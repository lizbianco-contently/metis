We confess that \nwhat is seen captivates our attention. It is easy to get lost in the \nlabyrinth of life's enigmas. The media constantly remind us of violence \nand vandalism, crimes and conflicts, and the spin we put on sin. \nSometimes, the things which are seen blur our vision of the unseen, but \nindefatigable movement of Your Spirit in people and circumstances. You \ncall us to experience the things which are unseen: Your eternal \npresence, the power of love, the healing of forgiveness, and Your \nguidance of leaders who open their minds to You.\n  In the on-going drama of secular life with all its sinister and \nalarming possibilities, also help us to see what You are doing to \nchange people and enable them to change government and our society. We \nare not asking for a simplistic, ``God is in His heaven and all is \nright with the world'' nostrum. Rather, we need an ``All is not right \nwith the world but lo I am with you always,'' cure for our deepest \nneeds.\n  Now it dawns on us with full force; only Your invisible power can \ntransform our intractable problems. We yield ourselves to be agents of \nYour visible impact on our Nation at this strategic time of history. In \nthe name of our Lord and Savior.

Mr. President, today the Senate will immediately resume \nconsideration of Senate Joint Resolution 1, the constitutional \namendment requiring a balanced budget. By unanimous consent, there will \nbe 60 minutes remaining for debate on Senator Wellstone's amendment No. \n3. Senators can expect a rollcall vote on or in relation to that \nWellstone amendment at approximately 3:15 today, if all debate time is \nused.\n  Following that vote, it is my hope we will be able to begin \nconsideration of the nomination of Bill Richardson to be the U.N. \nAmbassador. The Foreign Relations Committee will be reporting out that \nnomination this afternoon, and we will attempt to reach an agreement \nlimiting debate to approximately 20 minutes equally divided but we \nwill, of course, wait until the committee has officially reported it \nand then bring it up as shortly thereafter as possible.\n  Following that vote, we will continue debate on the balanced budget \namendment, and it is my understanding that Senator Reid will be \nprepared to offer his amendment relative to Social Security. The \namendment will be debated today and tomorrow, and we hope to set a vote \non or in relation to the Reid amendment for tomorrow, late in the \nafternoon, probably around 5:30 or so.

Under the previous order, there will now be 60 \nminutes for debate, to be equally divided in the usual form, prior to a \nvote on or in relation to the Wellstone amendment No. 3.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, yesterday I had a chance to speak for \nsome time about this amendment and then Senator Hatch and I had a very \nhonest exchange of views. Let me one more time just make clear to \ncolleagues what this amendment says. This amendment says that if we are \ngoing to make a commitment by way of a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget, then we go on record that the Federal outlays, as \nwe do this, should not be reduced in a manner that disproportionately \naffects outlays for education, nutrition, and health programs for poor \nchildren.\n  Yesterday my colleague, Senator Hatch, said I was asking for an \nexemption. There is no request for an exemption. This is just simply a \nrequest for fairness, and it just simply says let us not lock ourselves \ninto a very harsh set of priorities.\n  I also pointed out yesterday that in the last Congress, 93 percent of \nthe cuts in entitlement programs were entitlement programs that \naffected poor\n\n[[Page S1204]]\n\npeople in America, too many of them poor children. I also cited the \nCommittee on Economic Development, representing really some of the \nlargest corporations in America, saying that what we did last time, \nlast Congress, was really disproportionate and really not based on a \nstandard of fairness, because we cut a lot of programs that were \nimportant to the nutrition and health care and educational status of \nchildren.\n  I also quoted from the Concord Coalition, which has been a driving \nforce for our balancing the budget, taking the same position. I also \nquoted from an editorial yesterday in the Washington Post.\n  I think the most important thing that I did yesterday, though, Mr. \nPresident--and I would like to start this way today, and then develop \nthese points, and then listen very respectfully to my colleague from \nUtah, and then respond to some of what he has to say--was to try to \ntranslate this debate into human terms. Yesterday, my colleague from \nUtah said, and I appreciated it, ``You know, I don't agree with Senator \nWellstone but he is very sincere in his conviction.'' And I appreciated \nthat. That's a tribute from another Senator.\n  But this is really not about me. This is an amendment that I think is \nsubstantive, I think it is important, and I wish there would be 100 \nvotes for it. Because the fact of the matter is, all too often--and \nthat was the record last Congress and I think it has been the record of \ntoo many Congresses--when we come down to the nitty-gritty, to the \npoint where the rubber meets the road, we do deficit reduction based on \nthe path of least political resistance. And usually, all too often, it \nis not the special interests or heavy hitters or well connected or big \ngivers who are the ones that we target. And poor children have been, \nwith the exception of some Senators, the Chair is one of them--you have \nshown a tremendous commitment to what we can do at a neighborhood \nlevel, at a community level, as has the Senator from Missouri, by way \nof commitment to children.\n  But all too often, poor children in America are faceless and \nvoiceless in the U.S. Senate, and I just think that it is not at all \ninconsistent for Senators--even if they are for this amendment, to vote \nfor the constitutional amendment to balance the budget--to at least \nvote for this proposition. As a matter of fact, we are going to make it \nclear we are going to do it on a standard of fairness, and we are not \ngoing to disproportionately make cuts in programs that so vitally \naffect the nutritional and the educational and the health care status \nof children.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield just for a second?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to yield on the time of the Senator \nfrom Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized on his own \ntime.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the Senator indicated he would like 100 \npeople to vote for his amendment. I will make a suggestion to the \nSenator, and that is, amend your amendment to put it in a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution form, and I will work to get you 100 votes. But we \nare talking about amending the Constitution with language that really \nclutters up the Constitution with language that should not be in the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  If the Senator will do that, I will work to get him 100 votes in the \nSenate, because nobody wants to treat children or children's programs \ndisproportionately, but it is not constitutional language, and it \nshould not be in the Constitution. I have to be opposed to it, and I \nhope most of our fellow Senators will be opposed to it. Nobody is \nopposed to children.\n  I think that would be a reasonable way of resolving this. Put it in a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution, so it is not incorporated in the \nConstitution, as a sense-of-the-Congress resolution in the Congress. It \njust is not the way we should amend the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I cannot let that happen, but \nif the Senator will change and do that, I would be happy to go to a \nvote, and I would work my side of the floor to get 100 people to vote \nto say we do not want children's programs to be treated \ndisproportionately.\n  I hope the Senator will consider this kind offer. It is a sincere \noffer. I share his viewpoint with regard to children. I think virtually \neverybody in here does. The fact of the matter is, though, that all \nitems have to be on the budget if we are going to have any kind of a \nbalanced budget amendment work. I know the Senator is not going to vote \nfor a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution no matter what we \nput into it. Even if we accepted his amendment as part of the balanced \nbudget amendment, he would not vote for it.\n  That way, you are sending a message. That way, you would have your \ncolleagues voting with you. Otherwise, I think people who love and \nrevere the Constitution have to say this is not the way you amend the \nConstitution; we should not put this language into a constitutional \namendment because it is not constitutional.\n  Frankly, I suggest to my distinguished colleague, I would like to \nhelp him do that if he wants to do that. If he doesn't, then I have to \noppose this amendment, and I hope most Senators will oppose the \namendment, because this type of language should not go into the \nConstitution, because although it is meaningful language, it is not \nconstitutional language, and it will not guarantee the children's \nprograms are going to be treated any differently than anything else \nunder a balanced budget amendment.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the \nSenator from Utah. Actually, the language of this amendment is \nconstitutional. It is designed that way. If there is going to be a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget, I say to my good friend \nfrom Utah--and he has taken the leadership on this, he absolutely \nbelieves in it--if that is the direction we go in, then it is quite \nappropriate for me to have an amendment to this amendment to make sure \nthat we do not lock ourselves into some very harsh and distorted \npriorities.\n\n  I tried the route of a sense of the Senate last Congress, and \nactually I lost a couple of times on a sense of the Senate that we \nwould not take any action to create more hunger, malnutrition, and \npoverty among children. Finally, it was adopted on a voice vote. I wish \nthere had been a recorded vote. Then I think we went ahead and, in \nfact, passed some legislation or provisions of some legislation that is \ngoing to create that.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If I could just finish. I think this time around, \ngiven the track record of the last Congress and given the fact that the \ncitizens that I am trying to represent today--poor children--do not \nseem to have much of a presence here, quite frankly, I do not think a \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment does the job.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to yield on the Senator's time.\n  Mr. HATCH. On my time. I have to say that you did get a voice vote \nlast time, not a recorded vote. I am offering you a recorded vote. I \nhappen to believe sense-of-the-Senate resolutions mean a lot. But I \ncertainly could not accept this language as part of a balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment. If for no other reason, what does the term \n``disproportionate'' mean? Which programs have to be preferred above \nothers?\n  There are a thousand programs we are talking about here. I know, \nbecause I worked with most all of them when I was ranking member and \nchairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, on which the \nSenator from Minnesota now sits.\n  I will get you the votes. I will work my side to try to get 100 of \nthese people to vote for it. I happen to believe when Senators in this \nbody vote for a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, it means something, \nespecially if you get 100 percent. I cannot guarantee it, but I would \nwork to get 100 percent. It would be adopted, because I think virtually \neverybody here would like to have children's programs treated fairly.\n  The distinguished Senator makes a tremendous point. We treat seniors \nvery well. They get about 20 times the help from the Federal Government \nthat individual children get, and we are not\n\n[[Page S1205]]\n\ndoing what we should do for children in our country. There are a lot of \nchildren in poverty who are in serious straits who do not have the \nhealth care that they need.\n  On the other hand, the question is, how do we best solve that \nproblem? I do not think you single it out, because once you do that in \nthis amendment, there must be a thousand other things that do not want \nto be treated disproportionately.\n  Frankly, it just makes the amendment a nullity. I would be happy to \nwork for a significant up-or-down vote for the Senator, no motion to \ntable, up-or-down vote if he would make it a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution that does not go into this constitutional amendment.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair and, again, I thank my colleague. I \nappreciate his kind words. I know he is very sincere in the offer. \nAgain, what happened last time was we went ahead and adopted an \namendment saying we would not take any action to create more \nmalnutrition, hunger, or poverty among children, and then we went ahead \nand did budget cuts that, in fact, disproportionately affected poor \npeople in America, many of them children.\n  Mr. President, I really do view this amendment as a litmus test. I \nthink I do want to draw a line in the sand here. If Senators put \nchildren first, and Senators believe we ought to invest in the health \nand skills and intellect and character of our children, and Senators \nunderstand--and they do--that what happens before kindergarten is so \nimportant, then I do not know why in the world we cannot make a \ncommitment that when it comes to programs like Head Start and WIC and \nhealth care programs that affect poor children in America, that we at \nleast make a commitment that we not disproportionately cut those \nprograms.\n\n  As to which programs, listen, with a lot of what is in this \namendment, we are going to be writing implementing language, that is \nall going to be made specific. So I just do not think that critique \nreally does any damage to this amendment. I would like to speak, again, \nabout what is at stake.\n  Yesterday, I read from some examples, just some stories of some \nfamilies as we kind of reach out and talk to people around the country, \nnot just Minnesota. Marlene is a lot like many women. She went from her \nparent's home to her husband's. With the exception of a waitressing job \nin high school, she never had worked outside the home, and had no job \nskills. After 9 years of marriage, Marlene's husband left her with two \nchildren and pregnant with a third.\n  At 27, she found herself alone with no job skills or means of \nsupport. With the help of a neighbor, she enrolled in her local WIC \nProgram. ``I knew about nutrition, child care and how to take care of \nmyself. I just didn't have the money to. I knew that I needed to have a \nhealthy baby. I just did not know how to get it.''\n  WIC provided Marlene with vouchers to purchase the basics for a \nhealthy baby--milk, cheese, eggs, et cetera.\n\n       To this day, I believe that the food from WIC saved me and \n     my baby. Emotionally, I was so distraught and inept, I didn't \n     know if I was coming or going. Thankfully for WIC, for that \n     part of my life, I could just go on auto pilot. I knew that I \n     was taking care of my baby. I could go on with taking care of \n     the rest of the issues I was facing.\n\n  It has been 10 years since Marlene received help from WIC. Now she \nworks full time and supports her children. She says,\n\n       WIC was crucial for me. WIC was like a bridge to help me go \n     from being dependent on someone to learning how to take care \n     of myself and my kids. It's like they took care of me so I \n     could take care of the rest of my life. I cringe to think of \n     how things would have been without it.\n\n  Mr. President, Danielle is 8 years old. She looks closer to 6. Though \na spirited and cheerful little girl, Danielle struggles in life. She \nwas born at a low birth weight and has endured its effects. She will \nfor a long time.\n  As with many children born at a low birth weight, she has a limited \nimmunity system and she catches a lot of colds and flus. She misses a \nlot of school. Like many children born at low birth weight, it takes \nDanielle a bit longer to figure things out in school. Says her teacher, \n``I see her little brain trying to figure things out. She works hard \nand struggles. She's always a few steps behind us.'' While pregnant \nwith Danielle, her mother had no prenatal care or guidance.\n\n  Every 2 minutes a baby is born to a woman, a mother who had no \nprenatal care in our country. Her diet of chips, fast food, soda, and \ncandy did not change during the 8\\1/2\\ months of pregnancy. Danielle's \nmother did not participate in the Women, Infants, and Children Program.\n  At 5, Danielle's sister Alfrieda is healthy and active. While \npregnant with Alfrieda, her mother participated in WIC. She had a \nhealthy diet, checkups, and guidance. When she gave birth, she then \ngave birth to a fit and strong baby. She named her after the WIC nurse \nwho mentored her.\n  Says their mother:\n\n       I see how Danielle is not all there * * * how she's slow \n     and kind of sick. They tell me it is 'cause of how it was \n     when I was pregnant. I think they are right 'cause I really \n     see a difference with my baby, Alfrieda. You would not know \n     that Danielle is older.\n\n  In one family, in the case of two sisters, we see the impact and \ninfluence that WIC has. Danielle will always be a little behind, a \nlittle slow, and a little weak. Alfrieda will always be a bit smarter \nthan her older sister, a bit ahead of her older sister, and a bit \nstronger than her older sister. One small family and one big \ndifference.\n  Mr. President, I said this yesterday, the medical evidence is \nirrefutable and irreducible that the most important educational program \nfor our country is to make sure that every woman expecting a child has \na diet rich in vitamins, minerals, and protein; otherwise, that child \nat birth may not have the same chance as all of our children and \ngrandchildren have. And that is wrong. The goodness of our country is \nfor every child to have that chance.\n  Mr. President, we do not even fully fund the Women, Infants, and \nChildren Program right now, a program for women during pregnancy, a \nprogram for infants, and a program for small children who, by \ndefinition, do not have enough income to be able to purchase the food \nto have an adequate diet.\n  We know the WIC Program has made an enormous difference. It saves us \ndollars. It enables children to have a head start. It enables children \nto go on and do well in school. We know all of that. The only thing \nthis amendment says is, let us make a commitment if we are going to \nbalance this budget that in this constitutional amendment to balance \nthe budget we make a commitment we will not, as we move forward, \ndisproportionately cut programs that affect the nutritional status of \nchildren. That is what this amendment is all about.\n  It is not a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. I do want to draw a line \non this. I believe I should be able to get a strong vote for this. I do \nnot think it should be tabled. This is all about, as we go forward with \ndeficit reduction, who is going to decide and who is going to benefit, \nand who is going to be asked to sacrifice.\n  Are we going to decide, as we did last Congress, that we are going to \ndisproportionately cut programs that affect the quality of life for \nchildren, poor children in America? Who will decide to cut the \nnutrition programs and whose children will be hurt? They will not be \nour children, but they are all of God's children. I think we all agree \non that.\n  So I am really hopeful that I will get support for this amendment. \nThis is about values. We talk about values. This is about values. This \nis about Minnesota values.\n  If you asked people, are they in favor of a constitutional amendment \nto balance the budget, they say yes. I have been in disagreement. I \nwish we would separate the capital investment part of the budget from \non operating budget. I worry about it on political economic grounds. \nBut forgetting that, most people say yes. But if you ask people, are \nyou in favor of balancing the budget by making cuts in educational \nprograms or nutritional programs or health care programs that affect \nchildren, they say no. So I am hoping that this will not be tabled and \nthat Senators will vote for it.\n\n  Arel is only 14 years old but has the responsibility of someone much \nolder. He has two sisters. Even though they are at the right age and \neligible for\n\n[[Page S1206]]\n\nHead Start, they do not participate because the program near their home \nis full. I forget--I do not have the numbers right before me--but \nsomething like only 17 percent of the eligible 3-year-olds are \nparticipating and only 40 percent of the eligible 4-year-olds are \nparticipating. Really, we should work Head Start back, Mr. President, \nto age 1 and 2 as well.\n  By the way, it should be decentralized. This is a parent-\nparticipation program. It should happen at the local level. It should \nhappen at the neighborhood level. It can be done through nonprofits and \nit can be done through nongovernmental organizations. But when we know \nsomething works, when we know these kinds of programs give children a \nhead start, why can't we make a commitment that we will not \ndisproportionately cut these programs? Because if we do not make that \ncommitment, I really fear that is what is going to happen.\n  While we know how no Head Start will affect Arel's sisters, do we \nknow how it is going to affect Arel? Their mother leaves for work as a \nbus driver at 4 a.m. She is working. This means Arel is responsible for \nthe morning ritual with his sisters. After he gets them fed and \ndressed, Arel puts one sister on the handlebars of his bike and rides 5 \nmiles to drop her off at affordable day care. He returns home and gets \nhis second sister to drop her off. Since he cannot drop them off early, \nhe is late for school every day.\n  Because of tardiness, he failed his first-period class twice. Though \na talented athlete and a popular kid, Arel does not stay after school \nfor any activities. He would probably make the football team. He is \ninterested in track. He would love to be in a dance troupe. Instead, \nArel gets on his bike, rain or shine, to pick up his sisters one at a \ntime. I will not reveal to you what no Head Start means for his \nsisters. We know that. Unfortunately, so does their brother, a boy who \nhas no childhood.\n  Finally, Mr. President, Marcus is a shy and quiet first-grader who \nfinds himself in the principal's office for the third time in a week. I \ngave this example yesterday. According to his teacher, Marcus is either \noveragitated, annoying other students in class, or listless and \ndisinterested in the class at hand. Marcus does not usually know what \nis happening in class and he does not know yet his colors, numbers, or \nalphabet.\n  Though many of his class attends a Head Start program and learns the \ninitial steps toward understanding school and learning, Marcus does \nnot. He represents 1 of the 1.2 million children that, though eligible, \ncould not participate in Head Start when he was younger. The program \nnear his home was full. Not only were they full, but there was a year \nwaiting list when Marcus's grandmother tried to sign him up. Though \nthere was room at another program, it was too far for his grandmother \nto take him.\n  Marcus stayed alone sometimes at home while his grandmother worked. \nMarcus is conspicuously behind his classmates. While his classmates \nscurry around the teacher to be read to, he had not yet held a book or \never been read to. While his classmates--I am going to repeat this--\nwhile his classmates scurry around the teacher to be read to, he has \nnot yet held a book or ever been read to.\n  Marcus does not know how to write his name, nor can he recite the \nalphabet. In a phrase, Marcus is not part of the culture of the school. \nMarcus' teacher is concerned and anxious about him. He is far behind \nhis classmates, and she has little, if any, time to help him catch up. \nAs each week progresses, he falls further behind and more frustrated.\n  Already Marcus hates school and learning, counting the days until \nsummer vacation. He knows he is different. He knows he does not \nunderstand. But he also knows there is not much he can do about it.\n\n  Said his teacher: ``I just don't know what can be done for him. I \nknow that he needs a lot of one-on-one attention and love, but I just \ndon't have the time or the resources. Every day, I feel him slipping \nand, frankly, it breaks my heart. He is a good boy and a smart boy. I \nfeel as if he is being punished for what we did not do for him. I am \nworried that he will always hate school and suffer until he can leave. \nHe tries so hard, sometimes,'' says his teacher, ``I want to cry.''\n  Mr. President, I do not want Senators to make this amendment out to \nbe what it is not. There is an amendment on the floor. It is a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. This amendment says, as \na part of that constitutional amendment to balance the budget--if that \nis what we are going to do--we make a commitment that we are not going \nto disproportionately cut programs that affect the educational and \nnutrition and health care status of children. It is that simple.\n  This is about values. This is about fairness. I think we should make \nthat commitment. I think we should make that commitment.\n  Mr. President, we can no longer give speeches about children and no \nlonger have photo opportunities with children unless we are willing--\nunless we are willing--to invest in the health and skills and intellect \nand character of our children. Mr. President, that includes poor \nchildren, and that means we are part of local communities, but we are \npart of a national community. The U.S. Senate ought to go on record \nthat these are our priorities. These poor children are a part of our \npriorities. That is appropriate, and it is the right thing to do.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has 8 minutes, 25 \nseconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague from Minnesota. I \nbelieve he is devoted to children. But he is not alone. There are 99 \nothers in this body who are devoted to children. Frankly, children's \nprograms can compete very successfully with other programs, just like \nSocial Security can. To do a risky gimmick of putting this type of \nlanguage into the Constitution, like those who want to take Social \nSecurity out of the Constitution, the purview of the balanced budget, I \nthink would be highly risky and very, very dangerous.\n  I was talking with the junior Senator from Wyoming, Senator Enzi. He \nindicated to me, he said, you know, if you use the language ``not \ndisproportionate,'' which is what this language is, it can force \nproportionate reductions in all parts of the budget in order to comply \nwith this amendment, because this would be an amendment to this \namendment to the Constitution. The worst budgeting for kids could come \nfrom across-the-board budget cuts. That is how the courts could easily \ninterpret the amendment. Mr. President, for the information of every \nSenator, I have offered to give the Senator an up-or-down vote on a \ntrue sense-of-the-Senate resolution saying the same thing which he did \nnot get last year and which I will get him today, and I have offered to \ntry to get him 100 percent of the Senators to vote for this so we would \nbe on record as not wanting to have children's programs reduced \ndisproportionately.\n\n  However, to put this into the Constitution is the wrong thing to do. \nThis is not language that you would normally see in the Constitution. \nThe Wellstone amendment is not an appropriate amendment for inclusion \nin the Constitution. I want to point out to my colleagues that the \nWellstone amendment would place in the text of the Constitution itself \na statement of ``policy.'' I put policy in quotes because I think there \nis a lot of room to disagree with the Senator. It would put a statement \nof policy of the United States with regard to the budget priorities \ninto the Constitution, the first time in history to do that. Mr. \nPresident, I do not believe that it is appropriate to put what is \nessentially a sense-of-the-Senate resolution in the actual text of the \nConstitution. That is why I am suggesting that our colleagues vote \nagainst this amendment because that is not what should be done. I \nbelieve that such a policy statement would either be surplusage or \nproduce confusion and difficulties if it became part of the \nConstitution.\n  Now, the distinguished Senator from Minnesota sincerely said we are \nnot locking ourselves into a harsh set of priorities if we take this \namendment. I think you are. Let me paraphrase that better. He said if \nwe take the amendment as it is we are locking ourselves into a harsh \nset of priorities. I think it makes it more harsh if you put his\n\n[[Page S1207]]\n\namendment in because, first of all, nobody knows what the word \ndisproportionate means vis-a-vis constitutional language or \ninterpretation; and, second, you are referring one item in the budget \nfor one group of people in the Constitution over everybody else and \nthere are a lot of people in this country who would like to not be \ntreated in a disproportionate way. So we are not locking ourselves into \na harsh set of priorities by having this balanced budget amendment \npassed. We are simply saying everything in the unified budget must be \non the table. These programs for children are totally capable of \ncompeting with all other programs in the budget, as they should be. The \nfact is we have to have everything on the table because we are going to \nhit some very, very difficult times in the future and it will be \ndifficult to know what to do to balance this budget.\n  As we begin today's debate on Senate Joint Resolution 1, I do welcome \nthe discussion of this amendment, because after all what this debate \nand the balanced budget amendment are all about is the legacy we intend \nto pass on to our children and our children's children. Unfortunately, \nas it stands today, the legacy is not one of health and prosperity, as \nhas been the American tradition for the past two centuries; rather, the \nlegacy we are imposing on our children is one of fiscal servitude. The \ndebt, Mr. President, is a real threat to our children's future and to \ntheir well-being.\n  As I emphasized before, with our national debt standing at $5.3 \ntrillion and going to $5.4 trillion, every child born today is born \ninto this world trapped into a $20,000 debt. This new baby owes \n$20,000--$20,000. Think about that for a minute. In essence, what we \nare doing is handing every child who comes into the world an \nunsolicited and undeserved $20,000 liability. Unfortunately for our \nchildren, they are given nothing to show for that liability.\n  Every one of the 28 years represented by these unbalanced budgets, \nevery one of those 28 years these unbalanced budgets in this pile, in \nall but one of the last 36 years what we have done is finance our own \nexorbitant spending habits by mortgaging our children's future. In my \nview, this is taxation without representation in its purest form. What \nis worse, unlike you or me who may take out a loan to buy a house or a \ncar and begin to pay that loan off, not only do we not pay down any of \nour children's debt, we continue to refinance and finance again our \nchildren's mortgages, adding more and more debt to pay for our own \nprotracted fiscal irresponsibility.\n\n  Let me illustrate this point, Mr. President. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, by the time a child born today is 5 years \nold, the national debt would have risen to $6.8 trillion and his or her \nshare of that debt will have increased from $20,000 to $24,000. By age \n10, that debt will stand at $8.5 trillion, with that child shouldering \napproximately $29,000 of that burden. Just think about it. That is \nnearly a 50-percent increase of his or her debt burden in just 10 \nyears. At that rate, by the time a child graduated from college, he or \nshe would owe in the neighborhood of $50,000 as their share of the \nNation's debt. Now that, in my view, is no way to send a young man or \nyoung woman into the world to make a living. As sincere as my good \nfriend from Minnesota is, the fact is even if we accepted this \namendment he would not vote for the balanced budget amendment, which is \nthe only hope of helping these young children in the future, the only \nhope of stopping us from spending their future away and saddling them \nwith an irresponsible debt burden.\n  Now our former colleague, Senator Simon, who led the fight for a \nbalanced budget amendment on the Democrat side for many years, shared \nwith us the words of another of our former colleagues, Senator Cohen, \nnow Secretary of Defense, when he testified before the Judiciary \nCommittee a few weeks ago. Senator Cohen was at one time opposed to a \nbalanced budget amendment. And I remember those days because I have \nbeen responsible for bringing every balanced budget amendment to the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate from the first one right on up until today. \nAfter serving in Congress for 18 years, Senator Cohen had this to say, \nand he was against it initially, but after 18 years, this is what he \nsaid:\n\n       Today the ethic of self-sacrifice has been perversely \n     inverted. Parents and grandparents borrow from their heirs so \n     they might enjoy the comforts and pleasantries of the moment. \n     The practice of handing our children trillions of dollars of \n     debt with little more than a good luck wish can only be \n     considered an unconscionable and criminal act.\n\n  Secretary Cohen is exactly right.\n  As I have repeatedly said, the mortgaging of our children's future is \nnothing short of fiscal child abuse and it must end.\n  As a result of our failure to exhibit fiscal restraints in setting \nbudget priorities our children are faced with not only the looming \nburden of our enormous debt but also with massive annual interest \npayments required just to maintain the standard. This year we will pay \n$360 billion in gross interest to service our existing debt. That means \nwe will spend nearly $1 billion every day of this year just on interest \non the debt. Now to put this in perspective, if we take just the net \ninterest, meaning we ignore interest paid by the Government to the \nvarious trust funds and subtract interest income received by the \nGovernment, our annual interest payment would amount to $935 for every \nman, woman, and child in America. Just look at this. Interest on the \nnational debt, we could pay $340 to every man, woman, and child in Utah \nevery day. Think about it. That is in my own State, and the interest on \nthe debt is the fastest growing item in the Federal budget.\n  According to the CBO, interest on the debt will continue to rise \nsubstantially over the next 5 years, to $412 billion by the year 2002. \nMy gosh, that is more than the total Federal budget was 20 years ago. \nThat represents half of all projected individual income tax receipts \nfor that year and nearly two times all corporate income taxes. By 2007, \nthe interest on the debt is projected to reach a whopping $493 billion. \nThat is just the interest we owe. That is not the debt. That $493 \nbillion is just $50 billion shy of our entire discretionary budget for \nthe current fiscal year.\n  Mr. President, it is outrageous to me that we would consider \nsubjecting our children to a future where 50 percent of their hard-\nearned tax dollars would go to service the debt incurred by us, their \nparents. Just think what we could do for our children and our \nchildren's children if this money were available to be put to more \nproductive use.\n\n  We have talked a lot about the WIC Program, Women, Infants, and \nChildren Program. I know a lot about that. As a newly elected \nconservative, one of my counties said they did not want WIC funds \nbecause they did not want Federal Government strings. I thought WIC \nfunds were pretty important because they helped lactating mothers to be \nable to bring the best nutritional needs to their children, and even \nthough this was a county that really supported me I stood up and said I \nthink the WIC Program is a good program. Today, that county and the \nmothers that are poor benefit from that WIC Program. It is a highly \neffective program and works to improve the health of the mothers and \nthe newborn children, and also serves to reduce our Nation's overall \nhealth care costs. I have long supported the WIC Program, as has just \nabout every Senator. We are constantly struggling to come up with the \nmoney to fully fund participation in the WIC Program. With the $360 \nbillion we spend on interest on the debt this year not only could we \nfully fund participation in the WIC Program, we could afford to pay \nrecipients nearly 100 times what they received last year.\n  I could go through every program affecting children in our country \ntoday and we can talk about not allowing them to be disproportionately \nreduced. The best way to not allow children's programs to go down the \ndrain is to pass the balanced budget amendment and put some fiscal \nresponsibility into the Constitution, so we have to live within our \nmeans and we do not barter away our children's future, we do not \nmortgage it away, so we have the money to be able to help children. \nThese gimmicks that some on the other side want to put into the \nConstitution are dangerous. In the end, they will wind up hurting \nchildren and not balancing the budget. The best thing we can do for our \ncountry is to get that budget balanced and keep it balanced and start \nparing down the national debt, as well. If we do not start\n\n[[Page S1208]]\n\ndoing that, we are going to pay the price and it will be a heavy, heavy \nprice.\n  Mr. President, I am very concerned about this because if we are going \nto have a balanced budget amendment everybody in the world knows and \neverybody in Congress knows this is it. This is the last chance. This \nhas been developed over 20 years. It is a balanced budget amendment \nthat has been developed by Democrats and Republicans. I do not believe \nany single person can say they wrote it. It is an attempt by all of us \nto get together and do what is right. It is supported by an \noverwhelming majority in this body. Sixty-eight people have guaranteed \nto their constituents they will vote for it. We need 67. We should have \none more than 67 if everybody lives up to their word. Frankly, if we \npass this balanced budget amendment, it has a very excellent chance of \ngoing through the House.\n  Head Start is another program we have heard a lot about. I strongly \nsupport the Head Start Program. As chairman and ranking member of the \nLabor Committee, I was deeply involved in fighting to provide increased \nauthorizations for Head Start, and I am proud of the fact that since I \nfirst came to the Senate, the number of children served by federally \nfunded Head Start programs has more than doubled. And yet, given the \nbudget constraints we face, we are still working toward the goal of \nfully funding the Head Start Program--a result I believe every one of \nmy colleagues favors.\n  If we could recoup just a small portion of the money we will pay in \ninterest on the debt this year, we could fully fund Head Start in a \nheartbeat. Not only could we fully fund the entire Head Start Program, \nincluding the new Head Start Program for infants and toddlers that was \nestablished in 1994, with this year's interest expenditures we could \nincrease Head Start funding for every one of those children by more \nthan 10 times what we currently spend.\n  There are plenty of other important programs we could improve if we \nwere to free up the resources currently dedicated to servicing the \ndebt. In fact, with the money we will spend in gross interest on the \ndebt just this year, we could cover the costs of all food and nutrition \nassistance programs, including food stamps, for the last 14 years--\n$346.9 billion. This same interest payment would cover the costs of all \npayments for WIC and other supplemental feeding programs, child \nnutrition and milk programs, student assistance, and low income home \nenergy assistance for the last 20 years--$348.2 billion.\n  Even in the current fiscal year, as this chart shows, with the money \nwe will spend on gross interest payments, we could afford to double \nprojected spending for elementary, secondary, and vocational education, \nhigher education, research and general education aids, training and \nemployment, housing assistance, food and nutrition assistance, social \nservices, unemployment compensation, all health care services, and \npollution control and abatement--and still increase Medicare spending \nby 50 percent.\n  Now obviously we cannot simply pay off $5.3 trillion of debt and \nrecoup our $360 billion in annual gross interest payments overnight. \nBut, according to CBO, moving toward a balanced budget in 2002 would \nreduce projected net interest costs by some $46 billion and improve \neconomic performance enough to produce a total fiscal dividend of $77 \nbillion over the next 5 years. This represents real savings of nearly \ntwice the amount we spent on all food and nutrition assistance programs \nlast year, and is nearly 10 times all earned income tax credit payments \nfor the past 10 years combined. This is real savings we can bring about \nto benefit our children now just by balancing the budget.\n  But, if we continue to deficit spend, as we have in all but 8 of the \nlast 66 years, we will only continue to compound our existing debt, \nincreasing the interest payments necessary to service that debt and \nfurther exacerbating the tax burdens our children will face in future \nyears. According to OMB and CBO, such tax burdens may equate to a \nlifetime net tax rate of about 82 percent for future generations in \norder to finance the cost of government at all levels. The 82 percent \nfigure for our children stands in stark contrast to the 29 percent net \ntax rate for the generation of Americans born in the 1920's and the \n34.4 percent net tax rate for the generation born in the 1960's.\n  But the mammoth costs of financing both the Government and our \nenormous national debt are not the only burdens we are creating for our \nchildren by not balancing the budget. We should also recognize the \nsignificant economic benefits that our children stand to inherit from \nrecurring balanced budgets, but which we are withholding from future \ngenerations by failing to exercise fiscal restraint today.\n  As CBO reaffirms in its January report, balancing the budget in 2002 \nand subsequent years will lead to increased real economic growth, \nreduced interest rates, higher corporate profits, and increased \nrevenues to the Federal Government. As a result, the Joint Economic \nCommittee has estimated that a typical middle class family could easily \nsave $1,500 each year; $1,500 every single year, Mr. President. That is \nlike a built-in $500-per-child tax credit for a family of five--at no \ncost to the Government--just for passing the balanced budget amendment. \nI know a lot of families in Utah that could use an extra $1,500 each \nyear to pay for food or clothing for their children, to pay for college \ntuition, to pay down credit card debts, or even to take a vacation and \nspend time with their kids.\n  Even a college student could save an estimated $120 each year on a \n$10,000 student loan if we were to pass the balanced budget amendment. \nAnd it is not the Government that must pay for that savings. It is \nsimply the real benefit generated by the economy's reaction to long-\nterm balanced budgets.\n  Mr. President, it is time for us to face reality. The single largest \nthreat to our children's well-being is not that the Republicans and \nDemocrats will be forced to live within their means when funding any \ngiven program. The real threat is that we will continue down the path \nof the last 66 years and mortgage our children's future earnings to pay \nfor what we consider to be spending priorities today. If we do, our \nchildren will be left with no choice but to cut the very programs my \ncolleague is talking about in ways that are unthinkable today, or \ndrastically increase taxes on every American family to pay for the \ncontinued existence of those important programs. The balanced budget \namendment is the only real assurance we have that our children will not \nbe forced to make those choices.\n  Now Mr. President, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out \nthe solution to this problem. In fact, Grant Anderson, a 13-year-old \nyoung man in my home State of Utah, took the time to write a letter to \nme outlining how it can be done. Let me share with my colleagues what \nhe had to say:\n\n       Dear Orrin Hatch, I think we have a huge problem with the \n     national budget. I have the easiest way to fix it. Do you \n     want to hear it? Okay. Stop buying things if you don't have \n     the money.\n\n  That about says it all, Mr. President. It's just that simple. Yet, \nwithout a balanced budget amendment, there appears to be no real end in \nsight to Congress' abdication of its responsibility to people like \nGrant Anderson and to future generations.\n  The fact is that after 4 years of declining deficits we have not \nreduced our staggering $5.3 trillion debt one penny. We have only \nslowed the growth in the national debt. More importantly, as my \nRepublican colleagues and I predicted would happen during the debate on \nthe President's 1993 budget package, CBO now predicts that annual \ndeficits will resume their upward climb beginning this year--from an \nannual deficit of $124 billion in 1997, to $188 billion in 2002, and \nreaching a near-record $278 billion in 2007. Even OMB's estimates from \nthe President's newly proposed budget, which predict lower deficit \ntotals than CBO, project that gross Federal debt will top $6.6 \ntrillion, exceeding 66 percent of our gross domestic product, by 2002.\n  Now I know that there are those who will say that we can solve this \nproblem without the constraints of a balanced budget amendment--that \nCongress and the President are committed to balancing the budget and to \nputting an end to the era of deficit spending. While I can only pray \nthat they are right, our history of deficit reduction efforts in \nCongress should give the American people reason to be skeptical.\n\n[[Page S1209]]\n\n  Since 1978 we have adopted no fewer than five statutory regimes which \npromised to bring about balanced budgets. Every single one of them has \nfailed. As this chart shows, time after time statutory fixes have been \nmet with increased deficits. In fact, nearly 85 percent of our current \nnational debt has accumulated while Congress has operated within \nstatutory budget frameworks designed to ensure balanced budgets. Now, \nwe are told, things are different. But will they really be all that \ndifferent without the discipline of a constitutional amendment?\n  A quick look at the President's budget shows that under his plan, we \nwill continue to have deficits that are higher than last year's budget \ndeficit until the year 2000. Only in the last 2 years of this budget do \nwe see the dramatic cuts necessary to bring us into balance. That's \nright, Mr. President, a full 75 percent of the deficit reduction \nplanned in President Clinton's recent budget submission comes in the 2 \nyears after President Clinton leaves office. This is reminiscent to me \nof the 1985 Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law, wherein we committed ourselves \nto balancing the budget by 1991, only to see the law slowly amended, \ncircumvented, and the requirement for a balanced budget finally \neliminated just 1 year prior to the year in which we were to achieve \nbalance under the original law.\n  While I commend the President for his avowed commitment to balancing \nthe budget and appreciate the dedication expressed by leaders of both \npolitical parties to reaching a balanced budget, I seriously doubt \nwhether, without the weight of a constitutional requirement to balance \nthe budget, we will achieve balance by 2002. Even if we did--and I \nintend to work to that end--there is nothing to prevent future \nCongresses from yielding to the political pressures that would lead to \nrenewed deficit spending. We need a constitutional amendment if we are \ntruly committed to solving this problem.\n  Mr. President, passing the balanced budget amendment, free of \nexemptions and loopholes that can be exploited by those who might not \nbe fully dedicated to balancing the budget, is the most important thing \nwe can do in this Congress to protect our children and the future \ngenerations that will follow. I urge my colleagues to join me in this \neffort by supporting the balanced budget amendment. If that happens, we \nwill protect children like never before. To me that is worth it all. \nAnd in the end it will accomplish what the distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota would like to do. But if we put amendments like this in \neverybody and their dog will be in here with some sort of a program \nthey want to protect because they think it is the most important \nprogram in the world. No. Let us put everything in the budget on \nbudget. Let us have everything subject to the balanced budget amendment \nand let us have them compete for the available funds as it should be. \nThen let us make the right priority choices. And I guarantee my friend \nfrom Minnesota that Orrin Hatch will be there with him trying to help \nthe children of this country so that they don't suffer a \ndisproportionate reduction in their programs. And I do not think they \nwill as long as both he and I are here, and others as well.\n\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, when Senators vote on this they should \nnot confuse two different issues. There is not anybody on the floor of \nthe Senate that I know of who is opposed to balancing the budget. There \nare Senators who oppose this amendment.\n  My colleague keeps talking about balancing the budget or passing the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget is the best thing that \nwe can do for our children. My amendment speaks to the concerns and \ncircumstances of the lives of poor children. Close to one out of every \nfour children in America is poor. One out of every two children of \ncolor is poor. Every 30 seconds a child is born into poverty in our \ncountry. Every 2 minutes a child is born to a mother who has had no \nprenatal care. Every 12 or 13 seconds a child drops out of school, many \nof them children from poor families. And there is a higher correlation \nbetween high school dropout and winding up in prison than there is \nbetween cigarette smoking and lung cancer.\n  Mr. President, all too many of our children are rushing into the arms \nof the police and not into parents' arms, or teachers' arms.\n  My colleague used the word ``gimmick.'' This is no gimmick. This is a \nvery serious amendment because for these children they don't have any \nfuture. How can you argue that a child who is born severely underweight \nand damaged and who can't do well in school is going to benefit by \ndeficit reduction and balancing the budget 7 years from now? What about \nthat child right now? How can you argue that the 50 percent of children \nor the 60 percent of children who could be given a head start but come \nto school without a head start not ready to learn are going to do well, \nif we do not make a commitment that we are going to invest in them? \nBalancing the budget 7 years from now does not help those children \nright now.\n  There are 10 million children who have no health care coverage, most \nof them from working poor families, many of them with ear infections \nwho have lost hearing; too many. Many can't read well because they \nshould have had an eye examination. They can't afford it. Many of them \nshould have dental care, and they come to school with an infected tooth \nand abscess. They can't learn well. It is difficult for children who \nare in pain and discomfort to learn well.\n  If we do not make a commitment that in balancing this budget we will \nnot balance this budget on the backs of those children and we proceed \nto do what we did in the last Congress, which is disproportionately cut \nprograms that affect poor people and poor children in America, they \ndon't have any future. What good does it do those children if we are \ngoing to balance the budget 6 years from now if we are going to savage \nthem right now?\n  This is all about values. And if my colleague means or is sincere--\nand he always is. I guess it is just an honest difference that we \nhave--that surely we are not going to make these cuts, that is what we \nhave done in the past because these children don't hire the lobbyists. \nThey don't march on Washington every day, and one more time they are \nnot the big givers. Maybe there is a connection with all that we are \nreading about money and politics.\n  Mr. President, I ask all of my colleagues whether you are against \nthis constitutional amendment to balance the budget or whether you are \nfor it to vote for this amendment. It is all about fairness. We ought \nto go on record. We ought to make it clear that in our effort to \nbalance the budget with a constitutional amendment--or the way I prefer \nto do it, not a constitutional amendment--that we go on record that we \nwill not do what we have all too often done in the past--unfortunately, \nthe evidence is clear--that we will not disproportionately cut the \nprograms that benefit and affect the health and the nutrition and \neducation of children.\n  What is the definition? Just pick out the percentage of low-income \nprograms that are part of the entitlement programs. Pick out the low-\nincome programs for children that are part of the discretionary \nspending. Pick out the percentage, and in our overall cuts, don't cut \nthem any higher. It is simple. It does not take a rocket scientist to \nfigure it out. Let us not weave and dodge on this question.\n  I hope that I can get a strong vote. It is a difficult debate because \nthe Senator from Utah is one of the Senators whom I like the most and \nwhom I respect the most. It is an honest disagreement.\n  But I hope Senators will vote for this. It is the right thing to do. \nThis does not say we are not going to balance the budget. This does not \nsay we should not do what the Senator from Utah believes we should do. \nIt just says that if we are going to lock ourselves into a \nconstitutional amendment, or, if we do not do that, we are still going \nto make the commitment to balance the budget, that we will not balance \nthe budget on the backs of poor children; that we will invest in the \nskills, health, and character of children in America, including poor \nchildren. These are all God's children. I am telling you something, and \nI could argue this for 24 straight hours, the history\n\n[[Page S1210]]\n\nof the way we have done deficit reduction is that they come out on the \nshort end of the stick.\n  This amendment I think is the right thing to do. It puts us on record \nand it makes it clear that we are going to balance this budget based \nupon the Minnesota standard of fairness.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the rest of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will not take long.\n  I know my colleague is sincere. I know he is a very good person and \nthat he feels very deeply about children. And I have a great regard for \nhim. He knows that. Children have the love in this town. One of the \nmost effective lobbyists in this town is Marian Wright Edelman. I know. \nShe and I worked hard to get the child care bill through. That has \nhelped millions of children all over this country.\n\n  I do not take a second seat to anybody with regard to taking care of \nchildren. In fact, Elaine and I have six. We are expecting our 16th and \n17th grandchild within 2 weeks. I want them to have a future. I want \nthem to have the care. I want there to be some money to help them. I \nwant our country to be solvent. I do not want their futures bartered \naway and mortgaged away. The reason child care programs are being cut \nevery year is because we are spending it all on interest on the \nnational debt.\n\n  The only thing that will give children protection in the future is if \nwe pass this balanced budget amendment. We have here 28 years of \nunbalanced budgets. I do not know about others, but this pile is very \nsignificant to me. Every year we have people who are of the more \nliberal persuasion saying we should spend more, we should just get the \nwill to balance the budget but we should spend more. They are \ninconsistent.\n  Let me just tell you something. I think out of the mouths of children \ncomes the greatest truths sometimes. This is a letter I received from \nGrant Anderson, a young boy. Here is what he said, August 5, 1996:\n\n       Dear Orrin Hatch. I think we have a huge problem with the \n     national budget. I have the easiest way to fix it. Do you \n     want to hear it? OK--\n\n  With an exclamation mark. And then he writes in big print the \nletters. He said:\n\n       Stop buying things if you don't have money--\n\n  And a bigger exclamation mark. And then he said:\n\n       Thanks for your time. Grant S. Anderson.\n       P.S. My mom and dad voted for you.\n\n  A particularly good letter, I thought.\n  But the fact of the matter is Grant is right on the money. My friend \nGrant Anderson really calls it the way it should be. If we are going to \nstop spending money we do not have, we have got to get rid of all these \nyears of unbalanced budgets. And since we have proven that we are not \ngoing to get rid of them without a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution, then, by gosh, I suggest we pass the balanced budget \namendment so by the year 2002 we have the true budget that will be \nbalanced so kids like Grant Anderson and all the kids my colleague is \nfighting for and I am fighting for will have a future.\n  Now, to me out of the mouths of young people sometimes comes the \ngreatest truth.\n\n       Dear Orrin Hatch. I think we have a huge problem with the \n     national budget. I have the easiest way to fix it. Do you \n     want to hear it? OK. Stop buying things if you don't have \n     money. Thanks for your time. Grant S. Anderson.\n\n  I am grateful to Grant. I am grateful that he took the time to write \nto me, and there are thousands of others who are writing to us who want \nus to try to put some fiscal sanity into the system. We have tried five \ndifferent balance-the-budget methodologies and not one of them has \nworked. The distinguished Senator said his amendment is not a gimmick, \nbut his amendment reads:\n\n       It is the policy of the United States that in achieving a \n     balanced budget amendment--\n\n  ``It is the policy of the United States.'' He is writing policy into \nthe Constitution--\n\n       Federal outlays must not be reduced in a manner that \n     disproportionately affects outlays for education, nutrition \n     and health programs for poor children.\n\n  I agree with him; it is not a gimmick. It is a risky gimmick. If you \nstart putting language into the Constitution that the distinguished \nSenator thinks can be easily interpreted, he does not know much about \nthe Supreme Court if he takes that attitude. I have to tell you, we are \nmaking a great mistake. So I hope our colleagues will realize it is \nimportant to keep this amendment intact. It is the only amendment that \nhas a chance of passing. It is a bipartisan amendment, and I hope we \nwill support it here today.\n  I move to table the Senator's amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send a resolution to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has sent a \nresolution to the desk which will require a unanimous-consent request \nat this time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I understand that. I want to make a comment or two about \nit, and then I will make that unanimous-consent request.\n  Mr. President, this resolution relates to a very urgent problem on \nmilk pricing in the country, but especially in Pennsylvania, where \nSenator Santorum and I have been working with our farmers to try to \nfind something to grant some immediate relief. This is a problem which \nexists nationwide, and we believe that we have found a way to deal with \nthis issue in the short run as it relates to the price of cheese, which \nis an ingredient in establishing the price of milk.\n  Yesterday, Secretary of Agriculture Glickman accompanied me to \nnortheastern Pennsylvania. We have found that the Secretary has the \nauthority unilaterally to change the price of milk if there is a \ndifferent price for cheese other than that which has been established \nby the National Cheese Exchange in Wisconsin.\n  This is a matter of some urgency, Mr. President, which is why I have \ndiscussed with the leadership the prospect of offering this resolution \nat this time.\n\n[[Page S1211]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this resolution be taken up on a 20-\nminute time limit, 10 minutes equally divided, with the yeas and nays \non the vote. I submit this resolution on behalf of myself, Mr. \nSantorum, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Jeffords, and Mr. Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, on advice, I must object to the Senator's \nrequest----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. FORD. But I want to say why. We are attempting to clear it, and \nit is not something that I am objecting to lightly. So we are in the \nprocess of trying to get it cleared, and as soon as we do, we will lift \nthe objection. So I must object at this time, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The resolution will go over----\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator withhold, please?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please come to order. All of \nthe conversations should stop. The Senator from West Virginia has been \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I realize that the objection has already \nbeen heard. May I say, I have no objection to the resolution. But I \nhope the Senator, when he propounds his request again, will not include \nthat provision in the request that states that there be a rollcall \nvote. That has to be done by a show of hands. I do not want us to get \nstarted with having rollcall votes by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nWest Virginia for that suggestion. I shall incorporate that in my next \nunanimous-consent request.\n  I understand the reasoning of my colleague from Kentucky. We had \ncirculated this yesterday, so I thought there had been ample time for \nclearance. It is my understanding that this is an issue which will not \ncause regional friction, as do so many issues on milk pricing. It is an \nadjustment on price which will benefit all regions. So it would not \ncustomarily draw the objection. I understand it has not been cleared.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be printed in the \nCongressional Record. And, the objection having been heard, I will \nreinstate the resolution at a time when it has been cleared.\n  (The text of S. Res. 52 is printed in today's Record under \n``Submission of Concurrent and Senate Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator asking that all action be \nvitiated on this resolution?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am not asking that all action be vitiated to the \nextent that the resolution has been sent to the desk, and that the \ndiscussion has been held. I understand that I may not proceed now \nexcept with unanimous consent, and unanimous consent has not been \ngranted. I understand why unanimous consent has not been granted. So I \ndo not think I can do anything further, but I do not want to withdraw \nanything either.\n  Mr. President, the fact is, I have submitted the resolution for the \nRecord. I do not know that I need to do anything else since an \nobjection was heard and I cannot proceed unless there is unanimous \nconsent, which there is not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is advised this \nresolution will go to that section of the calendar that is entitled, \n``Resolutions and Motions Over, Under the Rule.''\n  Mr. SPECTER. A point of information, Mr. President. Does that in any \nway prejudice my bringing it back to the floor when it has been cleared \non both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would require a unanimous-consent request \nagain at that time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I understand that. It requires a unanimous-consent now. \nIt would require a unanimous-consent at that time. I just do not want \nto prejudice my position on bringing it back up. Whatever is the \nappropriate procedural call, I am prepared to accept the ruling of the \nChair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is understood.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/11/senate-section/article/S1210-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1211-S1212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  The Senate continued with consideration of the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, what is the order of business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is Senate Joint \nResolution 1.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nbalanced budget amendment, the constitutional amendment. I think it is \nproperly named Senate Joint Resolution 1 because it is one of the most \nimportant acts that this Congress, I think anyway, will achieve.\n  My home State of Montana has had that balanced budget amendment law \nsince its inception when it joined the Union in 1889. So, living with \nfiscal prudence has always been our way of life. Even though there are \ntimes when we strayed from this, and had our ups and downs, we always \nproduced a little bit of a surplus, which we had this last time, and \nthe State returned it to the taxpayers. The Federal Government could \nlearn a lot just looking at the example of the States.\n  For example, according to the Congressional Budget Office, if we do \nnot pass this legislation and we stay with the present trend, it has \nbeen pointed out that the deficit will be over 2\\1/2\\ times in 10 years \nwhat it was in the year of 1996. Using CBO's numbers, our national debt \nwill rise from $3.7 trillion to over $6 trillion by the year 2007. \nEvery day that goes by without a balanced budget is another step closer \nto financial calamity for the United States. Around 40 cents of every \ntax dollar you send to us goes to pay the interest on the national \ndebt, $344 billion last year alone. That is as much as we have spent on \nlaw enforcement, education, environment, energy, transportation, \nagriculture, and technology combined.\n  I guess in order to understand what we are doing here you have to \nboil it down to where the average American family can make sense of it \nand how it relates to them. Over the life of a 30-year mortgage on a \n$75,000 home, it means a savings of around $71,000; savings of $1,000 \non the life of a 4-year loan on an automobile worth $15,000; savings of \n$1,800 over the life of a 10-year student loan at $11,000. By the way, \nI am experiencing some of that, and that means quite a lot to this \nSenator. The grand total of all the savings of these loans will be \naround $74,000 over the lifetime. I think that is something that we \ncannot just overlook or ignore as a consumer.\n  A small State like Montana--we are small businesses, ranching, \nfarming--uses these savings to expand our businesses, thus expanding \nthe economy of Montana.\n  That is one thing that we have to do in this country. We have to \ncontinually expand the economy. If you want to do something for people \nto ensure jobs, job opportunity, and work opportunity, we cannot stand \nat the same trough and at the same side of the pie. We have to grow the \npie.\n  In the legislative branch we have to enact this amendment because it \nseems that we can't rely on the current administration to furnish or \nenact policies that will provide for further deficit-reduction \nmeasures. Sometimes we can't even do it ourselves. The President vetoed \nthe Balanced Budget Act of 1995, which would have led to a balanced \nbudget by the year 2002. All told, this year the omnibus appropriations \nfor fiscal year 1997 added back $70 billion of Federal spending because \nof pressure from the White House.\n  Finally, the President has publicly stated that he would like to see \nthe legislation fail. In fact, the President, Secretary Rubin, and \nMembers of this Chamber have been working overtime to ensure that this \namendment does not pass.\n  What is wrong with passing an amendment, sending it to the States, \nand letting the States decide, getting closer to the people? \nUnfortunately, some of these individuals have been trying to undermine \nthe balanced budget constitutional amendment by suggesting that if we \ninclude Social Security in the equation, this would\n\n[[Page S1212]]\n\ncause future harm to the Social Security trust fund and thereby the \nnext generation of seniors. I would like to state flatly that that is \nexactly the opposite of what we are trying to do here. We are trying to \nsave and strengthen Social Security.\n  The President has even admitted that no one could balance the budget \nwithout the Social Security funds. The President said that.\n  This is a false argument. It is a risky gimmick that causes undue \nanxiety among our people.\n  So my fellow Members believe that Social Security will have to fight \nit out with other programs if tied to the amendment. This is not the \ncase. Money has already been allocated, and it will remain in these \ntrust funds. We should not be needlessly scaring people into believing \nthat their futures are uncertain. We would never cut Social Security to \nbalance this budget.\n  So it is a risky business whenever you start talking about setting \nthe Social Security trust fund off to the side and not being included \nin the budget process.\n  If you do not include Social Security in this amendment, our deficit \nwill immediately increase by an additional $465 billion during fiscal \nyear 1998 through the year 2002, and by another $602 billion during \nfiscal year 2003 to the year 2007, for a total of $l.067 trillion over \na 10-year period. Excluding this provision will actually make it more \ndifficult to choose which programs will stay and which will be cut \naway.\n  So why would anybody suggest anything different? As we know, the \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment will force lawmakers to make \nsome tough decisions. That is the way it should be. We have always \nlived in a life of priorities.\n  If we are to save our Nation from future heavy debt and uncertainty, \nhopefully we will follow the course of what the States do every day. We \nwould hope at least to have a surplus.\n  I come out of county government. We maintain surpluses in every line \nitem. We always maintain reserves. There is a reason for that because \nof the tax collection. It makes you maintain reserves. It is prudent to \ndo it.\n  Nobody knows what the future holds. The American people look to us to \nprovide those funds in the event of emergencies. You cannot do it \nwithout maintaining reserves.\n  So I maintain that to keep safe and secure the future programs like \nthose which are meant to protect our senior citizens and our children, \nthat we have to pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution of \nthe United States. It just makes good sense.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would appreciate it if the desk would \ninform me when I have spoken for 7 minutes.\n  Mr. President, when I speak with Rhode Islanders I often find it very \ndifficult to put the budget problems in perspective. Few, if any, of us \nunderstand what a billion dollars is, never mind what $1 trillion is \nBut the current national debt of the United States is $5.3 trillion--\nnot billion dollars, not million dollars--trillion dollars.\n  So we try to figure how can we put this in some form of perspective \nand what the national debt is. This is what we owe our children. And \nthe national debt amounts to $20,000 for every American in our Nation, \nor a bill for a family of four of $80,000.\n  Let me give you some idea of what $5 trillion is: $5 trillion is \nenough money to purchase every automobile ever sold in the United \nStates and have enough money left over to purchase every airline ticket \never sold for travel in the United States. You buy all the automobiles \nthat have been made in the history of the United States, and then you \nhave money left over to buy every airline ticket that has ever been \nsold in the United States, and then you will have used up $5.3 \ntrillion; $5 trillion is equal to the asset value of all the U.S. \nstocks held by Americans. If we went out to spend a dollar every second \nof every day to reach the goal of $5 trillion, it would take 158,000 \nyears at a dollar per second.\n\n  When the Federal Government spends more than it collects in tax \nrevenue, it borrows the difference. This debt, obviously, is a \nliability for future generations. My children, your children, these \nyoung people here, the young people all over America are going to have \nto pick up the bill for what we spent that we didn't collect taxes for. \nAnd those who support a balanced budget constitutional amendment such \nas we have before us believe the Federal Government should do just like \na family does. All families in America have to pay their bills. If they \ndon't, they go into bankruptcy and go through a lot of extreme \ndifficulties. But the Federal Government does not pay its bills. It \ndoes not collect enough in taxes to pay what we are buying.\n  The Governor of California, Earl Warren, once said--I never forgot \nit--the people of California can have anything they want, anything they \nwant, as long as they are willing to pay for it. And that should be the \nguiding rule for us in the United States.\n  People might say, ``Well, sometimes you have to borrow some money.'' \nSure you do. Thomas Jefferson borrowed $15 million to finance the \nLouisiana Purchase. And our Nation, obviously, had to borrow money \nduring World War II in the 1940's to pay for that war. No one would \nargue with those decisions. But when we borrow money, we ought to pay \nit back and pay it back promptly. That isn't the way the Federal \nGovernment works today.\n  Mr. President, what this balanced budget amendment is attempting to \ndo is to say if we want something in the United States, then we ought \nto levy taxes to pay for it. And if we are not willing to levy the \ntaxes to pay for it, whether it is better parks or better education or \nbetter health care or better protective services or a stronger FBI or \nbetter facilities for our Ambassadors and officials of our Foreign \nService serving abroad, all of those things, maybe they are fine. And \nif they are and if the decision is that they are fine, then let us levy \nthe taxes to pay for it. That is what this amendment is all about.\n  Mr. President, I hope that this first step on a long road to \nbalancing our budget will be undertaken. This, of course, does not say \nwe are going to pay off that $5.3 trillion debt. But we will get \nstarted on it. First, we will not be adding to it every day of every \nyear. Certainly, for the last 40 years we have spent more than we have \ntaken in. That is why we have the $5.3 trillion deficit.\n  Mr. President, I think that this balanced budget amendment is a good \nstart. I hope it will be approved.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS.

The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, today the Senate fulfills its constitutional duty on \nthe nomination of Congressman Bill Richardson to serve as our country's \nPermanent Representative to the United Nations.\n  The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations met for almost 3 hours on \nWednesday, January 29, to consider the Richardson nomination. During \nthat hearing, the committee also heard from a bipartisan group of six \nMembers of Congress who introduced Congressman Richardson.\n  That group included the distinguished chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, Senator Domenici, the junior Senator from New Mexico, \nSenator Bingaman, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Hatch, the chairman and ranking member of the House \nInternational Relations Committee, Congressmen Gilman and Hamilton, and \nCongressman Robert Menendez of New Jersey.\n  During the hearing, Congressman Richardson was questioned extensively \nby many members of the committee on a broad range of issues related to \nthe United Nations, and other foreign policy matters.\n  At the conclusion of the hearing, it was agreed to keep the record \nopen until close of business on January 31, so that Senators could \nsubmit written questions to the nominee. Five Senators submitted 135 \nsuch questions, all of which were answered in writing by Congressman \nRichardson. The administration also complied with a document request \nconcerning State Department involvement with negotiations to free \ncertain hostages in Southern Sudan.\n  Earlier today, after members had spent several days examining the \nwritten replies, the committee met in a business meeting to consider \nthis nomination. By a vote of 17 to 0, the Committee on Foreign \nRelations reported favorably the Richardson nomination.\n  Mr. President, Congressman Richardson has been nominated to one of \nthe Nation's top foreign policy posts. He has been nominated at a \ncritical time in the history of the United Nations. I believe that he \ncould very well make history as the U.S. Permanent Representative who \nrolled up his sleeves and worked with Congress to bring true and \nlasting reform to that dysfunctional institution.\n  We have heard a lot of rhetoric from the administration and the \ninternational community about the need to pay arrearages to the United \nNations. U.S. contributions to the United Nations have been withheld by \nCongress for a valid reason: to cause the U.N. bureaucracy to wake up \nand smell the coffee. As I told Congressman Richardson, I believe \nCongress may be willing to pay those arrears, but only--and I repeat \nemphatically, only--if payments are tied to concrete reform.\n  Last month, the members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee had \na long and productive meeting with the new U.N. Secretary General, Kofi \nAnnan. I believe Mr. Annan genuinely wants to reform the United \nNations, and I genuinely want to help him. But like Ronald Reagan used \nto say: ``trust but verify.''\n  That is why I told Mr. Annan that I intend to introduce legislation \nshortly that sets benchmarks for U.N. reform, and that rewards reform \nwith payment of the U.S. arrearage. As each benchmark is met, money \nwill be dispensed, thus ensuring U.S. contributions will be linked to \nconcrete accomplishments.\n  I have asked the Secretary General for his ideas and input, as I work \nwith Senator Grams, who will chair the international operations \nsubcommittee during this Congress, and as I work with other Senate \ncolleagues to prepare this legislation.\n  Mr. President, Congressman Richardson has pledged to work with the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee and with the Congress as a whole, in \nimplementing concrete reforms at the United Nations. We welcome his \ninput.\n  I believe that on balance, he is well qualified for the post of U.S. \nPermanent Representative to the United Nations. I look forward to \nworking with him in moving our agenda forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Who controls the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina controls the \ntime on his side.\n  Mr. HELMS. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee \nfor yielding me time on this nomination. I rise in support of this \nnomination of Congressman Richardson to be America's Ambassador to the \nUnited Nations. I had the pleasure of serving with Bill Richardson \nwhile he was in the House. We arrived at nearly the same time.\n  He was a joy to serve with, and I have a lot of respect for what he \nhas done since that time, especially in the area of international \naffairs where he has in a number of instances been able to extricate \nAmericans from very difficult situations.\n  However, on this issue of the nomination, I think we also need to \naddress the question of the status of the United Nations and especially \nthe relationship of this Government to the United Nations, and a few \ncaveats need to be pointed out.\n  Specifically, my concern, and I think the concern of a number of \nMembers of Congress, is with the payment of arrearages to the United \nNations. The administration, we hear by rumor, is going to send to this \nCongress a supplemental, which supplemental will include in it a $900 \nmillion plus request for payment of arrearages to the United Nations.\n  There are two major issues raised by this. First, the question of \nwhether $900 million is the correct number. There is some serious \nconcern by those of us who have looked at this issue that that number \nmay be too high and that the proper number should be less because we as \na government have not received proper credit for costs of peacekeeping \nwhich we have incurred and should have been credited for.\n  Second, independent of what the right number is relative to \narrearages, there is the question of what the money will be spent for \nin the future. The United Nations has some very serious problems in its \nmanagement.\n  The new Secretary General, Kofi Annan, has made a commitment to try \nto address those problems, and we respect that commitment. But we need \nto go beyond verbiage. We need to go beyond language, and we need to \nhave specifics, and we need to have enforceable and identifiable and \nascertainable standards we can look to.\n  Specifically, we need to have from the United Nations a system to \nreview where the money is spent. There is not now available to those \nwho wish to review, those member countries that wish to review, an \neffective accounting procedure for where the money goes once it arrives \nat the United Nations, and we need to have that.\n  Second, we need to have an effective process for determining the \npersonnel policies of the United Nations. There is not now a structure \nfor adequately reviewing how personnel decisions are made at the United \nNations. There is a legitimate concern that there are a significant \nnumber of political appointees at the United Nations, patronage, for \nlack of a better word, and that these appointees do vote in many \ninstances. That is the representation. It may or may not be correct. \nBut because there is no system to be able to review the personnel \npolicies of the United Nations, because they do not have a systematic \npersonnel policy system, it is impossible to evaluate the accuracy of \nthese representations.\n\n[[Page S1214]]\n\n  Third, we need to have the process for evaluating the full services \ndelivered by the United Nations, the programmatic initiatives taken by \nthe United Nations and whether or not they are being efficiently and \neffectively handled. This is a very genuine concern because there is a \nvery significant amount of anecdotal evidence, at least, that many of \nthe activities and dollars that have been spent to support those \nactivities may not have produced the results sought, or in many \ninstances the dollars may have just been misplaced in at least a few \ncases that have been found by the present inspector general, even \nmisappropriated.\n  So until we get in place these three major accounting processes, \nwhich are typical of any major structure of government or of the \nprivate sector, an accounting structure for knowing where the money \ngoes, an accounting structure for knowing what the personnel policies \nare, and an accounting structure that allows you to follow programmatic \nactivity as to its efficiency and effectiveness, until we get something \nin place that shows us we are going to have those types of systems in \nplace that allow us to review and know whether or not our dollars are \nbeing spent effectively, it is very hard for us as the fiduciaries of \nour citizens' dollars, as the managers of our taxpayers' hard-earned \nincome that is sent here as taxes, to say to the United Nations you \nshall have this money in a carte blanche type of approach.\n  So there will be a significant debate in the Senate, and I suspect in \nthe Congress generally, as to how we structure any payment on \narrearages, and it is going to be my position, which I intend to \naggressively pursue--and it really is a position where I follow the \nlead of the chairman of the committee--that we have effective \naccounting procedures in place and that they be ascertainable and that \nthey be structured in a way that we are sure we are getting our \ndollar's worth of effective administration, personnel management and \nservices.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 5 minutes yielded the Senator have \nexpired.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Presiding Officer for his courtesy and the \nchairman for his courtesy.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of our colleague, \nCongressman Richardson, to become our Ambassador to the United Nations.\n  Mr. President, I will very shortly yield back the remainder of the \ntime. I understand I have 15 minutes under my control.\n  Mr. President, I take this opportunity to thank the chairman, Senator \nHelms, for his willingness to bring this important nomination to the \nfloor so expeditiously.\n  I join Chairman Helms in endorsing the nomination of Representative \nBill Richardson to be the Permanent Representative of the United States \nof America to the United Nations, with rank of Ambassador.\n  I commend President Clinton for having nominated him, and I strongly \nurge my colleagues here today to vote to confirm this distinguished \nMember of Congress who already has a long list of diplomatic \naccomplishments to his name.\n  Congressman Richardson has ably represented the Third District of New \nMexico for 14 years, but it is his experience in successfully \nnegotiating the release of Americans and others in some of the world's \nleast hospitable locales that has brought his formidable diplomatic \nskills to light. This diplomatic experience will serve him well at the \nUnited Nations as he seeks to advance American interests in contacts \nwith 185 other nations.\n  Likewise, Congressman Richardson's personal background and political \nexperience have prepared him well to represent the United States in the \nworld body.\n  Bill Richardson was born in California and grew up in Mexico City. He \nattended high school in Boston and remained there to attend Tufts \nUniversity, where he earned a bachelor's degree and a Master of Arts in \nLaw and Diplomacy.\n  Bill Richardson then came to Washington, working in the Legislative \nAffairs Office at the State Department and as a staffer on the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, where, like his predecessor, Secretary of \nState Albright, he gained an appreciation for the role of the Senate in \nhelping craft American foreign policy.\n  In 1978, Bill Richardson moved to Santa Fe, and in 1982 he won \nelection to this first term as a Member of Congress. His vast district \nhas been described by one writer as a ``mini-U.N.,'' with a diverse \npopulation that is 35 percent Hispanic and 25 percent Native American, \nincluding members of 28 different tribes.\n  As a Congressman, he served on the Intelligence Committee and was a \nfervent advocate of the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe official biography of Bill Richardson.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Report for the Committee on Foreign Relations, United States Senate\n\n     Subject: Ambassadorial Nomination: Certificate of \n         Demonstrated Competence--Foreign Service Act, Section \n         304(a)(4).\n     Post: U.S. Mission to the United Nations.\n     Candidate: Bill Richardson.\n       Bill Richardson has served as a member of the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, representing the state of New Mexico since \n     1983. He serves on the Commerce, Resources and Intelligence \n     Committees. Mr. Richardson is active on the North Atlantic \n     Assembly, the Helsinki Commission on Human Rights, the \n     Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and the House Democratic \n     Steering Committee. In addition, Congressman Richardson \n     serves as Chief Deputy Minority Whip.\n       Congressman Richardson has been active in hostage \n     negotiations in a number of countries which include the \n     Sudan, North Korea, Cuba, and Iraq. His diplomatic skills \n     have been instrumental in the release of a number of American \n     hostages.\n       Prior to his election to the U.S. House of Representatives, \n     Mr. Richardson served as a Staff Member of the U.S. Senate \n     Foreign Relations Committee, a Congressional Liaison Officer \n     as the Department of State, and a Staff Member of the \n     Wednesday Group of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n       Mr. Richardson received a B.A. from Tufts University and an \n     M.A. from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts. \n     He is the recipient of honorary degrees from the University \n     of the Americas in Mexico, the College of Santa Fe, and the \n     Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Mr. Richardson has \n     published a number of articles dealing with U.S.-Mexico \n     relations.\n       Born November 15, 1947, Mr. Richardson speaks Spanish and \n     French. He has won numerous awards including the Aztec Eagle \n     Award from Mexico Government in 1994. In 1995, he was \n     nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n       Mr. Richardson's dedication to public service and his \n     strong diplomatic and leadership skills make him an excellent \n     candidate as U.S. Representative to the United Nations.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, Bill Richardson has engaged in successful \ndiplomacy with some of the world's most recalcitrant regimes and \nrebels. His humanitarian concern for individuals and his commitment to \nadvance this country's interests have led him to countries like North \nKorea, Cuba, Iraq, Serbia, Nigeria, Burma, Haiti, and Sudan. My \ncolleagues will recall that he negotiated the release of an American \nhelicopter pilot in North Korea, three Red Cross workers in Sudan, and \ntwo Americans imprisoned in Iraq.\n  Two weeks ago, Congressman Richardson came before the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee and outlined how the United Nations should be used \nto advance American interests, while streamlining its bureaucracy and \nreforming its structure. I ask unanimous consent that his statement \nbefore the committee be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Statement by Representative William Richardson Before Senate Foreign \n                          Relations Committee\n\n       Mr. Chairman, distinguished Members of the Committee, it is \n     a pleasure to meet with you this morning. I would like to \n     begin by expressing my gratitude to President Clinton for \n     nominating me to this important and challenging position. I \n     am deeply honored by his trust and deeply conscious of the \n     fact that, if confirmed, I will be representing the United \n     States, and the interests and values of its people to the \n     world. This is a heavy responsibility that I do not undertake \n     lightly. But I assure you that, if I am confirmed, America \n     will have no more forceful advocate of its views and no more \n     forceful defender of its sovereign interests.\n       I would also like to thank you, Mr. Chairman, as well as \n     Senator Biden, for moving forward so expeditiously with my \n     nomination. I was very encouraged by the calls for bi-\n     partisan cooperation on U.S. foreign policy at Secretary \n     Albright's confirmation\n\n[[Page S1215]]\n\n     hearing, and I look forward, if confirmed, to working with \n     you in the same spirit.\n       I also extend my appreciation to Senators Domenici and \n     Bingaman, and Representatives Gilman, Hamilton and Menendez, \n     for their kind introductions. It has been my privilege to \n     work with these distinguished individuals. In my tenure in \n     the Congress, I have also come to know a number of the \n     members of this Committee. I have seen how deeply committed \n     you are to advancing the interests of the America people. I \n     thank all of the members of the Committee for the courtesies \n     you have extended to me during the last few weeks.\n       I would like as well to express my great admiration and \n     respect for the work of my predecessor, whose resolve, \n     frankness, and just plain good sense made her four years at \n     the U.N. such a resounding success. If confirmed, I hope to \n     profit from her example and to work closely with her as a \n     member of the President's foreign policy team.\n       Finally, I wonder if I might take a brief moment to \n     introduce my wife Barbara.\n       Mr. Chairman, I am proud of my long-standing commitment to \n     public service. For seven terms in the House of \n     Representatives, I have sought to demonstrate that commitment \n     by serving my constituents and my country to the best of my \n     abilities. Those fourteen years of service, I believe, \n     provide me with a perspective and a sensitivity to issues \n     that will strengthen my working relationship with you, this \n     Committee, and the Congress.\n       We share a love for our nation and a determination to \n     preserve and strengthen America's global leadership, to \n     promote our goals of world peace and security. We want a \n     better world for our generation, our children's generation \n     and all those who follow.\n       The good news is that we live at a time of remarkable \n     promise. Our nation is at peace. Our economy is strong. And \n     our most fundamental beliefs are ascendant, as more countries \n     and peoples than ever before enjoy the advantages of open \n     societies and open markets. But we also face a host of \n     threats--from rogue states and the spread of weapons of mass \n     destruction to terrorism, drug trafficking and environmental \n     degradation--that can all too easily undermine our hard-won \n     gains and our hopes for the next century.\n       I believe the U.N. is at a crossroads--and so is America's \n     leadership in the institution. Both the U.N. and the U.S. \n     face fundamental choices: for the United Nations, to adapt \n     fully to new demands and changing times, or to suffer the \n     erosion of support from nations and peoples. For the United \n     States, the choice is to sustain our leadership in a \n     reformed, effective U.N. or lose our voice in an institution \n     that has helped us advance American interests for half a \n     century. The U.N. must do its part. But we too must make the \n     right choice. Let me explain why:\n       As a global power with global interests, the United States \n     must lead in seizing the opportunities and meeting the \n     challenges of this new era. And to lead, we must have all the \n     tools of leadership at our disposal. Sometimes, when our \n     vital interests are at stake, we have to be willing and able \n     to act alone. That's why we are determined to maintain a \n     strong military, and an assertive, well-funded diplomacy.\n       But the U.S. can't do everything; nor should we try. As \n     President Clinton has put it, ``we cannot sustain our \n     leadership or our goals for a better world alone.'' That is \n     why the U.N. is  essential: not as an independent actor on \n     the world stage, but as an instrument that helps us \n     mobilize the support of other nations for goals the \n     American people support. Without it, we would face, more \n     and more often, the stark choice between acting alone and \n     doing nothing.\n       I know there are some who question whether our \n     participation in the U.N. serves American interests. The \n     question is a fair one--but the answer is clear: America's \n     most fundamental interests are best served by our active, \n     hard-headed leadership in the U.N.; they will be set back if \n     we drop out--either in the literal sense or by failing to \n     shoulder our fair share of responsibilities.\n       The values that inform the U.N. Charter are also American \n     values; the Charter's sentiments and, in many ways, its very \n     words echo the ideals so familiar to generations of \n     Americans: ``to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, \n     in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal \n     rights of men and women.'' This should be no surprise given \n     the role that Americans played in conceiving and drafting the \n     U.N. Charter.\n       But U.S. participation in the U.N. is not merely a question \n     of values. U.S. participation has made a positive difference \n     in meeting an extraordinary range of challenges around the \n     world. It enables us to build international support for our \n     foreign policy goals at a lower price; during the Gulf War, \n     this multiplier effect meant that the international community \n     shared the costs and responsibility of defeating Iraq. We see \n     peace in Cambodia, El Salvador, Angola, Namibia and \n     Mozambique thanks in no small part to the powerful \n     combination of effective U.S. leadership and sustained U.N. \n     engagement.\n       Mr. Chairman, I have seen for myself how the United Nations \n     can help us further America's interests: today, IAEA \n     inspectors help to verify that North Korea is living up to \n     its commitment not to produce nuclear weapons; in remote \n     parts of Sudan to which Americans have little or no access, I \n     have seen how U.N. affiliated organizations help protect and \n     feed the innocent victims of a terrible humanitarian \n     disaster. In Burma, I have seen how the nations of the world \n     at the U.N. General Assembly and led by the United States, \n     have brought hope to embattled democrats by justly condemning \n     a repressive regime.\n       As the President said last week, ``our well-being at home \n     depends on our engagement around the world.'' U.N. agencies \n     contribute to the safety and security of Americans; they even \n     protect U.S. jobs: the ICAO's aviation safety and security \n     standards disproportionately benefit Americans (who make up \n     40 percent of all international air travelers); labor \n     standards set by the ILO help ensure that U.S. exports remain \n     competitive overseas; trademark and copyright protections \n     overseen by the World Intellectual Property Organization \n     protect billions of dollars in U.S. exports of movies, \n     software, music, books, and industrial inventions; the FAO \n     and the WHO set international food product safety and quality \n     standards that benefit our agricultural exporters as well as \n     our consumers.\n       Increasingly, we use U.N. bodies to gain international \n     support for addressing such dangerous transnational scourges \n     as terrorism, crime, and narcotics trafficking. We work with \n     and through the U.N. to achieve our objectives on human \n     rights, the environment, and child labor--all issues of great \n     importance to the American people. The U.N. has helped bring \n     the world together in caring for refugees, feeding starving \n     children, eradicating smallpox and battling AIDS. If we can \n     maintain our leadership within the organization, this will \n     continue to be so.\n       During the last several years, Secretary Albright worked \n     tirelessly on U.N. reform, and she produced results: a new \n     Secretary General was appointed, committed to accelerate the \n     pace and widen the scope of reform; the U.N. was persuaded to \n     adopt no-growth budgets--both currently and for the \n     foreseeable future--and to reduce the number of people \n     working in the U.N. Secretariat by several hundred. \n     Furthermore, we have persuaded the regional economic \n     commissions to begin initial re-prioritizing, and we have \n     taken at least the first steps toward streamlining the \n     specialized agencies.\n       Make no mistake, the U.N. has serious problems to surmount. \n     There should, for example, be better coordination of its \n     activities, consolidation of related programs and bodies, and \n     elimination of redundancies and low-priority activities. The \n     specialized agencies must learn to live within their means. \n     And the whole U.N. system must take a page from the business \n     community's handbook and learn to do more with less. The \n     High-Level Working Group on U.N. reform proposed by President \n     Clinton at the 49th General Assembly to address key economic, \n     social and administrative issues has made little progress, \n     and changes so far at the specialized agencies have been ad \n     hoc and tentative.\n       Secretary General Kofi Annan has publicly committed himself \n     to achieving the kind of reform that will make the U.N. more \n     effective. His appointment presents us with an opportunity to \n     push for reform and solve our arrears problems. He appears \n     receptive to changing the way the U.N. operates; in his \n     public remarks since being appointed he has stressed the need \n     to make the U.N. ``leaner, more efficient and more \n     effective.'' I know his words have been applauded up here on \n     the Hill and I was very encouraged by the series of meetings \n     he held last week here in Washington--in particular by his \n     meeting with you, Mr. Chairman, and members of the committee. \n     His job will be a difficult one, but with will and effort, it \n     can be done. If confirmed, I will press relentlessly to make \n     sure that reforms are undertaken, both in the U.N. and the \n     specialized agencies, and that our priorities are key factors \n     in U.N. decision-making. At the same time, I'll ask your \n     support for America's leadership in the U.N.--and for \n     fulfilling the commitments that will enable us to lead.\n       Mr. Chairman, as a member of Congress, I know perfectly \n     well that while our constituents want to see America involved \n     in the world, they are not interested in seeing tax dollars \n     wasted on programs that are inconsistent with American \n     interests or values. A central part of my job will be to make \n     this reality absolutely clear to the U.N. and its 184 other \n     members.\n       In four years, I hope this Administration will be able to \n     say that by working with you and other key committees in \n     Congress we: Helped the U.N. and its specialized agencies \n     make the transition to smaller and more efficient \n     organizations; put our U.N. assessments on a sustainable \n     financial footing that preserves U.S. influence within the \n     U.N. system; paid America's debt to the U.N.; and rebuilt \n     bipartisan support in the United States for continued \n     American leadership within and through the U.N.\n       To accomplish these far-reaching changes, we envision a \n     reform package consisting of five elements: Maintaining at \n     least zero growth in the U.N. budget, streamlining the U.N. \n     Secretariat in terms of personnel and organizational \n     structure, streamlining the U.N.'s ``big three'' affiliated \n     agencies: the Food and Agriculture Organization, the \n     International Labor Organization, and the World Health \n     Organization, negotiating lower U.S. scales of assessment for \n     the U.N. regular budget, the budgets of affiliated agencies, \n     and the U.N. peacekeeping budget, and negotiating the kind of \n     Security Council reform that preserves its efficiency and \n     protects the prerogatives of the current Permanent Members, \n     while adding Germany and Japan.\n       To see these reforms implemented, however, I will need the \n     help of the Congress.\n\n[[Page S1216]]\n\n     The administration is prepared--even eager--to work with you \n     to help achieve our U.N. goals. But our efforts are \n     increasingly hampered by international resentment over our \n     arrears. As the U.N. cleans its house, we must do our part. \n     Our U.N. debt continues to hurt our efforts to press for \n     reform and damages our influence in the U.N. and its \n     affiliated agencies. The United States needs to get out of \n     debt and stay out of debt. As the President said just last \n     week ``We cannot expect to lead through the United Nations \n     unless we pay what we owe.''\n       For that reason, at the same time as I make America's case \n     at the U.N. I will be making the case to the Congress and the \n     American people that a reformed, effective U.N. serves our \n     interests in concrete ways and that our arrears have harmed \n     our ability to press for reform. As Secretary Christopher \n     used to say, ``we can't reform and retreat at the same \n     time.''\n       Clearly, the Administration and the Congress must work \n     together on a bipartisan basis to advance U.S. interests \n     through a reformed United Nations. In addition to my \n     commitment to pressing for U.N. reform, I also pledge to you \n     to make every effort to reinforce the unfailing commitment of \n     the American people to democracy and human rights around the \n     world.\n       I believe that one of my highest responsibilities will be \n     to confer, cooperate, and consult with the Congress across \n     the board on the widest range of U.N.-related issues, both in \n     Washington and in New York. If confirmed, I will welcome your \n     advice, Mr. Chairman, and that of every member of this \n     Committee and of the Congress. I extend to you individually \n     and collectively a standing invitation to come to New York \n     and see for yourselves what we are doing there. My door will \n     always be open.\n       On one thing we can all agree: the U.N. can and must do \n     better and since we are part of the U.N. we must together be \n     part of the solution. If, with your consent, I am confirmed, \n     I can pledge to you that you will find no one more committed \n     to getting the job done.\n       Thank you very much.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, Congressman Richardson reminded us that \nwhile U.N. reform is important, we must never lose sight of the \nfundamental value of the United Nations for our national interests. We \nrely on the United Nations to provide humanitarian assistance to \nmillions who otherwise would have no source of food or shelter. We rely \non the United Nations to eradicate disease and improve health. We rely \non the United Nations to prevent nuclear proliferation. We rely on the \nU.N. to facilitate and maintain peace. The United Nations allows us to \ncombine our resources with those of others to bring about outcomes that \nare in our national interest.\n  We must pursue reform, but we should not use reform as a stalking \nhorse to undermine the United Nations' ability to carry out tasks that \nserve our fundamental interests.\n  We must maintain our leadership in the United Nations. Doing so \nentails meeting our commitments to the United Nations; specifically, it \nmeans paying our back dues. We cannot expect others to fulfill their \ninternational obligations if we do not fulfill our own.\n  The President's request for a $921 million supplemental \nappropriation. to be disbursed 2 years from now, is a good place to \nbegin a bipartisan effort to pay off our debt and encourage meaningful \nU.N. reform.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with Congressman Richardson \nover the next 4 years to ensure that the United States continues to \nplay a leading role at the United Nations so that the United Nations \ncontinues to work in America's interests.\n  Let me just suggest that I think since I have been here--and it has \nbeen 24 years--we have not had anyone who by temperament, experience, \nbackground, and education is any more qualified to be our Ambassador to \nthe United Nations than Ambassador Richardson. We, all of us who have \nserved here, at least for 2 years or more, have come to know him \npersonally or have become acquainted with his incredible record of \nspecial missions, where he has not gone off on his own but gone off \nunder the aegis and umbrella, at least, and being told by informing \nadministrations what he has been doing, and the remarkable negotiations \nthat he has undertaken with such remarkable results.\n  The reason I mention that is not that that qualifies a man or woman \nto be the Ambassador to the United Nations in and of itself, but it \nindicates that this is a man who understands how to assess his \nopposition's interests and how to try to meet that interest without \nyielding on any principle that is important to this country. I think \nMadeleine Albright did that job well, as others have, and I think that \nBill will do it equally as well.\n  I also think that he goes there equipped with a firsthand knowledge \nof the concerns expressed by the chairman of the committee, the Senator \nfrom North Carolina, and our distinguished colleague from New \nHampshire, who just spoke. This is not something he has to divine or \nguess about. This is not just in terms of our arrearages. Our \ninvolvement with the United Nations--and the future relationship the \nUnited States will have with the United Nations--is something that he \nis personally aware of, in terms of the intensity, the extent to which \nthe concern exists, and the detail of the concern as emanated from the \nU.S. Congress, both in the House and the Senate.\n  So, he is a man who will arrive on the scene fully aware of both \nsides of this equation. He is not just a very gifted academic or \ndiplomat who will serve us there. He is not someone who has just \nlearned academically of the concern of the Congress and the simple, \nbasic, legitimate political concerns that we have. I don't mean \npartisan political, I mean political in the sense that we have to \nanswer to our constituencies as to what we are going to do about paying \narrearages, if we pay arrearages, and how we pay them. And I think that \nis a particularly useful background for a man to have at this moment, \ngoing to that job.\n  He is, as I said, academically qualified. He is qualified by \ntemperament. He is qualified by experience. And he is qualified, \nuniquely qualified in what is probably the single most significant \nissue that has faced our relations with the United Nations, probably \nsince the United Nations has come into existence. That is: What is the \nrelationship and role of the President's authority to make commitments \nrelative to the use of American dollars and forces in other parts of \nthe world, and how does that interrelate with the Congress and the \nSenate, in particular, and how and under what circumstances should we \nbe making up our arrearages and looking out for our longer term \ninterests at the United Nations?\n  So for those reasons and many others which I have not mentioned here \ntoday, I think Bill Richardson is the right man for the job at this \nmoment, although I suspect he would be qualified for the job at any \nmoment. But I think he is particularly qualified to take over this job \nat this time.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, as the new chairman of the Subcommittee on \nInternational Operations, I am pleased to offer my support for the \nnomination of Bill Richardson to serve as the U.S. Ambassador to the \nUnited Nations.\n  Many of us have followed Congressman Richardson's globe-trotting \nmissions to assist captured Americans in hostile circumstances. I want \nto express my personal appreciation for the successful effort he made \ntwo years ago to obtain the release of Bill Barloon in Iraq, since Mr. \nBarloon's brother lives in my home State of Minnesota.\n  We were very grateful. I have no doubt that the lessons Bill \nRichardson has learned from these missions, which one newspaper dubbed \n``daredevil diplomacy,'' will serve him well at the United Nations. \nOften, it seems the United States must use just the right mix of \naggressive persuasion and diplomatic negotiations to convince the other \n184 member states at the United Nations to go along with even minor \nreforms.\n  As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I have long had an \ninterest in the reform and revitalization of the United Nations. But \nlate last year, I was given the opportunity to become personally \ninvolved in some of the controversial issues surrounding this body when \nPresident Clinton appointed me to be a congressional delegate to the \nU.N. General Assembly.\n  From October to December, I made three trips to the United Nations to \nparticipate in its activities. These included not only meeting with a \nwide range of U.N. officials and representatives from other nations, \nbut also speaking before the U.N. budget committee--known as the Fifth \nCommittee--and also the General Assembly itself.\n  This experience reinforced my two key beliefs about the United \nNations. First, that a properly structured United Nations can be a \nuseful international forum and a vital tool for\n\n[[Page S1217]]\n\nAmerican foreign policy. And second, that it is also an unbelievably \ncomplex and bureaucratic organization which is crying out for an \noverhaul.\n  Last month, I was encouraged by the visit to Washington of the new \nU.N. Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, and by his assertions to Congress \nthat additional reforms are in the offing. I know many of us look \nforward to reviewing the reform package he has promised to develop by \nSeptember of this year.\n  During both his public testimony and in a private meeting with me, \nBill Richardson pledged unprecedented consultations with Congress on \nU.N. issues. I deeply appreciated that promise and know that Mr. \nRichardson, as a member of Congress himself, understands the importance \nof genuine interaction between the executive and legislative branches \non foreign policy.\n  In that vein, there are some matters at the United Nations that I \nbelieve require immediate attention and I hope to begin working \npromptly with soon-to-be Ambassador Richardson to address them.\n  To begin with, I am alarmed by the lack of resources currently being \nmade available to the U.N. Inspector General, known as the Office of \nInternal Oversight Services, or the OIOS. This office is one that would \nnot exist without American advocacy and, I might add, without the \npressure of legislation mandating that some United States contributions \nto the United Nations be withheld until it was created.\n  The OIOS is charged with rooting out waste, fraud, abuse, and \nmismanagement at the United Nations. According to the Undersecretary-\nGeneral who runs the office, it does not always receive the cooperation \nit needs from all U.N. staff and member states.\n  This is unfortunate because the purpose of the OIOS is to save money \nand make more effective use of U.N. resources. All member states should \nremember that money wasted is money that will not help meet the goals \nof programs that they themselves mandated the U.N. undertake.\n  My immediate concern is that the budget of the OIOS has been cut \ndramatically this biennium, including a reduction of $700,000 just in \n1997. It also has 12 posts which have not been filled, giving it an \nespecially high vacancy rate for U.N. offices. In fact, my \nunderstanding is that the OIOS has only about 10 trained investigators \nto handle the massive job of U.N. oversight.\n  Not only is this simply unacceptable, but it causes us to question \nwhether the U.N. Inspector General's office is truly independent.\n  Now I hope one of Mr. Richardson's first priorities will be to sit \ndown with Secretary-General Annan and figure out how to bring the OIOS \nup to full strength.\n  This means not only filling vacant posts for 1997, but making sure \nthere is funding in the 1998-99 budget outline to continue those posts \ninto the next biennium. It also means making sure the OIOS has \nsufficient resources to support the activities of its investigators.\n  We have heard enough excuses on this issue and it's time for it to be \nresolved. The United States has declared that one of its reform goals \nis to expand the U.N. Inspector General's authority to all agencies and \nprograms throughout the U.N. system. I strongly support this reform \ngoal, but question how it can be accomplished when the OIOS is having \ngreat difficulty meeting its current responsibilities.\n  Another issue which has caused deep congressional concern is the loss \nof the U.S. seat on the U.N. Advisory Committee on Administrative and \nBudgetary Questions, known as the ACABQ.\n  This is the first year since the founding of the United Nations that \nthe United States has not had a position on this crucial budget \ncommittee. Without this seat, it will be even more difficult for the \nUnited States to get access to important technical budget information \nat the very time we are trying to enforce fiscal restraint and a no-\ngrowth budget at the United Nations.\n  I would recommend Mr. Richardson take three important steps with \nregard to the ACABQ: First, he must make sure the U.S. mission to the \nUnited Nations and Congress will continue to have access to important \nbudget information whenever necessary.\n  Second, he should ensure that any matters involving the commitment or \nreprogramming of U.N. funds are considered in the General Assembly's \nFifth Committee, on which the United States still has a seat, rather \nthan only by the ACABQ.\n  Now third, it is clear the United States must regain its seat during \nthe next elections for the ACABQ in 1998. Given the stunning loss of \nthe last U.S. candidate, Mr. Richardson and the State Department need \nto fully consult with Congress before nominating our next ACABQ \ncandidate.\n  Mr. President, before I close, I want to say a few words about the \nmajor U.N. issue facing Congress this year, which is the President's \nrequest for $1 billion to pay United States arrears to the United \nNations.\n  Given what I understand so far of the President's plan--and I still \nhave yet to see anything on paper from the administration--I must \nexpress my disappointment with his U.N. reform proposal.\n  First of all, I am dismayed by the reluctance, if not outright \nrefusal, of the administration to link incremental payment of U.S. \narrears to specific U.N. reforms mandated by law. Clearly, this general \napproach has been successful on a series of reforms ranging from the \ncreation of the U.N. Inspector General to the ongoing implementation of \na no-growth budget.\n  Second, I am concerned the administration is focusing narrowly on \nsimply reducing U.N. budgets and assessments to the United States. \nWhile I agree that mandating budget reductions can force U.N. \nbureaucrats to prioritize funding and programs, this is only part of \nthe picture.\n  There are a whole series of management reforms that also deserve to \nhave the leverage of U.S. arrears behind them. The point is that we \ndon't just want a less expensive United Nations, but one that is more \nmanageable and efficient.\n  Third, I have reservations about the President's request for $921 \nmillion as an advance appropriation for fiscal year 1999. These \nreservations are heightened if such funding will not be legislatively \nconditioned on mandatory reforms.\n  My personal view is that this appropriation should not be rushed \nthrough Congress just so the President can have it in his pocket for \nsafekeeping. We should consider this funding in the normal \nauthorization and appropriations process so that it can be examined in \nthe context of all budget priorities.\n  I understand that Secretary Albright will be coming to Congress \ntomorrow to discuss the President's proposal so I will defer other \ncomments until after that meeting. However, as an opening bid in the \nnegotiations over how to resolve U.S. arrears and guarantee U.N. \nreform, the administration's plan seems to be falling short.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I hope negotiations between Congress and \nthe administration can proceed quickly so that we can begin discussing \na serious, comprehensive U.N. reform agenda. To that end, I look \nforward to working with our next United States Ambassador to the United \nNations, Bill Richardson, on a close and productive basis to strengthen \nthe relationship between the United States and the United Nations.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nBill Richardson to be U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.\n  But, Mr. President, I must express my concern about the United \nNations, particularly the imminent discussion about a multibillion-\ndollar bailout of this body.\n  My thoughts can best be summed up by an article which I will ask to \nhave printed in the Record. This excellent opinion piece, written by \nCliff Kincaid, raises serious questions about the United Nations that \nneed to be answered.\n  In addition to the wasteful spending practices of the United Nations, \nin my opinion, the organization in recent years has begun to pose a \nthreat to U.S. foreign policy and the command and control of the U.S. \nArmed Forces. It needlessly delayed the conflict in Bosnia and was \npartly responsible for the debacle in Somalia.\n  The role of the United Nations in dictating the foreign policy of \nthis country, and its role in the military affairs must be confronted \nand stopped.\n  I hope that Mr. Richardson could address these and other issues \nduring his coming tenure as our Ambassador.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article by Mr. Cliff Kincaid be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S1218]]\n\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 19, 1997]\n\n                          Who's Soaking Whom?\n\n                           (By Cliff Kincaid)\n\n       Kofi Annan is coming to town. Unlike Santa Claus, who gives \n     gifts, Annan wants them. The new secretary general of the \n     United Nations is scheduled to be in Washington this week to \n     ask members of Congress to provide another $1 billion or more \n     for the world organization. Members of Congress may wish to \n     ask him some tough questions about U.N. finances.\n       First: Why has the position of U.N. secretary general \n     enjoyed a 70 percent increase in pay over the past six years \n     while the United Nations has been going broke? U.N. figures \n     show the position was paid $156,429 in gross salary in 1991, \n     with an entertainment budget of $22,500. By May 1995, the \n     secretary general's gross salary had risen to $280,075, with \n     $25,000 for entertainment. If Annan is sincere about reform, \n     he should set an example by taking a pay cut.\n       Second: Why is former U.N. secretary general Kurt Waldheim \n     still getting a $102,000 annual pension? In 1986 journalists \n     exposed his collaboration in the Nazi extermination campaign \n     in southern Europe during World War II, and he was barred \n     from the United States. Since Waldheim got his U.N. job under \n     false pretenses, why is the United Nations still obligated to \n     pay him out of its $15 billion pension fund? Moreover, \n     doesn't it look bad for the U.N. to prosecute suspected war \n     criminals in Bosnia and Rwanda while continuing to pay \n     Waldheim?\n       Third: What is the real U.S. ``debt'' to the United \n     Nations? The General Assembly came up with the requirement \n     that the United States pay 25 percent of the U.N. operating \n     budget and 31 percent of the peacekeeping budget. Over the \n     course of the past decade, congressional appropriations for \n     the U.N. have fallen short of these ``requirements,'' which \n     are based on national wealth and responsibilities in world \n     affairs. If we don't pay what the U.N. wants, its only option \n     is to deny us a vote in the General Assembly. Members of the \n     assembly haven't done this because they know we're still the \n     biggest contributor to the U.N. regardless of the ``debt'' \n     talk.\n       The United States makes many contributions to the world \n     organization for which it receives no credit or \n     reimbursement. A March 1996 General Accounting Office (GAO) \n     report on peace operations found that, during fiscal years \n     1992-95, U.S. government costs in support of U.N.-backed \n     peacekeeping operations amounted to $6.6 billion. About $4.8 \n     billion of this amount was never counted as part of our \n     official U.N. assessment, according to the GAO. The United \n     Nations did reimburse the United States for about $79 million \n     of these expenses, leaving $4.7 billion that has effectively \n     been provided as a gift. If this sum is applied to our $1 \n     billion-plus ``debt,'' as seems logical, then the United \n     Nations owes us money, not the reverse.\n       U.N. supporters may argue that the United States is \n     obligated to appropriate money directly to the United \n     Nations, not just to direct U.S. agencies to support U.N. \n     operations. But U.S. support, including housing, humanitarian \n     supplies and other goods and services, is paid for by \n     congressional appropriations and directly enables the United \n     Nations to carry on its work. Why shouldn't these \n     contributions count?\n       Fourth: Why are U.N. officials continuing to push global \n     taxation? The U.S. Congress was shocked when former U.N. \n     secretary general Boutros Boutros-Ghali endorsed \n     international taxation schemes to fund the United Nations. \n     Legislation to derail these plans was voted on by the Senate \n     last year. Not surprisingly, global taxes for the United \n     Nations went down by a 70-28 margin.\n       Nevertheless, officials at the United Nations Development \n     Programme have now edited a 300-page book, titled ``The Tobin \n     Tax,'' on how to implement a global tax on international \n     currency transactions. (James Tobin is the Yale University \n     economist who came up with the idea.) This tax could affect \n     IRAs, pension funds, mutual funds and other investments of \n     ordinary Americans. Will Annan make sure that work on these \n     schemes stops immediately?\n       If the new U.N. secretary general wants to make a \n     convincing case on Capitol Hill, he should answer these \n     questions to the satisfaction of the U.S. Congress.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, our Nation has been very fortunate over \nthe years to have had distinguished, capable representatives serving as \nour Ambassadors to the United Nations. It is my honor today to speak on \nbehalf of yet another distinguished American, Bill Richardson, who has \nbeen nominated by the President to serve in that capacity.\n  Let me offer a few words of strong endorsement for my colleague. Bill \nRichardson and I first campaigned together in 1982, when he was running \nfor the House of Representatives and I was running for the Senate.\n  Starting with that 1982 campaign, and in the 15 years since then, I \nhave continued to be impressed by his resourcefulness, by his energy, \nby his talent for winning the trust and respect from people of diverse \nbackgrounds with widely varied points of view.\n  Much has been made of the successful diplomatic efforts that he has \nengaged in in the last few years, but I would like to say just a few \nwords about his performance on his so-called day job, that is, his job \nas Congressman for the State of New Mexico.\n  As you know, Mr. President, New Mexico is a State of many cultures. \nWe have a very large native American population, a very large Hispanic \npopulation, a community such as Los Alamos, which has the largest \nnumber of Ph.D.'s per capita of any city in the world.\n  Bill Richardson has managed to gain the trust and support of each of \nthese as well as many other groups and has been a very effective and \nsuccessful Congressman receiving very large majorities each of the \neight elections that he has stood for in our State.\n  Bill will demonstrate the same resourcefulness, energy, and skill in \nbuilding trust and rapport in the United Nations that he has \ndemonstrated in New Mexico. We in New Mexico will be losing a very \ncapable and effective Representative in Congress, but the country will \nbe well served by having Bill in this key position of advocacy in the \nworld's key international institution.\n  Mr. President, I strongly recommend to my colleagues that they vote \nto confirm the nomination of Bill Richardson for the U.N. Ambassador \nposition.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I do not see any other of my colleagues \nseeking to speak on this nomination. Therefore, I am prepared to yield \nback the remainder of my time and am prepared to vote anytime the \nchairman deems it appropriate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from North Carolina yield \nback his time?\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the yeas and nays have not been obtained \nfor this nomination, have they?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the Cloakroom would do well to advise \nSenators that there shortly will be a rollcall vote. I will explain to \nthe Chair, while we are delaying just a little bit, Senator Domenici, \nwho is a New Mexican, as is Mr. Richardson, is on his way to the floor \nand he wants to say a few kind words about his fellow New Mexican. So, \npending the arrival of Senator Domenici, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will time be equally divided?\n  Mr. HELMS. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Does the Senator from North Carolina yield time to the Senator from \nNew Mexico?\n  Mr. HELMS. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise just to say a few words in behalf \nof my good friend, the U.S. Representative from the State of New \nMexico, Bill Richardson. I think I would have been remiss if I did not \ncome to the floor today and say to soon-to-be Ambassador Richardson in \nbehalf of New Mexicans, we wish you the very best good fortune. We know \nthat whatever you have tried, you have succeeded at it in your life. \nAnd now, through that achievement and because New Mexicans have sent \nyou to the U.S. House in numerous elections and for a number of years, \nwe all think you are ready for a much bigger role and a much bigger \nmission in behalf of our country.\n  Most of us who know you, and most New Mexicans who have observed you, \nare confident you are going to do a splendid job in behalf of our \ncountry. The fact that you came from a State that has multiple \ncultures, that clearly accepts the diversity that no other State in the \nUnion has like ours, bodes\n\n[[Page S1219]]\n\nwell for your work with people from all over the world.\n  While I could stand here and speak for a long time in your behalf, it \nis not necessary today because you are clearly going to be confirmed \nand your name is going to be sent to the President as the next \nAmbassador to the United Nations. But I believe I will close with just \na couple of words in Spanish. Buena suerte, Bill. That's the simplest \nway of saying good luck and good fortune in Spanish. I have been \nprivileged to work with you. I hope you will continue to work with \nthose of us in the U.S. Senate and House who are interested in the \nUnited Nations succeeding. We think you have a big mission. We hope you \ncan establish some inroads, in terms of the United Nations being a more \neffective and efficient body, so that the United States can truly \ncontinue to support its efforts and your efforts in behalf of our \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time. I suggest \nwe go to a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded back, the \nquestion is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of \nBill Richardson, of New Mexico, to be U.S. Ambassador to the United \nNations? The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 100, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                       [Rollcall Vote No. 9 Ex.]\n\n                               YEAS--100\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith, Bob\n     Smith, Gordon\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am going to submit a resolution this \nafternoon and ask it be considered. It has not yet been cleared. I hope \nit will be cleared so we will be able to vote on this resolution on \nThursday if we do not have a settlement of the American Airlines \nstrike.\n  Mr. President, I am submitting this resolution on behalf of myself, \nand Senator Gramm. Perhaps others will want to come forward as well.\n  But, Mr. President, we have a very serious economic crisis pending \nFriday about midnight. If we do not have some agreement by the two \nparties, American Airlines and its pilots union, we could hold up about \none-fourth of the traveling public at the beginning of a holiday \nweekend. We could cause 75,000 other employees of American Airlines all \nover our country to be laid off without pay. We are causing, if that \nhappens, other employees of rental car companies--people who sell food \nto airports and to airlines--all of these people who have livelihoods, \nwho have families, to possibly be totally deprived of their ability----\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, we are talking about the livelihoods \nof hundreds of thousands of Americans, and we are talking about even \ninternational travel and commerce and goods that are going into \ninternational commerce.\n  Mr. President, the effects of this strike are going to be so far \nreaching that it will have an economic impact on this country that will \nbe quite severe.\n  The pilots union is meeting with the company as we speak. The \ndeadline before a strike is midnight this Friday. We have the \nopportunity with the resolution that I am introducing to have a sense \nof the Senate that the President would use all of his persuasive powers \nto get these parties to sit down, and that the President would be able \nto use his powers to appoint an emergency board which would \nautomatically keep the contract in place for 30 days and then provide \nfor another 30-day cooling-off period. This will give 60 days to these \npeople to be able to work out their differences.\n  I think that the pilots union and the airline company, American \nAirlines, are certainly big enough people to be able to work out their \ndifferences and not cause the disruption of so many lives in our \ncountry and the economies of so many States in our country.\n  So I am asking that the Senate vote on this on Thursday, if nothing \nhas happened in between. I hope the President will use all of his \npersuasive powers between now and Thursday to make sure that everything \nis being done to settle this strike. But if nothing has happened by \nThursday, we want the President to use the powers that Congress has \ngiven him to call an emergency board together to give a 60-day cooling-\noff period so that the negotiations can continue.\n  This is something that Congress and the President have worked out in \nthe past. This is the process, Mr. President. Let us step up to the \nline, and we hopefully will be able to work with the President to make \nsure that he has all of the tools necessary to do what is necessary to \nsave this country from a real economic hit that could come within the \nnext 3 or 4 days.\n  We can do something about it. The President can do something about \nit. And we are going to ask him to do that in this resolution.\n  As I said, I am going to submit this later. I am going to ask for \nunanimous consent to be able to vote on this on Thursday. I hope it is \na moot point by that time. It is very important that the President \naddress right away this impending crisis that can affect the lives of \nso many people and the families of so many people in this country and \nthe economies of so many States in this country. The ripple effect is \ndevastating. We can do something about it.\n  I hope that the President will use the powers that he has for that \nvery purpose.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I counted it up the other day. This is \nmy 17th year of having the honor to represent my State of Alaska in \nthis body.\n\n[[Page S1220]]\n\n During that period I participated in seven separate debates on this \nfloor on this very singular issue, and that is the amendment of our \nConstitution to require that the budget be balanced.\n  A number of years ago, several of us unloaded a big van on the steps \nof the U.S. Senate. In that van were mailbags. And in those mailbags \nwere letters from our constituents in overwhelming support of an \namendment to the Constitution that would mandate a balanced budget.\n  Mr. President, in 1982 the Senate adopted the amendment but it failed \nin the House. Since then, the amendment has failed in every year that \nwe have engaged in this debate. In the intervening decade and a half \nannual Federal spending has increased nearly $1 trillion and our \nnational debt has quadrupled.\n  Mr. President, through this debate, my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle have amply demonstrated the billions and trillions that we \nhave been spending, and the meteoric rise of our national debt. I do \nnot intend to repeat those numbers. As the 10-foot stack of budgets \nstanding before me on the floor clearly show, for the past 28 years the \nFederal Government has been living on debt. I find that rather ironic, \nMr. President, in view of the fact that you and I and our constituents \nback home have to balance, if you will, our checkbooks. But the \nGovernment goes through a process of lengthy debate and budgetary \nprocess of seeing what its revenues are, seeing what its expenditures \nare, and then whatever else it seems to need it is simply added to the \nnational debt.\n  Mr. President, I want to talk about the awesome responsibility that \nwe have as stewards of this Nation to face up to the enormity of the \nchallenge that we are facing in changing the way we govern and have \nbeen governing.\n  Mr. President, American Government was transformed by the Great \nDepression. In response to this crisis, our then President Franklin \nRoosevelt in 1933 ushered in the age of social activist government, one \nof whose tenets was that in times of economic stress the Government \nwould actively intervene to restart the economy. Thus was born the age \nof peacetime deficit spending.\n  Unfortunately, what has ensued in the intervening 64 years is that \nthe Federal Government has become incapable of weaning itself from this \naddiction to deficit spending. Whether in periods of strong growth or \nmodest growth, the Federal Government runs deficits. In fact, in only 8 \nyears since the Depression has the Federal Government operated with a \nsurplus.\n  But even that fact is somewhat misleading for I would note that the \nFederal surplus in those 8 years was a mere $33 billion. Compare that \nwith 56 years of deficits cumulating in a national debt of more than \n$5.2 trillion.\n  Let me refer to the chart here on my left. I hope that the President \ncan view this. It covers the next 4 years of the current administration \nwith outlays in 1997 of $1.6 trillion to the year 2000 at $1.84 \ntrillion.\n  The significance of what is occurring here is we are having to pay \ninterest on this accumulated debt. The interest is running $247 billion \nin 1997, $250 billion in 1998, $252 billion in 1999, and $248 billion \nin the year 2000.\n  I used to be in the banking business and I can tell you that interest \nis like owning a horse that eats while you are asleep. It goes on and \non, night and day and holidays. No day is exempt from the accumulation \nof interest.\n  Here is our deficit, Mr. President: $125 billion, $120 billion, $117 \nbillion, $87 billion. One can say that is good news. The deficit is \ndeclining. Let us look a little further.\n  But I would note that if we did not have to pay interest on this \naccumulated debt, if we hadn't accumulated all of these deficits, we \nwould not have to pay nearly a trillion dollars in interest in the next \n4 years and instead of running deficits for the next 4 years, we would \nhave a surplus. We would have a surplus of $122 billion this year, $130 \nbillion in 1998, $135 billion in 1999, and $161 billion in the year \n2000.\n  My point is that at the end of this timeframe of 1997, through the \nyear 2000, our outlays will have been a little over $7 trillion, our \ninterest will have been just under $1 trillion--$997 billion. Our \ndeficit that we are adding would be $450 billion.\n  So, if you look at where we are today, at the end of this year our \nnational debt is at $5.4 trillion. By the end of the year 2000, the \nnational debt will be $6.3 trillion.\n  So the increase in the national debt in the Clinton administration \nfor roughly 8 years is projected to be $2.2 trillion.\n  The significance of these figures is a bit startling, but the reality \nis if we were not strangled by $1 trillion in interest on the national \ndebt in the next 4 years, we could run a surplus and we could give \nevery American family a $2,500-per-child tax credit, not the $500 that \nis in the Republican proposal but $2,500. Or we could give every \nAmerican family a $1,500-per-child tax credit and every American \ncitizen a 10 percent across-the-board tax cut. Or give every American a \n20 percent across-the-board tax cut.\n  That is the significance of the necessity of this legislation which \nwill take away deficit financing and allow us to develop a surplus, do \naway with the interest and get a hold of this continuing national debt \nwhich does not go away until we reduce the deficit.\n  Some say, well, why do we need a constitutional amendment to do it? \nMy answer is rather simplistic, Mr. President. We have not had the \nself-discipline to do it ourselves. We could do it ourselves, but it \nhas not been done.\n  I say to my colleagues who have any doubt about the wisdom of this \namendment: The evidence is overwhelming that without the discipline of \na constitutional amendment, elected officials are incapable of fiscal \nmanagement of the people's business, and it has taken the last 64 years \nto demonstrate this fact.\n  Some say we can balance the budget without this amendment. I say, OK, \nprove it. There is nothing within our post-Depression experience to \nsuggest that this is even remotely possible. Eight years out of 64 \nyears with surpluses totaling $33 billion is hardly evidence that \nconvinces me. Quite the contrary. It proves to me that we must have \nthis amendment if we are ever going to end deficit spending as business \nas usual in Washington, DC.\n  Mr. President, the first 10 amendments to our Constitution, \ncollectively known as the Bill of Rights, are the seminal protections \nafforded citizens in a free society. They were adopted against the \nbackdrop of the 17th and 18th century tyranny that the kings \narbitrarily exercised over their subjects.\n  The Founders knew that these rights--the freedom of speech, religion, \nand assembly--would not be guaranteed simply by congressional statute, \nfor what one Congress grants, another can easily take away. That is why \nthese fundamental rights are enshrined within our Constitution. That is \nwhy the concept of a balanced budget must also be added to the \nConstitution, for the evidence shows without any doubt that in this \nmodern era of government, the President and Congress are simply \nincapable of balancing the budget except perhaps in rare and unique \ncircumstances.\n  When future historians review the history of 20th century American \nGovernment, I fear that the legacy we will leave behind will be an \nenormous debt that we have passed on to the citizens of the 21st \ncentury. When this new century opens in just 3 years, we will have \naccumulated a debt of more than $6 trillion, the carrying costs, as I \nhave indicated, of which will be a quarter trillion dollars annually.\n  Who is going to pay off that debt? Well, consider, Mr. President, \nthat the largest surplus this Government has ever run was a mere $11 \nbillion in 1948. In inflation adjusted dollars, that is equivalent to a \nsurplus today of approximately $84 billion.\n  If, starting in the year 2000, we could replicate our 1948 experience \nand have an annual surplus of $84 billion, the national debt of the \nUnited States would not be eliminated until the year 2073. That gives \nyou some idea of the legacy we are passing on.\n  In other words, under the most optimistic circumstances, the citizens \nwho are alive for the first 75 years of the next century will be \nshackled with paying the debts their parents and grandparents and \ngreat-grandparents accumulated. And we all know it is unlikely we will \nsustain such large surpluses throughout the next century. More likely, \nit will take 100 years or more to pay off this debt, only if we start \nnow.\n\n[[Page S1221]]\n\n  Can there be anyone in this Chamber who believes that the citizens in \nAmerica who will be alive in the year 2097 ought to be saddled with \npaying the interest on the debt that we are accumulating today--money, \nI might add, that is not being used to finance long-term investments or \njobs or inventory in this country but money that is being used to pay \ninterest on the national debt.\n\n  That is right; that is what we are doing.\n  In my view, this amendment is an economic bill of rights for future \ngenerations of this country. It is equally as important as the Bill of \nRights we now take for granted as the foundation for this great Nation.\n  It finally will force Government to learn that it cannot borrow \nindefinitely. It rearranges the rules of Government as never before in \nour history, for it requires us to face up to the fact that we can only \nspend as much as we take in in revenues, as we dictate to our private \ncitizens. And it stands for the proposition that building debt on top \nof debt is morally and fiscally irresponsible to Americans who have not \neven been born yet. That is what we are doing.\n  The legacy of the 105th Congress must be that we, at the end of this \ncentury, have recognized the responsibility we have to future \ngenerations, that we will no longer buy now and put off paying \nindefinitely. The time is now to finally stand up and change the way we \nhave been governing for the past 60 years.\n  I thank the Chair for its attention.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER [Mr. Allard]. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we are under no specific time restraints \nper side, are we, at this moment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague, the Senator from \nAlaska, for making a very clear statement of what happens when a \ncountry creates the kind of debt which our country has over the last 30 \nyears and the kind of priorities we have to shift to in funding simply \nto service debt.\n  The Senator from Alaska talked about the impact of interest on debt. \nStanding here or sitting here or stacked here beside me are 28 budgets, \n28 consecutive budgets of the last 28 fiscal years of our Government \nthat have been out of balance. In other words, that have had deficits \nthat got spun into debt that have created the $5.3 trillion debt we \nhave today.\n  As a result of that, in the last fiscal cycle and the one we are \ncurrently in and the one we are currently examining, this Senate and \nthe Congress at large is going to have to consider outlays of upwards \nof $250 billion to $260 billion to pay the interest on this stack of \nbooks or, more clearly spoken, on the debt that was generated by the \nbudgets that are housed in this stack of budgets.\n  Of these 28 budgets, 14 of them were intended to be deficit budgets, \nwith no excuse or no apology on the part of the Congress that passed \nthem. But there were the other 14 you would find in the language of the \nbook that would suggest the intent was to balance in the future, or it \nwas designed as a sequence of budgets to balance.\n  Interestingly enough, that is the very debate this Congress and our \nPresident are involved in at this moment. In fact, the President was \nhere today in the President's Room just behind the Chamber discussing \nhis budget proposal and the leaders of our Senate were there along with \nthe leaders of the House comparing notes and deciding where they might \nwork together to bridge the gap of the kind of impasse we have had and \nget to a balanced budget. But it is not a balanced budget. It is one \nbudget of a series of budgets that promises to bring balance by a given \ntime, in this case by the year 2002, as did 14 of these budgets.\n  Mr. President, 28 years later, 14 budgets in deficit and 14 intended \nto be balanced, we now are faced with the circumstance the Senator from \nAlaska has spoken about, a $5.3 trillion debt, $250 to $260 billion of \ninterest paid on debt depending on the rate of interest and the amount \nour notes are negotiated under, under the 3-year cycle under which our \nnotes get renegotiated, and here is the rest of the story.\n  The President, and I do not question his sincerity, presents a budget \nfor fiscal year 1998, of the U.S. Government, that will have about 250 \nbillion dollars' worth of net interest costs, which is about 14.8 \npercent of the entire Federal budget. Here is what happens in a \nGovernment like ours when we have to commit such a phenomenal amount of \nour resource to interest on debt. Let me give these comparatives. This \nis work that has been done by our policy committee as an examination of \nreality because, when we talk about 250 billion dollars' worth of \ninterest on debt, to serve debt, that means that creditors, people who \nbuy our bonds, are owed money. A fair amount of that flows to foreign \ncountries and foreign interest, but a fair amount of it flows to our \nown citizens and to their stocks and to their trust accounts.\n  But 250 billion dollars' worth of net interest in the President's \n1998 fiscal budget is something like this. It is 21 times as much on \ninterest as we are spending on agricultural programs. In other words, \nour priority in budgeting today is to spend 21 times more on interest \nthan we do on agriculture. So our priority is not agriculture, it is \npaying our debt. Better spoken, I should say paying our creditors who \nhave loaned us their money to service the debt.\n  What about international affairs? We are the last great superpower of \nthe cold war period. We play an important role in the decisions of the \nworld and our presence oftentimes causes other nations to think \ndifferently about how they would conduct their business, both \ninternally and externally. Yet, today, 17 times as much on interest is \npaid as on international affairs. So, for those of our constituents who \nsay you are spending too much on foreign aid, I would say we are \nspending 17 times more on debt, interest on debt. Again, clearly \nspelling out the priorities that we have forced ourselves into as a \ngreat nation, simply because we could not control our spending \nappetite.\n  We pay 11 times as much on interest as on natural resources and the \nenvironment. This President, this administration, likes to call itself \nthe environmental administration. And there is not a Senator on this \nfloor who does not want to make sure that Government policy in \ncooperation with the private sector promotes a positive, cleaner \nenvironment. And yet, today, when it comes to priorities of dollars and \ncents, we pay 11 times more to service the debt created by these 28 \nbudgets as we do on interest rates. Where are our priorities? They are \nto pay our creditors so we can continue to have debt.\n  We spend 10 times as much on interest as on the administration of \njustice. That is the Justice Department, that is the FBI, that is our \nengagement in the war on drugs, that is trying to curtail illicit \nactivities that flow across our borders that somehow damage our \ncitizenry. Yet, if you looked at our budget today, you would say that \nCongress is more preoccupied with paying interest on debt than they are \nwith protecting our citizens against drugs, if you were to look at the \nactual expenditure of money. Why? Because 30 years worth of fiscal \nirresponsibilities have forced us to pay more attention to servicing \nour debt than the flow of drugs across our borders and the kind of \nimpact they have on our citizens and our children.\n  We pay six times as much on interest as on benefits and services for \nveterans. A very large veterans group is now visiting our community, \nthis Nation's Capitol. I was just visited by a nice contingent of \nVeterans of Foreign Wars. This evening, there is a large gathering of \nhundreds of Veterans of Foreign Wars in this city, men and women who \nput their lives on the line to protect our freedom. Many of them are \nconcerned about the future of the Veterans Administration and the \nveterans health care delivery system, and will we honor our commitment \nto them and to the World War II veterans who are now reaching a peak in \ntheir need for health care services? Yet, today, this Government, by \nthe nature of its fiscal irresponsibility of the last 28 years, is \ngoing to pay six times more on interest as on the benefits and services \nto veterans. Is it our priority? It has to be our priority if we are to \nmaintain our fiscal solvency as a nation. We must progressively ignore \nthe true interests and priorities of our country in light of paying our \ncreditors.\n\n[[Page S1222]]\n\n  Four times as much on interest as on education, training, and \nemployment programs; yet our President, in his State of the Union, just \nthis past week prioritized for our Nation and for the decade ahead the \nissue of our involvement in education at all levels. None of us \ndisputes that priority. All of us recognize that our public schools are \nin need and, in many instances, they are failing. Yet, today, as we \nwrestle with the 1998 budget, what will be the first priority? Funding \ninterest on debt created by irresponsible Congresses of the past that \ngenerated 5.3 trillion dollars' worth of debt. So where in all of \nthese priorities will education fall? It is not going to be first. It \ncannot be first. What is first? Paying interest on debt. It has to be \ntaken right off the top. It has to be taken right off the top of \nGovernment expenditures, just the way interest on serving the debt in \nthe private sector is taken right off the top of all the money coming \nin. Because if you do not take it off the top, and you do not pay your \ndebts or your interest on debts, if you do not service your debt you do \nnot borrow any money. You are busted. You are bankrupt. And that, of \ncourse, is exactly what has happened to this country.\n\n  Now, nearing the largest single item in the Federal budget is \ninterest on debt. So when our colleagues stand on the floor and say, as \nthe President said the other night, ``Oh, gee whiz, you guys have the \nvotes and I have the signature. You pass a balanced budget and I will \nsign it,'' what this President knows and what he clearly has \ndemonstrated in the budget that he has sent to the Hill, is that it is \nnot in balance. It is about $120 to $130 to $140 to $150 billion out of \nbalance for the next 5 years. Then, if he really honors the tax cuts--\nwhich he does not, because he agrees in his budget that he takes them \nback to fund the deficit to create the balance in the outyears, because \nhe needs more money--what he is really saying is that his budget is not \nin balance. Why? Partly because of interest on debt.\n  Where does the National Government get $250 billion to pay its \ninterest costs? By adding together all corporate income taxes, that is \nonly $190 billion. Believe it or not, if we choose to double corporate \nincome tax in this country we would just get enough and a little more \nto pay interest on debt. And all Federal excise taxes--that is $61 \nbillion. I think the point I am making, and the point the Senator from \nAlaska made, is we do not believe the Congress truly has the will. We \ndo not believe any President, Republican or Democrat, can find the \ntotal will to work for, make the tough choices, and get to a balanced \nbudget in the kind of timeframe and with the kind of reasonableness \nthat the American people have demanded of us. That is why I and others \nso strongly believe we need the kind of constitutional framework to \noperate within, that creates the kind of political discipline and \nfiscal discipline to produce a balanced budget.\n  Who do we owe it to? We owe it to a lot of people. But most \nimportant, we owe it to future generations, because it is our children \nand our grandchildren who will pay off the debt. More important, if we \ncontinue to create debt without servicing debt, without bringing debt \ndown in the future, more and more of the resources of our young, when \nthey grow to maturity, will have to go to pay the creditor instead of \nfund the kind of Government they want, or to fund the kind of services \nthey want from Government; but, more important, to keep some of their \nown money so they can have their own lives and their own families, and \nhave their part of the American dream as our generation has had it.\n  There need not be any pointed finger or accusation as to whose fault \nthese budgets have been, because, while most of them in the 28-year \nperiod could be, arguably, Democratic budgets, a fair number of them \nwere Republican budgets.\n  A fair number of them were created under Republican Presidents. All \nof them were out of balance, and all of them had deficits, and all of \nthem created the $5.3 trillion debt that this country experiences \ntoday.\n  So I really think we ought to quit chasing our tail. The arguments \nthat we have heard for the last decade are the same arguments, and the \nPresident makes the argument today that is certainly not original that \na few Presidents before him have made but all who oppose a balanced \nbudget amendment to our Constitution make. And that is that you cannot \ntie the hands of Government, that this would be much too rigid, that it \nwould cause conflict within the economy, that it might cause us to not \nhave the priorities in Government that we want.\n  What they are really all saying is that nobody is willing to make the \ntough choices, and 28 years of budgets clearly demonstrate that. That \nis why I think it is important that we reflect on the words of Thomas \nJefferson who said that if there is 1 more amendment to the 10, the \n11th amendment he would have added was to disallow the ability of \nGovernment to borrow, because he was fearful of a representative \nrepublic being able to vote itself money, and we have done that year in \nand year out.\n  As a result of that, we are now here wrestling, as all Presidents and \nCongresses do, with what do we do with the debt, what do we do with the \ndeficit, and where do we find the money to spend on some of these \ncritical programs.\n  The Senator from Alaska is right. When a nation overspends itself, \nwhen a Congress no longer prioritizes as to where the limited resources \nof the tax dollars go, but takes $250 billion right off the top and \nsays that has to go to interest on debt, Mr. President, it is time we \nchange, and that is why many of us have stood on this floor and argued \nfor years that this is the mechanism to bring that change, this is the \nmechanism to bring the kind of political and fiscal discipline and \nresponsibility that this Congress must have, because there isn't a \nSenator on this floor who can just vote it without the real discipline \nthat a Constitution brings.\n  So this is why I hope that, in the ensuing days, all of our \ncolleagues join together to support the balanced budget amendment to \nour Constitution and to give the citizens of this country the right, \nunder the Constitution, to debate the issue in the capitals of their \nStates to determine whether they want to change the organic law of this \ncountry to discipline this Government to cause this Government to react \nin a way that they perceive, as I, to be a much healthier action on \nbehalf of the economy, the citizens and future generations.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, at some point, I believe a unanimous-consent \nrequest will be entered into, and we will set out the agenda for \ntomorrow's business, including an allocation of time for morning \nbusiness, as well as an allocation of time for an amendment, which I \nwill shortly propose, to be considered.\n  I gather the respective leaders are working on that. In anticipation, \nMr. President, I have been asked, in order to move the process along \nand make sure we have some business to conduct tomorrow, to submit an \namendment. I will briefly describe the amendment this afternoon and \nthen yield the floor. Based on the allocation of time the leaders are \nable to agree upon, we will engage more fully in the debate tomorrow.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 4\n\n (Purpose: To simplify the conditions for a declaration of an imminent \n                and serious threat to national security)\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4.\n       On page 3, line 7, strike beginning with ``is'' through \n     line 11 and insert ``faces an imminent and serious military \n     threat to national security as declared by a joint \n     resolution.''.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, that is the sum and substance of the \namendment.\n  Very briefly, the proposed language on the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment, section 5, reads as follows:\n\n       The Congress may waive the provisions of this article for \n     any fiscal year in which a declaration of war is in effect. \n     The provisions of this article may be waived for any fiscal \n     year in which the United States is engaged in military \n     conflict which causes an imminent and serious military threat \n     to national security and is so declared by a joint \n     resolution, adopted by a majority of the whole number of each \n     House, which becomes law.\n\n\n[[Page S1223]]\n\n\n  My concerns with this provision, Mr. President, are addressed, I \nbelieve, by the amendment that we will consider tomorrow. Very briefly, \nif one reads this section very carefully, word for word, and I \nemphasize in my reading of this section the language that is of \nparticular concern to me, and that is ``is engaged in military \nconflict''--now the earlier language, ``a declaration of war,'' \ntroubles me as well--it seems to mean we would have to be in the midst \nof a conflict before we can waive the provisions of the amendment. \nThere have been numerous examples throughout our history in which we \nwere very much aware that an imminent danger was on the horizon and we, \nin preparation of that imminent danger, were able to respond, utilizing \ndeficit financing to do it.\n  If you wait until we are actually engaged in that conflict, it seems \nto me you are running the risk of leaving this country very, very \nvulnerable, particularly with weapons of mass destruction that have the \ncapability of causing great harm to our Nation.\n  This amendment attempts to address that issue. If there is an \nimminent threat to our national security--and then allowing for the \ndifferent provision here--we would have a resolution adopted by both \nHouses where a majority of those present and voting would be necessary \nin case of some emergency circumstance--I see, for example, my good \nfriend and colleague from Idaho who has some distance to travel to get \nto Washington--where something may happen and Members are not able to \nget back here as quickly as they may need to.\n  We would not be able to meet that constitutional requirement if the \nunderlying balanced budget amendment is adopted, because you would need \n51 Senators. The amendment that I offer addresses both points; that is, \nenables a response prior to actually being engaged in military conflict \nand allows for a joint resolution to be adopted with less than the \nwhole number of each House.\n  Again, I will wait until tomorrow, Mr. President, to discuss this \nfurther. This is an amendment, I remind my colleagues, which has been \nraised in very similar form on previous occasions. Regardless of \nwhether one is for the balanced budget amendment or not, it seems to me \nwe do not want to place ourselves in the position, obviously, of \nrestricting our ability, particularly where our national security is in \nimminent danger and our Nation is in jeopardy and not able to respond.\n  I cannot think of a single Member who would want to be put in a \nposition, as important as balancing the budget is, where we would be \nwilling to risk a threat to this country on that particular altar.\n  So I hope Members, this evening and tomorrow, before we have time to \ndebate this amendment, will look at it carefully and consider it in \nhopes that I might garner their support when we vote on this tomorrow \nafternoon. Again, this will depend on when the leaders are able to \nagree on a time for debate and a vote.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n              Unanimous-Consent Agreement--Amendment No. 4\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate resume \nconsideration of Senator Dodd's amendment regarding national security \nbeginning at 1:30 on Wednesday with the time between 1:30 and 5:30 \nequally divided in the usual form. I further ask unanimous consent that \nat 5:30 the Senate proceed to a vote on or in relation to the Dodd \namendment and, finally, no amendment be in order to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There being no objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/11/senate-section/article/S1219-3", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

WRIGHT OF WEST POINT, KY, FOR 50 YEARS OF SERVICE TO \n                              FIREFIGHTING\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, on Saturday, February 8, 1997, the community \nof West Point, KY held its annual Volunteer Fire Department and EMS \nAppreciation Banquet. Each year, this banquet honors and celebrates \nthose in the community who have been instrumental in supporting the \nmission of the volunteer fire department and EMS services. This year, \nthe community honored one man, Ralph W. Wright, who has given 50 years \nof his life to the safety of the citizens of West Point.\n  Mr. Wright has been a member of the fire department for the last 50 \nyears. He began as a firefighter and worked his way up through the \nranks to chief, a position he held for 27 years. After a long and \ndistinguished career in the fire department, Mr. Wright did not let \nretirement prevent him from fighting fires. In fact, in his retirement, \nMr. Wright continues to serve as a firefighter--who still makes the \nfirst truck out of the station. In addition, to his service as a \nfirefighter, he was a volunteer EMT on the ambulance service for \nseveral years.\n  Because of his tireless efforts on behalf of the citizens of West \nPoint, today's volunteer fire department is what it is today: dedicated \nto the safety of all its citizens; prepared to battle fires and \nhazardous material spills; responding to protect the community from \nfloods and other natural disasters.\n  In addition to his work on behalf of the safety of the citizens of \nWest Point, Mr. Wright has been a strong and active supporter of the \nCrusade for Children. The citizens of West Point have been well served \nby Ralph Wright. He is an outstanding citizen and a shining example to \nall. I know that the community of West Point holds Ralph Wright in the \nhighest of esteem. This is an honor that is long overdue and I am \ndelighted to share this event with my colleagues. I extend my heartfelt \ncongratulations to Ralph Wright and to his family on this special \noccasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/11/senate-section/article/S1223-4", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1223-S1224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        HONORING THE WILLIAMS ON THEIR 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. Ashcroft. Mr. President, families are the cornerstone of America. \nThe data are undeniable: Individuals from strong families contribute to \nthe society. In an era when nearly half of all couples married today \nwill see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it is both \ninstructive and important to honor those who have taken the commitment \nof ``till death us do part'' seriously, demonstrating successfully the \ntimeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics \nmake our country strong.\n  For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Wade and Flo \nWilliams of Springfield, MO who on February 10, 1997, will celebrate \ntheir 50th wedding\n\n[[Page S1224]]\n\nanniversary.

Like Senator Johnston, Proctor \nwill be greatly missed in the Senate.\n  Proctor Jones has been an outstanding staff member who has served the \nSenate and the American people well for almost four decades. With his \nvast experience on appropriations issues and his skill at weighing \ncomplex priorities, Proctor has earned the respect of the entire Senate \nover the years. He has also earned the deep appreciation of other staff \nmembers for his signature style--unerring graciousness and \npleasantness, even under intense pressure. Proctor represents the best \nof Senate civility, and he will be long remembered by all of us.\n  It has been my particular pleasure to work closely with Proctor on a \nnumber of projects in Massachusetts which have been conducted by the \nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and which have significantly improved \npublic safety, the environments, and the economy of our State. I am \ngrateful for Proctor's leadership on these issues and many others. He \nrepresents the best in public service, and I wish him well in the years \nahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/11/senate-section/article/S1224-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/11/senate-section/article/S1224-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT CONCERNING THE INTERNATIONAL WHALING COMMISSION--MESSAGE FROM \n                          THE PRESIDENT--PM 13\n\n  The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  On December 12, 1996, Secretary of Commerce Michael Kantor certified \nunder section 8 of the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967, as amended \n(the ``Pelly Amendment'') (22 U.S.C. 1978), that Canada has conducted \nwhaling activities that diminish the effectiveness of a conservation \nprogram of the International Whaling Commission (IWC). The \ncertification was based on the issuance of whaling licenses by the \nGovernment of Canada in 1996 and the subsequent killing of two bowhead \nwhales under those licenses. This message constitutes my report to the \nCongress pursuant to subsection (b) of the Pelly Amendment.\n  In 1991, Canadian natives took a bowhead whale from the western \nArctic stock, under a Canadian permit. In 1994, Canadian natives took \nanother bowhead whale from one of the eastern Arctic stocks, without a \npermit.\n  In 1996, under Canadian permits, one bowhead whale was taken in the \nwestern Canadian Arctic on July 24 and one bowhead whale was taken in \nthe eastern Canadian Arctic on August 17. The whale in the eastern \nArctic was taken from a highly endangered stock. The IWC has expressed \nparticular concern about whaling on this stock, which is not known to \nbe recovering.\n  None of the Canadian whale hunts described above was authorized by \nthe IWC. Canada withdrew from the IWC in 1982. In those instances where \nCanada issued whaling licenses, it did so without consulting the IWC. \nIn fact, Canada's 1996 actions were directly contrary to IWC advice. At \nthe 1996 Annual Meeting, the IWC passed a resolution encouraging Canada \nto refrain from issuing whaling licenses and to rejoin the IWC. \nHowever, Canada has recently advised the United States that it has no \nplans to rejoin the IWC and that it intends to continue granting \nlicenses for the taking of endangered bowhead whales.\n  Canada's unilateral decision to authorize whaling outside of the IWC \nis unacceptable. Canada's conduct jeopardizes the international effort \nthat has allowed whale stocks to begin to recover from the devastating \neffects of historic whaling.\n  I understand the importance of maintaining traditional native \ncultures, and I support aboriginal whaling that is managed through the \nIWC. The Canadian hunt, however, is problematic for two reasons.\n  First, the whaling took place outside the ICW. International law, as \nreflected in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, \nobligates countries to work through the appropriate international \norganization for the conservation and management of whales. Second, \nwhaling in the eastern Canadian Arctic poses a particular conservation \nrisk, and the decision to take this risk should not have been made \nunilaterally.\n  I believe that Canadian whaling on endangered whales warrants action \nat this time.\n  Accordingly, I have instructed the Department of State to oppose \nCanadian efforts to address takings of marine mammals within the newly \nformed Arctic Council. I have further instructed the Department of \nState to oppose Canadian efforts to address trade in marine mammal \nproducts within the Arctic Council. These actions grow from our concern \nabout Canada's efforts to move whaling issues to fora other than the \nIWC and, more generally, about the taking of marine mammals in ways \nthat are inconsistent with sound conservation practices.\n  Second, I have instructed the Department of Commerce, in implementing \nthe Marine Mammal Protection Act, to withhold consideration of any \nCanadian requests for waivers to the existing moratorium on the \nimportation of seals and/or seal products into the United States.\n  Finally, the United States will continue to urge Canada to reconsider \nits unilateral decision to authorize whaling on endangered stocks and \nto authorize whaling outside the IWC.\n  I believe the foregoing measures are more appropriate in addressing \nthe problem of Canadian whaling than the imposition of import \nprohibitions at this time.\n  I have asked the Departments of Commerce and State to keep this \nsituation under close review.\n\n                                                  William J.

A bill to enhance competition in the financial services \nsector, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n\n\n           THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION AFFILIATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, today with the cosponsorship of my \ncolleagues, Senators Gramm, Grams, and Bennett, I am introducing the \n``Depository Institutions Affiliation Act of 1997,'' to modernize the \nlaws governing the financial services industry in a comprehensive, \nprogressive fashion. I am pleased that Representative Richard Baker, \nchairman of the Housing Banking Subcommittee on Capital Markets, \nSecurities and Government Sponsored Enterprises, will introduce similar \nlegislation, joined by Representatives McCollum, La Falce, and Dreier. \nThis legislation will promote efficiency and fair competition between \nall financial service providers and make U.S. financial firms stronger \nin global competition.\n  Mr. President, Congress has been struggling to modernize the \nfinancial system since before I became a member of the Banking \nCommittee in 1981. That effort must continue and should conclude \nsuccessfully in this Congress. Our existing legal framework is \nfundamentally outdated. The Glass-Steagall and Bank Holding Company \nActs impose regulatory structures that are inadequate for today's \nglobal marketplace and the financial needs of consumers.\n  Mr. President, our Nation's entire financial system --including \ntraditional banks, insurance companies, and securities firms--faces a \nfuture that is somewhat unsettled. Competitive developments in the \nmarketplace and the\n\n[[Page S1227]]\n\ntechnological revolution that is well underway have brought about \nsignificant changes in the financial system, domestic and \ninternational. And these changes have already had a significant \ninfluence on all financial services providers and their customers.\n  Mr. President, there is widespread recognition that the United States \nmust adopt a regulatory regime that recognizes market realities and \nassesses and controls risk. Our present patchwork of financial laws \nprotects particular industries, restrains competition, prevents \ndiversification that would limit risks, restricts potential sources of \ncapital, and undermines the efficient delivery of financial services \nand the competitive position of our financial institutions in world \nmarkets.\n  Mr. President, Congress' reform effort in the 105th Congress must be \nforward-looking, not merely a reengineering of the legacy and laws from \nthe New Deal. Our reform effort must not be limited in its design by \nunfounded fears and outdated philosophies. The far-reaching changes we \nare witnessing require a top-to-bottom examination of long-standing \nconventions about the way our financial system should be structured and \nregulated as we approach the 21st century. Already, banks and \ncompetitors from outside the conventional banking system are jockeying \nfor position and advantage as competition heats up for control of \nmarket share and customers in a world of electronic commerce.\n  Existing institutions that fight for legislative restrictions to \nprotect their markets are fighting the last war. Debate over financial \nmodernization that focuses primarily on issues like the future of the \nbanking franchise or gerrymandering markets through piecemeal \nlegislation to protect a particular market segment is too narrow from a \npublic policy standpoint. Such a narrow approach addresses questions \nand solves problems that existed in the 1970's and 1980's; however, the \nyear 2000 is quickly approaching and the policy debate in Congress and \namong industry leaders should be oriented toward the future. Technology \nand new financial competitors from outside the traditional arena will \nnow provide an important and new catalyst for meaningful change and \nlong overdue comprehensive financial modernization.\n  Mr. President, in its consideration of financial modernization, the \nnew Congress will need to explore a number of new and important issues, \nincluding:\n  Given all the technological changes and new players in the market, \nwhat does it mean to be a bank? Does it make sense to maintain an \nartificial distinction between banks and nonbanks? Does it make sense \nto preserve the fiction that banking and commerce are somehow separate? \nDoes it make sense to prohibit information-driven firms from owning or \naffiliating with banks now that financial services are in large part \ninformation processing activities?\n  How will the old system of deposit insurance fit into this \nenvironment? Should more complex institutions be required to give up \ndeposit insurance, as was suggested by one of the Federal Reserve Bank \npresidents?\n  How do we ensure that technology results in greater choice, lower \nfees and fair, readily available access by consumers? The experience we \nare having with ATM's raises questions about whether consumers will \nshare in the benefits of technology or whether the benefits will go \nprimarily to the owners of that technology.\n  How can we protect individual privacy now that computers make it so \neasy to collect and disseminate personal information? This is such a \nsensitive concern that the Congress directed the Federal Reserve to \nconduct a study.\n  I do not know the answers, but these are provocative questions which \nrequire careful study and debate.\n  Others are studying these issues as well.\n  Last year, Congress directed the Treasury Department to conduct a \nstudy of all issues relating to a common charter for all federally \ninsured depository institutions as part of the law stabilizing and \neventually merging the two Federal deposit insurance funds (BIF and \nSAIF) (P.L. 104-208). The Treasury Department is expected to submit \nthat study next month.\n  The Treasury Department appointed a consumer electronic payments task \nforce which will include the principal Federal agencies involved in the \npayments system.\n  In addition, the Treasury Department is completing a study on the \nstrengths and weaknesses of our financial services system in meeting \nthe needs of the system's users.\n  Most recently, Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan announced formation \nof a committee that will look at the Fed's role in the payments system \nof the future.\n\n  Mr. President, I introduce the Depository Institution Affiliation Act \nas a prelude to a vigorous debate about the future of our financial \nsystem. Let me explain how the Depository Institution Affiliation Act \n[DIAA] will make the financial system safer, more stable, and more \ncompetitive. I will submit a more detailed section-by-section \nexplanation of the bill at the end of my remarks. The bill is virtually \nidentical to legislation that I have previously sponsored or \ncosponsored in 1987 (S. 1905) and in 1989 (S. 530). In the previous \nCongress, it was S. 337. With the exception of technical and conforming \nchanges to reflect the enactment of banking laws since its original \nintroduction, the text of the bill is unchanged.\n  Mr. President, comprehensive financial modernization as proposed in \nthis reform legislation would produce many beneficial changes for all \nfinancial intermediaries.\n  First, the legislation will enable all financial intermediaries--\ncommercial banks, investment banks, thrifts, and so forth--to attract \nfinancial capital and managerial expertise by eliminating existing \nrestrictions on ownership by and affiliations among depository and \nnondepository firms. However, the DIAA preserves all the safety-and-\nsoundness and conflict-of-interest protections of the present system, \nwhile providing legal flexibility for a company to meet the financial \nneeds of consumers, businesses, and others.\n  Mr. President, some detractors of DIAA describe it as too radical \nbecause it permits these affiliations. However, this type of common \nownership is already allowed by our laws and has existed for decades \nwithout any evidence of problems. Federal law and public policy \nexpressly allows commercial companies to own and affiliate with a \nvariety of federally insured banks--for example, credit card banks, \nlimited purpose banks, trust companies, and so forth--and savings and \nloans. For example, unitary thrift holding companies have proven that \nfinance and commerce can be mixed safely. In fact, the lack of \nownership restrictions on thrifts has worked to expand the capital and \nmanagerial talent available to thrifts. And the successful record of \nunitary holding companies demonstrates that broader ownership \naffiliations can actually strengthen depository institutions through \ngreater diversification and financial strength. Moreover, the reality \nis that nonbank organizations, including telecommunications, cable \ncompanies, and software firms are designing and delivering banklike \nfinancial services and products over the Internet and World Wide Web \nwithout owning a bank.\n  Second, this bill will facilitate diversification and assure fair \ncompetition by creating a new charter alternative for all companies \ninterested in entering or diversifying in the financial services \nfield--a financial services holding company--FSHC. These FSHC's will be \nauthorized to engage in any financial activity through separately \nregulated affiliates of the holding company. The bill would permit the \nmerging of banking and commerce under carefully regulated circumstances \nby allowing a FSHC to own both a depository institution and companies \nengaged in both financial and nonfinancial activities.\n  Third, this legislation will insulate insured subsidiaries--for \nexample, banks--from the more risky business activities of its \naffiliates, as well as the parent holding company. It would not \nauthorize or allow these activities to be conducted in a bank's \noperating subsidiary.\n  Mr. President, by authorizing this alternative regulatory framework, \nthe legislation would essentially exempt a FSHC's subsidiaries and \naffiliates from those sections of the Glass-Steagall and Bank Holding \nCompany Acts that restrict mixing commercial banking with other \nfinancial--securities, investment banking, and so forth--and\n\n[[Page S1228]]\n\nnonfinancial activities--retailing, technology, manufacturing. A FSHC \nwould be able to diversify into any activity through affiliates of the \nholding company, with such affiliates subject to enhanced regulation.\n  Fourth, this bill will enhance substantially the quality and \neffectiveness of regulation through functional regulation. The \nregulation of the bank and nonbank affiliates of financial services \nholding companies would be along functional lines. The insured bank \naffiliate would be regulated by Federal and State bank regulators, the \nsecurities affiliate by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and so \non. Thus, for each affiliate, existing regulatory expertise and \nresources will be applied to protect consumers, investors, and \ntaxpayers. Functional regulation will also assure that competition in \ndiscrete products and services is fair by eliminating advantages \nattributable to current loopholes, regulatory gaps, and cost subsidies.\n  Finally, the bill would improve coordination and supervision of the \noverall financial system by permitting more effective analysis and \nmonitoring of aggregate stability and vulnerability to severe \ndisruptions and breakdown.\n  By removing unnecessary barriers to competition between providers of \nfinancial service in the United States, this legislation will permit \nU.S. capital markets to maintain their preeminence, and will allow U.S. \nfinancial intermediaries to respond to growing competition from foreign \ncompanies.\n  Mr. President, I want to underscore that the DIAA would not require \nexisting firms to alter their regulatory structure. By permitting \nfinancial services providers to become FSHC's, such providers will have \nthe option to phase gradually into, or expand within, the financial \nservices industry.\n  Mr. President, the DIAA provides a solid platform and a sound \napproach to modernizing our financial structure. I recognize that this \nbill can be improved, and I am specifically requesting constructive and \nhelpful comments to improve and to refine the major principles \nunderlying the bill. As the committee proceeds to hearings and further \nconsideration of the bill, I intend to make changes and adjustments in \norder to ensure competitive fairness, promote safety and soundness; \nachieve depositor, investor, and consumer protection; and assure \neffective and efficient functional regulation. Modernization of the \nfinancial services industry should not include the preemption of State \nconsumer protection laws.\n  Mr. President, in the absence of congressional action, the \nComptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve Board have acted to \nachieve limited modernization with results often of questionable legal \nauthority and public policy results. Specifically, I am concerned about \nthe OCC's action to permit a bank's operating subsidiaries to engage in \nactivities that are not permissible for the bank. I believe this \nregulation is unwise. And I am deeply concerned that the Comptrollers \naction may subject federally insured banks to excessive risks and \nexpose the bank insurance funds, and therefore taxpayers, to \nunnecessary liability. Congress can never forget the lessons of the \nsavings and loan crisis in the late 1980's. In addition, the Fed's \nrecent actions to increase the aggregate level of business a section 20 \nsecurities affiliate may engage in and its proposal to reduce or even \neliminate important firewalls and safeguards that have existed for over \na decade are also imprudent.\n\n  Mr. President, the rivalry between regulators to attempt unilaterally \nto set public policy and alter the competitive balance for their \nconstituencies is not wholesome or helpful. The regulators actions will \nnever be a substitute for comprehensive and balanced congressional \naction. For far too long, Congress has ceded the field to piecemeal \nderegulation by bank regulators and the courts. The time has come for \nCongress to decide on a legal and policy framework that prepares our \nfinancial institutions for the new century and the challenges of a \nrapidly changing global economy. The 105th Congress must address and \nresolve the important questions relating to the health and future of \nthe banking industry in the broader context of a financial system that \nis increasingly composed of nonbank financial service providers. We \nmust focus on the needs of our economy for credit and growth in the \nfuture and the next century. We must focus on financial stability, \nsafety and soundness, fair competition, and functional regulation of \nall financial service providers--whether they are banks, investment \nbanks, insurance companies, finance companies or even \ntelecommunications or computer companies.\n  Mr. President, the benchmark provisions, principles, and purposes of \nDIAA, as stated above, have been tested and explored over the years. \nDuring a decade of debate several studies, including a 1991 study by \nthe Treasury Department entitled, ``Modernizing the Financial System: \nRecommendations for Safer More Competitive Banks'', these principles \nand the framework of the bill have become the centerpiece of an \nemerging consensus in favor of forward-looking, balanced and prudent \napproach to modernization. I am hopeful that a new study underway by \nthe Treasury Department and due to be submitted to Congress in March \nrelated to a common bank and thrift charter will reach similar \nconclusions.\n  Mr. President, by continuing to work together, as demonstrated by the \nBIF/SAIF bill last year, the Congress and the administration can \novercome the complaints of vested interests and reform our antiquated \nfinancial services laws. We should not miss this opportunity for \nconstructive bipartisanship. I believe that this bill provides a good \nstarting point for the 105th Congress to act on financial \nmodernization. Passage of this bill will be a high priority for the \nBanking Committee. I believe this is a realistic objective.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a more detailed section-\nby-section summary of the bill be reprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n  Depository Institution Affiliation Act--Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n     Section 1: Short title\n       Section 1 provides that this Act be cited as the \n     ``Depository Institution Affiliation Act''.\n     Section 2: Findings and purpose\n       The purpose of this Act is to promote the safety and \n     soundness of the nation's financial system, to increase the \n     availability of financial products and services to consumers, \n     businesses, charitable institutions and government in an \n     efficient and cost effective manner. In addition, this Act \n     aims to promote a legal structure governing providers of \n     financial services that permits open and fair competition and \n     affords all financial services companies equal opportunity to \n     serve the full range of credit and financial needs in the \n     marketplace. This Act also aims to ensure that domestic \n     financial institutions and companies are able to compete \n     effectively in international financial markets. Finally, this \n     Act aims to regulate financial activities and companies along \n     functional lines without regard to ownership, control, or \n     affiliation.\n\n\n    TITLE I--CREATION AND CONTROL OF DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION HOLDING \n                               COMPANIES\n\n     Section 101\n       This section creates a new type of financial company, a \n     depository institution holding company (DIHC), and sets out \n     the terms and conditions under which such a company can be \n     established and must be operated.\n       Subsection (a) Definitions. This subsection defines terms \n     used in this section.\n       Paragraph (a)(1) defines a DIHC to be any company that \n     files a notice with the National Financial Services Committee \n     (see Title II of this Act) that it intends to comply with the \n     provisions of this section, and controls an insured \n     depository institution, or, either (i) has, within the \n     preceding 12 months filed a notice under subsection (b) of \n     this section to establish or acquire control of a federally \n     insured depository institution or a company owning such a \n     federal insured depository institution, or (ii) controls a \n     company which, within the preceding 12 months, has filed an \n     application for federal deposit insurance, provided that such \n     notice or application has not been disapproved by the \n     appropriate Federal banking agency or withdrawn. Any holding \n     company which elects to become a DIHC and which does not \n     control any banks that are not FDIC insured, will lose its \n     status as a bank holding company immediately upon filing the \n     notice of its election to become a DIHC. Similarly, a savings \n     and loan holding company that elects to become a DIHC will \n     lose that status upon filing the notice of its election to \n     become a DIHC. To assure that each bank controlled by a DIHC \n     would be subject to regulation and supervision by an \n     appropriate federal banking agency, owners of uninsured banks \n     would not be able to avail themselves of the opportunity to \n     become a DIHC, unless they agreed to convert such uninsured \n     banks into federally insured depository institutions.\n       Paragraph (a)(2) gives the term `bank holding company' the \n     meaning given to it in Section 2(a) of the Bank Holding \n     Company Act of 1956, as amended.\n\n[[Page S1229]]\n\n       Paragraph (a)(3) gives the term `savings and loan holding \n     company' the meaning given to it in section 10(a) of the Home \n     Owners' Loan Act.\n       Paragraph (a)(4) defines for this section, except paragraph \n     (5) of subsection (f), the term `affiliate' of a company as \n     any company which controls, is controlled by, or is under \n     common control with such a company.\n       Paragraph (a)(5) gives the term `appropriate Federal \n     banking agency' (AFBA) the meaning given to it in section 3 \n     of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.\n       Paragraph (a)(6) gives the term `insured depository \n     institution' the meaning given to it in section 3(c)(2) of \n     the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.\n       Paragraph (a)(7) gives the term `State' the meaning given \n     to it in section 3(a) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.\n       Paragraph (a)(8) defines the term `company' to mean any \n     corporation, partnership, business trust, association or \n     similar organization. However, corporations that are majority \n     owned by the Untied States or any State are excluded from the \n     definition of company.\n       Paragraph (a)(9) defines control by one company over \n     another. For purposes of this section, the term ``control'' \n     means the power, directly or indirectly, to direct the \n     management or policies of a company, or to vote 25% or more \n     of any class of voting securities of a company.\n       There are three exceptions from the definition of control. \n     These pertain to ownership of voting securities acquired or \n     held:\n       1. as agent, trustee or in some other fiduciary capacity;\n       2. as underwriter for such a period of time as will permit \n     the sale of these securities on a reasonable basis; or in \n     connection with or incidental to market making, dealing, \n     trading, brokerage or other securities-related activities, \n     provided that such shares are not acquired with a view toward \n     acquiring, exercising or transferring control of the \n     management or policies of the company;\n       3. for the purpose of securing or collection of a prior \n     debt until two years after the date of the acquisition; and\n       In addition, no company formed for the sole purpose of \n     proxy solicitation shall be deemed to be in control of \n     another company by virtue of its acquisition of the voting \n     rights of the other company's securities.\n       Paragraph (a)(10) defines the term `adequately capitalized' \n     with respect to an insured depository institution has the \n     meaning given to it in section 38(b)(1) of the Federal \n     Deposit Insurance Act.\n       Paragraph (a)(11) defines the term `well capitalized' with \n     respect to an insured depository institution has the meaning \n     given to it in section 38(b)(1)(A) of the Federal Deposit \n     Insurance Act.\n       Paragraph (a)(12) defines the term `minimum required \n     capital' with respect to an insured depository institution as \n     the amount of capital that is required to be adequately \n     capitalized.\n       Subsection (b): Changes in Control of Insured Depository \n     Institutions. This subsection provides that any DIHC wishing \n     to acquire control of an insured depository institution or \n     company owning such insured depository institution must \n     comply with the requirements of the Change in Bank Control \n     Act. Failure to comply with these requirements will subject \n     the relevant DIHC to the penalties and procedures provided in \n     subsections (i) through (m) of this section, in addition to \n     otherwise applicable penalties.\n       Subsection (c): Affiliate Transactions. This subsection \n     authorizes supplemental regulation of the transactions of \n     insured depository institutions controlled by DIHCs with \n     their affiliates. These regulations would be in addition to \n     the restrictions on interaffiliate transactions provided for \n     under sections 23A or 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. This \n     subsection gives each AFBA some flexibility to promulgate and \n     adapt rules and regulations in response to changing market \n     conditions so that the AFBA has at all times the capability \n     to prevent insured depository institutions under its \n     supervision that are controlled by DIHCs from engaging in \n     transactions that would compromise the safety and soundness \n     of such insured depository institutions or that would \n     jeopardize the deposit insurance funds.\n       Moreover, other provisions of this Act assure that the AFBA \n     will have the capability to enforce these regulations \n     vigorously (subsection (i) of this section) and that any \n     violations of these regulations will be more severely \n     punished than violations of regulations applicable to insured \n     depository institutions that are not controlled by DIHCs \n     (subsections (i), (j), (k) and (l) of this section).\n       Subparagraph (c)(1)(A) empowers the AFBA to develop rules \n     and regulations to prevent insured depository institutions \n     under its supervision that are also controlled by a DIHC from \n     engaging in unsafe or unsound practices involving the DIHC or \n     any of its affiliates, including unsafe and unsound practices \n     that may arise in connection with transactions covered by \n     sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act.\n       Subparagraph (c)(1)(B) empowers the AFBA to create certain \n     exceptions to the provisions of the preceding subparagraph, \n     if the AFBA deems that such exceptions are reasonable and in \n     the public interest and not inconsistent with the purposes of \n     this Act. These exemptions may relate to certain institutions \n     or classes of institutions, or to certain transactions or \n     classes of transactions, including transactions covered \n     under Sections 23A or 23B of the Federal Reserve Act.\n       Paragraph (c)(2) provides that any rules adopted under \n     subparagraph (c)(1)(A) shall be issued in accordance with \n     normal rulemaking procedures and shall afford interested \n     parties the opportunity to comment in writing and orally on \n     any proposed rule.\n       Paragraph (c)(3) grandfathers specific interaffiliate \n     transactions approved by a Federal regulatory agency prior to \n     the enactment of this Act, exempting them from rules and \n     regulations promulgated under subparagraph (c)(1)(A).\n       Paragraph (c)(4) makes it clear that sections 23A and 23B \n     of the Federal Reserve Act will apply to every insured \n     depository institution controlled by a depository institution \n     holding company.\n       Paragraphs (c)(5) and (c)(6) prohibit any insured \n     depository institution in a DIHC from extending credit to or \n     purchasing the assets of a securities affiliate and providing \n     other types of financial support to that DIHC's securities \n     affiliate except for daylight overdrafts that relate to U.S. \n     government securities transactions if the daylight overdrafts \n     are fully collateralized by U.S. government securities as to \n     principal and interest.\n       Paragraph (c)(7) prohibits insured depository institutions \n     in a DIHC from issuing various guarantees for the enhancement \n     of the marketability of a securities issue underwritten or \n     distributed by a securities affiliate of that DIHC.\n       Paragraph (c)(8) prohibits insured depository institutions \n     in a DIHC from extending credit secured by or for the \n     purposes of purchasing any security during an underwriting \n     period of for 30 days thereafter where a securities affiliate \n     of such institution participates as an underwritten or member \n     of a selling group.\n       Paragraph (c)(9) prohibits insured depository institutions \n     in a DIHC from extending credit to an issuer of securities \n     underwritten by a securities affiliate for the purpose of \n     paying the principal of those securities or interest for \n     dividends on those securities.\n       Paragraph (c)(10) defines ``securities affiliate'' for the \n     purposes of paragraphs (c)(5), (6), (7), (8) and (9).\n       Subsection (d): Capitalization. This subsection regulates \n     the capitalization of insured depository institutions that \n     are controlled by a DIHC.\n       Paragraph (d)(1) requires that insured depository \n     institutions controlled by a DIHC be well capitalized.\n       Paragraph (d)(2) provides that if the AFBA finds that an \n     insured depository institution subsidiary of a DIHC is not \n     well capitalized, the DIHC shall have thirty days to reach \n     an agreement with the AFBA concerning how and according to \n     what schedule the insured depository institution will \n     bring its minimum capital back into conference with \n     requirements. During that time the insured depository \n     institution shall operate under the close supervision of \n     the AFBA.\n       In the event that the DIHC does not reach an agreement \n     within thirty days with the AFBA on how and according to what \n     schedule the capital of the insured depository institution \n     will be replenished, the DIHC will be required to divest the \n     insured depository institution in an orderly manner within a \n     period of six months, or such additional period of time as \n     the AFBA may determine is reasonably required in order to \n     effect such divestiture.\n       Paragraph (d)(3) states that in view of the enhanced \n     regulatory control over insured depository institutions \n     controlled by DIHCs, no AFBA may regulate the capital of the \n     DIHC. Thus, no AFBA may require the DIHC itself to enter into \n     any other agreement regarding the maintenance of capital in \n     its insured depository institution affiliates. The capital of \n     the DIHC would, however, be regulated by any other agency \n     having jurisdiction over it. For example, if the DIHC were \n     also a registered broker/dealer, it would have to conform to \n     the minimum capital requirements mandated by the SEC.\n       Subsection (e): Interstate Acquisitions and Activities of \n     Insured Depository Institutions. This subsection subjects \n     interstate acquisitions of an insured depository institution \n     by a DIHC to the same restrictions as those applicable to \n     bank holding companies under section 3(d) of the Bank Holding \n     Company Act of 1956, as amended, and it subjects interstate \n     acquisitions of savings associations by a DIHC to the same \n     restrictions as those applicable to savings and loan holding \n     companies.\n       Subsection (f): Differential Treatment Prohibition; Laws \n     Inconsistent with this Act. This subsection does two things. \n     First, it prohibits adversely differential treatment of DIHCs \n     and their affiliates, including their insured depository \n     institution affiliates, except as this Act specifically \n     provides. Second, this subsection ensures that state and \n     federal initiatives do not undermine achievement of the \n     purposes of this Act. Whether couched as affiliation, \n     licensing or agency restrictions or as constraints on access \n     to state courts, such laws effectively perpetuate market \n     barriers and deny consumers the opportunity to choose between \n     different financial products and services.\n       Paragraph (f)(1) notwithstanding any other federal law, \n     prohibits states from enacting laws that discriminate against \n     DIHCs or against their affiliates, including their insured \n     depository institution affiliates. This paragraph also \n     prohibits, notwithstanding any other federal law, federal and \n     state regulatory agencies from discriminating by rule, \n     regulation, order or any other means against DIHCs or against \n     their affiliates, including\n\n[[Page S1230]]\n\n     their insured depository institution affiliates, except as \n     this Act specifically provides. This is intended to assure \n     that the primary purpose of this Act--the enhancement of \n     competition in the depository institution sector--will be \n     fulfilled.\n       Paragraph (f)(2) finds that certain State affiliation and \n     licensing laws restrain legitimate competition in interstate \n     commerce, deny consumers freedom of choice in selecting an \n     insured depository institution and threaten the long-term \n     safety and soundness of insured depository institutions by \n     limiting their access to capital.\n       Accordingly, with the exception of certain laws related to \n     insurance and real estate brokerage which are treated in \n     Subsection (g), this paragraph preempts any provision of \n     federal or state law, rule, regulation or order that is \n     expressly or impliedly inconsistent with the provisions of \n     this section. The preempted statutes include state banking, \n     savings and loan, securities, finance company, retail or \n     other laws which restrict the affiliation of insured \n     depository institutions or their owners, agents, principals, \n     brokers, directors, officers, employees or other \n     representatives with other firms. Similarly, laws prohibiting \n     cross marketing of products and services are preempted \n     insofar as such cross marketing activities are conducted by \n     DIHCs, their affiliates, or by any agent, principal, broker, \n     director, officer, employee or other representative. By \n     contrast, nondiscriminatory state approval, examination, \n     supervisory, regulatory, reporting, licensing, and similar \n     requirements are not affected.\n       Paragraph (f)(3) removes a common uncertainty under state \n     licensing and qualification to do business statutes, which \n     leaves an out-of-state insured depository institution's \n     access to another state's courts unresolved. Under this \n     provision, so long as such an insured depository institution \n     limits its activities to those which do not constitute the \n     establishment or operation of a ``domestic branch'' of an \n     insured depository institution in that other state, it can \n     qualify to maintain or defend in that state's court any \n     action which could be maintained or defended by a company \n     which is not an insured depository institution and is not \n     located in that state, subject to the same filing, fee and \n     other conditions as may be imposed on such a company. This \n     paragraph is not intended to grant states any power that they \n     do not currently have to regulate the activities of out-of-\n     state insured depository institutions.\n       Paragraph (f)(4) makes clear that a state, except subject \n     to the provisions of this Act, may not impede or prevent any \n     insured depository institution affiliated with a DIHC or any \n     DIHC or affiliate thereof from marketing products and \n     services in that state by utilizing and compensating its \n     agents, solicitors, brokers, employees and other persons \n     located in that state and representing such a insured \n     depository institution, company, or affiliate. However, to \n     the extent such persons are performing loan origination, \n     deposit solicitation or other activities in which an insured \n     depository institution may engage, those activities cannot \n     constitute the establishment or operation of a ``domestic \n     branch'' at any location other than the main or branch \n     offices of the insured depository institution.\n       Paragraph (f)(5) contains a special definition of \n     ``affiliate'' and ``control'' for purposes of paragraphs (2) \n     through (4) this subsection only. Control is deemed to occur \n     where a person or entity owns or has the power to vote 10% of \n     the voting securities of another entity or where a person or \n     entity directly or indirectly determines the management or \n     policies of another entity or person. Unlike the definition \n     of affiliate set forth in paragraph (4) of subsection (a), \n     this definition encompasses not only corporate affiliations \n     but affiliations between corporations and individuals.\n       Subsection (q): Securities, Insurance and Real Estate \n     Activities of Insured Depository Institutions. In order to \n     facilitate functional regulation of the activities of DIHCs \n     this section prohibits insured depository institutions \n     controlled by DIHCs from conducting certain securities, \n     insurance and real estate activities currently permissible \n     for some insured depository institutions.\n       Subparagraph (g)(1)(A) provides that no insured depository \n     institution controlled by a DIHC shall directly engage in \n     dealing in or underwriting securities, or purchasing or \n     selling securities as agent, except to the extent such \n     activities are performed with regard to obligations of the \n     United States or are the type of activities that could be \n     performed by a national bank's trust department (12 U.S.C. \n     92a).\n       Subparagraph (g)(1)(B) provides that no insured depository \n     institution controlled by a DIHC shall directly engage in \n     insurance underwriting.\n       Subparagraph (g)(1)(C) provides that no insured depository \n     institution controlled by a DIHC shall directly engage in \n     real estate investment or development except insofar as these \n     activities are incidental to the insured depository \n     institution's investment in or operation of its own premises, \n     result from foreclosure on collateral securing a loan, or are \n     the type of activities that could be performed by a national \n     bank's trust department.\n       Paragraph (g)(2) clarifies that nothing in this subsection \n     shall be construed to prohibit or impede a DIHC or any of its \n     affiliates (other than an insured depository institution) \n     from engaging in any of the activities set forth in paragraph \n     (1) or to prohibit an employee of an insured depository \n     institution that is an affiliate of a DIHC from offering or \n     marketing products or services of an affiliate of such an \n     insured depository institution as set forth in paragraph (1).\n       Paragraph (g)(3), however, contains significant limits on \n     DIHC entry into the businesses of insurance agency and real \n     estate brokerage. No DIHC could enter these fields de novo. \n     Rather, they would have to purchase either an insurance \n     agency or real estate brokerage business which had been in \n     business for at least five years prior to passage of the Act.\n       Paragraph (g)(4) provides that nothing in this subsection \n     will require the breach of a contract entered into prior to \n     enactment of this Act.\n       Subsection (h): Tying and Insider Lender Provisions. This \n     section subjects DIHCs to the tying provisions of section 106 \n     of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 and to the \n     insider lending prohibitions of section 22(h) of the Federal \n     Reserve Act. These sections prohibit tying between products \n     and services offered by insured depository institutions and \n     products and services offered by the DIHC itself or by any \n     of its other affiliates. Note, however, that these tying \n     provisions do not apply to products and services that do \n     not involve an insured depository institution. The insider \n     lending provisions severely limit loans by an insured \n     depository institution to officers and directors of the \n     insured depository institution. For purposes of both \n     provisions, the AFBA will exercise the rulemaking \n     authority vested in the Federal Reserve with regard to \n     these limitations.\n       Subsection (i): Examination and Enforcement. This \n     subsection provides that the AFBA shall use its examination \n     and supervision authority to enforce the provisions of this \n     section, including any rules and regulations promulgated \n     under subsection (c). In particular, it is intended that each \n     AFBA should structure its examination process so as to \n     uncover possible violations of the provisions of this section \n     and that the agency should not hesitate to make full use of \n     its cease-and-desist powers or to impose as warranted the \n     special penalties discussed below, if it believes that an \n     insured depository institution under its supervision that is \n     controlled by a DIHC is in violation of any provisions of \n     this section.\n       This subsection also grants the AFBA authority to examine \n     any other affiliate of the DIHC as well as the DIHC itself in \n     order to ensure compliance with the limitations of this \n     section or other provisions of law made applicable by this \n     section such as sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve \n     Act.\n       In addition, this subsection grants each AFBA the right to \n     apply to the appropriate district court of the United States \n     for a temporary or permanent injunction or a restraining \n     order to enjoin any person or company from violation of the \n     provisions of this section or any regulation prescribed under \n     this section. The AFBA may seek such an injunction or \n     restraining order whenever it considers that an insured \n     depository institution under its supervision or any DIHC \n     controlling such an insured depository institution is \n     violating, has violated or is about to violate any provision \n     of this section or any regulation prescribed under this \n     section. In seeking such an injunction or restraining order \n     the AFBA may also request such equitable relief as may be \n     necessary to prevent the violation in question. This relief \n     may include a requirement that the DIHC divest itself of \n     control of the insured depository institution, if this is the \n     only way in which the violation can be prevented.\n       This injunctive power will enable the AFBA to move speedily \n     to stop practices that it believes endanger the safety and \n     soundness of an insured depository institution under its \n     supervision that is controlled by a DIHC. If necessary to \n     protect the depositors and safeguard the deposit insurance \n     funds, the AFBA may request that the injunction proceedings \n     be held in camera, so as not to provoke a run on the insured \n     depository institution.\n       Subsection (j): Divestiture. This subsection states that an \n     AFBA may require a DIHC to divest itself of an insured \n     depository institution, if the agency finds that the insured \n     depository institution is engaging in a continuing course of \n     action involving the DIHC or any of its affiliates that would \n     endanger the safety and soundness of that insured depository \n     institution. Although the DIHC would have the right to a \n     hearing and to judicial review and have one year in which to \n     divest the insured depository institution, it should be \n     emphasized that the insured depository institution would \n     operate under the close supervision of the AFBA from the \n     date of the initial order until the date the divestiture \n     is completed. This is intended to safeguard the insured \n     depository institution in question, its depositors and the \n     deposit insurance funds.\n       Subsection (k): Criminal Penalties: This subsection \n     provides for criminal penalties for knowing and willful \n     violations of the provisions of this section, even if these \n     violations do not result in an initial or final order \n     requiring divestiture of the insured depository institution. \n     For companies found to be in violation of the provisions of \n     this section the maximum penalty shall be the greater of (a) \n     $250,000 per day for each day that the violation continues or \n     (b) one percent of the minimum required capital of the \n     insured depository institution per day for each day that the \n     violation continues, up to a maximum of 10% of the minimum \n     capital of the insured depository institution--a fine that\n\n[[Page S1231]]\n\n     could amount to tens of millions of dollars for a large \n     insured depository institution. Such a fine is designed to be \n     large enough to deter even large insured depository \n     institutions from violating the provisions of this section.\n       For individuals found to be in violation of the provisions \n     of this section the penalty shall be a fine and/or a prison \n     term. The maximum fine shall be the greater of (a) $250,000 \n     or (b) twice the individual's annual rate of total \n     compensation at the time the violation occurred. The maximum \n     prison sentence shall be one year. In addition, individuals \n     violating the provisions of this section will also be subject \n     to the penalties provided for in Section 1005 of Title 18 for \n     false entries in any book, report or statement to the extent \n     that the violation included such false entries.\n       A DIHC and its affiliates shall also be subject to the \n     Criminal penalties provisions of the Financial Institutions \n     Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 and the \n     Comprehensive Thrift and Bank Fraud Prosecution and Taxpayer \n     Recovery Act of 1990 to the same extent as a registered bank \n     holding company, savings and loan holding company or any \n     affiliate of such companies.\n       Subsection (1): Civil Enforcement, Cease-and-Desist Orders, \n     Civil Money Penalties. This subsection provides for civil \n     enforcement, cease-and-desist orders and civil money \n     penalties consistent with subsections (b) through (s) and \n     subsection (u) of section 1818 of Title 123 for any company \n     or person that violates the provisions of this section in the \n     same manner as they apply to a state member insured bank, and \n     grants the AFBA the power to impose such penalties after \n     providing the company or person accused of such violation the \n     opportunity to object in writing to its finding.\n       Subsection (m): Judicial Review. This subsection provides \n     for judicial review of decisions reached by an AFBA under the \n     provisions of this section. This right to review includes a \n     right of judicial review of statutes, rules, regulations, \n     orders and other actions that would discriminate against \n     DIHCs or affiliates controlled by such companies.\n     Section 102: Amendment to the Bank Holding Company Act of \n         1956\n       This section contains a conforming amendment to the \n     definition of the term ``bank'' in the Bank Holding Company \n     Act to ensure that a DIHC owning an insured depository \n     institution will be regulated under this Act rather than \n     the Bank Holding Company Act.\n     Section 103: Amendments to the Federal Reserve Act\n       This section clarifies the application of Section 23A of \n     the Federal Reserve Act to certain loans and extensions of \n     credit to persons who are not affiliated with a member bank. \n     Section 23A contains a provision that was intended to prevent \n     the use of ``straw man'' intermediaries to evade section \n     23A's limitations on loans and extensions of credit to \n     affiliates. Contrary to its original purpose, the provision \n     may also be literally read to restrict a bona fide loan or \n     extension of credit to a third party who happens to use the \n     proceeds to purchase goods or services from an affiliate of \n     the insured depository institution; such a loan could occur, \n     for example, if a customer happened to use a credit card \n     issued by an insured depository institution to buy an item \n     sold by the insured depository institution's affiliate. This \n     section clarifies that such loans and extensions of credit \n     are not covered by section 23A as long as (i) the insured \n     depository institution approves them in accordance with \n     substantially the same standards and procedures and on \n     substantially the same terms that it applies to similar loans \n     or extensions of credit that do not involve the payment of \n     the proceeds to an affiliate, and (ii) the loans or \n     extensions of credit are not made for the purpose of evading \n     any requirement of section 23A.\n     Section 104: Amendments to the Banking Act of 1933\n       Subsection (a) amends section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act \n     so that it does not apply to member banks that are controlled \n     by DIHCs.\n       Subsection (b) amends section 32 of the Glass-Steagall Act \n     so that it does not apply to officers, directors and \n     employees of affiliates of a single depository institution \n     holding company.\n     Section 105: Amendment to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act\n       This section amends the Change in Bank Control Act to \n     provide that an acquisition of a DIHC controlling an insured \n     depository institution may only be accomplished after \n     complying with that Act's procedures. It also modifies the \n     definition of ``control'' in the Change in Savings and Loan \n     Control Act to conform it to the definition in section \n     101(a)(9) of this Act.\n     Section 106: Amendment to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\n       This section amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to \n     provide for the registration and regulation of Broker \n     Dealers.\n     Section 107: Amendment to the Home Owners' Loan Act\n       This section amends section 11 of the Home Owners' Loan Act \n     in order to apply Section 101(c)(1)(B) of this section to \n     savings associations.\n     Section 108: Amendment to the Community Reinvestment Act\n       This section amends the Community Reinvestment Act to make \n     it applicable to acquisitions of insured depository \n     institutions by DIHC's.\n\n\n                   TITLE II--SUPERVISORY IMPROVEMENTS\n\n     Section 201: National Financial Services Committee\n       This section establishes a standing committee, the National \n     Financial Services Oversight Committee (Committee), in order \n     to provide a forum in which federal and state regulators can \n     reach a consensus regarding how the regulation of insured \n     depository institutions should evolve in response to changing \n     market conditions. In addition, the Committee also provides a \n     mechanism through which various federal regulatory agencies \n     could coordinate their responses to a financial crisis, if \n     such a crisis were to occur. The Committee comprises all \n     federal agencies responsible for regulating financial \n     institutions or financial activities, and it is structured to \n     allow state regulators to participate in its deliberations.\n       The Committee consists of the Chairman of the Secretary of \n     the Treasury, who is also the Chairman of the Committee, the \n     Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n     System, the Chairman of the FDIC, the Director of the Office \n     of Thrift Supervision, the Comptroller of the Currency, the \n     Secretary of Commerce, the Attorney General, the Chairman of \n     the SEC, and the Chairman of the CFTC.\n       The Committee is directed to report to Congress within one \n     year of enactment of this Act on proposed legislative or \n     regulatory actions that will improve the examination process \n     to permit better oversight of all insured depository \n     institutions. It is also directed to establish uniform \n     principles and standards for examinations.\n\n\n                               TITLE III\n\n     Section 301: Effective date\n       The Act will become effective on the date of enactment.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Depository \nInstitution Affiliation Act, which has been drafted by Senate Banking \nCommittee Chairman Alfonse D'Amato. This landmark piece of legislation \nwill modernize the archaic laws that govern our financial services \nindustry. Passage of this legislation will benefit consumers, increase \nthe availability of venture capital for job creation, and bolster the \ninternational competitiveness of America's financial services industry.\n  There is a clear need to modernize the outdated laws that govern \nAmerica's financial services industry, because financial services play \na vital role in our daily lives. We take out loans to go to college, to \nbuy a car, and to purchase a home. We buy insurance to provide greater \nsecurity to ourselves and our families. We make investments throughout \nour life so that we may retire in comfort and dignity.\n  Today, technological advancements and increased innovation in the \ndelivery of financial services make it easier than ever for consumers \nto get loans, purchase insurance, and invest their earnings. \nUnfortunately, our archaic and burdensome laws governing financial \ninstitutions continue to discourage, rather than encourage, such \nadvancement and innovation.\n  The laws to which I am referring are not those governing the safety \nand soundness of financial institutions, such as setting minimum \ncapital requirements or requiring periodic oversight by Federal or \nState regulators. Safety and soundness laws and regulations are \nbeneficial and necessary, as they enhance the security of the consumer \nwhenever he or she deposits money in a bank or purchases an insurance \npolicy.\n  The outdated laws to which I am referring are the laws that create \nbarriers to competition by artificially compartmentalizing the three \nmajor sectors of financial services--banking, securities, and \ninsurance. For example, under the Banking Act of 1933, more commonly \nknown as the Glass-Steagall Act, banks are generally barred from \ndirectly investing in corporate securities, underwriting new corporate \nissues or sponsoring mutual funds. Under the Bank Holding Company Act \nof 1956, securities underwriters, insurance underwriters, and \nnonfinancial companies are generally prohibited from owning banks or \nbeing owned by a bank holding company.\n  These outdated financial institution laws hurt consumers by \nartificially increasing the costs of financial services, reducing the \navailability of financial products, and reducing the level of \nconvenience in the delivery of financial services. These laws hurt \nsmall businesses--an engine of job growth in the American economy--by \nartifically limiting the amount of equity capital available for \nexpanded activity. These\n\n[[Page S1232]]\n\nlaws weaken the international competitiveness of America's financial \ninstitutions by prohibiting them from offering the range of financial \nservices that foreign financial institutions may offer.\n\n  It should be noted that the Glass-Steagall Act--which created the \ncompartmentalized structure of financial services that we have today--\nwas based upon the false premise that the massive amount of bank \nfailures that occurred during the Great Depression was caused by the \nsecurities activities that these banks conducted. However, just the \nopposite is true: Diversification in financial services actually \nincreased the safety and soundness of the banks. Between 1929 and 1933, \n26.3 percent of all national banks failed. However, the failure rate \nfor those banks that conducted securities activities was lower. Of the \nnational banks in 1929 that either had securities affiliates or had \ninternal bond departments, only 7.2 percent had failed by 1933. The \nmessage from these statistics is clear: We should encourage competition \nand diversification, not discourage it.\n  Last year, Congress passed a bipartisan and comprehensive legislative \ninitiative to reform the Telecommunications Act and stimulate \ncompetition and innovation in the telecommunications industry. Similar \naction is needed this year to stimulate the growth and global \ncompetitiveness of our financial services industry.\n  The Depository Institution Affiliation Act creates a new Financial \nServices Holding Company structure that will permit banks, thrifts, \nsecurities companies and insurance companies to affiliate and cross-\nmarket their products. This structure will do this while maintaining \nconsumer protections and the safety and soundness of the Federal \ndeposit insurance system.\n  This legislation will greatly benefit consumers. The D'Amato bill's \ntermination of affiliation restrictions will significantly increase \ncompetition in the financial services industry. Consumers' costs in the \npurchase of insurance, securities and banking products will be lowered. \nThe bill's termination of crossmarketing restrictions will increase \nconsumer convenience, as consumers will be able to do one-stop shopping \nfor all of their financial services needs. The D'Amato bill does all of \nthis while maintaining the statues and regulations that protect \nconsumers from fraud and discrimination.\n  This legislation will maintain the safety and soundness of the \nFederal deposit insurance system. The D'Amato bill protects banks from \nbeing affected by affiliate and holding company insolvency by \nimplementing firewalls that prohibit affiliates from raiding the \ninsured bank. As added protection, it requires that if a bank becomes \nanything less than satisfactorily capitalized, the Financial Services \nHolding Company must immediately divest of the bank.\n  This legislation will provide for competitive equality among all \nfinancial services providers. Its provisions have been carefully \ncrafted to provide a level playing field for banks, thrifts, securities \ncompanies and insurance companies. This charter up approach will permit \nall of these companies to become Financial Services Holding Companies, \nand will not prevent current financial institutions from conducting any \nactivities that they currently conduct.\n  In closing, I look forward to supporting Chairman D'Amato in his \nefforts to pass financial modernization legislation. It is my hope that \n1997 will be the year that we join together and create a bipartisan \nbill that will reform our laws so that America's financial institutions \nwill be able to compete, innovate and grow to meet the challenges of \nthe 21st century.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Levin, Mr. \n        Inouye, Mr. Coverdell, and Mr. Abraham):\n  S. 299. A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins \nin commemoration of the sesquicentennial of the birth of Thomas Alva \nEdison, to redesign the half dollar circulating coin for 1997 to \ncommemorate Thomas Edison, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n     THE THOMAS ALVA EDISON SESQUICENTENNIAL COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of Senators DeWine, \nLevin, Inouye, Coverdell, Abraham, and myself, to introduce legislation \nthat would direct the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins \ncommemorating the 150th anniversary of Thomas Alva Edison's birth. The \nintroduction of this legislation today, February 11, is significant \nbecause Thomas Edison was born 150 years ago.\n  Mr. President, few Americans have had a greater impact on our Nation, \nand our world, than Thomas Edison. He produced more than 1,300 \ninventions, including the incandescent light bulb, the alkaline \nbattery, the phonograph, and motion pictures.\n  In 1928, the Congress saw fit to award to Mr. Edison a Congressional \nGold Medal ``for development and application of inventions that have \nrevolutionized civilization in the last century.'' The legislation I am \nintroducing today would once again honor one of the world's greatest \ninventors by issuing both commemorative and circulating coins with Mr. \nEdison's likeness.\n  These coins not only would honor the memory of Thomas Edison, they \nwould also raise revenue to support organizations that preserve his \nlegacy. The two New Jersey Edison sites, the ``invention factory'' in \nWest Orange and the Edison Memorial Tower in Edison, are both in need \nof repair. Irreplaceable records and priceless memorabilia are in \ndanger of being destroyed because of moisture damage and structural \nproblems. Each year, 9,000 young students visit the West Orange site to \nlearn about the great inventor. Our legislation, at no cost to the \nGovernment, would provide the funds necessary to protect these and five \nother historical sites so that generations of schoolchildren can \ncontinue to visit them.\n  Let me emphasize that this legislation would have no net cost to the \nGovernment. In fact, because circulating coins are a source of \nGovernment revenue known as seigniorage, this bill would reduce \nGovernment borrowing requirements, thereby lowering the annual interest \npayments on the national debt. An Edison commemorative coin program \nalso has strong support among America's numismatists, whose interest is \ncrucial to the success of any coin program.\n  Mr. President, I introduced similar legislation at the end of the \n104th Congress. I introduce it again on the 150th birthday of this \ngreat American inventor with the anticipation that my colleagues will \njoin me in honoring the memory of Thomas Alva Edison while providing \nsorely needed funds to important historical sites.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and ask unanimous \nconsent that a copy of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 299\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Thomas Alva Edison \n     Sesquicentennial Commemorative Coin Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) Thomas Alva Edison, one of America's greatest \n     inventors, was born on February 11, 1847, in Milan, Ohio;\n       (2) the inexhaustible energy and genius of Thomas A. Edison \n     produced more than 1,300 inventions in his lifetime, \n     including the incandescent light bulb and the phonograph;\n       (3) in 1928, Thomas A. Edison received the Congressional \n     gold medal ``for development and application of inventions \n     that have revolutionized civilization in the last century''; \n     and\n       (4) 1997 will mark the sesquicentennial of the birth of \n     Thomas A. Edison.\n                      TITLE I--COMMEMORATIVE COINS\n\n     SEC. 101. COIN SPECIFICATIONS.\n\n       (a) Denominations.--In commemoration of the \n     sesquicentennial of the birth of Thomas A. Edison, the \n     Secretary of the Treasury (hereafter in this Act referred to \n     as the ``Secretary'') shall mint and issue--\n       (1) not more than 350,000 $1 coins, each of which shall--\n       (A) weigh 26.73 grams;\n       (B) have a diameter of 1.500 inches; and\n       (C) contain 90 percent silver and 10 percent copper; and\n       (2) not more than 350,000 half dollar coins, each of which \n     shall--\n       (A) weigh 12.50 grams;\n       (B) have a diameter of 1.205 inches; and\n       (C) contain 90 percent silver and 10 percent copper.\n       (b) Legal Tender.--The coins minted under this title shall \n     be legal tender, as provided in section 5103 of title 31, \n     United States Code.\n\n[[Page S1233]]\n\n       (c) Numismatic Items.--For purposes of section 5134 of \n     title 31, United States Code, all coins minted under this \n     title shall be considered to be numismatic items.\n\n     SEC. 102.

A bill to prohibit the use of certain assistance provided \nunder the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to encourage \nplant closings and the resultant relocation of employment, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n\n\n        The Prohibition of Incentives for Relocation Act of 1997\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I introduce legislation to \naddress an important and timely issue for the citizens of my State of \nWisconsin, and for others all over our Nation--the issue of job piracy.\n  Last month, officials in the State of Michigan announced a new \ninitiative designed to lure businesses from other States into their own \nborders. Businesses are provided a tempting incentive to relocate \nthere, tax-free status for 15 years, if they relocate to select regions \nof the State. The communications director for the Michigan Jobs \nCommission, Jim Tobin, was quoted in the Wisconsin State Journal as \nsaying that the new so-called renaissance zones program ``will \naggressively pursue Wisconsin companies for relocation into Michigan.'' \nPresumably, other States bordering Michigan will be targeted as well.\n  I was extremely disappointed to hear that my neighboring State had \nchosen to blatantly target Wisconsin jobs, rather than focusing its \nenergies on creating new jobs for its residents. In my opinion, \neconomic development ought not be thought of as a zero-sum game. We \nlive in an era of increasing economic interdependence, and responsible \nelected officials should be focusing on regional and national solutions \nto the crises in our States' most economically distressed areas, not on \nraiding each others' jobs.\n  Upon hearing of the new Michigan initiative, my colleagues Senator \nKohl and Congressman Tom Barrett and I requested investigations from \nseveral Federal agencies in order to ascertain whether and to what \ndegree Federal funds are being used to finance the renaissance zones \ninitiative. We feel strongly that our constituents' tax dollars should \nnot have to help finance the efforts of those across State lines who \nattempt to steal their jobs.\n  Fortunately, most Federal economic development grant programs, such \nas those funded by the Small Business Administration and the Economic \nDevelopment Administration, currently include antipiracy language. \nHowever,\n\n[[Page S1234]]\n\nthis important anti-piracy provision is conspicuously absent in the \nCommunity Development Block Grant [CDBG] Program and several other \nsmall programs administered by the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopmen [HUD].\n  Today, Senator Kohl and I are introducing the Prohibition of \nIncentives for Relocation Act of 1997, a bill we have introduced \npreviously, in both the 103d and 104th Congresses. It would simply make \nthe CDBG, HUD special purpose grants, and HUD economic development \ngrants consistent with other domestic economic development grant \nprograms, by prohibiting HUD funds from being used for activities that \nare intended, or likely to facilitate, the closing of an industrial or \ncommercial plant, or the substantial reduction of operations of a \nplant; and result in the relocation or expansion of a plant from one \narea to another area. Identical legislation is being introduced in the \nHouse by Representative Barrett and Representative Kleczka.\n  We became aware of this problem in the way the CDBG language is \ncurrently drafted several years ago. In 1994, Briggs and Stratton, one \nof Wisconsin's major employers, announced that its Milwaukee plant \nwould be closing. As a result, over 2,000 jobs at the plant were lost. \nThe total economic impact on the community was even worse: For every \nfour Briggs jobs lost, an estimated one additional job from a supplier \nor other business that relied on Briggs was lost.\n  At the same time as the Milwaukee closing, Briggs and Stratton \nexpanded two of its plants in other States. I do not dispute its right \nto do so. But what I find objectionable, Mr. President, is that Federal \ndollars, CDBG funds, were used to facilitate the transfer of these jobs \nfrom one State to another. This was, in my opinion, a completely \ninappropriate use of Federal funds. The Community Development Block \nGrant Program is designed to expand employment opportunities and \neconomic growth, not simply move jobs from one community to another. \nThere is no way to justify to my constituents that they are sending \ntheir tax dollars to Washington to be distributed to other States in \norder to attract jobs out of our State, leaving behind communities \nwhose economic stability has been destroyed.\n  Mr. President, it is not clear if CDBG dollars are being used by the \nState of Michigan to finance their piracy of jobs from my State and \nfrom our other Midwestern neighbors. But in any event, the statute \nshould be revised to prohibit such usage. It is an issue of fairness, \nand it deserves our attention. I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 300\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to set \naside up to $2 per person from park entrance fees or assess up to $2 \nper person visiting the Grand Canyon or other national park to secure \nbonds for capital improvements to the park, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                       NATIONAL PARKS LEGISLATION\n\n   Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that would allow \nus to make desperately needed improvements within America's national \nparks.\n  The National Parks Capital Improvements Act of 1997 would allow \nprivate fundraising organizations to enter into agreements with the \nSecretary of the Interior to issue taxable capital development bonds. \nBond revenues would then be used to finance park improvement projects. \nThe bonds would be secured by an entrance fee surcharge of up to $2 per \nvisitor at participating parks, or a set-aside of up to $2 per visitor \nfrom current entrance fees.\n  Our national park system has enormous capital needs--by last \nestimate, over $3 billion for high priority projects such as improved \ntransportation systems, trail repairs, visitor facilities, historic \npreservation, and the list goes on and on. The unfortunate reality is \nthat even under the rosiest budget scenarios our growing park needs far \noutstrip the resources currently available.\n  A good example of this funding gap is at Grand Canyon National Park. \nThe park's recently approved park management plan calls for over $300 \nmillion in capital improvements, including a desperately needed \ntransportation system to reduce congestion. Despite this enormous need \nfor funding, the Grand Canyon received only $12 million from the \nFederal Government last year for operating costs. The gap is as wide as \nthe Grand Canyon itself. Clearly, we must find a new way to finance \npark needs.\n  Revenue bonding would take us a long way toward meeting our needs \nwithin the national park system. Based on current visitation rates at \nthe Grand Canyon, a $2 surcharge would enable us to raise $100 million \nfrom a bond issue amortized over 20 years. That is a significant amount \nof money which we could use to accomplish many critical park projects.\n  I want to emphasize, however, the Grand Canyon would not be the only \npark eligible to benefit from this legislation. Any park unit with \ncapital needs in excess of $5 million is eligible to participate. Among \neligible parks, the Secretary of the Interior will determine which may \ntake part in the program.\n  I also want to stress that only projects approved as part of a park's \ngeneral management plan can be funded through bond revenue. This \nproviso eliminates any concern that the revenue could be used for \nprojects of questionable value to the park.\n\n[[Page S1235]]\n\n  In addition, only organizations under agreement with the Secretary \nwill be authorized to administer the bonding, so the Secretary can \nestablish any rules or policies he deems necessary and appropriate.\n  Under no circumstances, however would, investors be able to attach \nliens against Federal property in the very unlikely event of default. \nThe bonds will be secured only by the surcharge revenues.\n  Finally, the bill specifies that all professional standards apply and \nthat the issues are subject to the same laws, rules, and regulatory \nenforcement procedures as any other bond issue.\n  The most obvious question raised by this legislation is: Will the \nbond markets support park improvement issues, guaranteed by an entrance \nsurcharge? The answer is yes, emphatically. Americans are eager to \ninvest in our Nation's natural heritage, and with park visitation \ngrowing stronger, the risks would appear minimal. For example, a recent \nWashington Times editorial printed on December 8, 1996, noted that park \nvisitation has increased to nearly 280 million since 1983, so that now \nmore than a quarter of a million people visit our national parks every \nyear. That editorial went on to point out that attendance is expected \nto further increase to well over 300 million by the turn of the \ncentury.\n  Are park visitors willing to pay a little more at the entrance gate \nif the money is used for park improvements? Again, yes. Time and time \nagain, visitors have expressed their support for increased fees \nprovided that the revenue is used where collected and not diverted for \nsome other purpose devised by Congress.\n  With the fee demonstration program currently being implemented at \nparks around the Nation, an additional $2 surcharge may not be \nnecessary or appropriate at certain parks. Under the bill, those parks \ncould choose to dedicate $2 per park visitor from current entrance fees \ntoward a bond issue.\n  Finally, I want to point out that the bill will not cost the Treasury \nany money? On the contrary, it will result in a net increase in Federal \nrevenue. First, the bonds will be fully taxable. Second, making \ndesperately needed improvements sooner rather than later will reduce \ntotal project costs.\n  Mr. President, this legislation seeks to use park entrance fees to \ntheir fullest potential through bonds. I appreciate that some details \nmay remain to be worked out in this bill and I encourage the \nadministration and other interested groups to work with me to fine tune \nthis legislation. But, I believe that use of revenue bonds to pay the \nstaggering costs for capital improvements within our parks is an idea \nwhose time has come.\n  America has been blessed with a rich natural heritage. The National \nPark Service Organic Act, which created the National Park Service, \nenjoins us to protect our precious natural resources for future \ngenerations and to provide for their enjoyment by the American people. \nThe National Parks Capital Improvements Act must pass if we are to \nsuccessfully fulfill the enduring responsibilities of stewardship with \nwhich we have been vested. I urge my colleagues to support me in this \nimportant effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that copies of letters supporting this \nlegislation from the Environmental Defense Fund, the National Trust for \nHistoric Preservation, the Grand Canyon Fund, the National Park \nFoundation, the Grand Canyon Trust, the Friends of Acadia, Mount \nRainier, North Cascades & Olympic Fund and the Rocky Mountain National \nPark Associates, Inc., be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Rocky Mountain National Park\n\n\n                                             Associates, Inc.,\n\n                                 Estes Park, CO, February 3, 1997.\n     Senator John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain, Permit me to add a voice of support \n     for the bill you are reintroducing known as the National \n     Parks Capital Improvement Act.\n       Many of us affiliated as non profit and philanthropic \n     partners working to improve and enhance America's National \n     Park System are searching for innovative solutions to address \n     the pressing needs of our parks. The concept of the National \n     Parks Capital Improvements Act may be innovative within the \n     context of national parks, but it is clearly a well-tested \n     tool in the private sector and it is needed now for our park \n     fix-up kits. It is my understanding that it permits bonds to \n     be issued at our parks--at least those areas having special \n     long-term needs and those adept at revenue generation. This \n     legislation is not designed to address every need of the \n     maintenance backlog which is fast accumulating within the \n     National Park System. But in specific parks--like that of \n     Grand Canyon or others with carefully defined Master Plans--\n     this authority to issue bonds could be put to beneficial use \n     immediately, addressing critically important infrastructure \n     and visitor services improvement programs.\n       I hasten to add that not many parks have non profit \n     partnerships as strong as Grand Canyon National Park has with \n     its affiliates, the Grand Canyon Association and the Grand \n     Canyon Fund. The key to making this bond issuance authority \n     work effectively is the leadership and managerial competence \n     coming from these non profit partners. The National Park \n     Service is fortunate to have such strong non profit friends \n     who are able to both create and manage this financing plan \n     within the context of our National Park System.\n       I applaud your foresight and your leadership in \n     reintroducing the National Parks Capital Improvements Act in \n     this current session of Congress. I heartily endorse your \n     concern and your continued efforts in seeking new solutions \n     to help our national parks.\n           Kindest regards,\n                                                   C.W. Buchholtz,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       National Trust for Historic\n\n\n                                                 Preservation,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 3, 1997.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the more than 250,000 \n     members of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, I am \n     writing to express our support for the National Parks \n     Improvements Act of 1997. This legislation creates, in the \n     form of revenue bonds, an innovative mechanism for funding \n     the backlog of capital investment and deferred maintenance \n     needs in our National Park System.\n       Recently, Senator Craig Thomas, the new Chairman of the \n     Subcommittee on Parks, Historic Preservation and Recreation, \n     expressed the view that the challenges facing the National \n     Parks System--specifically the backlog of deferred \n     maintenance, repair and restoration needs--must be addressed \n     outside that normal annual appropriation process. The \n     National Trust for Historic Preservation has a particular \n     interest in finding sources of funding for the $1 to $2 \n     billion backlog of restoration and rehabilitation needs for \n     the 20,000 historic structures in our National Parks. The \n     National Parks Improvement Act of 1997 provides a solution to \n     the complex problem, and we look forward to working with you \n     on this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Edward M. Norton, Jr.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      Grand Canyon Fund, Inc.,\n\n                               Grand Canyon, AZ, January 31, 1997.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: We are very pleased to offer our \n     enthusiastic support of your new legislation, which will \n     enable the National Park Service and private partners to use \n     taxable revenue bond funding for the benefit of our \n     irreplaceable national parks. We understand the new \n     legislation incorporates the necessary changes to accommodate \n     the recreation fee demonstration project and other interests.\n       Revenue bonding is an additional tool for private partners \n     to utilize in assisting the National Park Service with \n     meeting the overwhelming backlog of unfunded capital needs. \n     We appreciated your support of the parks with your bill S. \n     1695 (National Parks Capital Improvements Act of 1996) and \n     were very pleased to testify before the United States Senate \n     Subcommittee on Parks, Historic Preservation and Recreation \n     last September. We stand ready to assist you in any \n     appropriate way.\n           Sincerely,\n     Eugene P. Polk,\n       Chairman.\n     Robert W. Koons,\n       President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                            Friends of Acadia,\n\n                                          Maine, February 3, 1997.\n     Re S. 1695--National Parks Capital Improvements Act of 1997.\n     Senator John McCain,\n     Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     Subcommittee on Parks, Historic Preservation, and Recreation.\n       Dear Sen. McCain, Sen. Campbell and Committee Members: \n     Friends of Acadia enthusiastically supports S. 1695, the \n     National Parks Capital Improvements Act of 1997. Please add \n     these comments directly to the record.\n       The bill would allow as much as a $2.00 user surcharge for \n     visitors to Grand Canyon National Park and allow the issuance \n     of bonds by a nonprofit park cooperator. The bill can apply \n     to other, unspecified parks as well.\n\n[[Page S1236]]\n\n       Friends of Acadia endorses this resourceful idea and thinks \n     it may be applicable to Acadia National Park, which has an \n     approved general management plan and currently has capital \n     needs exceeding $5 million.\n       We respectfully request that, based on conditions unique to \n     a given park, an individual park may be allowed to set the \n     surcharge within or above the fee demonstration amount, if it \n     is a fee demonstration park.\n       Friends of Acadia is an independent nonprofit organization \n     whose mission is to protect and preserve Acadia National Park \n     and the surrounding communities. We recently raised $4 \n     million in private funds to leverage a $4-million park \n     capital appropriation.\n       This was a model private-public partnership. Its success \n     demonstrates that federal dollars can be effectively \n     multiplied by innovative use of philanthropic nonprofits, as \n     is envisioned in this bill.\n       Friends of Acadia urges passage of S. 1695.\n       Thank you for your consideration of and support for this \n     effort.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Heidi A. Beal,\n     Director of Programs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     National Park Foundation,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 3, 1997.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: Last year the National Park Foundation \n     enjoyed working with you on several pieces of legislation, \n     including a bill you authored which would have allowed the \n     use of taxable bonds to finance long-term capital \n     improvements within the National Park System. This bill, the \n     National Parks Capital Improvements Act, would have generated \n     additional revenue for America's natural, cultural and \n     historic treasures through an innovative public-private \n     partnership.\n       As the 105th Congress begins, we look forward to working \n     closely with you and your staff on legislation designed to \n     help conserve and protect National Parks.\n       Thank you for your consistent, thoughtful support of Grand \n     Canyon National Park and the leadership you have shown in \n     developing solutions to help the entire National Park System.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Jim Maddy,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           Grand Canyon Trust,\n\n                                                 February 6, 1997.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: I am writing to express Grand Canyon \n     Trust's support for the National Parks Capital Improvements \n     Act of 1997, legislation to authorize a $2.00-per-person \n     surcharge on entrance fees at Grand Canyon and other national \n     parks to secure bonds for capital improvements.\n       We believe the proposed legislation will greatly assist the \n     efforts of the National Park Service and other entities to \n     generate the additional funding so urgently needed to \n     maintain, repair and enhance the infrastructure of Grand \n     Canyon National Park and others in the National Park System. \n     We support the proposed use of the $2.00-per-person surcharge \n     to generate incremental revenue for park capital projects.\n       Grand Canyon Trust shares your concerns that the park \n     system's, and particularly Grand Canyon National Park's, \n     pressing infrastructure and resource management needs will \n     not be met unless Congress acts to provide the new authority \n     proposed in this legislation. If those needs are not met, the \n     environment in the parks and visitors' experiences will \n     continue to deteriorate, an unacceptable and unnecessary fate \n     for America's ``crown jewels,'' the national parks.\n       We look forward to working with you to achieve passage of \n     this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Geoffrey S. Barnard,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     Mount Rainier, North Cascades\n\n\n                                               & Olympic Fund,\n\n                                    Seattle, WA, January 31, 1997.\n     Senator John McCain,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the Mount Rainier, North \n     Cascades & Olympic Fund, I would like to state our strong \n     support for the upcoming bill that is replacing S. 1695.\n       The Fund is a non-profit organization, dedicated to the \n     preservation and restoration of Washington's National Parks. \n     Organizations such as the Fund, have been created throughout \n     the United States to help fill the increasing gap between \n     national park needs and funds. In 1995, these non-profits \n     contributed approximately $16 million dollars to national \n     parks throughout the nation. However, even this impressive \n     figure is only scratching the surface of the National Park \n     Services needs.\n       ``The National Park Service was created in 1916, with a \n     mandate to manage the national parks in such a manner . . . \n     as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future \n     generations.'' As financial pressures have mounted, it has \n     become increasingly difficult for the parks to fulfill this \n     mission.\n       I believe that passage of the National Parks Capital \n     Improvements Act, will help parks such as the Grand Canyon, \n     fulfill their mission to protect our national treasures for \n     present and future generations.\n       Thank you for your efforts to preserve and protect our \n     natural heritage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Kim M. Evans,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Environmental Defense Fund,\n\n                                    Boulder, CO, February 9, 1997.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: In a recent report, the General \n     Accounting Office told the United States Congress that ``the \n     national park system is at a crossroads.'' The General \n     Accounting Office confirmed what many of us have known for \n     some time: while the national park system is growing and \n     visitation is increasing, the resources available to manage \n     and protect these resources are falling far short of what is \n     needed to preserve America's natural and historical heritage. \n     As a result, the backlog of repairs and maintenance needed \n     throughout the national park system has grown to $4 billion.\n       Last year, you proposed legislation that would have \n     authorized a limited number of not-for-profit entities to \n     issue taxable bonds, the proceeds of which would have been \n     used to make critically needed investment in units of the \n     national park system. Without creative and innovative \n     approaches such as this, we very likely will never close the \n     gap between the financial resources that are needed to manage \n     and protect our national park system, and the resources that \n     are available.\n       I understand that you plan to introduce a similar bill in \n     the 105th Congress, and I am writing to offer the \n     Environmental Defense Fund's support for this undertaking. \n     While no one piece of legislation will solve all of the \n     problems confronted by the national park system, your \n     legislation is a big step in the right direction.\n       I look forward to working with you as your proposal works \n     its way through the legislative process.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                  James B. Martin,\n                                          Senior Attorney.\n\n By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Frist, Mr. Jeffords, \n                           and Ms. Collins):\n\n  S. 302. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide additional consumer protections for Medicare supplemental \ninsurance; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  THE MEDIGAP PORTABILITY ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President. Last year, the President signed into law \nbipartisan legislation that provides greater portability of health \ninsurance for working Americans. Today, I join with my colleagues, \nSenator Rockefeller, Senator Frist, Senator Jeffords, and Senator \nCollins, in the introduction of a bipartisan bill that will provide \nsome of the same guarantees for Medicare beneficiaries who buy Medicare \nsupplemental insurance or MediGap policies.\n  Of the 38 million Medicare beneficiaries, about 80 percent, or 31 \nmillion, have some form of Medicare supplemental insurance, whether \ncovered through an employer-sponsored health plan, Medicaid or another \npublic program, or a private MediGap policy. Our bill does several \nimportant things for Medicare beneficiaries who have had continuous \ncoverage:\n  First, it guarantees that if their plan goes out of business or the \nbeneficiary moves out of a plan service area, he or she can buy another \ncomparable policy. These rules also would apply to a senior who has had \ncoverage under a retiree health plan or Medicare Select if their plan \ngoes out of business.\n  Second, it encourages beneficiaries to enroll in Medicare managed \ncare by guaranteeing that they can return to Medicare fee-for-service \nand, during the first year of enrollment, get back their same MediGap \npolicy if they decide they do not like managed care. Under current law, \nif a senior wishes to enroll in a Medicare managed care plan, he or she \nhas two options. The MediGap policy may be dropped if the senior \nchooses a managed care program, or the individual can continue to pay \nMediGap premiums in the event that the policy is needed again some \nday--a very costly option for those on fixed incomes. Many seniors fear \nthat if they lose their supplemental policy after entering a managed \ncare plan, it may be financially impossible for them to reenroll in \nMediGap.\n  Third, it bans preexisting condition exclusion periods for Medicare \nbeneficiaries who obtain MediGap policies when they are first eligible \nfor Medicare. Under current law, any time insurers sell a MediGap \npolicy, they can limit or exclude coverage for services related to \npreexisting health conditions for a 6-month period.\n  Fourth, it establishes a guaranteed open enrollment period for those \nunder\n\n[[Page S1237]]\n\n65 who become Medicare beneficiaries because they are disabled. Under \ncurrent Federal law, Medicare beneficiaries are offered a 6-month open \nenrollment period only if they are 65. There are approximately 5 \nmillion Americans who are under 65 years of age and are enrolled in the \nMedicare program. Currently, they do not have access to MediGap \npolicies unless State laws require insurers to offer policies to them. \nOur bill provides for a one-time open enrollment period for the current \nMedicare disabled, which will guarantee access to all MediGap plan \noptions for almost 5 million disabled Americans.\n  It is true that this bill does not go as far as some would like. Our \nbill leaves to the states more controversial issues, such as continuous \nopen enrollment and community rating of MediGap premiums. I believe, \nhowever, that this legislation will provide seniors similar guarantees \nto those that we provided to working Americans under the Kassebaum-\nKennedy legislation.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the MediGap \nPortability Act of 1997. The importance of this legislation is best \nexpressed by the many stories of individuals who have unsuccessfully \ntried to obtain adequate Medicare supplemental coverage. Therefore, I \nwould like to share with you the experience of one of my constituents--\nGary Purcell, a 60-year-old retired professor from the University of \nTennessee.\n  To say the least, Dr. Purcell's health status has been a challenge \nfor him. Despite a history of multiple illnesses including lupus, \nhypertension, diabetes, severe heart and kidney disease, and recurrent \nlife-threatening skin infections, this man kept working. Even after \nsuffering a stroke, he kept working. Dr. Purcell fought to remain \nproductive, but as his condition deteriorated, he was forced to retire \non disability. He subsequently developed prostate cancer and recently \nsuffered an amputation of the left leg.\n  One day last fall, he received a letter saying he was eligible for \nMedicare due to disability. In fact, the situation was a little more \ncomplicated than that. Since he had not yet reached his 65th birthday, \nDr. Purcell was actually being reassigned to Medicare, thus losing his \nprivate health insurance coverage. Due to the fact he is eligible for \nMedicare because of disability and not age, and because of preexisting \nmedical conditions, Dr. Purcell could not obtain MediGap coverage and \nhe had no other insurance options. As a result, he will incur high out-\nof-pocket costs to fill the many gaps in Medicare's coverage. Although \nDr. Purcell will be eligible for supplemental coverage at age 65, 5 \nyears from now, until then he will have to spend $500 per month or 25 \npercent of his income on medications to make up for what Medicare does \nnot cover.\n  Dr. Purcell explored other options--ways of obtaining less expensive \ndrugs, but the bottom line is, he will still have to pay massive sums \nof money for his medications, money which he does not have. \nUnfortunately, his situation is not unique. Many seniors, as well as \nother individuals with disabilities, are suffering as well.\n  How did this happen? What is the real issue? MediGap insurance \npolicies offer coverage for Medicare's deductibles and coinsurance and \npay for many services not covered by Medicare. However, for several \nreasons, the current MediGap laws do not always meet the needs of \nMedicare beneficiaries--especially individuals with disabilities.\n  First, under current law, individuals with disabilities who qualify \nfor full Medicare benefits before the age of 65 must wait to purchase \nMediGap coverage until they reach that age. At that time, they are \ngiven a 6-month period of open enrollment. This means that unlike the \nelderly, they cannot obtain MediGap insurance when they become eligible \nfor Medicare.\n  Second, even when obtainable, MediGap coverage may be limited. During \nthe open enrollment period, insurers may not use a preexisting \ncondition to refuse a policy for an individual. However, coverage for a \nspecific preexisting condition can be delayed for up to 6 months. This \nis called underwriting. Even though alternative policies which do not \nuse the underwriting process are available, they do not necessarily \noffer comparable coverage. Further, Federal law does not guarantee that \nthese alternatives will continue in the future. Thus, individuals with \ndisabilities on Medicare may not receive the same choices of MediGap \nplans as their senior counterparts.\n  Third, such stringent requirements hinder the efforts of seniors who \nwish to try a Medicare managed care option. They are afraid of not \nbeing able to receive comparable supplemental coverage should they \ndecide to return to the traditional fee-for-service Medicare. \nAccordingly, they do not take the risk of changing. This is perhaps one \nreason that enrollment in Medicare managed care lags far behind the \nrest of the population. We must encourage this transition if we are to \nslow the growth of Medicare costs.\n  Fourth, those Medicare beneficiaries whose employer-provided wrap-\naround plans are reducing or dropping benefits after they become \neligible for Medicare will have difficulties purchasing additional \ncoverage.\n  Finally, we must consider those who have enrolled in Medicare managed \ncare plans which terminate contracts with Medicare or whom move outside \nthe service area of their plan. In these circumstances, beneficiaries \noften need to return to the traditional Medicare program and may again \nwish to obtain supplemental coverage.\n  To summarize, although our current policies may encourage many \nmembers of the aging population to obtain continuous coverage, they are \ndeficient in encouraging the same for individuals with disabilities who \nare unable to obtain supplemental coverage even if they have had \ncontinuous insurance coverage. They also limit the choices of seniors \nwho wish to switch plans or whose retiree plans terminate or limit \ncoverage. The situation is simply unfair.\n  Last fall, the President signed the Health Insurance Portability and \nAccountability Act of 1996 (the ``Kassebaum-Kennedy'' bill) which \naddressed health insurance portability for the small group market. The \nMedigap Portability Act addresses similar issues for seniors and \nindividuals with disabilities.\n  First, seniors will now have more choices than were available before. \nThey will be able to explore the managed care options now available, \nyet still return to their original Medigap plans if they change their \nminds.\n  Second, if their retiree health plans terminate or substantially \nreduce benefits, seniors will still have access to supplemental health \ninsurance without regard to previous health status.\n  Finally, if their insurance plans should go out of business, seniors \nwill still have Medigap options.\n  In other words, it guarantees choice and security for senior citizens \non Medicare.\n  In addition, the bill guarantees access to the same coverage \navailable to seniors for individuals with disabilities in three ways:\n  First, it insures that anyone will be able to enroll in a Medigap \nplan of their choosing without discrimination during the first 6 months \nof their eligibility for full Medicare benefits, regardless of age.\n  Second, the bill guarantees that the disabled will still have the \nsame access to the array of Medigap choices that are available to \nseniors after the enrollment period ends, although restrictions may \napply.\n  And, third, individuals with disabilities who are currently enrolled \nin the Medicare program will have a one-time open enrollment period to \nguarantee their access to all Medigap plan options.\n  Dr. Purcell is a responsible middle income American who fell through \nthe safety net. He lost both rights and choices. In his own words, ``I \nfind it so frustrating that I had really planned for the retirement \nperiod and had tried to prepare myself as prudently as possible * * * \nYet, I had no idea that my comprehensive coverage would cease after \nonly 2 years. Even though I have always done my best to be a good \nworker and to provide for my family, the rug was pulled out from under \nme anyway. I feel so helpless.''\n  Dr. Purcell went on to say, ``I thought the issue through and tried \nto determine where I might have the most impact just as one person * * \n* I felt that my best option was to go to the people who represent me * \n* * in the national legislature.''\n\n[[Page S1238]]\n\n  Dr. Purcell and the 4 million other disabled Americans he represents \nhave legitimate concerns. So do the 34 million senior citizens who are \nalso affected by this issue. They are only asking for the same rights \ngiven to working Americans. They are coming to us, their elected \nrepresentatives, for help. Mr. President, I challenge my colleagues and \nthe insurance industry to respond to these beneficiaries. This bill \nwill provide freedom of choice for seniors and individuals with \ndisabilities. It is a step forward in our battle to improve health care \naccess for all of our citizens and I give it my full support.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to be reintroducing a \nbill with my colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, to improve \nthe security and protection of Medicare supplemental policies, so-\ncalled MediGap policies. I am especially pleased that Senator Jeffords, \nboth the new chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee and \none of the newest members of the Finance Committee, Senator Frist, and \nSenator Collins have joined us this year as original cosponsors of our \nlegislation. And I continue to be pleased that similar legislation has \nbeen introduced in the House of Representatives by the bipartisan team \nof Representatives Nancy Johnson and John Dingell.\n  When enacted, our bipartisan, bicameral bill will make MediGap \npolicies more portable, more reliable, and more accessible for almost \n40 million Medicare beneficiaries, including 5 million disabled \nMedicare beneficiaries.\n  Last year, when we introduced this bill, we were not terribly \noptimistic that it would get enacted before the end of the 104th \nCongress. But we put forward our legislation anyway to share our \nproposal and objectives, begin building momentum for changes we feel \nare necessary, and to preview the fact that we would be back in the \n105th Congress with a concerted effort to make this a legislative \npriority. As it turns out, having identified MediGap improvements as an \narea of bipartisan concern, President Clinton has responded directly by \nadding the same goal of new MediGap protections as a priority he shares \nand included it in his recently submitted budget proposal. We are very \nhappy that our bipartisan support for improved MediGap protections got \nnoticed by the President and will be pursued by his administration in \nthe upcoming budget process.\n  Mr. President, too many Americans are falling through the gaps in our \nhealth care system. For example, consider the situation of a 44-year-\nold disabled man from Capon Bridge, WV. He earns too much money to \nqualify for Medicaid and is unable to buy a private MediGap policy \nbecause of his medical condition. And, there is the 47-year-old woman \nfrom Slanesville, WV, who is in a similar situation. She was uninsured \nbefore qualifying for Medicare because of kidney disease. She and her \nhusband have too many assets to qualify for Medicaid and they can't \nafford the $300-a-month health insurance policy offered by her \nhusband's employer. They have not been able to find an insurer willing \nto sell them a MediGap policy to help with Medicare's hefty cost-\nsharing requirements. A MediGap policy would be more affordable for \nthem than the insurance policy offered by her husband's employer which \nduplicates, rather than supplements, Medicare's benefits. Many of the \n50,000 disabled West Virginians who qualify for Medicare are in a \nsimilar situation. This is wrong and we can do better.\n\n  Mr. President, almost 8 in 10 older Americans have opted to purchase \npolicies through private insurance companies to fill gaps in their \nMedicare benefits. This MediGap insurance commonly covers the $756 \ndeductible required for each hospital stay, the part B deductible for \ndoctor visits and doctor copayments. MediGap policies also cover \ncopayments for nursing home care, extended rehabilitation, or for \nemergency care received abroad. Some MediGap policies cover \nprescription drugs.\n  But even MediGap policies have gaps because of insurance underwriting \npractices which prevent beneficiaries from switching MediGap insurers \nor, as in the case of the Medicare disabled, from even initially \npurchasing MediGap protection.\n  Employers, looking to lower their health care costs, are increasingly \ncutting back on retiree health benefits. In just 2 years, employer-\nsponsored retiree health benefits has dropped by 5 percent. These \nretirees are forced to go out on the private market and purchase \nindividual MediGap coverage. Those lucky enough to find insurance will \nfind their coverage compromised by preexisting condition limitations. \nSome won't find an insurer willing to sell them a policy at any price.\n  In 1990, I worked with Senator Chafee, the minority leader, Senator \nDaschle, and the then-chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator \nBentsen, On enacting a number of measures to improve the value of \nMediGap policies. We also successfully enacted legislation that \nstandardized MediGap policies so that seniors could more easily compare \nthe prices and benefits provided by MediGap insurers.\n  At that time, Congress also mandated that insurers must sell a \nMediGap policy to any senior wishing to buy coverage when that person \nfirst becomes eligible for Medicare, without being subject to medical \nunderwriting. At the time, there was a worry that including the \nMedicare disabled population in this open enrollment period would \nescalate premiums for current MediGap policyholders. As a result, the \ndisabled were not included in this guaranteed issue requirement. Since \nthen, 12 States have moved ahead and required insurers to issue \npolicies to all Medicare beneficiaries in their States, including the \ndisabled. To my knowledge, not one State has reported large hikes in \npremiums as a result of their new laws.\n  We have also asked the American Academy of Actuaries for an \nindependent analysis of our legislation. We are confident that their \nevaluation of our bill will lay to rest any concerns about wild hikes \nin MediGap premiums because of our provision to end the current law \ndiscrimination against the disabled.\n\n  Mr. President, our bill would protect all Medicare beneficiaries by \nguaranteeing them MediGap coverage if they are forced to change their \nMediGap insurer, or if their employer stops providing retiree health \nbenefits. Specifically, our bill would require MediGap insurers to sell \nMedicare beneficiaries a new MediGap policy without any preexisting \ncondition limitations if an individual moves outside the State in which \nthe insurer is licensed, or the health plan goes out of business; if an \nindividual loses their employer-sponsored retiree health benefits; if \nan individual enrolled in a health maintenance organization [HMO] or \nMedicare Select policy moves outside of a health plan's service area, \nor if the HMO's contract is canceled; or if an individual enrolled in a \nHMO or a Medicare Select policy decides during their first 12 months of \nenrollment to return to a MediGap fee-for-service policy.\n  Mr. President, our bill gives Medicare beneficiaries an opportunity \nto try out a managed care plan without worrying about losing their \noption to return to fee-for-service medicine. Understandably, many \nseniors worry about enrolling in a managed care organization if it \nmeans losing access to their lifelong doctor. Our bill would encourage \nMedicare beneficiaries to try out a managed care plan to see if it \nsuits them, but our bill gives them a way back to fee-for-service \nmedicine, if that ends up being their personal preference.\n  Our legislation bans insurance companies from imposing any \npreexisting condition limitation during the 6-month open enrollment \nperiod for MediGap insurance when a person first qualifies for \nMedicare. This change from current law makes the rules for MediGap \npolicies consistent with the recently enacted Kassebaum-Kennedy bill \nfor the under-65 population, and with Medicare coverage which begins \nimmediately, regardless of any preexisting conditions.\n  Mr. President, our bill also includes a section to help seniors \nchoose the right health plan for them by ensuring that they get good \ninformation on what plans are available in their area. It allows them \nto compare different health plans based on results of consumer \nsatisfaction surveys, and will include information on benefits and \ncosts.\n  Our bill does not directly address affordability. And, even since we \nintroduced our original bill last September, there is growing evidence \nthat MediGap premiums are skyrocketing. I am hopeful that the Finance \nCommittee will take a closer look at this issue\n\n[[Page S1239]]\n\nduring its deliberations on other Medicare reform initiatives. Between \n1995 and 1996, large numbers of seniors received double-digit increases \nin their MediGap premiums. These increases were far in excess of Social \nSecurity cost-of-living increases and varied dramatically across \nStates. In my own State of West Virginia, MediGap policies sold by the \nPrudential Insurance Co. increased by 17 percent between 1995 and 1996. \nIn Ohio, premiums increased by 30 percent and in California by 37 \npercent.\n\n  Congress has considerable history in trying to guarantee at least a \nminimal level of value across all MediGap policies. Under the current \nlaw, individual and group MediGap policies must spend at least 65 and \n75 percent, respectively, of all premium dollars collected, on \nbenefits. If a MediGap plan fails to meet these minimum loss ratios, \nthey must issue refunds or credits to their customers.\n  Mr. President, while Federal loss ratio standards help assure a \nminimum level of value, they do not prevent insurance companies from \nannually upping premiums as a senior ages. This practice, known as \nattained age-rating, results in the frailest and the lowest income \nseniors facing large, annual premium hikes as they age. I would hope \nthat more States would follow the lead of the 10 States that have \nalready banned attained age-rating. This would vastly improve the \naffordability of MediGap for the oldest and frailest of our seniors.\n  Mr. President, to repeat what I said last year, our bill is a \ntargeted, modest, proposal. But it would provide very real and very \nsignificant help to millions of Medicare beneficiaries who, year in and \nyear out, pay out billions of dollars in premiums to have peace of mind \nwhen it comes to the cost of their health care. It is wrong and unfair \nwhen senior and disabled citizens in West Virginia and across the \ncountry are suddenly dropped by insurers or denied a MediGap policy \njust because they move to another State, or their employer cuts back on \npromised retiree health benefits, or because they're disabled.\n  Mr. President, it is always a pleasure to be working on legislation \nwith the Senator from Rhode Island. Senator Chafee has a long, \nimpressive, and, more important, successful record in enacting \nlegislation that has helped millions of seniors, children, and \ndisabled. I urge my colleagues to join Senators Jeffords, Frist, and \nCollins in cosponsoring this bill, and to help us extend more of the \nhealth care peace of mind that older and disabled Americans ask for and \ndeserve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 303. A bill to waive temporarily the Medicare enrollment \ncomposition rules for the Wellness Plan; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          medicare waiver for the wellness plan of detroit, mi\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, at the end of the last Congress I \nexpressed my disappointment at the unwillingness of this body and the \nother Chamber to move legislation that I believe is important to the \nhealth care of the people of Michigan. Today I rise along with my \ncolleague from Michigan, Senator Levin, to reintroduce our legislation \nproviding a Medicare 50/50 enrollment composition rule waiver for the \nWellness Plan of Detroit, MI.\n  The Wellness Plan is a federally certified Medicaid health \nmaintenance organization located in Detroit, MI. It has approximately \n150,000 enrollees--roughly 140,000 of whom are Medicaid, while only \nabout 2,000 are Medicare beneficiaries. Since 1993, the Wellness Plan \nhas had a health care prepayment plan contract with Medicare. However, \ntechnical changes enacted by Congress effective January 1, 1996, \nunintentionally prevent the Wellness Plan from enrolling additional \nMedicare beneficiaries under the HCPP contract. So the Wellness Plan is \npositioned to become a full Medicare risk contractor, it currently is \nprecluded from doing so due to the 50/50 Medicare enrollment \ncomposition rule.\n  Mr. President, it is important to note that even the Health Care \nFinancing Administration has supported the Wellness Plan receiving this \nplan-specific 50/50 waiver. We also expect a companion bill to be \nintroduced in the other Chamber shortly, and we expect it to be \ncosponsored by the entire Michigan delegation.\n  Because this legislation is essentially noncontroversial, affects \nonly the State of Michigan, and is supported by the entire State \ndelegation, it is our earnest hope that the Senate will act on this \nmeasure as expeditiously as possible. There is no rational \njustification for preventing the Wellness Plan from enrolling new \nMedicare beneficiaries into its health plan. If our goal is to allow a \nwider variety of options and choices of health care plans for our \nseniors, a good place to start is to allow those Michigan residents who \nwish to join this particular health maintenance organization to be able \nto do so.\n  Mr. President, I wish to thank my friend and colleague from Michigan, \nSenator Carl Levin, for once again supporting and helping me with this \neffort. I look forward to working with him to see that this measure \nwhich has such broad support in Michigan becomes enacted in the very \nnear future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 203\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. WAIVER OF MEDICARE ENROLLMENT COMPOSITION RULES \n                   FOR THE WELLNESS PLAN.\n\n       The requirements of section 1876(f)(1) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395mm(f)(1)) are waived with respect \n     to Comprehensive Health Services, Inc. (doing business as The \n     Wellness Plan) for contract periods through December 31, \n     2000.\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am joining with my colleague \nSenator Abraham in introducing legislation that would provide the \nWellness Plan of Michigan with a Medicare 50/50 enrollment composition \nrule waiver. I was disappointed that Congress did not enact this waiver \nlast session as the Wellness Plan is the prototype for the type of \nhealth maintenance organization into which many Medicare beneficiaries \nwill want to enroll. It is my hope that the Senate will act \nexpeditiously on this legislation so that Michigan Medicare \nbeneficiaries may have the opportunity to enroll in this well-\nestablished, quality plan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/11/senate-section/article/S1226-3", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 206\n\n  At the request of Mr. Reid, the name of the Senator from Louisiana \n[Mr. Breaux] was added as a cosponsor of S. 206, a bill to prohibit the \napplication of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, or any \namendment made by such act, to an individual who is incarcerated in a \nFederal, State, or local correctional, detention, or penal facility, \nand for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 251\n\n  At the request of Mr. Shelby, the name of the Senator from Nebraska \n[Mr. Hagel] was added as a cosponsor of S. 251, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow farmers to income average over 2 \nyears.\n\n\n                                 S. 277\n\n  At the request of Mr. Cochran, the name of the Senator from North \nCarolina [Mr. Faircloth] was added as a cosponsor of S. 277, a bill to \namend the Agricultural Adjustment Act to restore the effectiveness of \ncertain provisions regulating Federal milk marketing orders.\n\n\n                                 S. 294\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Hutchison, the names of the Senator from \nArizona [Mr. McCain], the Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft], the \nSenator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], the Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. \nSmith], and the Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Faircloth] were added \nas cosponsors of S. 294, a bill to amend chapter 51 of title 18, United \nStates Code, to establish Federal penalties for the killing or \nattempted killing of a law enforcement officer of the District of \nColumbia, and for other purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/11/senate-section/article/S1239-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1239-S1240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 52--CONCERNING THE NEED TO ADDRESS THE CURRENT MILK \n                                 CRISIS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kohl,\n\n[[Page S1240]]\n\nMr. Jeffords, and Mr. Leahy) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas ordered to lie over, under the rule:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, each fall, Senators and \nCongressmen turn to the enjoyable task of submitting nominations to the \nU.S. Service Academies. This year, like every other, my office was \nflooded with applications from qualified young men and women--students \nwith excellent academic records, students whose extracurricular \nactivities would drive the most patient parent crazy, students who \ndonate endless hours to community service projects. However, rarely do \nI see a young person possessing all of this and more.\n  This year I proudly nominated Erica Michelle Pitts, of Louisville, \nKY, to the U.S. Military Academy, as did Senator Wendell Ford and then-\nCongressman Mike Ward. There are many adjectives that can be used to \ndescribe Erica--poised, accomplished, brave, athletic, energetic, but \neven combined they do not adequately portray her. A senior at Saint \nFrancis High School, Erica's headmaster Thomas Pike describes her as \n``a delightfully different young person.'' Counselor Kit Llewellyn sees \nher as a ``risk-taker'' and admires her integrity.\n\n[[Page S1241]]\n\n  Erica's military career dreams began at the age of 6 when her \nstepfather took her for a tank ride. At the tender young age of 8 she \nbegan working for her mother's boss formatting computer disks for $5 an \nhour. Entering as a seventh-grader at the respected Saint Francis, she \nwas immediately placed in the freshman class, where, lacking a girls \nbasketball team, Erica played on the boy's team. She has participated \nin a Russian exchange program, the Duke University Talent \nIdentification Program, and served on the Courier-Journal High School \nRound Table. And, amidst her participation on the academic team and the \nyearbook staff, Erica works part-time at the Louisville Science Center \nyearround.\n  As you can see, Erica's childhood has been far from average. \nNotwithstanding, she has grown into a graceful young woman whose lofty \ndreams have been realized. Hoping to enter the Judge Advocate General's \nCorps after her years at West Point, Erica aspires to serve on the \nSupreme Court or be elected President. Both goals are well within her \ngrasp.\n  Mr. President, please join me in honoring this outstanding young \nKentuckian who has a bright future in the U.S. military. I ask that an \narticle which recently appeared in the Louisville Courier-Journal be \nprinted in the Record. The author does a wonderful job of capturing \nErica's charm and enthusiasm.\n  The article follows:\n\n                          Getting to the Point\n\n                            (By C. Ray Hall)\n\n       At first blush, the most interesting thing about Erica \n     Pitts is this: Barely 17, she is headed for the United States \n     Military Academy to join West Point's legendary long gray \n     line.\n       It will probably be the grayest thing that has ever \n     happened to her. So far, her life has been like a \n     colorsplashed, abstract work of art in progress.\n       Erica Pitts has been interesting for a long time. She was \n     interesting even in the womb.\n       ``I was named after a soap-opera character,'' she said. \n     ``Because I was trouble. My mom went into labor and so she \n     went to the hospital.''\n       False alarm.\n       ``They sent her back home. Then I was about ready to pop \n     out so they called the ambulance. I was almost born in the \n     ambulance. I was almost born outside on the way into the \n     hospital. I was almost born in the lobby. I was almost born \n     in the elevator, but finally they got her to a delivery room \n     and I was born. I made life a little difficult for her.''\n       Hence the name, Erica: ``Yeah, Erica Kane. Because I was \n     trouble.''\n       Not even a minute old, and her life was already a \n     cliffhanger.\n       Next scene in Erica's life: the beginning of an unlikely \n     romance. At Fort Knox, of all places. In a tank, of all \n     things.\n       ``It started when I was about 6. My mom had married my \n     stepdad. He was in the Army and he took me for a tank ride \n     one day and I just thought that was the coolest thing. I \n     admired the discipline in the Army.''\n       Next scene: Erica gets her first paying job, earning $5 an \n     hour to format computer disks for her mom's boss at the \n     Internal Revenue Service. She is 8.\n       Next scene: Erica is stepfatherless, owing to divorce. She \n     and her mom, Pamela Scott, are living in Louisville. Erica \n     masters public school effortlessly. ``I was so used to just \n     showing up for class, reading the newspaper during first \n     period and not doing any work all day and still getting an A \n     in every single class I took.'' So her mom takes Erica to St. \n     Francis, a downtown school of high academic reputation and \n     equally stratospheric cost (tuition up to $8,140).\n       Headmaster Thomas Pike recalled, ``I remember her and her \n     mom coming in and her talking about not being academically \n     challenged, talking about being an environmental lawyer or \n     biochemist. This is a seventh-grader. Just a really bright, \n     lively 13-year-old, and she has been lively and bright ever \n     since . . . a delightfully different young person.''\n       St. Francis took her and let her skip from the seventh to \n     the ninth grade. (``A double bonus,'' Erica said.)\n       ``Her life has always been action-packed,'' said school \n     counselor Kit Llewellyn. ``She's a skateboarder, a volleyball \n     player, a basketball player. She volunteers regularly. . . . \n     She has worked on literary magazines, so her literary \n     analysis is strong and indepth. . . .\n       ``She's kind of a risk-taker. She likes to start things. \n     She participated in crew (rowing) when it was founded. She's \n     the first female from this school to entertain the idea of \n     applying to a military academy.''\n       And yet, somewhere in that swirl of action, there's a \n     cerebral center.\n       ``I guess what stands out with me for Erica is her \n     integrity,'' Llewellyn said. ``I was her sponsor at Calvary \n     Episcopal Church when she went through the confirmation. For \n     her age (then 15), her questions and her depth of \n     understanding, what she was pursuing in her belief and in her \n     spiritual self, was very strong. Well-thought-out and very, \n     very calm in her approach.''\n       Oh. And did we mention she wants to be president?\n       Of the United States. Like the current occupant of the Oval \n     Office, she likes lawyering. And, like Bill Clinton, she went \n     to Russia at a tender age, as part of an exchange program.\n       Erica was nominated to West Point last year by then-\n     Congressman Mike Ward. For the physical test, she returned to \n     Fort Knox, the scene of her first infatuation with the Army. \n     She passed the exam, which includes running, throwing a \n     basketball while on your knees and hanging on a chin-up bar. \n     Some girls immediately drop off the bar. She held on for 31 \n     seconds.\n       The audience included Lt. Col. Don Miller, an Army \n     reservist who serves as a West Point liaison (and, in another \n     life, helps run a Louisville brokerage). After interviewing \n     her, he wrote to the academy, ``Erica is a very goal-oriented \n     young lady with aspirations of becoming president someday. . \n     . . Erica has excellent people skills and appears to possess \n     good leadership traits. Her mother raised Erica alone and \n     this has resulted in sacrifice, and yet has developed her \n     sense of commitment.''\n       So this is a 17-year-old of greater complexity than most. \n     During her trip to Russia, she bought a fur hat. She felt bad \n     about it when she realized rabbits had died to decorate her \n     head. She thinks the country spends too much on defense. She \n     clashed openly with a 10th-grade teacher, but she has a kind \n     word even for Adolf Hitler. (``He was psycho, but he was a \n     brilliant, brilliant ruler.'')\n       This is not your father's West Point cadet.\n       ``She's a free spirit,'' said Bryan Walde, the man who \n     teaches her calculus, chemistry and basketball at St. \n     Francis. In her graduating class of 38, the animal-loving, \n     defense-cutting, coffeehouse-and-concert habitue might have \n     been voted least likely to go to West Point.\n       ``I heard that a lot,'' she said.\n       `` `You were the last person I thought would ever go \n     there.' A lot of the people I know are not really anti-\n     government, but they don't like people telling them what to \n     do. I don't really like it myself, but I do need the \n     discipline. I would love to have the discipline. And it's one \n     of the best schools in the country. Who would turn that \n     down?''\n       West Point told her the price of the education awaiting \n     her. ``They valued it as $200,000, which I wouldn't doubt, \n     because I think West Pointers can easily top people who go to \n     Harvard.''\n       That's obviously the kind of talk they like to hear on the \n     cliffs overlooking the Hudson River. Not that they actually \n     like to hear much talk at all from first-year cadets, or \n     ``plebes.'' For a while at West Point, she will speak only \n     when bidden. Too bad, for she has lots to say. To wit:\n       On her willowy yet well-fed frame of 5 feet 10 inches, 120 \n     pounds:\n       ``I eat a lot. This morning for breakfast, I had a \n     cheeseburger, two pancakes and a cinnamon roll. . . .\n       On love, sex and all that:\n       ``I manage to stay friends with all of my ex-boyfriends. \n     It's really strange. I think partially because there's never \n     any reason for either of us to be really bitter. I don't \n     sleep with anybody. I just decided no sex before marriage. So \n     I never had to worry about sleeping with somebody and then \n     the next morning they just totally ditch me. There's never \n     any big thing to get really mad about. It's just a bunch of \n     little things that lead up to you saying, `You know, maybe we \n     shouldn't be together.' So you can just go back to being \n     friends.''\n       On her idea of cool wheels:\n       ``I want a big Dodge Ram truck as soon as I can get a \n     car.'' (She calculates that that will be three years hence, \n     with the down payment saved from her West Point stipend of \n     $6,600 a year.)\n       On her mixed parentage, the result of a college romance \n     that never led to marriage. A delicate matter?\n       ``It never has been. People have asked me about that for a \n     long time. They've asked me if I was mixed and it's never \n     bothered me. I've never really worried about it. Yeah, my \n     dad's white, my mom's black. . . . It's never been a big deal \n     to me.''\n       On her twin ambitions, of being a lawyer and a \n     psychologist:\n       ``I love to argue. That's what appeals to me about being a \n     lawyer. And I love using words . . . to get a point across. I \n     want to be a psychologist because I'm so used to doing that: \n     There are so many people with problems. My friends always \n     come to me for advice.''\n       What's the best advice anyone gave her?\n       ``You've got to learn to choose your battles and not fight \n     every single one. That's some good advice I got from my \n     mother. . . . For a while, every time somebody did something \n     I didn't like, I was ready to argue with them. I didn't get \n     into fistfights or anything, but I kind of verbally berated \n     my teacher sophomore year, sometimes in front of his class. \n     He didn't like that very much. That's when I learned to start \n     controlling my temper. I felt kind of bad, although I think \n     he kind of deserved some of that, although in front of his \n     class was really mean.''\n       On the prospects of harassment or hazing from macho \n     military males:\n       ``The sexual harassment thing, I think I would have the \n     guts to just stand up and say, `Hey, I don't like it. Stop.' \n     Being hazed and stuff like that, once it got to a dangerous \n     point where people were setting me on fire, I would just have \n     to like fight back, period. I would not allow somebody to set \n     me on fire\n\n[[Page S1242]]\n\n     as part of a hazing ritual. I think I'm strong enough to \n     handle anything that might be thrown at me as a hazing \n     ritual.''\n       Hazing? Been there, done that, in a non-incendiary way. On \n     a basketball court, of all places.\n       ``My favorite moment came freshman year,'' she said. ``We \n     didn't have a girls' team yet, so I had to play on the boys' \n     team. We were playing against a team that was very, very, \n     very chauvinist. . . . I got in with about a minute 40 left, \n     and they were not treating me very well. At first my \n     teammates wouldn't even pass me the ball, and finally one of \n     'em did. I just stood back behind the three-point line, shot \n     and it went right in. Swish. It was perfect. We still lost \n     the game, but I felt better.''\n       Next scene in Erica's life: November 1996. The IRS \n     transfers Erica's mom to Nashville. ``She and her mother have \n     been a team through the years--her mom with pretty high \n     expectations and Erica living up to them,'' said Llewellyn, \n     the St. Francis counselor.\n       Erica stays behind to graduate from her school. She lives \n     with her grandma, Ellen Pitts. ``She's been pretty great. I \n     have my own loft, and it's really nice. It's not very big, \n     but it's nice. I've got a computer and a desk and my futon up \n     there, and that's all I really need.''\n       For now, at least, she dreams in a loft. But soon enough, \n     the dreams will be aloft. And Erica Pitts' life will get even \n     more interesting.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/11/senate-section/article/S1240-4", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CITY OF HAMTRAMCK\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am honored today to pay tribute to \nthe city of Hamtramck, MI, which is celebrating its 75th anniversary \nthis year. The people of Hamtramck call their city a ``Touch of Europe \nin America,'' and indeed it is truly a unique community. Hamtramck is a \ncity within a city, whose boundaries on all sides are with the city of \nDetroit. Yet Hamtramck maintains its own identity, an identity rooted \nin its diversity.\n  The history of Hamtramck predates its incorporation as a city by more \nthan 100 years. It is named for Col. John Francis Hamtramck, who served \nas the first American commander of Fort Detroit after it was \nsurrendered by Great Britain in 1796. Originally a township larger in \nsize than the present-day city of Detroit, Hamtramck was organized as a \nvillage in 1901.\n  The village of Hamtramck began with 500 people but changed \ndramatically with the birth of the automobile industry. A Dodge Bros. \nauto plant was established in 1914, attracting skilled and unskilled \nworkers from around the Nation and the world. Between 1910 and 1920, \nHamtramck boasted the greatest population growth of any community in \nthe United States, going from 3,589 to 46,615 residents in a single \ndecade.\n  While Hamtramck was originally settled by the same French colonists \nwho had settled Detroit, and later farmed by German immigrants, the \nautomobile industry attracted huge numbers of Polish workers. Since \n1910, Hamtramck's Polish population has grown so rapidly that today, 80 \npercent of its residents stem from first, second, or third generation \nPolish origin.\n  Many of the remainder of Hamtramck's residents are from Central and \nEastern Europe. Having received the warm and generous hospitality of \nMichiganite themselves, in 1946 the Polish-American residents of \nHamtramck began welcoming displaced people from Central Europe and the \nBalkans. More recently, Hamtramck has seen a substantial number of \nUkrainians join the community. All of these groups have maintained \ntheir cultural heritage and identity, while embracing the ideals and \nGovernment of their new country.\n  On any street or in any restaurant in Hamtramck, one can hear any of \n25 different languages being spoken, which is especially impressive in \na city of slightly more than 2 square miles. Hamtramck is renowned for \nthe best Polish food outside Poland, and the hospitality to match, as \nPresident Clinton discovered on a trip to Michigan in 1996 where he \nthoroughly enjoyed lunch at Polish Village Cafe.\n  Mr. President, Hamtramck's blend of cultures has produced a city \nwhich truly feels like a ``Touch of Europe in America.'' Under the \nsteady leadership of Mayor Robert Kozaren, Hamtramck is prepared to \nenter the 21st century with a confidence rooted in the varied \ntraditions and fervent unifying patriotism of its citizens. I commend \nthe residents and leaders of Hamtramck for the community they have \nbuilt, and am proud to represent them in the U.S. Senate. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in congratulating the people of Hamtramck on \nthe occasion of the city's 75th anniversary. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/11/senate-section/article/S1242-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     JOHN D.

Mr. President, I rise to commend my colleague, \nSenator Santorum, for the article he recently had published in the \nWashington Times concerning partial birth abortion.\n  All too often, Mr. President, debates over public policy issues \ndegenerate into uncivil attacks on each side's motives. Mr. Santorum's \narticle does an excellent job of showing how this bickering can be \navoided even when the issue is as serious and sensitive as abortion. \nHow can we reach common ground on partial birth abortion? By realizing \nthat this procedure has nothing to do with the Supreme Court's decision \nin Roe versus Wade or the subsequent decision in Doe versus Bolton. By \nrealizing that partial birth abortion is simply unacceptable.\n  Whatever one's view of abortion, one should recognize this procedure \nas one that is, as Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan phrased it, ``just \ntoo close to infanticide.''\n  We are a civilized society, Mr. President. I hope that our debates \nover this contentious issue can be made more civil. I also hope that we \ncan reach common ground in banning partial birth abortion.\n  Mr. President, I ask that Senator Santorum's article from the \nWashington Times be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Jan. 22, 1997]\n\n              Partial Birth Abortion: The Art of Agreement\n\n                           (By Rick Santorum)\n\n       A wide spectrum of individuals has coalesced around the \n     recent effort to ban partial birth abortions. These varied \n     individuals and groups have raised their voices in support of \n     a ban both because of the brutality of partial birth \n     abortions and because they recognize that this debate is not \n     about Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision \n     legalizing abortion. It is not about when a fetus becomes a \n     baby. And it is certainly not about women's health. It is \n     about virtual infanticide, it is about killing a child as he \n     or she is being born, an issue that neither Roe vs. Wade nor \n     the subsequent Doe vs. Bolton addressed.\n       During the Senate debate last year, many traditionally pro-\n     choice legislators voted in support of legislation to ban \n     this particular procedure. Among them was my colleague Sen. \n     Arlen Specter who stated on the floor of the Senate, ``In my \n     legal judgment, the issue is not over a woman's right to \n     choose within the constitutional context of Roe versus Wade . \n     . . The line of the law is drawn, in my legal judgment, when \n     the child is partially out of the womb of the mother. It is \n     no longer abortion; it is infanticide.'' He was joined in \n     these sentiments by other such consistently pro-choice \n     members as Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Sen. Ben \n     Nighthorse Campbell.\n       Such coalescence with pro-choice proponents suggests the \n     enormous scope of the tragedy that this procedure represents. \n     This broad coalition further confirms that extraneous \n     considerations, such as the anticipation of a disabled \n     child, or a mother's broadly-defined health concerns, were \n     just that--\n\n[[Page S1243]]\n\n     extraneous to the debate. And for those who may still be \n     unclear what a partial birth abortion procedure is, it is \n     this: a fully formed baby--in most cases a viable fetus of \n     23-26 weeks--is pulled from its mother until all but the \n     head is delivered. Then, a scissors is plunged into the \n     base of the skull, a tube is inserted and the child's \n     brains are suctioned out so that the head of the now-dead \n     infant collapses and is delivered.\n       Partial birth abortion is tragic for the infant who loses \n     his or her life in this brutal procedure. It is also a \n     personal tragedy for the families who choose the procedure, \n     as it is for those who perform it--even if they aren't aware \n     of it. But partial birth abortion is also a profound social \n     tragedy. It rips through the moral cohesion of our public \n     life. It cuts into our most deeply held beliefs about the \n     importance of protecting and cherishing vulnerable human \n     life. It fractures our sense that the laws of our country \n     should reflect long-held, commonly accepted moral norms.\n       Yet this kind of tragedy--can be an unexpected catalyst for \n     consensus, for new coalitions and configurations in our \n     public life. The partial birth abortion debate moves us \n     beyond the traditional pro-life/pro-choice lines of \n     confrontation to hollow out a place in the public square \n     where disparate individuals and groups can come together and \n     draw a line that they know should not be crossed.\n       The stark tragedy of partial birth abortion can be the \n     beginning of a significant public discussion, where we \n     define--or redefine--our first principles. Why is such a \n     discussion important? Precisely because it throws into relief \n     the fundamental truths around which a moral consensus is \n     formed in this country. And, as John Courtney Murray reminds \n     us in We Hold These Truths, Catholic Reflections on the \n     American Proposition, a public consensus which finds its \n     expression in the law should be ``an ensemble of \n     substantive truths, a structure of basic knowledge, an \n     order of elementary affirmations . . .''\n       If we do not have fundamental agreement about first \n     principles, we simply cannot engage one another in civil \n     debate. All we have is the confusion of different factions \n     locked in their own moral universe. If we could agree \n     publicly on just this one point--that partial birth abortion \n     is not something our laws should sanction, and if we could \n     then reveal the consensus--a consensus that I know exists--\n     against killing an almost-born infant, we would have \n     significantly advanced the discussion about what moral status \n     and dignity we give to life in all its stages. Public \n     agreement, codified by law, on this one prohibition gives us \n     a common point of departure, a common language even, because \n     we agree, albeit in a narrow sense, on the meaning of \n     fundamental terms such as life and death. And it is with this \n     common point of departure and discourse--however narrow--that \n     we gain a degree of coherence and unity in our public life \n     and dialogue.\n       I truly believe that out of the horror and tragedy of \n     partial birth abortions, we can find points of agreement \n     across ideological, political and religious lines which \n     enable us to work toward a life-sustaining culture. So, as \n     hundreds of thousands of faithful and steadfast citizens come \n     together to participate in this year's March for Life let us \n     remember that such a culture, the culture for which we hope \n     and pray daily, might very well be achieved one argument at a \n     time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/11/senate-section/article/S1242-3", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR AVIATION\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep \ndisappointment in the President's 1998 budget request for critical \naviation safety and infrastructure purposes. Most notably, the \nadministration proposes to fund the Airport Improvement Program [AIP] \nat only two-thirds of its current level. This represents a drastic cut \nto our Nation's airport grant program, which supports airport safety, \nsecurity, and capacity programs.\n  Mr. President, the administration has assured the American public of \nits commitment to a safe and secure aviation system. Without adequate \nresources, this assurance rings hollow.\n  For instance, the White House Commission on Safety and Security is \ndue to report tomorrow on a number of steps we should take to enhance \nthe security of the aviation system. I expect the Commission will offer \nvaluable insight on where we should go from here to implement \nadditional security enhancements. How we pay for these enhancements is \na significant issue.\n  In addition, Congress approved and the President signed into law the \nFederal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996. Administration officials \nhailed the importance of the bill's safety and security initiatives. We \nall joined together at the signing ceremony in praise of the \nlegislation's security improvements. However, these improvements are \nmeaningless without adequate financial support. For politicians to \npraise their own efforts in a press conference and yet fail to provide \nsufficient resources is cynical, at best.\n  Again, I want to be clear. The administration's actions and \nassurances are only as good as the resources allocated to implement \nthem. Unfortunately, the administration submitted a budget request \nsignificantly short on aviation capital improvements, so that he can \nuse these resources elsewhere in the budget to support his spending \ninitiatives. Meanwhile, he knows he can count on Congress to step up to \nthe plate and restore funding for vital aviation initiatives. Such \nbudget chicanery is neither serious nor responsible.\n  Past experience bears out this point. When President Clinton took \noffice, the Airport Improvement Program was a $1.9 billion program. \nEvery year, Congress has funded the program at a level higher than the \nrequest. For example, in fiscal year 1996, the AIP request was for $1.3 \nbillion, and Congress enacted a $1.45 billion level. In fiscal year \n1997, the administration requested $1.35 billion and Congress responded \nwith a $1.46 billion appropriation. At the same time, the \nadministration claimed record-level investments in transportation \ninfrastructure improvements.\n  The AIP funds more than just airport construction projects, \nwhich make airports safer and enhance the system's ability to handle \never increasing levels of air traffic. Airports also use these funds to \nsupport their security programs and purchase security-related \nequipment.\n\n  The Administration's budget request also proposes reduced funding for \nthe FAA facilities and equipment account. This account is the principal \nresource for modernizing and improving the air traffic control system, \nproviding enhanced baggage screening equipment, and enhanced weather \ndetection programs.\n  I recognize that the Administration has made efforts to bolster its \nsafety and security work force. Even so, a significant funding source \nfor FAA operations depends on an unspecified user fee for which the FAA \nhas no statutory authority to collect.\n  Mr. President, this is not a serious budget proposal. The \nAdministration should back up its safety and security recommendations \nwith enough funding to put them in place. The Nation's air travelers \nhave paid taxes dedicated to support the aviation system. They \nrightfully expect the Government's commitment to spend these funds on \ntheir intended purpose.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/11/senate-section/article/S1243-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1243-S1244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RESTORING INCOME AVERAGING FOR FARMERS\n\n Mr. HAGEL.

I commend Senator Shelby, the bill's principal sponsor, for \nhis leadership on this matter.\n  Today's Federal Tax Code is hardly a friend to the family farmer.\n  For example, farmers and ranchers do not have access to company or \ngovernment pensions and retirement plans, in which many other Americans \nhave the ability to participate. Farmers and ranchers will receive \nfewer Social Security benefits than workers in most other careers since \nthey plow much of their income back into the farm And, as self-employed \nworkers, farmers and ranchers are charged with payroll taxes that are \nnearly double that of most any other private business employee. Even \nretirement can be a painful proposition for agricultural producers who \nhave spent their lives building a security nest egg only to be faced \nwith onerous capital gains tax rates and, later, with a confiscatory \nestate tax when they want to pass their farm along to their children.\n  The American consumer still enjoys the most plentiful food supply at \nthe lowest cost in the developed world--thanks to our Nation's \nagricultural might. Population growth, rising per capita incomes, \nexpanded trade opportunities, along with new production and marketing \ntechnologies, are a few of the reasons why the future of American \nagriculture is so bright. However, flexibility in our U.S. Tax Code is \nstill needed to strengthen our position as the world's leader in \nproduction agriculture.\n  Before 1986, agricultural producers were allowed to average their \nincome over a 2-year period, which allowed greater flexibility in both \nprofit potential and management decisions. This\n\n[[Page S1244]]\n\ntax management tool was repealed in the 1986 tax reform bill, but the \nneed for this instrument to reduce the farm tax burden still remains.\n  A fairer and more equitable tax policy will also have a profound \neffect upon the creation and sustainment of jobs in rural America. The \neconomic vitality of our rural communities continues to hinge on the \nsuccess of our agricultural industry. A prosperous rural economy means \ngreater opportunities for the local men and women who sell the farm \nimplements, drive the grain and livestock trucks, deliver the feed and \nfuel, market the seed and fertilizer, and process the fruits of our \nharvest so as to maintain our position as the world's most efficient \nand reliable food supplier.\n  As we continue to move toward a more market-oriented farm program, \nfarm and ranch producers will need to derive a greater proportion of \ntheir income from the marketplace--and to retain a greater proportion \nof their hard-earned income through tax relief. Income averaging is \nclearly a practice that will bring some degree of fairness to the U.S. \nTax Code.\n  The current Tax Code adds up to higher taxes, more regulatory \nburdens, and added retirement worries for Nebraska farmers who labor \nyear in and year out in order to feed and clothe the world. This simply \nmust change. Income averaging is one tool that agricultural producers \ncan utilize to enhance profits and keep rural dollars in rural \ncommunities. It's time that Congress properly recognizes the \ncontributions of the family farmers by reducing rather than raising \ntheir taxes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/11/senate-section/article/S1243-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1244-S1247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RULES OF THE COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS\n\n Mr. HELMS.

Staff of other \n     Senators who are not members of the Committee may not attend \n     closed sessions of the Committee.\n       Attendance of Committee staff at meetings shall be limited \n     to those designated by the Staff Director or the Minority \n     Staff Director.\n       The Committee, by majority vote, or the Chairman, with the \n     concurrence of the Ranking Minority Member, may limit staff \n     attendance at specified meetings.\n\n\n                            rule 4--quorums\n\n       (a) Testimony.--For the purpose of taking sworn or unsworn \n     testimony at any duly scheduled meeting a quorum of the \n     Committee and each subcommittee thereof shall consist of one \n     member.\n       (b) Business.--A quorum for the transaction of Committee or \n     subcommittee business, other than for reporting a measure or \n     recommendation to the Senate or the taking of testimony, \n     shall consist of one-third of the members of the Committee or \n     subcommittee, including at least one member from each party.\n       (c) Reporting.--A majority of the membership of the \n     Committee shall constitute a quorum for reporting any measure \n     or recommendation to the Senate. No measure or recommendation \n     shall be ordered reported from the Committee unless a \n     majority of the Committee members are physically present. The \n     vote of the Committee to report a measure or matter shall \n     require the concurrence of a majority of those members who \n     are physically present at the time the vote is taken.\n\n\n                            rule 5--proxies\n\n       Proxies must be in writing with the signature of the absent \n     member. Subject to the requirements of Rule 4 for the \n     physical presence of a quorum to report a matter, proxy \n     voting shall be allowed on all measures and matters before \n     the Committee. However, proxies shall not be voted on a \n     measure or matter except when the absent member has been \n     informed of the matter on which he is being recorded and has \n     affirmatively requested that he or she be so recorded.\n\n\n                           rule 6--witnesses\n\n       (a) General.--The Committee on Foreign Relations will \n     consider requests to testify on any matter or measure pending \n     before the Committee.\n       (b) Presentation.--If the Chairman so determines, the oral \n     presentation of witnesses shall be limited to 10 minutes. \n     However, written statements of reasonable length may be \n     submitted by witnesses and other interested persons who are \n     unable to testify in person.\n       (c) Filing of Statements.--A witness appearing before the \n     Committee, or any subcommittee thereof, shall file a written \n     statement of his proposed testimony at least 48 hours prior \n     to his appearance, unless this requirement is waived by the \n     Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member following their \n     determination that there is good cause for failure to file \n     such a statement.\n       (d) Expenses.--Only the Chairman may authorize expenditures \n     of funds for the expenses of witnesses appearing before the \n     Committee or its subcommittees.\n       (e) Requests.--Any witness called for a hearing may submit \n     a written request to the Chairman no later than 24 hours in \n     advance for his testimony to be in closed or open session, or \n     for any other unusual procedure. The chairman shall determine \n     whether to grant any such request and shall notify the \n     Committee members of the request and of his decision.\n\n\n                           rule 7--subpoenas\n\n       (a) Authorization.--The Chairman or any other member of the \n     Committee, when authorized by a majority vote of the \n     Committee at a meeting or by proxies, shall have authority to \n     subpoena the attendance of witnesses or the production of \n     memoranda, documents, records, or any other materials. When \n     the Committee authorizes a subpoena, it may be issued upon \n     the signature of the Chairman or any other member designated \n     by the Committee.\n       (b) Return.--A subpoena, or a request to an agency, for \n     documents may be issued whose return shall occur at a time \n     and place other than that of a scheduled Committee meeting. A \n     return on such a subpoena or request which is incomplete or \n     accompanied by an objection constitutes good cause for a \n     hearing on shortened notice. Upon such a return, the Chairman \n     or any other member designated by him may convene a hearing \n     by giving 2 hours notice by telephone to all other members. \n     One member shall constitute a quorum for such a hearing. The \n     sole purpose of such a hearing shall be to elucidate further \n     information about the return and to rule on the objection.\n       (c) Depositions.--At the direction of the Committee, staff \n     is authorized to take depositions from witnesses.\n\n\n                            rule 8--reports\n\n       (a) Filing.--When the Committee has ordered a measure or \n     recommendation reported, the report thereon shall be filed in \n     the Senate at the earliest practicable time.\n       (b) Supplemental, Minority and Additional Views.--A member \n     of the Committee who gives notice of his intentions to file \n     supplemental, minority, or additional views at the time of \n     final Committee approval of a measure or matter, shall be \n     entitled to not less than 3 calendar days in which to file \n     such views, in writing, with the Chief Clerk of the \n     Committee, with the 3 days to begin at 11:00 p.m. on the day \n     that the Committee has ordered a measure or matter reported. \n     Such views shall then be included in the Committee report and \n     printed in the same volume, as a part thereof, and their \n     inclusion shall be noted on the cover of the report. In the \n     absence of timely notice, the Committee report may be filed \n     and printed immediately without such views.\n       (c) Rollcall Votes.--The results of all rollcall votes \n     taken in any meeting of the Committee on any measure, or \n     amendment thereto, shall be announced in the Committee \n     report. The announcement shall include a tabulation of the \n     votes cast in favor and votes cast in opposition to each such \n     measure and amendment by each member of the Committee.\n\n\n                            rule 9--Treaties\n\n       (a) The Committee is the only Committee of the Senate with \n     jurisdiction to review and report to the Senate on treaties \n     submitted by the President for Senate advice and consent. \n     Because the House of Representatives has no role in the \n     approval of treaties, the Committee is therefore the only \n     congressional committee with responsibility for treaties.\n       (b) Once submitted by the President for advice and consent, \n     each treaty is referred to the Committee and remains on its \n     calendar from Congress to Congress until the Committee takes \n     action to report it to the Senate or recommend its return to \n     the President, or until the Committee is discharged of the \n     treaty by the Senate.\n       (c) In accordance with Senate Rule XXX.2, treaties which \n     have been reported to the Senate but not acted on before the \n     end of a Congress ``shall be resumed at the commencement of \n     the next Congress as if no proceedings had previously been \n     had thereon.''\n       (d) Insofar as possible, the Committee should conduct a \n     public hearing on each treaty as soon as possible after its \n     submission by the President. Except in extraordinary \n     circumstances, treaties reported to the Senate shall be \n     accompanied by a written report.\n\n\n                          rule 10--nominations\n\n       (a) Waiting Requirement.--Unless otherwise directed by the \n     Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member, the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations shall not consider any nomination until 6 \n     calendar days after it has been formally submitted to the \n     Senate.\n\n[[Page S1246]]\n\n       (b) Public Consideration.--Nominees for any post who are \n     invited to appear before the Committee shall be heard in \n     public session, unless a majority of the Committee decrees \n     otherwise.\n       (c) Required Data.--No nomination shall be reported to the \n     Senate unless (1) the nominee has been accorded a security \n     clearance on the basis of a thorough investigation by \n     executive branch agencies; (2) in appropriate cases, the \n     nominee has filed a financial disclosure report and a \n     confidential statement with the Committee; (3) the Committee \n     has been assured that the nominee does not have any interests \n     which could conflict with the interests of the government in \n     the exercise of the nominee's proposed responsibilities; (4) \n     for persons nominated to be chief of mission, ambassador-at-\n     large, or minister, the Committee has received a complete \n     list of any contributions made by the nominee or members of \n     his immediate family to any Federal election campaign during \n     the year of his or her nomination and for the 4 preceding \n     years; and (5) for persons nominated to be chiefs of mission, \n     a report on the demonstrated competence of that nominee to \n     perform the duties of the position to which he or she has \n     been nominated.\n\n\n                            rule 11--travel\n\n       (a) Foreign Travel.--No member of the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations or its staff shall travel abroad on Committee \n     business unless specifically authorized by the Chairman, who \n     is required by law to approve vouchers and report \n     expenditures of foreign currencies, and the Ranking Minority \n     Member. Requests for authorization of such travel shall state \n     the purpose and, when completed, a full substantive and \n     financial report shall be filed with the Committee within 30 \n     days. This report shall be furnished to all members of the \n     Committee and shall not be otherwise disseminated without the \n     express authorization of the Committee. Except in \n     extraordinary circumstances, staff travel shall not be \n     approved unless the reporting requirements have been \n     fulfilled for all prior trips. Except for travel that is \n     strictly personal, travel funded by non-U.S. Government \n     sources is subject to the same approval and substantive \n     reporting requirements as U.S. Government-funded travel. In \n     addition, members and staff are reminded of Senate Rule \n     XXXV.4 requiring a determination by the Senate Ethics \n     Committee in the case of foreign-sponsored travel. Any \n     proposed travel by Committee staff for a subcommittee purpose \n     must be approved by the subcommittee chairman and ranking \n     minority member prior to submission of the request to the \n     Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the full Committee. \n     When the Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member approve the \n     foreign travel of a member of the staff of the committee not \n     accompanying a member of the Committee, all members of the \n     Committee shall be advised, prior to the commencement of such \n     travel of its extent, nature, and purpose.\n       (b) Domestic Travel.--All official travel in the United \n     States by the Committee staff shall be approved in advance by \n     the Staff Director, or in the case of minority staff, by the \n     Minority Staff Director.\n       (c) Personal Staff.--As a general rule, no more than one \n     member of the personal staff of a member of the Committee may \n     travel with that member with the approval of the Chairman and \n     the Ranking Minority Member of the Committee. During such \n     travel, the personal staff member shall be considered to be \n     an employee of the Committee.\n       (d) Personal Representatives of the Member (PRM).--For the \n     purposes of Rule 11 as regards staff foreign travel, the \n     officially-designated personal representative of the member \n     (PRM) shall be deemed to have the same rights, duties, and \n     responsibilities as members of the staff of the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations. Furthermore, for the purposes of this \n     section, each Member of the Committee may designate one \n     personal staff member as the ``Personal Representative of the \n     Member.''\n\n\n                          rule 12--transcripts\n\n       (a) General.--The Committee on Foreign Relations shall keep \n     verbatim transcripts of all Committee and subcommittee \n     meetings and such transcripts shall remain in the custody of \n     the Committee, unless a majority of the Committee decides \n     otherwise. Transcripts of public hearings by the Committee \n     shall be published unless the Chairman, with the concurrence \n     of the Ranking Minority Member, determines otherwise.\n       (b) Classified or Restricted Transcripts.--\n       (1) The Chief Clerk of the Committee shall have \n     responsibility for the maintenance and security of classified \n     or restricted transcripts.\n       (2) A record shall be maintained of each use of classified \n     or restricted transcripts.\n       (3) Classified or restricted transcripts shall be kept in \n     locked combination safes in the Committee offices except when \n     in active use by authorized persons for a period not to \n     exceed 2 weeks. Extensions of this period may be granted as \n     necessary by the Chief Clerk. They must never be left \n     unattended and shall be returned to the Chief Clerk promptly \n     when no longer needed.\n       (4) Except as provided in paragraph 7 below, transcripts \n     classified secret or higher may not leave the Committee \n     offices except for the purpose of declassification.\n       (5) Classified transcripts other than those classified \n     secret or higher may leave the Committee offices in the \n     possession of authorized persons with the approval of the \n     Chairman. Delivery and return shall be made only by \n     authorized persons. Such transcripts may not leave \n     Washington, DC, unless adequate assurances for their security \n     are made to the Chairman.\n       (6) Extreme care shall be exercised to avoid taking notes \n     or quotes from classified transcripts. Their contents may not \n     be divulged to any unauthorized person.\n       (7) Subject to any additional restrictions imposed by the \n     Chairman with the concurrence of the Ranking Minority Member, \n     only the following persons are authorized to have access to \n     classified or restricted transcripts.\n       (i) Members and staff of the Committee in the Committee \n     rooms;\n       (ii) Designated personal representatives of members of the \n     Committee, and of the Majority and Minority Leaders, with \n     appropriate security clearances, in the Committee's Capitol \n     office;\n       (iii) Senators not members of the Committee, by permission \n     of the Chairman in the Committee rooms; and\n       (iv) Members of the executive departments involved in the \n     meeting, in the Committee's Capitol office, or, with the \n     permission of the Chairman, in the offices of the officials \n     who took part in the meeting, but in either case, only for a \n     specified and limited period of time, and only after reliable \n     assurances against further reproduction or dissemination have \n     been given.\n       (8) Any restrictions imposed upon access to a meeting of \n     the Committee shall also apply to the transcript of such \n     meeting, except by special permission of the Chairman and \n     notice to the other members of the Committee. Each transcript \n     of a closed session of the Committee shall include on its \n     cover a description of the restrictions imposed upon access, \n     as well as any applicable restrictions upon photocopying, \n     note-taking or other dissemination.\n       (9) In addition to restrictions resulting from the \n     inclusion of any classified information in the transcript of \n     a Committee meeting, members and staff shall not discuss with \n     anyone the proceedings of the Committee in closed session or \n     reveal information conveyed or discussed in such a session \n     unless that person would have been permitted to attend the \n     session itself, or unless such communication is specifically \n     authorized by the Chairman, the Ranking Minority Member, or \n     in the case of staff, by the Staff Director or Minority Staff \n     Director. A record shall be kept of all such authorizations.\n       (c) Declassification.--\n       (1) All restricted transcripts and classified Committee \n     reports shall be declassified on a date twelve years after \n     their origination unless the Committee by majority vote \n     decides against such declassification, and provided that the \n     executive departments involved and all former Committee \n     members who participated directly in the sessions or reports \n     concerned have been consulted in advance and given a \n     reasonable opportunity to raise objections to such \n     declassification.\n       (2) Any transcript or classified Committee report, or any \n     portion thereof, may be declassified fewer than twelve years \n     after their origination if:\n       (i) the Chairman originates such action or receives a \n     written request for such action, and notifies the other \n     members of the Committee;\n       (ii) the Chairman, Ranking Minority Member, and each member \n     or former member who participated directly in such meeting or \n     report give their approval, except that the Committee by \n     majority vote may overrule any objections thereby raised to \n     early declassification; and\n       (iii) the executive departments and all former Committee \n     members are consulted in advance and have a reasonable \n     opportunity to object to early declassification.\n\n\n                      rule 13--classified material\n\n       (a) All classified material received or originated by the \n     Committee shall be logged in at the Committee's offices in \n     the Dirksen Senate Office Building, and except for material \n     classified as ``Top Secret'' shall be filed in the Dirksen \n     Senate Building offices for Committee use and safekeeping.\n       (b) Each such piece of classified material received or \n     originated shall be card indexed and serially numbered, and \n     where requiring onward distribution shall be distributed by \n     means of an attached indexed form approved by the Chairman. \n     If such material is to be distributed outside the Committee \n     offices, it shall, in addition to the attached form, be \n     accompanied also by an approved signature sheet to show \n     onward receipt.\n       (c) Distribution of classified material among offices shall \n     be by Committee members or authorized staff only. All \n     classified material sent to members' offices, and that \n     distributed within the working offices of the Committee, \n     shall be returned to the offices designated by the Chief \n     Clerk. No classified material is to be removed from the \n     offices of the members or of the Committee without permission \n     of the Chairman. Such classified material will be afforded \n     safe handling and safe storage at all times.\n       (d) Material classified ``Top Secret,'' after being indexed \n     and numbered shall be sent to the Committee's Capitol office \n     for use by the members and authorized staff in that office \n     only or in such other secure Committee offices as may be \n     authorized by the Chairman or Staff Director.\n       (e) In general, members and staff undertake to confine \n     their access to classified information on the basis of a \n     ``need to know'' such information related to their Committee \n     responsibilities.\n\n[[Page S1247]]\n\n       (f) The Staff Director is authorized to make such \n     administrative regulations as may be necessary to carry out \n     the provisions of these regulations.\n\n\n                             rule 14--staff\n\n       (a) Responsibilities.--\n       (1) The staff works for the Committee as a whole, under the \n     general supervision of the Chairman of the Committee, and the \n     immediate direction of the Staff Director; provided, however, \n     that such part of the staff as is designated Minority Staff, \n     shall be under the general supervision of the Ranking \n     Minority Member and under the immediate direction of the \n     Minority Staff Director.\n       (2) Any member of the Committee should feel free to call \n     upon the staff at any time for assistance in connection with \n     Committee business. Members of the Senate not members of the \n     Committee who call upon the staff for assistance from time to \n     time should be given assistance subject to the overriding \n     responsibility of the staff to the Committee.\n       (3) The staff's primary responsibility is with respect to \n     bills, resolutions, treaties, and nominations. In addition to \n     carrying out assignments from the Committee and its \n     individual members, the staff has a responsibility to \n     originate suggestions for Committee or subcommittee \n     consideration. The staff also has a responsibility to make \n     suggestions to individual members regarding matters of \n     special interest to such members.\n       (4) It is part of the staff's duty to keep itself as well \n     informed as possible in regard to developments affecting \n     foreign relations and in regard to the administration of \n     foreign programs of the United States. Significant trends or \n     developments which might otherwise escape notice should be \n     called to the attention of the Committee, or of individual \n     Senators with particular interests.\n       (5) The staff shall pay due regard to the constitutional \n     separation of powers between the Senate and the executive \n     branch. It therefore has a responsibility to help the \n     Committee bring to bear an independent, objective judgment of \n     proposals by the executive branch and when appropriate to \n     originate sound proposals of its own. At the same time, the \n     staff shall avoid impinging upon the day-to-day conduct of \n     foreign affairs.\n       (6) In those instances when Committee action requires the \n     expression of minority views, the staff shall assist the \n     minority as fully as the majority to the end that all points \n     of view may be fully considered by members of the Committee \n     and of the Senate. The staff shall bear in mind that under \n     our constitutional system it is the responsibility of the \n     elected Members of the Senate to determine legislative issues \n     in the light of as full and fair a presentation of the facts \n     as the staff may be able to obtain.\n       (b) Restrictions.--\n       (1) The staff shall regard its relationship to the \n     Committee as a privileged one, in the nature of the \n     relationship of a lawyer to a client. In order to protect \n     this relationship and the mutual confidence which must \n     prevail if the Committee-staff relationship is to be a \n     satisfactory and fruitful one, the following criteria shall \n     apply:\n       (i) members of the staff shall not be identified with any \n     special interest group in the field of foreign relations or \n     allow their names to be used by any such group;\n       (ii) members of the staff shall not accept public speaking \n     engagements or write for publication in the field of foreign \n     relations without specific advance permission from the Staff \n     Director, or, in the case of minority staff, from the \n     Minority Staff Director. In the case of the Staff Director \n     and the Minority Staff Director, such advance permission \n     shall be obtained from the Chairman or the Ranking Minority \n     Member, as appropriate. In any event, such public statements \n     should avoid the expression of personal views and should not \n     contain predictions of future, or interpretations of past, \n     Committee action; and\n       (iii) staff shall not discuss their private conversations \n     with members of the Committee without specific advance \n     permission from the Senator or Senators concerned.\n       (2) The staff shall not discuss with anyone the proceedings \n     of the Committee in closed session or reveal information \n     conveyed or discussed in such a session unless that person \n     would have been permitted to attend the session itself, or \n     unless such communication is specifically authorized by the \n     Staff Director or Minority Staff Director. Unauthorized \n     disclosure of information from a closed session or of \n     classified information shall be cause for immediate dismissal \n     and may, in the case of some kinds of information, be grounds \n     for criminal prosecution.\n\n\n                 rule 15--status and amendment of rules\n\n       (a) Status.--In addition to the foregoing, the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations is governed by the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate which shall take precedence in the event of a clear \n     inconsistency. In addition, the jurisdiction and \n     responsibilities of the Committee with respect to certain \n     matters, as well as the timing and procedure for their \n     consideration in Committee, may be governed by statute.\n       (b) Amendment.--These Rules may be modified, amended, or \n     repealed by a majority of the Committee, provided that a \n     notice in writing of the proposed change has been given to \n     each member at least 48 hours prior to the meeting at which \n     action thereon is to be taken. However, Rules of the \n     Committee which are based upon Senate Rules may not be \n     superseded by Committee vote alone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/11/senate-section/article/S1244-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AUTHORIZING CORRECTION OF THE ENGROSSMENT OF SENATE RESOLUTION 10\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.
