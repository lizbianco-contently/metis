You \nhave told us in the Bible that there are blessings You grant only when \nwe care enough to pray for each other. Our attitudes are changed when \nwe do pray for one another. We listen better and conflicts are \nresolved. We discover answers to problems together because prayer has \nmade it easier to work out solutions. Working together becomes more \npleasant and more productive.\n  Knowing this, we make a specific commitment to pray for the people \nwith whom we disagree politically. As we pledge that we are one Nation \nunder You, help us to exemplify for our Nation what it means to be one \nhere in the Senate family, with unity in our diversity, held together \nwith the bonds of loyalty to You and to our Nation.\n  Today, we experience the power of intercessory prayer for very \nspecific needs. We ask You to comfort and encourage the survivors of \nthe tornado that leveled the town of Spencer, South Dakota.\n  Also, we ask You for the continued healing and health of Senator \nArlen Specter. Be with him now as he is in surgery.\n  And we join with Members of both parties in thanking You for the life \nand leadership of Senator Barry Goldwater who served here in the Senate \nfor 30 years. Bless his wife and family in this time of grief. In the \nName of our Lord and Savior.

Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of \nmorning business until 2 p.m. Following morning business, the Senate \nwill resume consideration of S. 1415, the tobacco legislation, with \nseveral amendments pending. As was announced prior to the recess, there \nwill be no rollcall votes during today's session. And also as a \nreminder to Members, a cloture motion was filed with respect to the \nmotion to proceed to the nuclear waste bill.

I know the distinguished \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee is anxious for us to return to \nthe DOD authorization bill. It is my intent to do that at the earliest \npossible opportunity and that work be completed on the authorization \nbill so that we can go to the military construction appropriations bill \nand the DOD appropriations bill.\n  We also may have some executive and legislative calendar items that \nwill be cleared for action. I believe we have at least one more \njudicial nomination, perhaps others, that we will be able to move on \ntoday. We are hopeful there will be some conference reports available \nthis week. Specifically, the Coverdell A+ education bill conference \nreport could be ready this week. Work will continue on the IRS \nconference report, but it looks like that may not be available until \nnext week.\n  Finally, I announce that with respect to the passing of our former \ncolleague, Senator Barry Goldwater, the Senate will not be in session \non Wednesday in honor of this distinguished Member of the U.S. Senate. \nMembers will be attending funeral services on that day in Arizona.\n  I thank my colleagues for their attention and their cooperation as we \ngo through the balance of this week.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/01/senate-section/article/S5489-5", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts).

Mr. President, I rise to speak a word or two about \nSenator Barry Goldwater. Senator Goldwater was a man of integrity, \nability, and dedication. When he announced he was going to run for \nPresident, I changed parties that year because I wanted to support this \nparticular man on account of the high principles for which he stood. I \ndid support him. Whether he had a chance to be elected or not, I wanted \nto have a part in supporting a man who stood for values, who stood for \nAmerica, and who stood for the good things of life.\n  Senator Goldwater served here for about 30 years. I enjoyed serving \nwith him. On account of that opportunity to serve with him--I knew a \ngood man when I saw one--that is the reason that I supported him for \nPresident. He carried my State, and he carried about five or six other \nStates. I was sorry he was not elected. He would have made a great \nPresident of the United States.\n  I extend my deepest sympathy to his family in this time of grieving.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I appreciate those remarks of the Senator from South Carolina who, of \ncourse, served with Senator Goldwater probably longer than anybody else \nin this body.\n  Senator Goldwater first came to the Senate in 1952 and completed his \nservice in the U.S. Senate in 1987. And, of course, we recall the time-\nout when he ran for President of the United States. But the first thing \nabout his service to this country, obviously, for us to note is his \nservice as a U.S. Senator, serving right here on this floor.\n  Mr. President, I would like to talk about Senator Goldwater for just \na few minutes this morning but focus on a couple of other aspects of \nhis life.\n  It is clear that for many of us, particularly my generation, he was \nan inspiration for us to become involved in politics and to approach it \nfrom what he called a ``commonsense conservative point of view.''\n  I remember in 1960 meeting him when I was a student at the University \nof Arizona in Tucson, AZ. He cared a lot about young people and was \nalways willing to come to the university and talk to us.\n  I had read the ``Conscience of a Conservative'' and was greatly \nimpressed with its commonsense approach to politics at the time. \nEverywhere I have gone over the years--and when I have been with \nSenator Goldwater--I have been impressed with the fact that people from \nall over the country would come up to him and say, ``Senator Goldwater, \nyou're the reason I got involved in politics. Yours was the first \ncampaign that I ever got involved in'' or ``It was your election that \nwas the first time I voted.''\n  He inspired Americans all over the country to become more involved in \npolitics and, as I said, to approach politics from his commonsense \nconservative point of view.\n  For the United States as a whole, I think our history will reflect \nthe fact that Senator Goldwater was one of the three people who really \nbegan the modern conservative movement in this country. I think he was \nthe first, along with Bill Buckley, providing a lot of the intellectual \nstimulus for the conservative movement through his publication, the \nNational Review. And, of course, Senator Goldwater paved the way later \nfor Ronald Reagan to become elected by the American people and to serve \ntwo terms with the tremendous conservative mandate of the American \npeople.\n  I think it is generally acknowledged that without Senator Goldwater's \nactivity here in the U.S. Senate, and also in his activities as a \nPresidential candidate in 1964, that the ascendancy of the Ronald \nReagan candidacy and his election by the American people would not have \noccurred.\n  So as a result, I think those of us here in the Senate reflect not \nonly on his service here in the Senate as chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, his service and very strong support for a strong \nnational defense for the United States, but also for being part of the \nbeginning of the conservative movement in this country. I find it \ninteresting that today most people call themselves conservatives in the \nsame way that Barry Goldwater did all the way back in 1958, 1960, when \nhe first came here.\n\n  Let me talk just a little bit about Senator Goldwater in a different \nsense, not in the sense of a Senator in this body, not in the sense of \na creator of the modern conservative movement in this country, but \nrather as the individual, because in Arizona a lot of people know Barry \nGoldwater a little bit differently, a lot of people whom no one else \nknows. They are not the big important people of the world, they are \npeople who grew up with Senator Goldwater. They are Navajo Indians whom \nhe got to know when he helped to run his family's trading post on the \nNavajo Indian reservation. They are people all over the State with whom \nhe visited when he traveled the State, hiked it, and photographed it. \nThere are veterans he visited with, people in the military all over the \ncountry, but particularly in Arizona, with whom he was very closely \nassociated. These are the people Barry Goldwater would reminisce with \nme about when I went to his home and visited with him, long after his \nGovernment service came to an end.\n  In fact, when I went to his house to visit with him, I expected him \nto talk about Senate business and get advice from him about what we \nshould be doing here. He didn't want to talk about that. He wanted to \nreminisce about people he had known way back when--the people who \nreally mattered to him most. They weren't kings, they weren't \npresidents, and they weren't Senators; they were regular folks from \nwhom he took a great deal of learning.\n  If you read ``Conscience of a Conservative'' again, and even if you \nreview the speech that he gave when he accepted the party's nomination \nin 1964 to run for President, you will see throughout a strong \nreference to the economic sense of people and the nature of people. He \ntalked, in ``Conscience of a Conservative,'' about the inherent nature \nof people, and he criticized some of his liberal friends for wanting to \nremake people in their image, basically, through Government action. His \npoint was, look, people are the way God made them, for better or for \nworse; we should recognize that human nature and formulate Government \npolicies to help permit people to live as they would as human beings, \nwithout trying to have Government make them into a particular type of \nperson or to direct their activities in a particular way. That is why \nhe became known as the great friend of freedom.\n  He was a person who did not believe Government should tell people \nwhat to do or even shouldn't tell people a great deal, because it would \nprevent them from helping to learn themselves. He understood human \nnature. How did he come to that understanding? Part of it is because he \nreally liked people and he liked to be with people. He learned from \nthem what it was that was the essence of the character of man.\n  I think a lot of that began, as I said, when he was living on the \nNavajo Indian reservation, tending to his family's trading post. The \nphotographs he has taken, particularly in his early life, frequently \nare commented upon as remarkable for capturing something very special, \nsome inner quality of the people he photographed. A lot of the people \nhe photographed were on the Navajo Indian reservation and the Hopi \nIndian reservation. I have one of his photographs hanging in my office \nof a young Navajo girl. There is something very, very special about \nthat. Every one of the photographs that he took of the people, you \nalmost feel that you know that person, that it is a very special \nperson. There is sort of an inner quality that comes out in his \nphotographs.\n\n  How did he do that? He didn't have the greatest camera equipment at \nthe time, although he has always been a fine photographer. He was \nsomehow able to capture the essence of people through his photography. \nI think part of it is because he got to know the people and he would \ntalk to them and ask them very nicely if they would mind being \nphotographed. He was able, therefore, to capture that essence of \nhumanity that I think most of us miss. We are all too busy, too busy \nwith the big important things in life.\n  Barry Goldwater focused a lot on the little things in life, which is \nanother reason he was such a great photographer of Arizona landscape. \nHe found\n\n[[Page S5491]]\n\nbeauty in places that many of us would have passed over because we were \nin a hurry. Now we reflect on those photographs and think, how could \nanyone have captured that the way he did? Some of which, incidentally, \nMr. President, are very valuable because they show, for example, trips \ndown the Grand Canyon in areas that are now dammed up and we will never \nsee them the way he saw them and the way the photographs captured them.\n  My point here is that in recent years when I visited with Senator \nGoldwater, I learned a lot more from him about people than I did about \npolitical philosophy and what we should be doing with these great \nmomentous decisions here that we debate on the Senate floor. In this \nrespect, Senator Goldwater was a lot like my own father, who also had \nthe privilege of serving in the U.S. Congress, representing the State \nof Iowa. He, too, is a great photographer. And he, too, sees that \nsomething special in people and in places that he has been able to \nphotograph. He, too, thinks a great deal about individual people and \nwhat they meant. And he, too, likes to reminisce about people in his \nearlier years.\n  I suppose that happens to all of us when we get a little bit older, \nbut part of it is because not only do we remember those people, but we \nreflect, now, upon an entire life and we understand what is important \nand what isn't. We understand that part of what is really important \nabout life is the people we got to know and what we have learned from \nthem. I learned a great deal from my father, just as I have from \nSenator Goldwater, about human nature. I think that knowledge is better \nfor us as public servants than any other schooling we could get or any \nother studying we could do.\n  In reflecting on Senator Goldwater's life after he passed away on \nFriday, it just occurred to me that the things I want to share about \nhim are these reflections about the individuals he knew and what he \nlearned from them, something that probably will not be greatly \ncommented upon by others who will reflect upon his service here in the \nSenate, his strong support for national defense, his creation of the \nmodern conservative movement--as I said, his leading of that movement \nthrough much of the period of the 1960s. All of that was very, very \nimportant. That is why he will go down in the history books as a great \nAmerican leader, as a great American patriot.\n  But as I said, he was also, to me, a teacher. One of the reasons for \nhis greatness was the fact that he understood the importance of the \nlittle things in life, the little things that create beauty, the little \nthings that make us all what we are. I think if more people understood \nthat human nature as Senator Goldwater did, because he experienced it \nso much in his early life, that all of us in this body and in the other \nbody would be much better representatives of the people for whom we \nwork, because we would better understand their desires, their hopes, \ntheir needs, and perhaps would better be able to reflect those hopes, \nneeds, and desires in the kind of policy that we help to set here in \nWashington, DC.\n\n  A final point in closing, Mr. President. Senator Goldwater, of \ncourse, was very blunt and outspoken. I think a little bit of that \nwould go a long way these days, too--to say what we really think, \nirrespective of the political consequences. Now, some have said he \ncould afford to do that because in 1964 he was running a race that he \ncouldn't win and so he had the luxury, in effect, of just saying what \nwas on his mind. If you know Barry Goldwater, he didn't just limit it \nto the 1964 campaign; he said what was on his mind, regardless of the \ncircumstances, when he was beginning in politics and all the way \nthrough to the day he died.\n  All of us, I think, could benefit by trying to be a little bit more \ncandid in how we express ourselves. He and Ronald Reagan, I think, \nfound the same thing. When you do that, it is surprising how \nappreciative people are and how politically popular, sometimes, you can \nbe by simply saying what is on your mind. People understand when you \nare politicking versus when you are talking from the heart. It is not \nhard for people to see through what most of us say. That is why a lot \nof politicians do not have very good reputations. I think if more of us \nreflected on the way Barry Goldwater did it, we would find it is not \nonly a more candid approach but it also can have very good benefits for \npeople to see that all of us are willing to express ourselves in a very \ncandid and a very open way.\n  So he has taught us a great deal. I think as people put the parts of \nhis life together, it all fits together in a mosaic that created a \nunique individual. We will find additional lessons to take from his \nlong and very productive life. I am looking forward, Mr. President, to \nvisiting with other Members of this body to learn of their experiences \nwith Senator Goldwater, because of course I didn't have the opportunity \nto serve with him.\n  In the time that he was here, Senator Goldwater, I think, represented \nArizona in a way that permitted those of us in Arizona to refer to him \nas Mr. Arizona, a person who reflected really a great deal about our \nown State. Mr. President, it is from that standpoint that I approach, \nnot with a great deal of sadness, but rather with some degree of \ncelebration, the fact that he was able to serve in this body so long, \nto represent the State of Arizona for so long, to be really reflective \nof our State, and he will go down in the history books not as a great \nnational and international figure, but probably as the most important \nand famous Arizonan, at least in my lifetime, and someone who I think \nall of us in Arizona were proud to have as a representative of our \nState.\n\n  I am looking forward to joining many of my colleagues Wednesday in \nPhoenix at his funeral which, as his wife told me, will be more of a \ncelebration of his life and of all of the things that he did, both for \nhis State and for this country. I am sure we will hear a lot of stories \nand do a lot of laughing about Barry--and a lot of crying about the \nfact that he is gone. But the fact of the matter is that we have an \nopportunity to reflect on an individual who we have loved very much, \nand we want to make the most of that opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to come here this morning to give a few \nreflections, not in the usual vein of his political accomplishments and \nwhat he did as a Senator, but more what I saw in him, especially in his \nlater years, as an individual who just wanted to be remembered as an \nhonest man.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I gather that my colleague, Senator \nKyl, has taken some time to speak about Senator Goldwater.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I only heard about his remarks. Let me thank my \ncolleague from Arizona for coming to the floor to speak. I am sure we \nwill hear from Senator McCain as well, if we haven't already.\n  As a Senator, I suppose, on the other side of the ideological \ncontinuum--if that is, in fact, even relevant; sometimes I don't think \nit is. I don't think politics has that much to do with left to right to \ncenter; I think it has more to do with trying to do well for people, \nand we have all reached different conclusions about how to do that. But \nit is about public service. I just want to say to the Goldwater family \nthat I think Barry Goldwater really set a standard, especially when it \ncomes to personal integrity and intellectual integrity and political \nintegrity. And I think people in our country really yearn for that. His \noutspokenness, and especially his courage, and especially in recent \nyears his willingness to speak out, even after no longer being in \noffice, to continue to serve our country I think really is inspiring \nfor all of us.\n  I wish to add my words to the really fine words of the Senator from \nArizona.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Wellstone pertaining to the submission of S. Res. \n238 are located in today's Record under ``Submission of Concurrent and \nSenate Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Mr. President, as we near the summer of this legislative \nsession and discuss the agenda remaining for this Congress, I want to \nraise, as my colleagues and I have for many, many days in this Chamber, \none of the pieces of legislation we want considered in the Senate \nduring this session of the Senate. That legislation is the Patients' \nBill of Rights.\n  About 160 million Americans are now enrolled in managed care \norganizations. HMOs--health maintenance organizations, one of the main \ntypes of managed care--can save money and they can improve care. But by \nthe same token, managed health care organizations can cause real \nserious problems for many Americans. I want to describe just a few of \nthem and describe why we believe a Patients' Bill of Rights should be \nenacted by this Congress.\n  To describe part of the problem with managed care organizations, let \nme tell the story of a woman who had just suffered a brain injury. As \nshe was lying in an ambulance being hauled to a hospital, with her \nbrain swelling, she advised the ambulance drivers that she wanted to be \ntaken to the hospital that was farther away, rather than the nearest \nhospital.\n  She survived and was asked later why she issued directions to be \ntaken to the hospital farther away. She said she had learned a lot \nabout the hospital that was nearest to the ambulance at that point, and \nit was a hospital that by reputation had made health care a function of \nits profit and loss statement. She did not feel comfortable presenting \nherself to an emergency room where her care was going to be a function \nof someone else's profit and loss.\n  And that is something that concerns a lot of the American people \nthese days, especially as health care moves more towards for-profit \nhealth care, more towards managed care. Let me give you another \nexample.\n  This example, whose name is Wendy Connelly, a wife and mother from \nSherwood, OR, is yet another reason why we need a Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n  In 1994, Wendy Connelly experienced symptoms of what she feared was a \nheart attack, including heaviness in her chest and a heart that began \nbeating wildly, at a rate approaching 150 beats per minute. She thought \nshe was having a heart attack, so Wendy sought treatment at the local \nhospital emergency room, as one would likely do in that situation. \nFortunately for Wendy, the doctors on call treated her for what was not \na heart attack, but rather, a previously undiagnosed thyroid imbalance. \nWhen she first began to fear the worst, Wendy had contacted her HMO's \non-call physician for advice. Obviously, he was unable to make an over-\nthe-phone diagnosis for her, and he told her to seek emergency room \ncare if her symptoms did not subside. And so she did. But when the bill \ncame due, the HMO denied payment of Wendy Connelly's claim. They said \nthat her case was not deemed emergency care. The HMO was basing its \ndecision on the final diagnosis, not the heart-attack like symptoms \nthat sent her to the emergency room.\n  Wendy Connelly, to her credit, felt that the HMO was wrong in its \ndenial, and so, for more than a year, she sent letters explaining what \nhad happened. Even her doctors and the hospital that treated her urged \nthe HMO to cover that claim. Finally, the HMO conceded and she was no \nlonger liable for the costs that she incurred more than a year before. \nBut she decided that she would help others in this situation who were \nbeing unfairly denied coverage, so she filed a complaint against the \nHMO with the Oregon Department of Insurance. It was found by the \nDepartment of Insurance that what had happened to Wendy Connelly was a \nroutine practice for this insurer. If a person went to the emergency \nroom but found that the final diagnosis is not something that would \nrequire emergency care, despite what the presenting symptoms were, then \nthe claim was denied.\n  Here is what Wendy said:\n\n       I went to an emergency room (because) I thought I was \n     having a heart attack. . . . I felt that if I went somewhere \n     else or delayed longer, I would (have been) putting my life \n     in jeopardy.\n\n  But all across the country now we discover these cases, time after \ntime after time, of the managed care organizations deciding that they \nwon't cover someone showing up in an emergency room. Or, in fact, some \nof them have clauses in their contracts with their doctors that say if \na doctor's patient shows up in the emergency room, it comes out of the \ndoctor's compensation for the managed care organization. You talk about \na terrible incentive; you talk about a conflict of interest; that is \nit.\n  We have proposed a Patients' Bill of Rights, proposed by Democrats \nand Republicans, in the Congress. Let me go through, just for a moment, \nwhat some of these rights would be.\n  Patients in this country ought to have an opportunity to know all of \nthe medical options available to treat their illness or disease--all of \nthe medical options, not just the cheapest. A number of managed care \norganizations have gag rules in their contracts with their doctors. \nThey will only allow their doctors to tell patients what they want the \npatients to know. If there are other treatments available, perhaps \nbetter treatments, treatments that are more appropriate but perhaps \nmore expensive, then they have no obligation to tell the patient that \nthere are other treatment options. Many patients worry, and some \ninvestigations confirm, that often the patients learn not all of the \ntreatments available but only those which are the cheapest.\n  You have a right to choose the doctor you want for the care you need, \nincluding specialty care. One person from my home state of North Dakota \nwhose employer recently switched to a closed network health plan has a \nchronic heart condition. But his new health plan has refused to allow \nhim to see the cardiologist who has been caring for him for this heart \ncondition for a decade. This employee has no option to choose a health \nplan that will allow him to continue seeing his cardiologist, even \nthough he says he is willing to pay for that right. So under the \nPatients' Bill of Rights, patients will have the right to choose the \ndoctor they want for the care they need.\n\n  You have the right to emergency room care whenever and wherever you \nneed it. In fact, a Missouri managed care organization plan sent all of \nits customers a letter saying a trip to the emergency room with a \nbroken leg, or a baby running a high fever, should not generally be \nassumed to be covered. The letter read like this:\n\n       An emergency room visit for medical treatment is not \n     automatically covered under your benefit plan.\n\n  An Arkansas woman suffered a broken neck in a car wreck and was \nrushed to the hospital. Her managed care company refused to pay for her \nemergency room care--this is a patient with a broken neck from a car \naccident--because she failed to get prior authorization. Managed care \norganizations think that the first thing to do when you break your neck \nin a car accident is to seek prior authorization to get to an emergency \nroom? So, another of the patients' rights is the right to emergency \nroom care whenever and wherever you need it.\n  You also have the right to a fair and speedy process for resolving \ndisputes with your health care plan. You have the right to considerate, \nrespectful care without discrimination. You have the right to keep your \nmedical records confidential.\n  Why is it important that these rights be made available to patients? \nBecause too many managed care organizations are denying those basic \nrights to American citizens and to those who are sick right now. We \nhave a proposal that has been dealt with by the Senate, dealing with \nmastectomies. Why should the Senate be talking about the length of \nhospital stays available for a woman who has a mastectomy? Because \nmanaged care organizations are taking these women into hospitals for \nmastectomies, radical mastectomies, and 8, 10, 12 hours later, with \ntubes coming from their bodies, sending them home. And the same is true \nwith\n\n[[Page S5493]]\n\ndrive-through baby deliveries. That is why Congress addressed that \nparticular problem in 1996.\n  Is this body part by body part legislation the best way to address \nthese issues? No, not for Congress to be dealing with these specific \nprocedures. But why are we even confronted with this? Because health \ncare all too often--regrettably, for those who are sick, for those who \nare in need of health care--has become more a function of dollars and \ncents, more a function of someone's profit and loss, than someone \nelse's critically needed health care. That is why we want a Patients' \nBill of Rights passed by this Congress.\n  Some say this will cost a lot of money. No it will not. The ultimate \ncost for the American people is to deny treatment, to deny coverage, \nand deny opportunity for those who are sick to get the treatment they \nneed. If you want to mushroom the health care bill in this country, \nthen keep doing what we are doing and say to the American people: If \nyou break your neck, we won't pay for emergency services for you \nbecause your first stop should be some accountant's desk to get prior \nauthorization. Your first stop, before the doctor's office or the \nhospital room, is to appeal to some accountant in an insurance office \n500 miles away to ask what kind of health care delivery that managed \ncare plan will give you, your child, your parents, or your family. That \ndoesn't make any sense.\n  Doctors all across my State and across this country support the \nPatients' Bill of Rights, because they understand medicine ought to be \npracticed in the doctor's office and in the hospital room, not in some \ninsurance company's office by some junior accountant who is 500 or \n1,000 miles away from the problem the patient is suffering.\n  Mr. President, I hope very much that in the coming weeks this \nCongress will include on its agenda a Patients' Bill of Rights so that \nall Americans will understand their rights and all managed care \norganizations will understand their obligations to people in this \ncountry when they need health care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/01/senate-section/article/S5492-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5493-S5494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              FARM CRISIS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as I finish my time I want to turn to a \nseparate matter for a moment to discuss some meetings that I held in \nNorth Dakota during this past week. While the U.S. Senate was not in \nsession, I held a number of farm neighbor meetings around North Dakota \nto talk about the farm crisis that exists in our part of the country. \nIt is not something you read much about, but it exists and it is \nserious.\n  We have seen all kinds of natural disasters and they break your \nheart. We have seen tornadoes, earthquakes and floods. We have had \nfloods in North Dakota, our neighboring State of South Dakota had \ndevastating tornadoes over the weekend. They are all tough to deal \nwith.\n  But there is another kind of crisis and disaster that occurs that \ndoes not come from a single event that climaxes in massive, visible \nimmediate destruction. I am talking about a farm crisis that is \ndevastating farm families in States like North Dakota. Chronic grain \ndisease, such as scab that results in vomitoxin, chronically low farm \nprices, a wet cycle, diminished production, and a range of other things \nhave combined to put literally thousands and thousands of family \nfarmers in harm's way. By harm's way, I mean these farmers are not \ngoing to get financing to put in another year's crop. They are going to \nsee their lifelong dream of operating their family farm gone, ripped \napart and torn to shreds.\n  At one of the farm neighbor meetings I had, there were three \ngenerations of farmers sitting there--a granddad, a dad and a son. The \nson was about 20 years old, kind of a husky young man. The granddad \nstarted that farm many, many decades ago, and the father took over that \nfarm. Now the son is getting ready to graduate from college and would \nlike to come back and farm as well. But the son said he wasn't sure he \nwas going to be able to do that. In fact, the dad wasn't sure he was \ngoing to be able to hold on to the farm even if his son did want to \nfarm it. Three generations of farmers and their hope for the future is \ngone.\n  At one of the farm meetings we had, the sky clouded up with big black \nstorm clouds to the west. A storm was imminent, when one of the farmers \nstood up and explained what a lot of people probably do not understand.\n  He said, ``You know, I've lost money 4 years in a row. I run a small \ngrains farm. I put my kids through college. This is what I love to do. \nIt is what I know to do,'' and he said, ``yet, the grain prices are far \nbelow my cost of production. We have had crop disease and every problem \nyou virtually can conceive of, and I don't know how long I can keep \nfarming.''\n  He said, ``See that cloud bank out west. Those storm clouds that will \nbe here in an hour or so, that's pressure. That's pressure for us, and \npeople don't understand that. That might ruin what little crop that has \nstarted to come. That might wash out seeds that haven't yet sprouted. \nThat is pressure.''\n  You don't think much about that until you sit on those farmsteads and \nvisit with the farmers who are trying to make a living under very \ndifficult circumstances.\n  Farmers are the only business men and women in this country who have \nthe following kinds of problems of risk: One, when they plant a seed \nafter they plow the soil in spring, they have no idea whether the crop \nis going to grow, whether it be wheat, barley, flax, or corn. If it \ngrows, maybe a month later the grasshoppers come. Maybe it is insects, \nmaybe it is hail, maybe crop disease or maybe a dozen other things \nconspire to destroy that crop.\n  But maybe the crop doesn't get destroyed and the farmer harvests the \ncrop and takes it to the grain elevator. Then maybe, as is the \ncircumstance today, that farmer gets $2 a bushel less than it cost him \nto produce the wheat. Then the farmer wonders, ``I took all these risks \nand end up losing all my money, all my equity, and then I am told by my \nbanker that the U.S. Congress changed the farm program and reduced \nprice supports so I can't cashflow anymore. Because Congress changed \nthe farm programs, I no longer have the loans available to me to put in \nthe spring crop.'' And they rightfully wonder what is happening to our \ncountry.\n\n  We must, as a country, do something if we want to save family \nfarmers. This country has an obligation to stand up in international \ntrade and farm policy. We need to say that a network of family farms in \nour country's future matters to this nation.\n  We can do better in a range of areas. We need a better crop insurance \nprogram, a better price support program, and better trade policies that \nprevent other countries from unfair trade practices against us. We can \ndo all these things.\n  This Congress, in my judgment, has a responsibility now to respond to \nthe growing farm crisis. I hope my colleagues who come from farm States \nwill understand that this is not some parochial issue. It is not some \nparochial concern that is of no consequence to anyone else.\n  It is of consequence to everyone in this country whether or not our \nfamily farmers have an opportunity to survive and succeed. I think it \nis interesting, Mr. President, that the price of wheat has gone from \n$5.50 a bushel to $3.50 a bushel, nearly $2 below the cost of \nproduction for a bushel of wheat. And yet, at the same time, the folks \nin town go to the grocery store and they discover the price of bread \nhas increased a bit. The price of wheat has dropped like an anvil, and \nthe price of bread keeps going up. The price of wheat drops, the price \nof cereal keeps going up. What it says is that family farmers are down \nthere at the bottom of the economic totem pole. Yet, they are the ones \nwho produce. They plow the ground in the spring, they harvest it in the \nfall, they take all the risks in between and, in all the circumstances, \nthey are the ones who lose the money. At the same time the big millers \nhave record profits and the big grocer manufacturers have record \nprofits. You can take a look at the big grain trading companies--record \nprofits.\n  Everybody profits, except those who have to put on work clothes to \nplant the field and harvest the crop. It is everybody who doesn't have \nto work in that kind of a situation who makes a record profit, while \nthe farm families are going out of business.\n  In my home State, they have had to call auctioneers out of retirement \nto handle the number of auction sales for\n\n[[Page S5494]]\n\nfamily farms going out of business this year. There is something wrong \nwhen we say as a country, ``Gee, our economic policy is working quite \nwell,'' and then we see all these family farmers going out of business.\n  One part of this is trade, and I might just finish today by \nmentioning trade. In almost every circumstance, this country has \nrefused to stand with its producers on trade, and that is especially \ntrue with farm producers. It has refused to do what it should have done \non United States-Canada grain trade in which this country is flooded \nwith subsidized Canadian grain. It refuses to do what it should do with \nrespect to China, Japan, and Europe.\n  Just last week, we finally began confronting unfair trade, when the \nSecretary of Agriculture took action against the European Union for \nsending a ship that docked in California loaded with barley. That \nbarley was deeply subsidized, to the tune of over $1 a bushel. \nSecretary Glickman, to his credit, took the first action. It was a \nstep, it was a baby step, but, nevertheless, a step in the right \ndirection. In taking it Secretary Glickman is saying to the European \nUnion: ``You can't do that to this country. You can't do that to our \nfarmers. You can't take money directly out of our farmers' pockets. In \nthis case of unfair trade, you can't do that with impunity. This \ncountry will not allow you to do that.''\n  Mr. President, I am going to speak later this week about farm policy \nand some of the related issues that we have to deal with--crop \ninsurance, trade, price supports, investment in research for crop \ndisease, and a whole range of other things.\n  I say to my colleagues, this is critically important. There is, \nindeed, a farm crisis and we have a responsibility to respond to it in \na thoughtful and important way.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/01/senate-section/article/S5493-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 1415, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1415) to reform and restructure the processes by \n     which tobacco products are manufactured, marketed, and \n     distributed, to prevent the use of tobacco products by \n     minors, to redress the adverse health effects of tobacco use, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n       Gregg/Leahy amendment No. 2433 (to amendment No. 2420), to \n     modify the provisions relating to civil liability for tobacco \n     manufacturers.\n       Gregg/Leahy amendment No. 2434 (to amendment No. 2420), in \n     the nature of a substitute.\n       Gramm motion to recommit the bill to the Committee on \n     Finance with instructions to report back forthwith, with \n     amendment No. 2436, to modify the provisions relating to \n     civil liability for tobacco manufacturers, and to eliminate \n     the marriage penalty reflected in the standard deduction and \n     to ensure the earned income credit takes into account the \n     elimination of such penalty.\n       Daschle (for Durbin) amendment No. 2437 (to amendment No. \n     2436), relating to reductions in underaged tobacco usage.\n       Daschle (for Durbin) amendment No. 2438 (to amendment No. \n     2437), of a perfecting nature.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to express some of my \nconcerns dealing with the tobacco tax increase legislation that we are \nclose to considering, including how we deal with this country's tobacco \nfarmers.\n  I believe we should do what we can to assist tobacco farmers and \ntheir communities' transition for a supposed decrease in demand for \ntobacco products that will result from this bill's passage.\n  However, I would like to share this cartoon by Mr. Ed Fischer which \nillustrates a very important point: Do we value tobacco farming and \ntobacco-dependent communities more than other producers and their \ncommunities? ``Guess which farmers in trouble will get a huge \ngovernment bailout?'' I have serious doubts this legislation will \nactually reduce tobacco growth and consumption in this country as much \nas proponents claim. As such, I question whether the type of support we \nare willing to rush in and throw at tobacco producers and tobacco-\ndependent communities is warranted.\n\n  My understanding is, under both proposals, there is no requirement \nthat tobacco farmers actually stop producing tobacco; they will just \nhave to assume all the risk, like other farmers under the freedom to \nfarm bill which was signed into law in April of 1996. The freedom to \nfarm bill contained transition payments, but those payments pale in \ncomparison to what we are talking about here. All crops combined under \nthe transition to Freedom to Farm--corn, wheat, soybeans, et cetera--\namounted to less than $1,500 per acre over 7 years. This bill would \namount to about $18,000 per acre over 3 years. Yes, it is a phase-out \nof the tobacco program, but let us be fair to the farmers, but also let \nus be fair to the taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, I am very sympathetic to the plight of tobacco \nfarmers, their families and their communities, who suffer as a direct \nresult of Federal policy. The tobacco farmers are certainly not alone \nin facing unfavorable--even crushing--circumstances at the hands of the \nCongress.\n  The point I now propose is that we cannot hope to maintain any \nsemblance of consistency if we favor one agriculture product over all \nothers. Let us not get caught up in the hype of this tobacco \nlegislation today to forge a plan that will cost taxpayers more than \nnecessary. Let us be fair, but let us be reasonable. How can we explain \nwhy we favor one product over another?\n  My colleagues and I from the Upper Midwest have been fighting a \nconstant battle against Federal dairy policy for years.\n  And again just look at this cartoon: ``Guess which farmers in trouble \nwill get a huge government bailout * * *''\n  The dairy producers of the Upper Midwest have long been disadvantaged \nby having to bear the burden of unjustifiable dairy policy which does \nnot reflect the realities of modern dairy economics. This current \nFederal policy--specifically, Class I milk price differentials--is \nwidely recognized as antiquated, unjustifiable, and patently unfair.\n  In fact, USDA's current Federal marketing order system was deemed \n``arbitrary and capricious'' by a Federal district court judge late \nlast year. The case brought against USDA has been in the courts for 7 \nyears, and the judge's ruling was no less than the fourth such \nproceeding in the history of the case.\n  The courts have ruled four separate times the Federal dairy program \nis arbitrary and capricious. Bottom line, it is unfair. And what has \nbeen the response of the USDA? Not to accept the decision but to \nappeal. The Government should not be in the business of picking winners \nand losers in agriculture, but it is doing so in this case.\n  I hate to be arguing the dairy issue during the debate on a tobacco \nbill today, but I believe it supports my argument that: if we are to go \nabout bailouts in a reasonable manner, we should address the Upper \nMidwest dairy farmers as well. Would anyone in this Senate vote to pay \nour dairy farmers $18,000 an acre? I doubt it.\n  Dairy farmers have endured inequities for decades. We in Minnesota in \nfact are losing an average of three dairy farms every single day. The \nirony is that milk is a health product. It is a product we encourage \nour children to consume. How can we possibly suggest that Minnesota's \ndairy industry does not deserve equal protection from this Congress?\n  Mr. President, I would also like to express my opposition to S. 1415 \nin its entirety.\n  I have listened to a number of my colleagues come to the floor and \nclaim many things and cite many statistics. One of those statistics was \nthat 75 percent of regular smokers could not quit if they wanted to. \nWhile I will not take issue with this figure, I do have a problem with \nthe fact that proponents of this bill are so willing to take advantage \nof these smokers' inability to quit.\n\n[[Page S5495]]\n\n  Let us forget about the figures and rhetoric for a moment and ask the \nmore important question: Why are we persecuting these people because of \ntheir addiction?\n  If someone is addicted to alcohol, are we going to increase taxes on \nthem? If someone is addicted to drugs, are we going to increase taxes \non them? Of course not, because we give them all sorts of Government \nbenefits amounting to thousands of dollars a year.\n  So if you are addicted to one type of drug, the Government is going \nto give you thousands of dollars a year in assistance, but if you are \naddicted to another type of drug--in this case nicotine--we are going \nto tax you more money every year.\n  Congress wants to tax you, in fact, at a rate of about $1,400 a year. \nAnd it simply does not make sense. It does not make sense for us to be \ndiscussing this legislation as if it were a tobacco settlement.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary status at this \npoint with respect to the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Currently, we are on the consideration of S. \n1415, and there is a motion to recommit pending with amendments pending \nthereto.\n  Mr. KERRY. That is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. As well as amendments pending to the \nunderlying measure.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, at this point in time I believe I have the \nfloor; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask my colleague from Minnesota how long \nit would be his intention to speak, if he did wish to continue to \nspeak?\n  Mr. GRAMS. It would be for only about another 5 to 7 minutes--less \nthan 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Minnesota be recognized to complete his comments without my losing \nthe right to the floor at that point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Senator for allowing me to finish this \nstatement.\n  Just to finish, Mr. President, we are talking about the tobacco bill \nand addiction. And I just say, let us forget about the figures and \nrhetoric for a moment that is surrounding this bill and ask the more \nimportant question: Why are we persecuting these people because of an \naddiction?\n\n  Now again, if someone is addicted to alcohol, are we going to \nincrease taxes on them? If someone is addicted to drugs, are we going \nto go out and increases taxes on them? Of course not, because we give \nthem all sorts of Government benefits amounting to thousands of dollars \na year if they are addicted to alcohol or other illegal drugs. But if \nyou are addicted to nicotine, Congress wants to tax you as much as \n$1,400 a year. And I believe it simply does not make sense.\n  It also does not make sense for us to be discussing this legislation \nas if it were a tobacco settlement. This is not a tobacco settlement. \nIt is a tax increase to pay for increased Government spending programs. \nSupporters of this tax increase assert that if you vote against this \nbill, you are for big tobacco--if you vote against this bill, you are \nfor big tobacco--if you vote for it, you are compassionate and you are \ntaking a stand for the health of our children. But this isn't really \nabout our children, is it? It is about lining Washington's coffers with \nmore taxpayer dollars.\n  Let us talk about the statistic that 3,000 kids start smoking every \nday. That statistic has been thrown around the floor of the Senate and \nthe White House with complete disregard for the facts. In his \neditorial, entitled ``Child's Ploy,'' Jacob Sullum points out--and I \nquote--\n\n       This estimate comes from an article published in the \n     Journal of the American Medical Association in January of \n     1989. Based on data from a National Health Interview Survey, \n     the authors estimated that one million ``young persons'' \n     became regular smokers each year during the 1980s [again, \n     that one million ``young persons'' became regular smokers \n     each year during the 1980s], which amounts to about three \n     thousand a day.\n\n  That figure refers to 20-year-olds. And since the study did not \ninclude data for anyone younger than that, somehow these now ``young \npersons'' have metamorphosed into kids. At least one commentator on \nCNBC referred to them as ``babies.''\n  It started out as people 20 years old, ``young persons,'' and somehow \nit got transformed into ``kids.'' And even one commentator referred to \nthem as ``babies.'' I think this demonstrates how far the crusaders are \nwilling to go to punish and tax adult smokers in order to fund \nWashington's wish list for more Government spending.\n  There was another point Mr. Sullum made which I think deserves to be \nvoiced on the floor. He wrote:\n\n       While it may be true that the young are especially \n     attracted to smoking, it is probably also true that people \n     who are especially attracted to smoking tend to start young.\n\n  Mr. President, I agree, we should be doing more to reduce and \ndiscourage our children from smoking. I do not believe the legislation \nbefore us is truly about reducing teen smoking or recovering the \nGovernment's cost of providing health care to smokers. It is about \nmoney.\n  When I ran for the Senate 4 years ago, I made a very simple promise \nduring my campaign. I said I would never vote to increase taxes. The \nbill before us does just that--increases taxes on those who use tobacco \nproducts, who largely are the ones who can least afford a $1,400-a-year \ntax increase. The lion's share of the hundreds of billions of dollars \ncollected under this bill will come from families and individuals who \nearn $30,000 a year or less. That is simply wrong.\n\n  During debate on this bill, there have been some who have questioned \nthe sincerity of our concern for the well-being of America's working \npeople. They go on and on to say, if we are so concerned about their \nwell-being, we should vote for an increase in the minimum wage later \nthis year. I guess that will be great for the teenagers who, by the \nway, hold most of the minimum wage jobs in America, because they then \nwill be able to afford the cigarettes on which we are just about to \nhike the taxes.\n  It has been said by proponents that everyone and anyone who votes \nagainst this legislation has been bought off by big tobacco and we \ndon't care about our children. Of course, nothing could be further from \nthe truth. Frankly, I resent that type of accusation.\n  During the Budget Committee's consideration of the budget resolution, \nI voted for what I thought was the most appropriate use of any tobacco \nsettlement funds--dedicate them to Medicare. After all, isn't that \nwhere most of the smoking-related illness costs are?\n  There was another important provision from the budget resolution as \nwell. We increased funding for youth smoking cessation programs. The \nbudget assumed $825 million would be spent on trying to prevent teens \nfrom smoking and helping those who are trying to quit. The States are \nincreasing their efforts in this regard as well. This is a positive \napproach and addresses the underlying problems that we face.\n  It should be noted that our budget this year more than doubled the \namount of money spent on preventing teen smoking than President Clinton \nhad even requested in his budget, and he assumed at that time that \nthere would be a tobacco tax. So we included twice as much in our \nbudget, not assuming that.\n  This legislation before the Senate today is not about protecting kids \nfrom tobacco. It is not about punishing big tobacco. It is not about \nhealth care either. This is just one more way for Washington to take \nand spend more of the taxpayers' money.\n  Mr. President, if and when this legislation is fully phased in, \nFederal and State Governments will be profiting more by the sale of \ntobacco products than the manufacturer. Again, Mr. President, if this \nbill is phased in, State and Federal Governments will be profiting more \nby the sale of tobacco products than the manufacturer. Something is \nhorribly wrong when tax rates reach that proportion.\n  Mr. President, in 1997, a man in Kentucky pleaded guilty to one of \nthe largest cigarette smuggling cases in our Nation's history. Over the \nperiod of just 1 year, this individual made nearly $30 million--$30 \nmillion transporting contraband cigarettes.\n\n[[Page S5496]]\n\n  I learned of this story from the National Association of Police \nOrganizations, which sent me a letter also opposing S. 1415, again, \nbecause of the threat of increased black market activity, which is \nclearly already occurring. Those of us with border States know how \nprevalent and easy smuggling already is. Will we just shut down our \nborders, or will we search every person crossing them?\n  Other law enforcement organizations have weighed in, sharing \nbasically the same concerns about a potential black market: The \nFraternal Order of Police, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers \nAssociation, the International Union of the Police Associations, and \nthe International Association of Chiefs of Police. All of these \norganizations, whose primary duty is to enforce the law of our Nation, \nrecognize this legislation will be the catalyst for a huge black market \nin cigarettes. As a result, teen smoking will probably increase, not \ndecrease.\n\n  Supporters of this legislation claim we need to increase taxes to get \na shock value from it. I want to remind my colleagues of what four very \nbright teenagers had to say at a House Commerce Committee hearing on \nyouth smoking when asked if price were really a factor in whether teens \nbuy cigarettes. One of the teens said if money were a huge issue, then \nkids wouldn't be buying marijuana as much.\n  I believe this teen has it right and also brings up another important \nissue. When asked what they believed to be the most pressing problem \nfor our Nation's high schools, all agreed that alcohol and marijuana \nwere much more serious. If the same commitment this administration and \nthis Congress have shown to fighting tobacco had been applied to the \ndrug problem, I think we would be hearing a very different answer. \nUnder this legislation, we will fund massive new Government programs \nfor tobacco but we will remain silent about the drug problem in our \nNation. I question whether this is the wisest course for us to take.\n  In closing, I cannot in good conscience support the Washington money \ngrab, masquerading here as the National Tobacco Policy and Youth \nSmoking Act. If we were being honest with the American people, the bill \nwould be entitled ``the National Tobacco Tax and Spend Act.'' It is not \nabout public health or protecting our kids or cutting big tobacco down \nto size; it is all about taxes, taxes, taxes. This Senator is not going \nto be bullied into raising taxes on America's hard-working men and \nwomen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, for the duration \nof the afternoon until the Senate either goes out of legislative \nsession or adjourns, that we would be confined to debate only and to no \nparliamentary procedures with respect to the tobacco bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I do want to make a few comments. I know my \ncolleague from Texas wants to speak, and in keeping with the unanimous \nconsent agreement that we have, I will not talk as long as I had \nintended to. I do want to try to make a few comments, if I may.\n  First of all, I will make a couple of comments about where we find \nourselves now as we return to the tobacco legislation. Just prior to \nthe Memorial Day recess, the Senate had dealt with two of the most \ndifficult issues with respect to tobacco of perhaps the four or five \nissues that people assume are the difficult hurdles we need to get \nover. Those two, obviously, were: The question of price--whether it \nwould be a price of $1.10 or $1.50; and the second issue of the \nliability, as it was called, the question of the cap or amount of \npayments that would be made in any 1 year.\n  The third of those difficult issues is now pending, the so-called \nlook-back provisions, in the amendment by Senator Durbin and Senator \nDeWine, which seek to strengthen the ability to get individual \ncompanies to be able to take part in, to have an incentive to be part \nof, the process of trying to reduce teenage smoking.\n  Obviously, the LEAF program hangs out there as a very critical issue. \nThere are a couple of others, depending on what shape the debate takes \nover the course of the next days. Then there will be, no doubt, a few \nindividual amendments here and there, but I don't think they present \nthe Senate with the kind of larger issues that we need to face, that \nhave been presented in the context of those amendments I have just \ntalked about. It is possible, with a considerable amount of effort over \nthe course of the week, to dispose of the most difficult issues \nregarding this legislation, if there is a good-faith effort to try to \nmove forward.\n\n  I will make a couple of comments about a few of the points that have \nbeen made both as we closed debate a week ago and also in the early \nhours of the debate, the comments that have been made today.\n  First of all, with respect to smuggling, the smuggling that has taken \nplace so far with respect to American cigarettes has been a one-way \nsmuggling out of the United States. Our brands, which are popular \ninternationally and known to be among the best cigarettes, are those \nthat have been smuggled into Europe, where the prices are higher than \nthose that were smuggled temporarily, for a brief period of time, \nacross the border into Canada. We currently don't foresee that kind of \nproblem, according to most people within the law enforcement community \nwho have been asked about it in a series of hearings where the Treasury \nDepartment, Customs, and others were also inquired of with respect to \nthe difficulties regarding smuggling.\n  I underscore the testimony of Deputy Treasury Secretary Larry \nSummers, before the Senate Judiciary Committee on April 30, where he \nsaid: ``The Treasury Department believes that the creation of a sound \nregulatory system, one that will close the distribution chain for \ntobacco products, will ensure that the diversion and smuggling of \ntobacco can be effectively controlled and will not defeat the purposes \nof comprehensive tobacco legislation.'' And most people would agree \nwith that because most people who smoke want to smoke the brands they \nare accustomed to and that they like and are known to be the best. So \ndepending on whether you are smoking Newport, or Marlboro, or whatever \namong the most popular brands, those brands are going to be \nmanufactured here, not elsewhere. They are going to be marked in a way \nand designated in such a way as to be exceedingly difficult to \nreplicate or bring in. The bulk makes them difficult to replicate and \nbring in. It is far more profitable to continue to smoke even, as \npeople do, heroin, cocaine and other illegal substances.\n\n  Most people in the law enforcement community who are tracking these \nkinds of things do not believe that raising our cost of a pack of \ncigarettes to the level of almost an equivalency to Europe will, in \nfact, increase smuggling. It will reduce smuggling because there will \nbe less incentive for our cigarettes to be smuggled to these other \ncountries since our prices will be commensurate with theirs.\n  There is another reason why that smuggling would be difficult. This \nis not a fee which is paid, or an assessment which is paid exclusively \nat the retail establishment so that you have a huge differential \nbetween the price of a carton of cigarettes at the manufacturing \nlocation, and then it rises very significantly at the retailer so that \nthere is a huge grab in between. The assessment is a manufacturing \nassessment; it is a fee that is placed by the manufacturer. It is not \nunlike a value-added concept so that it is passed on, and as a \nconsequence of that, there is no differential that creates an incentive \nbetween manufacturer and retailer. The result of that is you have a \ntracking system in place where the incentive is obviously for the \nmanufacturer to recoup what the manufacturer already has paid out-of-\npocket, and that recoupment comes by having a very strict system in \nplace for the tracking.\n  So as the Treasury Department said, you need to have all entities in \nthe distribution chain for tobacco products--the manufacturers, the \nwholesalers, the exporters, the importers, the distributors and the \nretailers, holding a license or permit. That is precisely what will be \nexisting. The licensing will be done at the State level. Licensing can \nbe revoked or suspended for any kind of specific violations, and those \nconducting business without it obviously would be subject to the same \nkind of penalties.\n  Secondly, there would be a marking, branding and identification of \nthese\n\n[[Page S5497]]\n\npackages for domestic distribution and for export so that it is very \ndifficult to divert. And the sales structure from the manufacturer to a \nspecifically identifiable person for whom they are accountable also \nmakes it exceedingly difficult for this kind of diversion to take \nplace.\n  But I think the more important thing is to focus on the most critical \nissue here. We have heard a lot of talk about the cost of this bill. A \nnumber of opponents of the bill--people who seem to be out here \nprepared to allow the tobacco companies to continue to do what they are \ndoing because they offer no alternative for what they are doing--are \narguing that there is a regressive cost here to Americans, that this is \nsomehow too costly. And suddenly, the same people who have proposed tax \ncut after tax cut after tax cut for the wealthiest Americans, at the \nexpense, most often, of those who pay the most regressive taxes, are \nbecoming the champions of the poor. I wonder if these crocodile tears \nthat we are hearing for those people who smoke in the country--which I \nremind everybody is a voluntary act; no one is taxed who doesn't decide \nto go smoke. Nobody has to pay something who isn't actually smoking. \nGiven the number of addicts that we have in the country and the amount \nthat those addictions cost every American, the real regression here is \nthe regression that falls onto the average American who is paying the \nhealth care costs of people who are addicted, the health care costs of \npeople who get diseases for which they are either not covered or can't \npay.\n\n  There are countless, countless costs associated with smoking. None of \nmy colleagues on the other side want to come and talk about that. They \ndon't want to talk about the billions of dollars that Americans are \nassessed because of the cost of a substance being sold that is \naddictive and is a killer substance. That is the bottom line here. \nEverybody says, oh, yes, we have to stop our teenagers from smoking. \nYes, we have to have preventive programs. But then there is no talk \nabout how you put them in place; there is no talk about what preventive \nprograms are going to be put in place, or how are you going to fund \nthem. No discussion whatsoever. It is just a generic, flat opposition \nto this particular piece of legislation which seeks to do something \nreal about the problems of smoking.\n  The fact is that 98.5 million American households, families of \nsmokers, and most importantly, nonsmokers, pay about $1,320 a year to \ncover the damage that smoking does to our society. Every single working \nfamily in America, including those who live on the minimum wage, and \nthose struggling to send their kids to college, or to pay for parochial \nschool, or just to make ends meet, are paying for America's deadly \nsmoking habit today.\n  The reality is that the overall smoking cost to our society is about \n$130 billion a year, and that cost measures the medical costs of \nsmoking--the cost of smoking during pregnancy, the cost of lost output \nfrom early death, and even the lost work days, lost productivity that \nwe get as a consequence of this. This taxes every single American, and \nthe question is whether we are going to reduce taxes on Americans by \nfinally stepping up to tackle the problem of smoking.\n  A lot of people argue this is about family economics. They come to \nthe floor and suggest that family economics dictate that in fairness we \nnot somehow tax a person at the minimum wage who is going out and \nsmoking. Well, they are right; it is about family economics. The \nproblem is they are not on the side of families, because those of us \nwho are fighting to pass this legislation are looking for a way to \nprovide some kind of relief to working families by passing this \nlegislation.\n  The fact is that if you are not willing to put in place a tough \nregimen for reducing teenage smoking, you are in fact augmenting the \nburden that American families are already paying. The fact is there is \na $60 billion-a-year cost in medical costs alone related to smoking. \nOver 40 percent of those costs--fully $25 billion--are covered by \nMedicare and Medicaid. Medicare and Medicaid are paying for $25 billion \na year of the cost. That is a tax. That is a tax on Americans of $25 \nbillion a year that is paid by all Americans, even those who don't \nchoose to smoke, even those who hate smoking, even those who make every \neffort possible to avoid secondary smoke in public places. They wind up \npaying the tax on the medical costs for those who choose to smoke, or \nthose who are addicted and have little choice as a consequence of a \nhabit they picked up as teenagers.\n  The important thing to remember here is this: For all those adults \nwho are smoking today, 86 percent of them got hooked on smoking when \nthey were teenagers. All of the analyses show if you can make it \nthrough your teenage years without getting hooked on the habit, without \nsmoking, the likelihood of your having the development of character and \na sort of health consciousness that would then keep you from smoking is \nsignificant. Most of these people who start smoking in their teenage \nyears start at the ages of 13 and 14 years old. In fact, a very \nsignificant proportion are hooked by the time they are 14.\n  Now, we know to a certainty that price affects the availability of \nany commodity to anyone. Clearly, for young kids the amount of cash \nwhich they have in their pockets is going to be spent according to the \ncost and what particular benefit they deem they are getting for that \ncost. If you raise the price, it is clear there will be less \navailability.\n  But that is not all we are doing, Mr. President. This legislation \ndoesn't just raise the price and say, OK, we have done the job, let's \ngo home. This legislation sets up a whole set of efforts to reach out \nto young people, to increase the awareness regarding addiction, to \nincrease prevention programs, to increase our research efforts within \nthe NIH and the medical community in order to understand addiction \nbetter. It increases our capacity to learn whether we can reduce \naddiction among adults in significant ways.\n\n  There are a host of other benefits that come with this legislation \nthat are critical. But equally as critical is what the Senator from \nIllinois is trying to do, Senator Durbin, in the so-called look-back \namendment. It doesn't do you a lot of good to simply pass a piece of \nlegislation that somehow leaves the tobacco companies out there in a \nway that they are not going to be part of the solution of trying to \nreduce the access of kids to smoking. If the tobacco companies have a \nstrong incentive to be part of that process, then we have a much better \nchance of reducing smoking and meeting our goals.\n  So the look-back provisions are a way of giving the tobacco companies \na grace period in order to be able to make the adjustments in their \nadvertising and their distribution process in order to help in the \neducation of young people and, through that process, significantly \nreduce the desire of young people to smoke, because it somehow makes \nthem look older and makes them look cool as a response to peer pressure \nand a whole lot of other reasons that young people do choose to smoke.\n  I might add that we have come to understand very well what those \nreasons are. Over the course of the last years, while the struggle has \nbeen going on between the tobacco industry and people who want kids to \nbe able to lead healthier lives, during the course of that time there \nhave been many, many, many analyses, many surveys, many focus groups, \nmany discussions, many polls, all of which have indicated the degree to \nwhich young people smoke as a consequence of either peer pressure or a \ndesire to kind of fit the role model that they may have seen in a \nmovie, or somehow to be older, to look older, at a time in life when \nsome of those choices are important.\n  We were at a tobacco forum in Boston, MA, about a month or two ago \nwith Vice President Gore. We had testimony there from an adult who \ntoday has great difficulty breathing, who today is confined to a \nwheelchair, who testified personally to how the lung problems she has \ntoday and the diseases that she is now suffering from came directly \nfrom smoking, which came directly from her desire to look older. As she \nsaid to those kids who were assembled at this forum, ``Boy, I sure \nsucceeded in my goal. I look a lot older now.''\n  Those kinds of testimonials are the most important kinds of ways in \nwhich we can, hopefully, reach our young before they fall prey to this \naddiction.\n  What we need to remember as we think about the ``cost'' of this bill \nis\n\n[[Page S5498]]\n\nthat the cost of this bill is minimal compared to the cost to society \nof people whose lives are literally ruined as a consequence of the \ncancers, or liver disease, or heart disease, emphysema, that some \nmembers of their family suffer. There are kids in this country whose \nparents are unable to send them to college, or to buy them books, \nbecause of their $13,700-a-year habit to buy cigarettes. That is what \nyou are talking about.\n  So if you want to talk about the real costs to America, the real \ncosts to America are not contained in the first ever comprehensive \neffort to try to do something about our narcotic killer substance that \nis being sold across the counter to anyone who wants to buy it. The \nreal costs to our society are costs as a consequence of that happening \nwithout the Senate of the United States or the Congress being willing \nto take action to respond to it. Again and again this week, Mr. \nPresident, I hope we are going to be reminded about those costs to the \nUnited States.\n\n  We have people who have been addicted to cigarettes in this country \nsince they were kids. And, literally, there are cases where I have \nheard people say that they had to tell their kids that they couldn't do \nX, Y, or Z for their children because of their addiction. The cost of \nsmoking in that regard is enormous.\n  Consider the cost of smoking while pregnant. The truth is that a \npregnant woman who smokes daily and suffers complications will spend \n$8,000 more than a nonsmoker in trying to deliver a healthy baby. That \nis a cost you do not hear our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \ntalking about. That is a cost that the tobacco companies don't offer up \nas one they ought to be responsible for. That is a cost to society and \na long-term cost to the future of that child. Smoking while pregnant \ndoubles the risk of having a low-birth-weight baby. And that, as we all \nknow, significantly complicates the postnatal period, raising the costs \nby thousands upon thousands of dollars in hospitals.\n  If that doesn't communicate how serious the problem is, look at the \nimpact. Forty-eight thousand low-birth-rate births are caused by \nsmoking each year--48,000 children who may suffer medical problems \ntheir whole lives because of smoking that took place during pregnancy. \nThese are 48,000 kids whose lives will be affected for the rest of \ntheir lives. I am not sure how you measure that financially.\n  So as our colleagues come to the floor lamenting the fact that we are \nasking that people who buy these as a matter of course, on their own \ndecision, on a voluntary basis, would have to pay a little more for \ntheir substance that costs all of us a lot more, that is not too much \nto ask. It is certainly, when you balance it more appropriately, not to \nprotect the tobacco companies; it is to protect the rest of America \nagainst those costs. That is the choice that I think most Americans see \nexist in this legislation.\n  The reality that has been lost in some of the debate about the costs \nof this legislation is the reason that the Senate is now presented with \nthis vital legislation. It is my hope that over the course of the next \ndays we will be able to move forward on it.\n  A quick word about the look-back provision, and then I will yield to \nmy colleague.\n  The look-back provision is a provision that seeks to try to create a \nsensible balance in how you invite the cigarette companies to really \nact more responsibly. Unfortunately, there is a long, long track record \nof the cigarette companies acting irresponsibly. That is a smoking \nrecord in the final analysis. Everybody remembers the times that \ncigarette executives came up here and raised their hands and swore to \ntell the truth and nothing but the truth. The truth is, they did not \ntell the truth, and now all of America knows that.\n  Now, as a result of some courageous attorneys general around the \nUnited States taking suit against the cigarette companies, we have \nreceived documents that show the degree of the deception, the degree to \nwhich there was literally a predatory attack on the young people of our \ncountry. That is the choice the U.S. Senate faces here--whether we are \ngoing to just talk about protecting our kids from that kind of \npredatory attack, or whether we are going to actually do something \nabout it. It is a choice that will be very clear to the American people \nwho are going to watch what the Senate of the United States does here.\n\n  But the question is, How do we get the cigarette companies to take \nactions that do not try to subvert what we do here? How do we guarantee \nor at least provide the best structure that we can to invite them to \nbecome part of a solution? The way to do that, Mr. President, in my \njudgment, is to strengthen the look-back provision so that there will \nbe a stronger incentive on the individual companies to participate. \nCurrently, there is a $4 billion cap industry-wide that suggests that a \ncompany that decided, ``Well, we are going to just ride the wave of the \nindustry, we will not take part that much, and if we don't happen to \nmeet the goal, then this is not going to cost us as much because the \nrest of the industry is going to pick up the cost,'' there is a sense, \neven though there is a penalty of $1,000 per child per percentage \npoint, that they don't meet the goal, which we feel may not be a \nsufficient goal.\n  So the Durbin-DeWine amendment seeks to shift the remainder of that \nso that there is less of a cap, less of a requirement on the industry-\nwide payment and more of an individualized, company-specific payment in \norder to provide a stronger incentive for that company to become part \nof the solution here.\n  I think above all the American people have reached a point where they \nunderstand that they want these cigarette companies to act responsibly. \nThey want them to be part of the process of helping to protect their \nkids from exposure to this narcotic substance.\n  On that basis, Mr. President, that is where we find ourselves today. \nWe will debate through the afternoon. And at some point tomorrow there \nwill be some resolution--I guess late tomorrow--with respect to the \nparliamentary status that we are in.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I wish we could pass a resolution or a \nbill that would stop every child from starting to smoke and that would \nstop every adult from smoking.\n  I begin with a little personal experience. I have been alive for 55 \nyears. I have spent much of that time trying to get my mother, who is \nnow 85, to quit smoking, and I have had no success, nor do I believe \nthat by raising the price of cigarettes we will achieve that result, \neither.\n  But the point I want to make, to begin with, is that if we could have \na resolution that would, in fact, keep people from starting to smoke \nand stopping people from smoking, I can't imagine that anybody would \nvote against that resolution. Also, contrary to the rhetoric of much of \nthis debate, I don't find any love anywhere for tobacco companies. I \nthink if there is a problem in the debate, it is that we create the \nimpression we are punishing tobacco companies with this bill, when this \nbill has, in fact, extraordinary provisions to guarantee that tobacco \ncompanies will not be punished. We talk about tax increases as if the \ntobacco companies were paying those tax increases, but in reality not \nonly do they not pay them, but we have written into the bill provisions \nthat make it illegal for them to not pass the tax through to the \nconsumer and therefore the tobacco company is held harmless for the \ngeneral increase in taxes on cigarettes.\n  The cold reality is that we have before us a bill that raises taxes \nby $700 billion--one of the largest tax increases in history. This tax \nis not randomly distributed among the population. Those who make less \nthan $15,000 a year will pay 34 percent of these taxes, those who make \nless than $22,000 a year will pay 47 percent of these taxes, and those \nwho make less than $30,000 a year will pay 59.1 percent of these taxes. \nThe cigarette companies will pay none of these taxes.\n  Over the recess, I examined carefully data about cigarette smoking in \nmy State. What I would like to do is talk a little bit about this data \nand the tax and describe what I am trying to do with an amendment that \nis now pending but that has other amendments piled on top of it in such \na way as to prevent me from getting a vote on it. I want to talk about \nwhy that amendment is important. I want to say a little bit about the \nsubstitute that Senator Domenici and I will offer with Senator \nCoverdell and others, and then I\n\n[[Page S5499]]\n\nwant to talk about how we have lost control of this legislation.\n  I have spent the last 8 days back in Texas and I have listened to \npeople all over my State and have thought about what we could do to fix \nthis bill so that we could actually move ahead. I want to share those \nthoughts with my colleagues, not so much thinking that anybody might be \nswayed by those thoughts but at least to perhaps encourage others to \nthink that, well, maybe other people are thinking about this problem \nthe way I am and maybe we ought to try to get together and work out \nsome of these things.\n  In my State, 23.7 percent of the adults smoke. That is 3,130,723 \nTexans. If I could snap my fingers or do anything other than using \npolice powers, I would like to induce these people to stop smoking. But \nthe first thing I have to be aware of is the fact that these are the \nvictims. The whole logic of this tobacco bill is that the tobacco \ncompanies have conspired to get young people to smoke. To use the \nlanguage of our colleague, the chief proponent of the bill, they have \ngotten people addicted to smoking, and so that is what I mean when I \nsay that there are 3,130,723 Texans who smoke, who are the victims. \nThese are the people who the tobacco companies, through advertising and \nthrough encouraging some of them when they were young to smoke, have \ngotten addicted or at least attached to the product to the extent that \nthey continue to buy the product.\n  Now, here is one of the things that concerns me greatly about this \nbill. We all agree that the smokers are the victims. We all agree that \nthe tobacco companies are the villains. And yet we have a bill that \nholds tobacco companies harmless, that requires by law that they pass \nthe tax through, doesn't allow them to pay a penny of it in terms of \nthe initial tax that is imposed. And yet if, in fact, as most people \nwho are knowledgeable about the marketing of this product say, this \nbill will have the effect of raising the price of a pack of cigarettes \nby $2.78 a pack, it will mean that the annual cost of buying one pack \nof cigarettes a day for the people in my State who smoke will rise by \n$3,176,744,628 which means nothing, but let me give you a number that \ndoes mean something.\n\n  For every person in my State who is addicted to cigarettes, who has \nbeen victimized by a process that we are trying to fix in this bill, \nthe people who are the sole purpose of this bill, we are imposing a tax \non them of $1,015 a year in the process of helping them. As my 85-year-\nold mother said the other day, ``Why aren't you taxing the tobacco \ncompanies instead of taxing me? If I am the victim, why am I paying?''\n  Well, the point I want to make sure my colleagues understand is that \nwhile we may love pounding our chest and vilifying the tobacco \ncompanies, with good reason, we have before us a bill that is punitive \nnot to the tobacco companies but to the people who are their victims. \nAnd the level of punishment is a level that is virtually without \nprecedent as far as I am aware. In fact----\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, will the Senator yield so I can answer \nthe question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. No. I let the Senator go on for some time. I would like to \ndo the same. When we get through, I have to go back to the Medicare \nCommission meeting, but I will yield for a moment at that point.\n  So one of the concerns I have had in trying to see what we might do \nto fix this problem is that we are looking at the potential of \n3,130,000 people in my State, if they smoke one pack of cigarettes a \nday, having a tax increase of $1,015 each year.\n  Now, I thought, looking at the figures that were put out by the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, that there must be something wrong with these \nfigures, but when you look at that $1,015 Federal tax for a Texan or an \nAmerican who smokes one pack of cigarettes a day, it makes the number \nbelievable that the Joint Tax Committee put out, and that number was, \nfor Americans who make less than $10,000 a year--some smoke, some don't \nsmoke--but for all Americans who make less than $10,000 a year, this \nbill will drive up their Federal taxes by 41.2 percent.\n  So one thing that has worried me from the very beginning, and one \nthing that I do not find to be trivial, is that we are talking about a \nmassive, $700 billion tax increase that is being imposed not on the \ncompanies that have inspired teens and others to smoke but it is being \nimposed on the very people who are the victims, and in my State it has \nthe potential of imposing a $1,015 new Federal tax on a blue-collar \nworker making less than $30,000 a year who is addicted to smoking. And \nif you have a blue-collar couple who may have two jobs, a lady who \nworks in a restaurant, and a man who drives a semi, and they both smoke \na pack of cigarettes a day, you are talking about imposing a $2,030 \nincrease in Federal taxes on them.\n\n  It may be that this increase in taxes would induce some of them not \nto smoke. Over and over our colleagues who support this massive tax \nincrease have said this is not about money, that they don't want the \nmoney, they want to get people not to smoke. So before we left on the \nrecess--having listened to this debate and having heard over and over \nand over again that this was not about money, that they just wanted to \ndrive up the price of cigarettes, that they weren't trying to decimate \nblue-collar workers financially, that they just wanted to get them not \nto smoke--I sent an amendment to the desk. My amendment said: If the \npurpose of this is to get people not to smoke by driving up the price \nof cigarettes, let's raise the price of cigarettes, but let's take that \nmoney and instead of giving it to the Government to spend, let's give \nat least some of it back to blue-collar workers by changing the Tax \nCode. And the proposal that I made was let's eliminate the so-called \nmarriage penalty where two workers, both of whom work outside the home, \nfall in love, get married, and end up paying $1,400 more in taxes being \nmarried than if they stayed single.\n  I focused it on moderate-income Americans. The idea being, raise the \nprice of cigarettes to discourage smoking, but because we are not \nraising the price of cigarettes to impoverish blue-collar workers, why \nnot raise the price of cigarettes to discourage smoking, but return the \nmoney through new tax cuts to the same people? So you raise the price \nof smoking but so that people who are really addicted and who either \ncan't or don't quit smoking--that we simply don't pound them into the \nground economically.\n  I was somewhat taken aback that when I offered this amendment, it \nshut down the Senate, and that we clearly have Members of the Senate \nwho do not want to vote on giving some of this money back to blue-\ncollar workers. I am somewhat at a loss to explain that. If the tax is \nnot about money, why wouldn't we want to give some of it back in tax \ncuts to the very blue-collar workers who have been victimized by the \ntobacco companies?\n  Also, I would have to say for those who want to talk about the health \ncare cost of smoking, when Senator Domenici and I, in the budget, \ndedicated the money to Medicare, many of the same people who were for \nthis bill opposed that amendment.\n  The point I am making is, first of all, I am going to get a vote on \nmy amendment. I had to write my amendment as a motion to recommit with \ninstructions. Some people have gotten confused in the media and believe \nthat somehow my amendment delays the bill or kills the bill. It does \nnot. My amendment simply directs that the bill notionally be taken back \nto committee and be brought back immediately with this tax cut attached \nto it. If it were adopted, it wouldn't delay the Senate for a second, \nnor would it pull the bill down.\n  I believe if this issue is about smoking instead of about money that \nthe Senate will adopt my amendment, and hopefully another amendment \nwhich would give blue-collar workers the same tax treatment General \nMotors has in buying health insurance. But we will get an opportunity \nto vote on those issues.\n  Let me also say that in traveling around my State for 8 days and \nmeeting with editorial boards, holding public meetings, and on several \noccasions raising the tobacco issue, I received not a question about \nthe tobacco bill. We are debating this issue as if this is the all-\nconsuming issue on the planet, and yet all over the State, in meeting \nafter meeting, in editorial boards where I raised the issue, I don't \nrecall a single question anyone asked me\n\n[[Page S5500]]\n\nabout it. In fact, we have had two polls come out since we have been \nconsidering this bill. One, published in USA Today asked people, ``Do \nyou believe higher cigarette taxes will reduce teen smoking?'' Seventy \npercent say ``no;'' 29.9 percent say ``yes.'' When you ask parents what \nthey are most concerned about with their teenagers, 39 percent say \nusing illegal drugs--something that has doubled since 1992, something \nthat this bill doesn't deal with, something the substitute that \nSenators Domenici and Coverdell and I will offer does deal with, with \nthe toughest antismoking, antidrug program that will be considered in \nthe Senate during this debate--16 percent say joining a gang, 9 percent \nsay drinking alcohol, 7 percent say having sex, 7 percent say driving \nrecklessly, and 3 percent say smoking or chewing tobacco.\n\n  I would like to explain what I believe has gone wrong on this bill \nand why it is going to be so hard for us to fix it. I have given this a \nlot of prayerful thought. Let me just share with you the results of \nthis thought.\n  First of all, why are we dealing with this issue to begin with? Why \nis this issue on the floor of the Senate? We had settlements between \ntobacco companies and States. Why are we considering it? I will tell \nyou why we are considering it. It is completely lost in this debate, \nbut we are considering it because the attorneys general came to us and \nsaid, in essence, this whole thing has gotten out of control and the \nonly way we can enforce these settlements is for the Federal Government \nto step in and impose some reason and responsibility on the process. In \nfact, presumably, the attorneys general recognized something--some \npeople may be offended by the analogy but it is a good analogy--that a \nparasite can live only if the host animal does not die. What the \nattorneys general recognized was that the way this whole thing was \ngoing, the tobacco companies were all going broke and they weren't \ngoing to collect this money. They weren't going to be able to pay for \nMedicaid with it. As a result, they would have won a big victory in \ncourt, but it would not mean anything to their States, to their \nconstituencies.\n  So they came to Congress and said look, this thing has gotten \ncompletely out of control. It is unlikely that the kind of money, in \nessence, that we are talking about can never be paid. What we want \nCongress to do is step in and set levels that will make it possible for \nus to actually collect these settlements.\n  What has happened in the process? Sadly, the settlements started out \nat roughly half the cost of the bill that is before us. Quite far from \nthe objective of the attorneys general in asking us to get involved in \nthis issue to begin with, we have roughly doubled the cost of the bill \nand every concern that drove this issue to the Congress has now been \nmultiplied by a factor of two. How did it happen? How did the cost of \nthis bill get so high? This is what I think is the most revealing part \nof this whole process. I could go through 100 examples, but I am only \ngoing to go through a couple.\n  One of the things that happened when the bill got to Congress was \nthat, as normally happens in these situations, everybody wanted some of \nthe money. So we start dozens of new agencies. We have programs for \ncommunity action. Nobody knows what they are. We set up international \nprograms. We have programs to buy out vending machine owners. We have \nprograms to subsidize tobacco farmers.\n  But we don't just have programs, we have spending programs that are \ncompletely out of any realm of reason and responsibility. A perfect \nexample of it is the tobacco program. It was perfectly reasonable that \nthose who represent tobacco States, when we were getting ready to \ncollect a lot of money from the tobacco companies, would want some of \nit. You would think in going about trying to get some of it that we \nwould have ended up with a figure that would be somewhat similar to the \ntransition payments we paid in the legislation we call freedom to farm.\n  Under the Freedom to Farm bill we, in essence, provide transition \npayments to wheat producers, corn producers, grain sorghum producers, \nbarley producers, oat producers, upland cotton producers and rice \nproducers within a 7-year period. You might have thought that what we \nwould have done was set up a program for tobacco similar to those other \nprograms. Such a proposal might not have been an unreasonable addition \nto this bill. But reason has nothing to do with this bill, because \nsince we could, in essence, act as if the tobacco companies were paying \nthese costs when, in fact, the consumer was paying the cost, the sky \nwas the limit in terms of the amount of money spent.\n  Let me tell you what we have done in tobacco. We have two proposals \nnow before us. We are going to be asked to choose between one of the \ntwo on the floor of the Senate. The Ford proposal costs $28.5 billion. \nThe Lugar proposal costs $18 billion. The Ford proposal will pay \ntobacco producers $21,351.35 per acre. It will also continue the \ntobacco program. Nobody will have to stop growing tobacco. No one will \nhave to give up their land, but we will give them a payment of \n$21,351.35 an acre.\n  The Lugar bill will make a similar payment while ending the tobacco \nprogram at $22,297 an acre.\n  Who knows what a billion dollars is, but let me put it in English. \nThat is almost 20 times the amount we pay every other commodity \ncombined to end their program. We have before us a bill that will pay \ntobacco brokers 20 times more than we paid, on a per-acre basis, wheat \ngrowers, corn growers, grain sorghum growers, barley growers, oat \ngrowers, upland cotton growers and rice growers combined--nearly 20 \ntimes as much per acre as we paid all those programs combined.\n  Let me explain a little bit about the program. In 1938, we set up \nthis program. It was aimed to do one thing and that was to raise the \nincome level of tobacco farmers. We set out a quota system where you \ncan't grow tobacco unless you have a quota. What happened almost \nimmediately is people with quotas in many cases quit growing tobacco \nand they rented their quota to other people so that now 63 percent of \nthe people who own the quotas don't even grow tobacco. What we are \ngoing to do under these two proposals is pay them roughly $20,000 an \nacre, and allow them to continue to grow tobacco and keep the acreage.\n  Madam President, 1997 is the last figure I have, but in 1997, you \ncould have bought the quota to grow an acre of tobacco for $3,564. I \nask the following question, and it can't be answered: If I could go out \ntoday and buy a quota to produce an acre of tobacco for $3,564, why in \nthe world would the Government want to pay me six times that amount in \nthis tobacco bill, six times the amount that I just paid yesterday for \nthe quota? They are going to pay me six times that amount of money, and \nI can go right on producing tobacco. How could such a provision \npossibly get into a bill about which Members of the Senate would not \nblush? How can we let a person go out today and buy a quota to produce \nan acre of tobacco and sell it to the Government next month for six \ntimes what they paid for it and still grow tobacco and not give up the \nland? Whoever heard of paying people $20,000 an acre because we are \ngoing to pass a tobacco bill, but they can go right on growing tobacco, \nor six times what you can buy the right to grow it for? How did it \nhappen?\n  It happened because of the feeding frenzy of spending money that was \ncoming from tobacco consumers, basically blue-collar workers--59.1 \npercent of them earning below $30,000 a year. By making it look like \nthe tobacco companies were paying the bill, we could, in essence, pay \npeople $20,000 an acre who are growing tobacco and let them keep on \ngrowing. There is no logic to that happening, except that this has \nbecome a giant piggy bank, or as a candidate for comptroller in my \nState has said about the tobacco settlement in Texas, ``We won the \nlottery.'' This is the kind of consumption people do when they win the \nlottery.\n\n  We have had an extensive debate on this subject, but those who have \nstudied the settlement in Texas have concluded that lawyers in Texas \nwill make about $100,000 an hour under that bill --$100,000 an hour. \nWhy would we have a bill that allows that to happen? Can you imagine if \nwe were appropriating the money to hire lawyers to do work for the \nGovernment, allowing a situation where attorneys' fees could range \nbetween $88,000 and $100,000 an hour? Can anybody imagine that \nhappening? How did it happen in this bill? How could it have happened?\n  What happened is the attorneys general came to us and said, ``Look, \nwe\n\n[[Page S5501]]\n\nhave these settlements that have gotten out of control, and people \naren't going to be able to collect money because the judgments \ncumulatively are going to be so big that they are going to drive the \ntobacco companies out of business, and we're not going to be able to \ncollect our money. Congress needs to do something about it.''\n  So what did Congress do about it? Congress doubled the amount of \nmoney that we are taking and, in the process, set off a spending spree \nthe likes of which we have not seen since Lyndon Johnson became \nPresident. There has been no period of time in American history since \nthe first year of Lyndon Johnson's Presidency where we will have an \nexplosion of new programs and new discretionary spending.\n  Many of these programs have absolutely nothing to do with smoking, \nand the list goes on and on from child care to international programs \nto you name it.\n  How did asbestos settlement get into this bill? How did we end up \nwith billions of dollars going to asbestos settlements in this bill? \nWhere did that come from? How did that happen?\n  My guess is that there was this lottery that we won, and so somebody \nsaid, ``Well, look, you have all this money, why don't we give some of \nit to people who have asbestos-induced health problems.'' And they then \nsaid, ``Well, many people were around asbestos in World War II. Since \nmost people in World War II smoked, they were around asbestos, why \ndon't we take money out of this and give it to them?''\n  Here is my point. How do we get back to something that would be \nreasonable and, quite frankly, try to figure out how we might put \ntogether something that would actually achieve what we want?\n  I wanted to share with my colleagues why I despair, why it is going \nto be very difficult to fix this bill. Let us say we decided we were \ngoing to go back to the tobacco farmers issue, and we said, ``OK, now \nlook, we want to be generous. We'll pay tobacco farmers the cumulative \namount that we paid every other farmer per acre combined.'' And that \nwould be $1,496 per acre. We will give them that amount of money \nbecause they might be affected by this tobacco bill. We do not know \nthey will be because we do not know for certain what else will happen, \nwhether demand will go down or not. Other things being the same, it \nshould.\n  So you might say, ``Well, look, why don't we offer them the amount we \npay every other crop combined?'' Well, how can our colleagues from \ntobacco States--when they have been debating giving people $20,000 an \nacre or $21,000 an acre--how can they go back and say, ``We're actually \nonly going to get one-twentieth of that amount''?\n  They can't go back, because once you let the feeding frenzy start, \nand once you get expectations built up--anyone who went to tobacco \nfarmers a year ago and said, ``I, as your Senator, have arranged for \nyou to get the amount of money equal to the per-acre payment of all the \nother seven major crops combined,'' you would have gotten a standing \novation. But today, when we are talking about paying 20 times that \namount, you would get stoned. So we are not going to be able to break \nthat impasse as long as people believe this bloated bill is at all \npossible.\n  How are you going to go back to people who have suffered from \nasbestos poisoning and say, ``We're not going to give you anything''? \nThe bill never had anything to do with them, but nevertheless, now \nthere is a big constituency there.\n  We contemplated in the bill that we would set some limits on \nattorneys' fees. We are going to have a vote on $1,000 an hour. That is \nnot a minuscule amount. But even if we could be successful on that--and \nI am not sure we could--you have expectations so high that I do not \nknow how you ultimately put this together.\n  Let me tell you what I think the final solution would look like if \nyou could get there. You have to throw all of these add-on spending \nprograms overboard. They never should have been here to begin with. \nThis is an obscene feeding frenzy. All of these X, Y, Z bureaucracies, \nall of these community action programs, all of these international \nsmoking alliances, all of these payments for other purposes--all that \nhas to go.\n  Secondly, if we are going to raise prices, and we are not going to \nbeat blue-collar workers into pulp economically, some of the money that \ncomes in has to be given back to them in other taxes where we \ndiscourage them from smoking but we do not impoverish the people who \nare addicted to cigarettes and either will not be able to quit or at \nleast will take an extended time to quit.\n  Senator Domenici and I fund in our bill, through Medicaid, Medicare, \nand through tax deductibility, smoking cessation programs. Those are \nthe kinds of things it seems to me that we ought to be focusing on \nhere. But a bill is going to have to be back within the range that we \ncould ever hope to collect.\n  Secondly, we are going to have to be aware of the fact--and I heard \nmy colleague talking about black markets, but, you know, the Canadians \nraised the price of cigarettes by about the price increase we are \ntalking about. They have highly educated people. They have law \nenforcement. But what happened is, after their experiment had failed, \nthe Health Minister, Diane Marleau, said the following: ``The \ngovernment decision to cut taxes would actually reduce consumption \namong youngsters because it will end the smuggling trade and force \nchildren to rely on regular stores for cigarettes where they are \nforbidden to buy them until they are 19.''\n  Maybe we are so much smarter than the Canadians that we will be able \nto prevent black market activity. Smuggling among the Canadian \nprovinces is still a problem. The British have 50 percent of their \nmarket for cigarettes now in the black market.\n\n  We have been independent of Britain for over 200 years and maybe we \nnow are so smart that we can solve the problem. But I would just like \nto point out to my colleagues that maybe we are that smart but that our \nfriends and our kin folks--if you go back a few generations in places \nlike Britain and Spain and Italy, Eastern Europe--they are all plagued \nwith the massive black marketing of cigarettes.\n  So if there is a solution to this problem, it seems to me that the \nsolution lies in the following: That, No. 1, we have to throw all this \nfeeding frenzy overboard. We have to cut back the reimbursement for \ntobacco farmers and to lawyers to reasonable levels; we have to throw \nout all of this extraneous material where we are spending hundreds of \nbillions of dollars on programs that have nothing to do with smoking; \nwe have to raise the price of tobacco and give the money basically to \ntwo things--smokers' cessation programs and attendant health-related \nmatters, such as the health provisions that Senator Domenici and I have \nproposed where Medicaid and Medicare will be able to fund smokers' \ncessation programs and where taxpayers can get a tax credit if they \nparticipate in the programs designed to try to help people break their \naddiction.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. But beyond those modest programs, we have to give the \nmoney back if our purpose is not to impoverish people but in turn to \nget them to quit smoking.\n  It is not clear to me how we are going to get everybody--from lawyers \nto tobacco farmers to asbestos beneficiaries to whoever these \nthousands, hundreds of thousands of people who hope to man these \nagencies for massive community action, for these world organizations, \nand all the people who hope that this could be the winning of the \nlottery for everything from child care to you name it--how do we get \neverybody to back off those things so that we might really have a bill \nhere to do something about reducing teen smoking?\n  We often, it seems to me, overstate our ability to really make people \ndo things or get them to do things. But I simply despair at figuring \nout how we are going to get a bill that is focused on smoking, that \ndiscourages smoking but at the same time does not impoverish blue-\ncollar workers, and that does not set off a massive wave of hundreds of \nbillions of dollars of new spending. If we could do that, and combine \nit with an effort to do something about illegal drug use, along with \nillegal cigarette use by children, then I think we would have served \nthe public well. But I am not sure how we do it.\n  There is a lot of dead weight in this bill that has to be gotten out. \nI hope\n\n[[Page S5502]]\n\nthat as we go through the debate that reason and responsibility will \nprevail on everything from the tobacco farmers to the lawyers' fees to \nasbestos, to all of these X, Y, Z bureaucracies.\n  But today, in my State, the people that have any awareness of this \nissue basically have concluded two things: that, No. 1, we are probably \nnot going to get children not to smoke by raising this tax and that, \nNo. 2, the tax is about revenue to fund a whole bunch of new Government \nprograms, that the tax is not about getting people not to smoke.\n  If we are going to convince people--I have always found that telling \nthe truth does not always convince people, but it is easier when you \ntell them the truth. And if this is really not about money, then let us \nnot create all these spending programs that are not directly related to \nsmokers' cessation, let us take the money, the tax, and give it back to \nthe workers by cutting their taxes, let us throw all this subsidiary \nstuff overboard and write a real bill. If we don't do that, I don't see \nhow in the end we will convince people that raising taxes by $700 \nbillion and creating literally dozens and dozens of new programs that \nhave virtually nothing to do with smoking--I don't see how we convince \npeople that we are doing anything other than the old-fashioned tax and \nspend.\n\n  But we have found a new wrinkle, and the new wrinkle is to find an \nindustry that deserves vilification, vilify them, then tax their \nvictims, and then tax and spend. If that is not our objective, then we \nare going to have to change this bill dramatically to actually achieve \nthe goals we sought.\n  I have covered a lot of things here. I thought about this a lot over \nthe recess, trying to figure out how we could get from where we are to \nhaving a real bill. I have concluded that it is going to be hard, very \ndifficult, because when you have convinced all these special interest \ngroups that we are going to give them $700 billion, and you start \ntaking the money back--because, in reality, we can't impose a tax that \nbig--people are going to be disappointed and you are going to have \nproblems.\n  Now, the Senator from Massachusetts wanted me to yield. I know it has \nbeen a long time; that is part of the problem with our procedure. I am \nhappy to yield for a minute. Then I have to go back over to the \nMedicare Commission.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator from Texas. I just had a couple of \nquestions, one that came up momentarily, that I wanted to understand.\n  The Senator suggested three ways we could solve the whole problem, \nand they were: ``Throwing the feeding frenzy overboard;'' throwing out \nthe ``extraneous programs;'' and, third, to raise the price of tobacco.\n  I just wanted to ask the Senator, first of all, how he intends to \nraise the price of tobacco.\n  Mr. GRAMM. What I was saying was, if we believe that by raising the \nprice of tobacco we can discourage consumption--and, being a person who \nused to be an economist, I believe that demand curves are downward \nsloping--and other things being the same, that we could produce some \nresults there.\n  What I am saying is that I think we might put together a bill that \nraises the price of tobacco products either with a hidden excise tax or \none out front. But where I disagree is, since almost 60 percent of the \npeople paying the tax make less than $30,000 a year, rather than using \nthis as a piggy bank to fund massive new programs, I think we need to \nraise the price of tobacco as part of a coordinated effort, and I would \nlike to include an antidrug effort with it, but I would like to give \nmost of the money we raise back to low-income people so that we don't \nend up punishing the victims, which is what I see happening.\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me come back to the Senator again. I understand where \nhe wants to put the money, but he didn't answer my question. I ask him \nagain to answer the question, How does he propose to raise the price of \ntobacco?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I just said it may well be that in some compromise I can \nsupport the method in your bill. It is not so much the tax that I \nobject to; it is what we are doing with the money and what the tax is \ndoing to moderate-income people.\n  If we take your revenue figure and we throw out all these spending \nprograms and we give the bulk of the money back to moderate-income \npeople, for example, by repealing the marriage penalty for moderate-\nincome Americans, make health insurance tax deductible for moderate-\nincome Americans and make that subject to the earned-income tax credit, \nso that we are raising the price of tobacco but we are not brutalizing \nmoderate-income people, blue-collar people, economically, it may be \nthat you can get more people to support that.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I ask the Senator further, having \nacknowledged, then, that to raise the price of tobacco you basically \nwind up essentially where we are in this legislation, or somewhere near \nit, because any time you raise the price of tobacco--and, being an \neconomist, the Senator from Texas, I know, will agree--there is no way \na tobacco company is simply going to absorb that price, they are going \nto pass it on. Ultimately, whatever raising of the price of tobacco \ntakes place will be passed on to the tobacco consumer in one form or \nanother. I know the Senator would agree with that.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. If I could reclaim my time, I don't necessarily agree with \nthat.\n  First of all, we could impose a windfall profits tax on tobacco \ncompanies. We could make tobacco companies pay part of the tax. But the \nimportant thing is that--I would like to just try speaking like an \neconomist for just a minute--I am perfectly willing to raise the \nrelative price of cigarettes; that is not what I object to. What I \nobject to is that 3\\1/2\\ million people in my State, 60 percent of them \nmaking less than $30,000 a year, those who are really addicted, who are \nreally the victims, are going to pay $1,015 a year in new Federal \ntaxes. So if they are making $30,000 a year, you are taking a 30th of \ntheir income in this new tax.\n  All I am saying is, raise the tax to get them not to smoke, but take \nthe money and cut other taxes they pay so you don't impoverish them. \nThat is what I am saying.\n  Mr. KERRY. I hear the Senator from Texas, but if that were true, then \nhe would come to the floor with an amendment that would somehow give \nthe rebate to the actual smoker. By coming to the floor with a marriage \npenalty tax that costs some $52 billion, he is actually going to take \nall these people out there, whatever income level they may be at, who \nhappen to pay this, into the upper-income levels. They will wind up \ngetting the benefit for the marriage penalty, and you aren't solving \nthe problem that he is here on the floor complaining about.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reclaiming my time--and then I will yield the floor--my \namendment is targeted to moderate-income families. No family making \nmore than $50,000 would get a penny of benefits out of it. My amendment \nwould eliminate the marriage penalty where moderate-income Americans \nwho fall in love and get married wouldn't pay the Government $1,400 a \nyear for the privilege. My wife is worth $1,400 a year, but I think she \nought to get the money, and not the Government.\n  I am not apologizing for that proposal. I want to get a vote on it at \nsome point. I would like to follow it with another one that would say \nmoderate-income people get the same tax treatment when buying health \ninsurance as General Motors does by being able to deduct the cost of \ntheir health insurance premiums from their taxable income.\n  What I am saying is, I could support a bill that gave the money back \nthrough these kinds of tax cuts and kept just enough money to fund our \nsmoking cessation and whatever we did on drug prevention for teenagers. \nI could support a bill like that. But what I can't support is a $700 \nbillion tax increase that pays tobacco farmers $21,000 an acre and \nallows them to go on growing tobacco; that gives money to people for \nproblems that have nothing to do with smoking and that creates all \nkinds of new agencies.\n  I hear my colleague say over and over again, ``This is not about \ntaxes. This is not about money. We don't want the money.'' But all I \nknow is, I have an amendment that is pending that gives some of the \nmoney back to working families, the very people who smoke in the \nhighest proportions, and yet I can't get a vote on it because my \ncolleagues have covered it up with other amendments.\n\n[[Page S5503]]\n\n  Now we will get a vote at some point, so I think really what I was \ntrying to do today, for those who are for this bill and want to see \nsomething passed--and I will conclude on this--I was simply trying to \npoint out how we might find a middle ground here. I don't object to \nmaking tobacco products more expensive. But I do object to \nimpoverishing 3.5 million Texans. I do object to taking money we are \ntaking from people, 60 percent of whom make less than $30,000 a year. I \ndo object to taking that money and spending it on programs that make \npeople millionaires many times over, that pay people $88,000 to \n$100,000 an hour for legal services, that pay tobacco farmers $21,000 a \nacre and they can keep right on growing tobacco and that create all of \nthese Government programs and nobody knows what they do. Nobody knows \nwhat this big community action program does, other than put a lot of \npolitical activists on the payroll.\n\n  So if the goal is to stop people from smoking, and we can do it by \nraising tobacco prices, I would like us to be sure we don't start a big \nblack market and have it so that some hood is running around saying to \nour children, ``Do you want to buy a cigarette, or some dope?'' or \nwhatever. I don't want that to happen. Within those constraints, I \ncould support higher prices for tobacco if you gave the money back to \nblue-collar workers in tax cuts and if you didn't spend it on all these \nother programs.\n  But in the end, I am fearful that we will not reach a general \nconsensus, because I am afraid that along the way, with the best \nintentions, this bill has become a tax and spend bill. I don't know how \nwe get away from it. I don't know how we now go to all of these groups \nthat hope to get tens of billions of dollars from this bill and say, \nwell, you know, it was in that original bill, but we could not get that \nbill passed, and we have had to throw it in the trash can where it \nbelongs, and we have to start over, and now we are not going to have a \nbig community action program, we are not going to have a big \ninternational program, we are not going to pay money to people who have \nasbestos poisoning, we are not going to pay for child care; we are \ngoing to focus on smoking, raising the relative price of tobacco, and \nthen we are going to give the money back to the blue-collar workers who \nare going to bear the burden, because we are not taxing tobacco \ncompanies, we are taxing blue-collar workers who smoke.\n  That is what I hope we can do, but I am not optimistic that we are \ngoing to, because this thing has taken on a life of its own as the \nlargest taxing and spending bill of my political career.\n  I am afraid that the only alternative we are going to have is to \ndefeat this bill. Hopefully, if it is defeated, we can come back and \ntry to do it right, and maybe at some point we can do that in the first \nplace. But having spent the recess thinking about it, I wanted to \nsimply come over and outline what I, as one Member, saw as a potential \ncompromise--raise the price, keep a little of the money for smoking \ncessation, and spend some of the money on drug enforcement. As long as \nwe are trying to keep the children from smoking, we should try to get \nthem away from drugs. We can give the rest back in tax cuts, so nobody \ncan say you are taxing and spending, you are just raising the price of \ntobacco. Maybe we can make that happen, but I don't see any motion in \nthat direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I know the Senator from Texas needs to \nleave the floor. Not all my comments will be directed to him, but I ask \nhim this. He asked a question at the outset of his comments. The \nquestion he asked was, sort of: I don't know why we are raising all \nthis money; why is there a raising of the tax? Now he has come to a \npoint where he has agreed he is willing to raise the tax. But there is \none very simple, straightforward reason. It is not in order to raise \nthe money. The money is raised because it is a consequence of taking an \naction that is deemed imperative by most people who have been involved \nin trying to get kids to reduce smoking. I simply say this to my friend \nfrom Texas. Let me read him a quote:\n\n       It is clear that price has a pronounced effect on the \n     smoking prevalence of teenagers and that the goals of \n     reducing youth smoking and balancing the budget would both be \n     served by increasing the Federal excise tax on cigarettes.\n\n  That is a Philip Morris document from 1981.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield for one question, since I yielded \nto him four times?\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I will in a minute. A key finding is that:\n\n       Younger adult males are highly sensitive to price. This \n     suggests that the steep rise in prices expected in the coming \n     months could threaten the long-term vitality of the industry \n     by drying up the supply of new, younger adult smokers \n     entering the market.\n\n  That is from an R.J. Reynolds document. The smoking industry--the \ntobacco sellers--are saying don't raise the price because it will \nreduce the young kids that we can get addicted to cigarettes. That is \nthe reason we are here raising the price. The Senator can say he \ndoesn't want to vote to stop young kids from smoking.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Now wait a minute. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERRY. I will yield for a question in a moment. I want to point \nout something else to the Senator. He spent a lot of time out here \nsaying, ``I am willing to support a drug program and to support an \nopportunity for kids to be able to be part of smoker cessation \nprograms.'' Well, that is precisely what this money goes to do, Madam \nPresident; that is precisely what it does. It goes to public health, it \ngoes to research into addiction, it goes to State money, and the \nSenator ought to love this. We are giving the money back to the States \nand saying, ``You can do what you want with this amount of money in the \nfollowing areas.'' And every single one of those areas is to prevent \nkids from smoking. There are safe and drug-free schools. There is a \ndrug plan. There is a safe school plan. There is child care, child \nwelfare, and children's health maternal block grants. There is the \nprofessional training of teachers to be able to help kids to understand \nwhy they should not smoke. Every single one of those is a cessation \nprogram; it is a drug program. It is precisely what the Senator from \nTexas is saying.\n  So the Senator from Texas can come here filled with all of the \ntraditions of rhetoric and say this is ``tax and spend,'' et cetera, \nbut the fundamental purpose is to raise the price, just as the tobacco \ncompanies feared and said, ``We know it will cut down on teenage \nsmoking,'' and to take the money that comes from raising the price and \nput it into cessation programs, put it into programs for safe and drug-\nfree schools.\n  That is the program. That is what is on the floor of the Senate. It \nis done in a responsible way that does not tie up the States in a host \nof Washington bureaucracy and Washington mandates. It allows the States \nto choose to do what they think works best.\n  Let me just share with my colleague a final thing, and then I will \nyield for a question. Here is a report that says that the California \nand Massachusetts programs, both large-scale community-based \ncomponents, have been effective in reducing tobacco use. For example, 3 \nyears after Massachusetts began its public education and tobacco \ncontrol campaign, an independent evaluation found that tobacco \nconsumption in Massachusetts declined at a rate three times that of the \nrate for the rest of the Nation. So we are talking about programs that \nwork, that are demonstrable.\n  Experts--far more expert than the Senator from Texas or I --have all \nsuggested that you have to raise the price of a pack of cigarettes and \nyou have to put these programs in place. In fact, Dr. Koop and Dr. \nKessler suggested that we raise the price $2. The Senate voted that it \nwas unwilling to even raise the price $1.50. So we are stuck at $1.10. \nIt seems to me what we are offering is precisely the kind of \nreasonableness the Senator articulated.\n  I will agree with the Senator that there is a fight here over the \nissue of the farmers and how that ought to be approached. The Senate, I \nam confident, in the next week has a chance to work its will \nintelligently and try to find a common ground there. But I think our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle should stop coming here and \ncondemning the bill as a whole. I suggest that we are really talking \nthe same language fundamentally. Unless we are out here trying to find \nsome way to stop it--I am against the marriage penalty. I would like to \nvote to\n\n[[Page S5504]]\n\neliminate the marriage penalty. Most of my colleagues on this side want \nto eliminate the marriage penalty. Nobody feels, at this point in time, \nthat the marriage penalty is sensible public policy. It is bad tax \npolicy, bad social policy, bad moral policy. But the question is, Is \nthis the place to do it? Is the formulation of the Senator from Texas \nthe formulation that is going to fairly distribute the income that you \ntake from raising money on cigarettes, which you ought to be putting \ninto the cessation and drug programs the Senator has talked about?\n\n  So the fight here ought to be understood for what it is. If we are \nreally going to try to get rid of the marriage penalty, there are a \nhost of opportunities in the budgeting process to do that fairly. This \nis not the place to do it. I will vote to get rid of the marriage \npenalty in the right manner and in the right place. But I think the \nSenator may indeed have some other motive here than passing the tobacco \nbill, because this is not the place to take $52 billion of $60 billion \nand say we are still going to have meaningful cessation programs and \nmeaningful research and meaningful efforts to reduce teenage smoking.\n  I yield for the question without yielding my right to the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM. A point of information. My amendment, as it is now drafted \nand pending before the Senate, would take about half the money and give \nit back. So in terms of the numbers, those are the circumstances.\n  Here is where we differ. I would agree that we can have an impact on \nsmoking by raising prices. But what I don't agree on is that we ought \nto take $700 billion, basically from Americans who make $30,000 or \nless, and set out on a massive spending spree. So I am saying if you \nwant to raise the price of cigarettes, why don't you support an effort \nto give at least half of the money back to the people from the same \nincome group, rather than setting out programs to pay tobacco farmers \n$21,000 an acre or plaintiff attorneys $100,000 an hour, or starting \nmassive new programs that have virtually nothing to do with smoking. I \nthink that is where we differ. I think until we come to an agreement \nthere that we are not going to have a resolution.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, again I will reclaim my right, and I will \nanswer the Senator. He keeps coming back with this notion that what we \nare spending the money on again has nothing to do with the purpose of \nstopping kids from smoking, even after I have just particularly cited \ntwo States that are engaged in those very efforts. When you look at the \nlegislation and read it, here is what they go to. They go to State and \ncommunity-based prevention efforts. They go to counteradvertising, \nwhich is specifically targeted to stop kids from smoking. They go to \ncessation programs, specifically targeted to stop kids from smoking, \nand they go to research on youth smoking.\n  That is it. That is all. The Senator from Texas comes and says----\n  Mr. GRAMM. What about the tobacco farmers?\n  Mr. KERRY. The tobacco farmers are a component of the Federal \nexpenditure.\n  But, Madam President, let me answer the Senator. The fact is that \nbecause a lot of tobacco farmers are going to be injured here, just as \nwe have helped fishermen in New England, just as we have helped people \nin the Midwest in the wheat or other crops such as soybeans, just as we \nhave helped people who have been impacted negatively by a decision \nbeyond their control, the Government is coming in and saying what you \nhave been doing for your livelihood for years we have discovered merits \nour taking action that is going to impact your livelihood. Maybe the \nSenator from Texas thinks it is OK to abandon a lot of farmers and let \nthem go down the drain. I don't think that is the American way. I think \nmost of us in the U.S. Senate believe if the Government is going to \nmake some kind of decision that actively impacts people's lives as \nsignificantly as this could conceivably, then we have an obligation to \ntry to help those people transition into a new livelihood, or into a \nplace of safety and economic security. To do less than that would, \nindeed, be irresponsible.\n  If the Senator thinks that is a big spending program or some kind of \nbad giveaway, then let him vote that way. I think the majority of \npeople in the U.S. Senate are going to vote for some kind of a \nresponsible measure to assist the farmers. I think that is an \nappropriate thing to do for an appropriate period of time. The question \nis how much, and what is the appropriate period of time?\n  So there is a difference of opinion here. But let us not forget that \nfor years the tobacco industry has been fighting this legislation. For \nyears the tobacco industry fought anything anywhere. It took the \nattorneys general of this country from 44 States to be willing to go to \ncourt to put us in the position to be able to even contemplate some \nkind of comprehensive settlement. That is where we are, finally--\ncontemplating it--because we have learned that even the tobacco \ncompanies 20 years ago or 18 years ago understood that raising the \nprice of cigarettes would impact their sales. They were unwilling to do \nthat. So they would fight it. They have fought every step of the way.\n  It is time for the U.S. Senate to come together to have the votes, \ncast the votes that are important, come to closure on this, and decide \nwe are going to pass a bill. Let the majority will of the Senate work \nits way and move forward.\n  I will just add not just the tobacco companies are those who believe \nwe should be raising this price. We ought to stop debating this issue \nof price. We really ought to stop debating it. The issue here is not \nwhether or not we ought to be doing that, because there is no evidence \nto the contrary. The economist Senator from Texas has accepted the \nnotion. ``I am willing to accept the price,'' he says. So the fight is \nover what we are going to do with it. That is a fight worth having.\n  I believe when we have that fight the Senate will resolve that it is \nimportant to keep our focus on what this bill is doing. If we are \nraising the price, we are doing it for one principal reason, because \nthat will reduce kids from smoking. That is the purpose of this bill. \nWe shouldn't be diverting that purpose to relieve the marriage penalty, \nworthy as that is, at least to the tune of almost half of the revenue \nthat comes in. We ought to be guaranteeing that that revenue is \nadequately spent on the cessation programs, the counseling programs, \nthe teaching development programs necessary to help teachers be able to \nteach the peer group and other kinds of things necessary to lead kids \nto make wise decisions.\n\n  We need to be able to guarantee that there is counteradvertising. We \nneed to be able to guarantee that there is research into addiction in \norder to help us understand better how we are going to end this \nterrible scourge for a whole bunch of adults who are stuck smoking--40 \nto 50 million Americans who are addicted and who are going to go out \nand buy no matter what. We ought to be trying to help them, too.\n  The choice for the Senate is whether we are going to take this \nrevenue that reduces smoking and help these folks to be able to make \nthe choices that are a matter of good health and good public policy. \nThat is what this debate is about.\n  I know there are other colleagues here who wish to speak. I yield the \nfloor at this time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nMassachusetts for initiating these responses to our colleague and \nfriend from Texas giving the strong emphasis in terms of the real make-\nup of this legislation, because he, like I, believes the single purpose \nof this legislation should be to halt the young people in this country \nfrom starting smoking, and then also to do it by the best means that \nare available to us from a public health point of view; that as a \nresult of a good deal of practical study, we know there are some \nmeasures that are effective and will work. We have seen the inclusion \nof those measures in the legislation. Some, I believe, should be \nstrengthened. But the Senate has made a judgment on this. That was in \nthe earlier debate about the increase in price to bring it up to the \nrecommendations which have been made by our friends and colleagues in \nthe public health community that universally, based upon their \nexperience, believe that we should raise the price to $1.50 a\n\n[[Page S5505]]\n\npack and to do that in a more dramatic way than was included in the \nlegislation that is before us; then also to have the effective programs \nin counteradvertising and the cessation programs; and strengthen the \nFood and Drug Administration with the help and assistance to \nprogramming in schools and local communities and many programs which \nhave been touched on this afternoon included in the legislation.\n  One of the ways that we have is a very important opportunity to also \nstrengthen the general thrust of this legislation and make it more \nrelevant to the reduction of teenage smoking is to provide the \ndisincentives to the major tobacco companies for advertising and \ntargeting the children in this country.\n  I am always interested in listening to my friend and colleague from \nTexas crying crocodile tears for working families. We will have an \nopportunity to address those needs of working families as we have in \nthe past in terms of their income, in terms of their health care, in \nterms of their safety on the job, and in a variety of terms for \nfamilies with numbers of children, which he has always unfortunately \nvoted in opposition to.\n  But nonetheless part of the whole tragedy that we as a nation have \nexperienced has been the viciousness of the tobacco industry in \ntargeting the children of working families and of the neediest families \nin this country and those have been primarily the children of the \nminorities and working families in this country.\n  All we have to do is look again at what has happened in the past \nyears and see what the results of that targeting of more than $5 \nbillion a year have been on the teenagers in this country. We find out \nthe actual explosion in the use of tobacco by those who are black and \nnon-Hispanic was some 80 percent over the period of the last 6 years, \n34 percent by Hispanic, 28 percent by white and non-Hispanic, a general \nrise of some 32 percent. And that has been primarily the children of \nworking families.\n  To suggest out on the floor of the Senate that somehow the primary \nconcern of these workers is going to be the cost of the pack of \ncigarettes over the interest of having their children stop smoking I \nthink is a real failure to understand what is happening out among \nworking families in this country. To think that they are more concerned \nabout the increase in the cost than they are about making sure that \ntheir children are not going to get cancer in the community or that \nthey are going to be free from these absolutely devastating health \nimpacts which, by starting smoking at an early age or any age, are \ngoing to occur I think really fails to consider what is happening out \namong working families in this country and also what this legislation \nis attempting to do.\n  I want to speak just briefly this afternoon on the Durbin-DeWine \nprovision because I do think it has a very important impact in terms of \ndiscouraging the major tobacco companies from the targeting of \nchildren. Once again, we are primarily concerned with the targeting of \nchildren--the significant and dramatic increase in costs which \ndiscourage children, the preventive programs that are included in this \nlegislation devised to discourage children, and to help and assist \nthose children who develop the addiction to free themselves from that \naddiction, resources available to help communities to free themselves \nfrom this targeting of children. And now this very important and \nsignificant amendment that is before the Senate, which it will \nhopefully adopt, that reflects a bipartisan approach, I think is one of \nthe major kinds of improvements and strengthening amendments that can \nbe achieved.\n  Now, Madam President, the amendment which is before the Senate will \nassess increased sums for noncompliance with the youth reduction \nsmoking targets. In addition, the emphasis will be shifted from the \nindustry-wide assessments to the company-by-company assessments in \norder to more effectively deter the individual tobacco companies from \nmarketing their products to children.\n  For years, big tobacco has appealed to children through its \nadvertising and promotional campaigns. Before tobacco advertising was \nbanned from television in 1970, cigarette advertising included cartoon \ncharacters Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble promoting Winston \ncigarettes from their Bedrock neighborhood.\n  So the tobacco companies have been targeting kids as young as 12, \nbecause they know once the children are hooked on cigarettes, they \nbecome customers for life. Prior to the introduction of the Joe Camel \nadvertising campaign, fewer than one-half of 1 percent of youth smokers \nchose Camel. After a few years of intensive Joe Camel advertising, the \nCamel share of the youth market rose to 33 percent.\n  The tobacco company pricing decisions also have a dramatic impact on \nthe level of youth smoking. When Philip Morris made a decision to \ndramatically cut the prices of Marlboro Friday and other companies \nfollowed its lead, the industry precipitated a substantial increase in \nyouth smoking. The historical record is irrefutable. The tobacco \nindustry, through its marketing and pricing decisions, has an enormous \nimpact on the level of youth smoking.\n\n  Madam President, we see in this chart exactly what happened with \nMarlboro Friday. This chart, as we have seen in the course of the \ndebate, is so compelling, so convincing, so overwhelming in its \nconclusion that as the price of cigarettes goes up, teenage smoking has \ngone down. The dramatic increase in the price in the 1980s we \ndemonstrated last week to show the sharp decline in youth smoking. And \nthen we presented what we call Marlboro Friday, where we showed the \nsignificant reduction in the real price and then the dramatic spike up \nin the consumption of youth smoking that we have seen over the period \nof time.\n  The fact is that as they have maintained their price, this number of \nyoung people going up to 32, 33 percent a year is reflected with the \ndramatic increase in advertising. Take price and advertising, and you \ncan tell the story in terms of teenage smoking. And so we know \nadvertising is a key element in this whole debate as well. Price is a \nkey element in this debate.\n  The Senate has gone on record now that it is holding at the $1.10 \nprice. I still believe that a significant increase in price would have \na much more dramatic effect. The public health community believes that \nas well. The Senate has made that decision on price. But we have now \nthe opportunity to make a decision on another feature of youth smoking, \nand that is on the degree of advertising that the tobacco industry is \ngoing to involve itself in in order to continue to hook children in \nthis country. And that is what this amendment is really all about. It \nis going to say to the tobacco industry: All right, we are passing this \nlegislation. If you are going to continue to rifle-shot children, if \nyou are going to continue to rifle-shot the children of working \nfamilies, of minorities, and they are going to exceed a certain \nstandard, you are going to end up paying an additional penalty for \nthat. If you are going to make the effort, that you have stated that \nyou will make, to try not to target children in this country, then you \nwill not have the additional penalty.\n  That is really what this amendment is all about. What the amendment \nfrom Senator Durbin and Senator DeWine does is to make sure there is \ngoing to be compliance. I think all of us understand that a right \naround here is not very effective unless you are going to have an \nenforcement mechanism for that right.\n  What we are basically saying is, if the tobacco industry is going to \nlive up to its commitment and not target children, all fine and well; \nbut if they are not, they are going to find a penalty. It is as simple \nas that. If they are going to stand by their word, they have nothing to \nfear from this amendment.\n  Given what we have heard from our good friend from Texas, it is going \nto be interesting to see how he will vote on this amendment. I wish he \nhad had an opportunity to address it a bit this afternoon and indicated \nsupport, because I think it would help to establish a good deal of \ncredibility to the other aspects of his argument.\n  So, Madam President, as we have seen, in fact, 90 percent of current \nadult smokers began to smoke before they reached the age of 18. If \nyoung men and women reach that age without beginning to smoke, it is \nvery unlikely they will ever take up the habit in later years. And so \nthe industry has conducted its advertising accordingly. For at least a \ngeneration, big tobacco\n\n[[Page S5506]]\n\nhas targeted children with billions of dollars in advertising and \npromotional giveaways that promise popularity, maturity, and success \nfor those who begin this deadly habit.\n  In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have found \nthat the average 14-year-old is exposed to $20 billion in tobacco \nadvertising--$20 billion--at the age of 6--beginning at the age of 6. \nWe wonder why children as young as 12 years old, 14 years old, 16 years \nold--62 percent of those who have started by the time they are 16 years \nold have been subject to these billions of dollars of advertising, \nstarting at the age of 6.\n  We are saying now, OK, if you are not going to target the children, \nyou have nothing to worry about. But if you are and your brands are \ngoing to be accepted and taken and paid for, even with this increase, \nyou are going to pay a price at the back end. That sounds pretty fair \nto me. It is just holding them at their word.\n  It is no coincidence that the three most heavily advertised brands \nare preferred by 80 percent of children: Marlboro, Camel and Newport--\nthe three most heavily advertised, the three most heavily used. So, \nonce again, we know what is going to happen, I believe, unless we have \nthe Durbin-DeWine amendment.\n  A study published in the February 8, 1998, Journal of the American \nMedical Association also reported a correlation between the cigarette \nadvertising and youth smoking. It analyzed tobacco advertising in 34 \npopular U.S. magazines and found that as youth readership increased, \nthe likelihood of youth-targeted advertising increased as well. So \nthese weekly--daily surveys that are taking place by the tobacco \nindustry to find out what children are reading in magazines are then \nsent on back to the advertisers of the major tobacco industry. And, \nsure enough, up they come with that appealing kind of advertising to \nhook those children into addiction. That is happening.\n  That is the issue we are attempting to address in this legislation. \nWe deal with it on some of the restrictions, in terms of advertising, \nthat have been constitutionally upheld in the Baltimore decision, some \nof the protections that are there, provided under the FDA, but there is \nan opportunity for us to go far beyond that with this legislation, and \nthat is what we are doing.\n  Two recently disclosed industry documents reveal that big tobacco has \na deliberate strategy to market its products to youth. In a 1981 Philip \nMorris memo entitled ``Young Smokers--Prevalence, Implications, and \nRelated Demographic Trends,'' the author wrote that:\n\n       It is important to know as much as possible about teenage \n     smoking patterns and attitudes. Today's teenager is \n     tomorrow's regular customer, and the overwhelming majority of \n     smokers first begin to smoke while still in their teens. . ..\n       Because of our high share of the market among the youngest \n     smokers, Philip Morris will suffer more than other companies \n     from the decline in the number of teenage smokers.\n\n  There is the cigarette company looking at the teenager, not as a \nteenager but as part of the profit in the years ahead, over a \nlifetime--a shorter life, albeit--but over a lifetime of smoking.\n  A 1976 R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company memorandum stated that:\n\n       Young people will continue to become smokers at or above \n     the present rates during the projection period. The brands \n     which these beginning smokers accept and use will become the \n     dominant brands in future years. Evidence is now available to \n     indicate that the 14 to 18 year old group is an increasing \n     segment of the smoking population. [RJR-T] must soon \n     establish a successful new brand in this market if our \n     position in the industry is to be maintained over the long-\n     term.\n\n  We cannot have it any clearer--that this is the group that is being \ntargeted. We know they have done so. We know that is how they have \nincreased their market. They have indicated they will not do so in the \nfuture. We are saying: If you are not going to do so in the future, you \nhave nothing to fear from this amendment. But we are going to recognize \nwhat your track record has been over the historic past, and how you \nhave targeted youth, and we are going to say the least you are going to \ndo is to pay an important penalty if you are going to violate your \ncommitment. That is what this Durbin-DeWine amendment will accomplish. \nIt will accomplish that goal much more effectively than the current \nlook-back provisions in the managers' amendment. It will substantially \nincrease the total amount of the surcharges which companies must pay if \nsmoking levels do not decline in accordance with the reduction targets. \nIt also shifts the payment obligations from a predominantly industry-\nwide system to a predominantly company-specific system. This will \ndramatically increase the deterrent influence of the look-back on \ncompany policy.\n\n  In this chart, you see what the relative effect would be with regard \nto the ``real incentives'' surcharge in the millions under the current \nMcCain legislation and what would happen with regard to the Durbin-\nDeWine program. Here we find, with regard to the industry-specific, how \nmuch more effective this amendment would be in targeting those who \nreally have abused the system most in the past, and to make sure that \nis not going to happen, to protect our children in the future.\n  The current McCain provisions provide for a maximum industry-wide \npenalty of $4 billion, or about 20 cents a pack. The company-specific \nportion is extremely small, amounting to only a few pennies per pack. \nThe Durbin-DeWine amendment provides for substantial company-specific \npenalties which, in the aggregate, could reach $5 billion per year if \nthe companies continue to flout the law and blatantly target children. \nThe amendment also provides for an industry-wide surcharge of up to $2 \nbillion a year.\n  Through this important amendment we are speaking to the tobacco \ncompanies in the only language they understand--money. If they are \ngoing to continue to target children, these companies will pay a \nfinancial price far in excess of the profits raised from addicting \nchildren.\n  But, if they are willing to cooperate in efforts to prevent teenage \nsmoking, the companies may never have to pay a dollar in look-back \nsurcharges. A strong company-specific look-back, such as the one we are \nproposing, will give the tobacco companies a powerful financial \nincentive to use their skill in market manipulation to further rather \nthan undermine the public interest in reducing youth smoking. Each \ntobacco company must be held accountable for its actions on teenage \nsmoking. The stakes involved are nothing less than the health of the \nNation's children. For each percentage point that the tobacco industry \nmisses the target, 55,000 children will begin to smoke. One-third of \nthese children will die prematurely from smoking-induced diseases. We \nare talking about the difference of hundreds of thousands of children \nbetween the two approaches that are before the Senate now--one under \nthe proposed legislation and one under the Durbin-DeWine proposal. \nThis, I believe, is just absolutely an essential amendment that will \nreally strengthen the legislation to carry forward its very sound and \nimportant public health provisions to protect America's children.\n  Finally, I did want to also mention briefly the very substantial \nprovisions, as my friend and colleague, Senator Kerry, pointed out \nbefore, with regard to the preventive aspects of this legislation, the \nvery important smoking cessation programs, the prevention programs in \nschool and the prevention programs in communities. We have a number of \nteenage volunteers in our State, down in New Bedford, MA, and in \nclassrooms around our Commonwealth now, who are going out to various \nshopping malls to get the owners of the various shopping malls and the \nvarious shops to make these shopping malls smoke free. These are young \npeople. These are teenagers who we are asking to participate, to make a \ndifference in their communities, and they are prepared to do so.\n  Counteradvertising--we have seen, even in a State like our own State \nof Massachusetts, where the tobacco industry was spending 10 times as \nmuch as counteradvertising, still, the counteradvertising, talking \nabout the importance of the health implications and the dangers of \nsmoking, had a very important and significant impact in reducing the \nincidence of addiction--very, very important.\n  The medical research into addiction prevention and cure--as someone \nwho sits on the Health Committee, I know the work that is being done, \nin terms of addiction and substance abuse and also in nicotine. We \nknow--we have been listening--about how we ought to\n\n[[Page S5507]]\n\nbe concerned about the problems of substance abuse as well. We are \nconcerned about the problems of substance abuse.\n  There are two gateway drugs and smoking is No. 1. The second one is \ndrinking beer. This is a gateway drug. When I listen to our friends who \nhave indicated opposition to this legislation say this isn't the \nproblem that we ought to be dealing with, substance abuse, if you talk \nto anyone who has seriously worked on the problems of addiction and \nsubstance abuse, they will tell you that nicotine is right out there \nwith any of the other kind of addictions that are afflicting the young \nchildren in this country, and we can do something about it.\n  The various medical research into the tobacco-related diseases, and \nthere are many--emphysema and the whole complexities in terms of the \nlungs--there are many, we have resources to try and deal with those \nissues as well.\n  Madam President, I see my friend and colleague from Ohio on the \nfloor. I pay tribute to him for his leadership on this amendment. I \ncommend him for his work in this area. He has been an important leader \nin protecting the interests of children in our country and society on \nmany different matters. It is just a pleasure to join with him, and I \nurge the Senate to accept his wisdom and judgment about public policy \non this issue.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, first, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for \nhis very kind comments. I think the charts of the Senator from \nMassachusetts tell a great story, actually a sad story, but it is a \nvery effective story and really illustrates the need for this bill.\n  I also thank my other colleague from Massachusetts for his kind words \nabout this amendment a few moments ago.\n  The amendment that Senator Durbin and I have offered really will make \na few, but very necessary, improvements to the so-called look-back \nprovision of the underlying McCain bill. Let me start my remarks this \nafternoon by talking a little bit about the look-back concept, and then \nthe specific look-back provisions in the McCain bill, because I think \nan understanding of the broad concept of look-back is essential to \nunderstanding what the McCain bill tries to do in this area, and is \nalso essential to understanding what Senator Durbin and I are trying to \ndo with our amendment.\n  Conceptually, the purpose of look-back--whether in the original \ntobacco settlement, the McCain bill, or in the Durbin-DeWine \namendment--is to change the incentives for tobacco companies. Until \nnow, tobacco companies have always had an incentive--potential \nprofits--to convince children to use their products. The look-back \napproach simply flips this incentive--it turns it around by giving \ntobacco companies incentives to help reduce the number of minors using \ntheir products. This incentive structure, through which tobacco \ncompanies will work with us rather than against us in our goal to \nreduce youth tobacco use, is created by imposing assessments on tobacco \ncompanies if they do not meet targets reducing youth tobacco use.\n  It is simple: If the targets are not met, the companies will have to \npay. If the targets are not met to reduce teenage smoking--and these \nare targets that the tobacco companies all said they could do, all made \na commitment to do in the settlement they reached with the attorneys \ngeneral--if those targets are not made and are not met, then the \ntobacco companies will have to pay.\n  Before I get into the specifics of the McCain look-back provision and \nour amendment, I would like to reiterate what I have said several times \non the floor of the Senate before, and that is that the Chairman of the \nCommerce Committee, Senator McCain, has done a great job in bringing \nthis tobacco bill to the Senate floor against some very, very difficult \nodds. This is a comprehensive bill. Something like this, frankly, has \nnever been tried before, so I commend my colleague from Arizona for his \ngreat work.\n  This bill includes many different parts, each of which is important \nif we are really going to reduce youth use of tobacco. The look-back \nprovision that our amendment deals with is an important and integral \npart of this campaign to reduce youth use, but is only one of several \nthings the bill does, all of which are important, to have a real impact \non youth smoking. Again, I congratulate Senator McCain, as well as his \ncolleagues on the Commerce Committee, for facing this difficult issue \nand meeting it head on with a very sound piece of legislation.\n\n  I will now turn to a quick overview of the Durbin-DeWine amendment. \nMadam President, the Durbin-DeWine amendment will make two changes to \nthe look-back provision in the underlying McCain bill.\n  First, our amendment will shift the emphasis from an industry-wide \nlook-back to a company-specific look-back. Let me make it very clear, \nboth the McCain bill and the Durbin-DeWine amendment blend the company \nlook-back with the industry-wide look-back. Both are blends. The \ndifference is the Durbin-DeWine amendment puts more emphasis on the \nresponsibility of the individual tobacco company. We follow what I \nconsider to be, frankly, a more conservative point of view, and that is \naccountability, that the tobacco companies should have to live with the \nconsequences of their actions or even their inactions. That is the \nconservative way to look at it, but more important than that, it is the \nright way to look at it.\n  The second provision of the Durbin-DeWine amendment provides for \nincreasing the McCain bill's targets for the reduction of youth tobacco \nuse. Yes, by setting a higher target of reduction, the goal is to have \nfewer kids smoking. But having said that, let me emphasize that our \nprovision effectively takes us back to what the cigarette companies \nagreed to over a year ago when the cigarette companies and the \nattorneys general reached this agreement. Our provision takes us back \nto what the tobacco companies said they could do in June of last year.\n  I'll repeat that: We are simply increasing these reduction targets to \nlevels the tobacco industry and companies agreed was achievable just \nlast year in the attorneys general agreement.\n  Let me discuss in more detail these two specific changes in the look-\nback provision that we are providing in the Durbin-DeWine amendment. I \nwill first start with the company-specific emphasis and how we would \nrequire more accountability from the individual tobacco companies.\n  The first important change that I mentioned our amendment makes is \nthat it shifts the emphasis from an industry-wide look-back to a \ncompany-specific look-back. What does this really mean? Let me explain \nby using an example and by talking about my early concern of last \nyear's settlement which only contained an industry-wide look-back and \nhad no company-specific piece in it.\n  Under a pure industry-wide look-back, the industry is measured and \njudged as a whole on how well it does in reducing youth tobacco use. \nWhat this does, in effect, is dilute the incentive for each company to \ndo everything it can to make sure children are not using its products.\n  Why do I say that? Simply because the effects of whatever that \ncompany does--positive or negative--is spread across the entire \nindustry. In a sense, this is a form of socialism. Whatever they do, \nhowever well they do it, they only get a portion of the credit, and \nthey only get a portion of the blame. The intent is to share--everybody \nis in this together. You can have one company that does everything it \ncan to reduce teenage smoking, and you can have another company that \ncompletely ignores everything and goes about its business to continue \nto try to hook kids. It doesn't matter; each one is treated equally \nunder a pure industry system. I think that is wrong.\n  Let me raise a specific case that I brought up a few weeks ago when I \ntalked about this issue on the floor--a case that involves the Philip \nMorris company, the maker of Marlboro. This company, Philip Morris, \nthrough the use of the Marlboro Man and other marketing campaigns, has \nbeen extremely successful in selling cigarettes to our young people.\n  They know what they are doing. They are very, very good at marketing \ntheir product. They did such a good job that by 1993--if you can \nbelieve this--60 percent of all teen smokers in this country used \nMarlboro--60 percent. But\n\n[[Page S5508]]\n\nin the overall market of all cigarettes sold, the legal market, \nMarlboro only had 23.5 percent of the market. So 60 percent in illegal \nsales--60 percent to kids--and only 23.5 percent to legal, adult \nmarket. The Marlboro Man and other advertising did a fantastic job, \ntragically, in hooking young kids.\n  How would an industry-wide look-back approach affect Philip Morris, \nthe maker of Marlboro? After all, Philip Morris is responsible for a \nmajority of youth smoking, meaning this is the main company the look-\nback incentives should be aimed at.\n  Madam President, the industry-wide look-backs in the original \nsettlement and in the McCain bill would allocate the industry-wide \nassessments to each company based on its adult market share--not its \nshare of the youth market. So if the cigarette industry as a whole \nmisses its reduction targets, under the original settlement reached \nlast year, Philip Morris would only be responsible for 23 percent of \nthe total industry-wide look-back assessment, even though Philip Morris \nis responsible for 60 percent of all the youth smoking in the country.\n  So once again, let me ask the question that I have asked previously: \nWhat do we think Philip Morris will do under this industry-wide look-\nback if we had a pure industry-wide look-back provision? Will the look-\nback succeed in getting Philip Morris to try to reduce the number of \nchildren who use its products? I do not think so. For the industry-wide \nlook-back, it is pretty clear to me that the answer is no. Philip \nMorris will probably not try to reduce youth use of its products at \nall. Why? Well, it's simple: the incentive is not there. The industry-\nwide look-back forces other companies to pay for the sins of Philip \nMorris. Philip Morris is simply smarter to simply ignore the look-back.\n  So an industry-wide look-back in this case would fail to do what it \nis supposed to do. In the case of Philip Morris, it would fail to give \nthe proper incentive to the very company with the most responsibility \nfor stopping kids from using its products.\n  So, Madam President, what can we do to make sure the look-back \nprovision is effective and really gives tobacco companies the right \nincentives? The answer is simple. We need to hold each company \nresponsible individually for meeting the youth reduction targets, and \nallow each company to reap the rewards or face the consequences of its \nown behavior.\n  Madam President, it is the American way. It is the right way. Let us \nhold them responsible. Let us hold them accountable. Let us measure \ntheir success or their failure.\n  Right now about 3 million children, it is estimated, smoke Marlboro \ncigarettes which are made, as I mentioned, by Philip Morris. Instead of \nfocusing a look-back provision on what the industry as a whole does, it \nis so much more powerful to simply say to Philip Morris--this is what \nwe ought to say to them--``You have 3 million children who use Marlboro \ncigarettes--3 million in this country. You need to do everything you \ncan to help us reduce that number. That's your responsibility.''\n  That is what the look-back provision should hold them to. That is \nwhat the Durbin-DeWine amendment says. By focusing on a company-\nspecific rather than industry-wide look-back, we are simply telling \neach tobacco company that it is responsible for its own behavior. In \nthis way we create a more powerful incentive for each company to help \nus achieve the ultimate goal of this legislation. Let us never forget \nthat ultimate goal; that is, to reduce youth smoking in this country.\n  Let me talk, if I could, Madam President, about the second part of \nour look-back change that we make in the Durbin-DeWine amendment. Part \nof our amendment, as I mentioned, was to set higher reduction targets \nfor youth smoking than those set in the McCain bill. What this means is \nthat tobacco companies are given an incentive to try to get even more \nchildren to stop smoking.\n  Using the current level of youth smoking as the baseline, the Durbin-\nDeWine amendment would aim for a 67-percent reduction in youth smoking \nin ten years. This compares to the 60-percent goal contained in the \nMcCain bill. But this, I think, is the important thing: in real terms \nwhat this means is that 450,000 fewer children will smoke if the \ncompanies meet the reduction targets in our amendment. Since we know \nthat one-third of smokers die young as a result of their habit, this \nmeans that 150,000 fewer children will die early as a result of \nsmoking.\n  These are real kids. These are real children that we are talking \nabout, and they are quite possibly real deaths. So let me say it again. \nIf tobacco companies meet their reduction targets in our amendment, it \nwill mean 450,000 fewer youth smokers and 150,000 fewer early deaths \ndue to smoking.\n  What we need to remember is that the reduction targets in our \namendment in real terms are actually equal to the targets from last \nyear's settlement. Our amendment has the same targets to which the \nindustry agreed to last year.\n  To me, Madam President, this is an easy issue and it is an easy \ndecision. In effect, the industry has already agreed that it is \npossible to prevent almost half a million more kids from smoking than \nthe underlying bill calls for. Let us pass this amendment which stops \nthese kids from ever becoming smokers at all.\n  Again, I emphasize our amendment merely takes us back in real terms \nto what the industry, the tobacco companies and the attorneys general, \nagreed to last June. The 67 percent in our amendment is really equal to \nthe 60 percent they agreed to last June because of the change in the \nbaseline. The raw numbers are the same.\n  Madam President, I would like to respond for a moment to some of the \ncriticism that we have heard about this amendment. And let me just \ncomment about a few things.\n  Some Members have come to the floor and have argued that this might \nbe too punitive. Some have said that the potential assessments under \nthis amendment are just too high.\n  First, I would like to say that my sincere hope is that we never see \nany assessments under a look-back, because this would mean we will have \nmet our reduction goals for youth smoking. Once again, since the \nindustry, the tobacco industry, has agreed that these reduction goals \nare achievable, I think it is likely we will never see any assessment \nunder the look-back, at least that is what our goal is.\n  But this will only be true if we create a strong incentive for each \ncompany to meet the reduction targets. This is what our amendment, the \nDurbin-DeWine amendment does. The company-specific payments in the \nDurbin-DeWine amendment are higher than the McCain bill. However, the \nindustry-wide payments are lower. When you add the two types of look-\nbacks, company-wide and industry-wide together, you really will not \nfind a huge difference between our amendment and the McCain bill. We \nhave a different blend. We change the emphasis, but overall there isn't \na great deal of difference.\n  Let us take an example. Let us suppose that each and every company \nmisses the reduction target in a given year by 10 percent. If this \nhappens, the combination of industry-wide and company-specific payments \nin the McCain bill would add up to a total of $1.8 billion. In the \nDurbin-DeWine amendment, under those same set of facts, it would add up \nto $2.4 billion. There is a difference, but the difference is really \nnot huge.\n  Madam President, the real difference between our amendment and the \nMcCain bill is not the size of payments, but rather the emphasis. The \ncompany-specific focus of the Durbin-DeWine amendment places more \nincentive on each tobacco company individually to change its behavior \nand to stop children from using its products.\n  Madam President, others have argued to address another issue that has \nbeen raised, that company-specific look-backs are unfair because the \ncompany cannot really control whether kids use its products. Well, we \nknow from experience and seeing what these tobacco companies have done \nin the past that that simply is not true. There are many things that \ntobacco companies can do to prevent kids from using their cigarettes. \nThere have been many things that the tobacco companies have done to get \nkids to use their cigarettes. We know there are many things they can do \nto stop them as well or reduce it. Those who make that argument aren't \ngiving the tobacco companies enough credit. The most basic\n\n[[Page S5509]]\n\nthing tobacco companies can do is make sure its advertising is not \nappealing to kids.\n\n  Now, some of this is already taken care of and addressed in the \nMcCain bill. We do this by placing marketing restrictions on tobacco \ncompanies, such as prohibiting the use of cartoon characters or human \nimages. That is in the bill. But advertising is a subtle thing. The \ntobacco industry has proven a real expert at dealing with this. There \nis simply no way Congress can specifically prohibit every type of \nadvertising that might appeal to children. We are not that good. We \ncan't write legislation that specific.\n  The advantage of a company-specific look-back provision is that each \ncompany is given the incentive to think about other ways its \nadvertising may be attracting children and then to stop it. But even \nbeyond the issue of advertising, companies can still have an impact on \nhow many kids use their products. For example, they can initiate their \nown antismoking advertising campaigns or their own education programs \nthat would build on efforts called for elsewhere in this bill. They \ncould do it if they wanted to do it. Again, the buck stops with them \nunder our provision.\n  A company could also work with retailers to find ways to be \nabsolutely sure that none of its products were being sold to minors. \nThe relationship between retailers and tobacco companies is a very \nclose one. They have used it over the years to build sales. They can \ncertainly use it in the next few years to reduce illegal sales to \nminors.\n  So I think those who say that, gee, the tobacco companies can't be \nheld for liability on this, this is all beyond their control, I think \nthat argument is absolutely absurd.\n  As we can see, companies have any number of ways or tools to make it \nharder or less likely for children to use their products. We need to \nmake sure they have a strong incentive to put that great genius to \nwork. The only way to place a strong incentive on each company \nseparately is with a strong company-specific look-back penalty like \nthat contained in the Durbin-DeWine amendment.\n  The choice before the Senate is simple. We have the opportunity when \nthis amendment comes for a vote, the Durbin-DeWine amendment, to vote \non an amendment that will prove the basic purpose of this legislation, \nand that is to reduce youth smoking by holding individual tobacco \ncompanies more accountable for failing to reduce youth smoking, and by \nrestoring the original target set by the tobacco companies themselves \nand agreed to themselves. The Durbin-DeWine amendment will make a real \ndifference in young lives. I, once again, urge my colleagues to join us \non behalf of our young people and support the Durbin-DeWine look-back \namendment.\n  Some of my colleagues and friends have come to the floor, and I have \nheard legitimate talk about the problem of the illegal use of drugs. \nThat is a major problem. It is a major problem in our country today. It \nis a major problem with our young people. If we had to tick off two of \nthe major problems we have with our general population, but \nparticularly with our young people, we certainly would include \ncigarettes and we certainly would include the illegal use of drugs.\n  As I have listened to some of those debates, and I agree with what \nthey have said and I do not disagree in any way--in fact, I am struck \nby the similarity between the two issues--cigarettes and drugs. I think \nas we approach, really for the first time in this Congress, the issue \nof trying to comprehensively deal with tobacco use, and as we for the \nfirst time try to structure a comprehensive program to reduce the \nnumber of young people who start smoking cigarettes, who start to use \ntobacco, that the lessons we have learned as a society over the last \nfew decades in regard to the illegal use of drugs and how we deal with \nthat and how we try to reduce that, I think are very apt. I think we \nought to look at that effort in that war.\n  What have we learned? We have had some success in the war against \ndrugs and we have had an awful lot of failures, as well. We have seen \nthe use go up and we have seen the use go down. There are times in our \nhistory where we have driven the use down and at times we have driven \nthe use back up, particularly among our young people. I think we have \nlearned a great deal.\n  What have we learned that might be applicable to what we are trying \nto do in regard to cigarettes? A couple of things. One, price. Why do \nwe spend so much time, effort, and money to try to keep drugs from \ncoming into this country? Why do we go to the source countries? Why do \nwe try to help Colombia? Why do we have Coast Guard cutters today off \nthe coast of Haiti to try to interdict drugs? Why are we working in the \nBahamas? Why are we working in Mexico? Why are we doing everything we \ncan to try to stop drugs from coming into this country?\n  The answer is not only do we want to keep drugs out of the hands of \nanybody who might buy them in this country, but at the same time we are \ntrying to drive up the price of drugs. We know there is a direct \nrelationship between the cost of drugs on the streets of Cleveland, OH, \nLos Angeles, Cincinnati and the cost on the drug traffickers to get \nthem there; and we know there is an inverse relationship between the \nprice of those drugs and the use of those drugs. So if it is true with \nillicit drugs, and I think it is true for just about any product, it \ncertainly is true and the statistics have shown us that it can in many \ncases be true in regard to tobacco, as well.\n  Now, I happen to think, and I have argued on this floor, that price \nalone is not enough, driving up the price of tobacco is in and of \nitself not enough. We have seen that the studies have been conflicting \nin regard to the price issue. But I am convinced that price is an \nimportant factor.\n  What else have we learned about a war on drugs in general? We have \nlearned that when we have come forward with very effective antidrug \nadvertising campaigns that are focused in the media, that are focused \non radio and television--we know when the genius of Madison Avenue is \nutilized, we know they can be effective, and they are effective. We \nknow when we focus public attention on the issue that we can make a \ndifference. Advertising does work. Counteradvertising works, as well. \nAgain, another lesson from our war on drugs. We know what works and we \nknow what doesn't.\n  The same is true with education. We know that when you combine the \nincrease in cost, the price on the street of a drug, you combine that \nwith counteradvertising, you combine that with education sustained year \nafter year after year in school, that it will make a difference. Part \nof the problem with our anti-education programs that are anti-illicit \ndrugs, we only do them for 1 or 2 years. We might have a 5th or 6th \ngrade DARE program, and then a young person might not get another dose \nof that until 11th or 12th grade in health class. We know that is a \nproblem. Every study has shown the only way education is effective is \nstarting in kindergarten, preferably before that, and start K through \n12, every single year.\n  This is not rocket science. This is not difficult. It is the same way \nwith tobacco. The lessons we have learned, sometimes the hard way, in \nregard to how you deal with illicit drugs in this country--sometimes we \nact like we haven't learned those lessons, but those lessons can be \napplied in regard to stopping young people from smoking cigarettes.\n  What we are trying to do in this bill is to take the knowledge that \nwe have and come up with a comprehensive package that will in the long \nrun save tens of thousands of our young children's lives. That is what \nwe are about. So as we debate this bill and we talk about different \nprovisions, whether it is the look-back provision or other provisions, \nlet us keep our eye on the ball. Let us keep our eye on what are the \nbare facts and what the goal is. The goal is to reduce teenage smoking.\n  The only way that we can do that is to come up with a comprehensive \napproach that combines education, antismoking advertising, reduction in \nadvertising aimed at children, good law enforcement, and an increase in \nprice. When you put all of those things together you have a good, good, \nfighting chance to dramatically reduce teenage smoking in this country, \nwhich is what our goal is. That is why I continue to support this \nlegislation and continue to urge my colleagues, no matter what their \nposition is on individual amendments as they come up, to keep our eye\n\n[[Page S5510]]\n\non the ball and keep pushing this bill forward. It is essential that we \nget it passed. We have a great responsibility to get that job done. I \nhope we will continue to do it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I would like to address the question of \nthe National Tobacco Policy and Youth Smoking Reduction Act, S. 1415, \nthis afternoon, which the Senate is resuming consideration of today. \nThis is a very important bill, and I know the occupant of the Chair \nshares my concerns with this legislation and a concern that it be \npassed. This seeks to address a serious problem--tobacco use among our \nyoung people.\n  Both conservatives and liberals fault this legislation. Some say it \nis not strong enough; some say it goes too far. I think it strikes an \nappropriate balance and merits our support. It is not a perfect bill, \nbut I don't think we should let perfection be the enemy of the good. By \nstriving constantly for what each of us wants in the perfect bill, we \nwon't end up with anything. I am concerned about that.\n  Madam President, if one counts the Mondays and Fridays as part of \neach working week, there are only 68 legislative days remaining in this \ncongressional session before we adjourn for the midterm elections in \nthe fall. Sixty-eight days is not very long. Time is of the essence if \nwe are going to enact a comprehensive tobacco bill this year. I \ncertainly believe Congress should enact such legislation. Thus, I am \nhopeful that, following a vigorous and healthy debate, the Senate will \npass the McCain bill and send it along to the House.\n  Given all the disinformation circulating about this legislation--most \nof it, I might say, initiated by the tobacco industry--I would like to \ntake a few moments of the Senate's time to review the bidding as to why \nwe are considering national tobacco legislation at this time.\n  The opponents of S. 1415, the so-called McCain bill, would have us \nbelieve that this legislation is a case of tax and spend liberalism \ngone wild, that this bill is an excessive response to a relatively \nminor social problem--that of tobacco use among the young people--and \nthat an antitobacco media campaign is all we need, that is an adequate \nresponse. Well, for years the tobacco industry sought to discredit \nstudies which linked smoking to cancer and other diseases. Then the \nindustry told us that nicotine was not addictive. Now the industry says \nit doesn't target kids with any advertising or marketing programs and \nthat this legislation is just another opportunity--the McCain \nlegislation--for Washington to increase taxes on the U.S. public.\n  Let's look at the facts. There is indisputable consensus within the \npublic health community that tobacco use constitutes the single most \npreventable cause of death in this country. In other words, of all the \npossibilities of reducing deaths in our country, including better \nexercise, reduction in fat consumption, conducting what we might call a \nhealthful life, all of those things put together aren't as effective in \nimproving the health of the United States of America as giving up \nsmoking would be. In other words, it is the single most preventable \ncause of death. Who says that? Is it I, Senator Chafee from Rhode \nIsland? Not at all. It is the Centers for Disease Control.\n  Here is a chart. This chart says tobacco kills more Americans than \nalcohol, car accidents, suicides, AIDS, homicides, illegal drugs, and \nfires combined. In other words, all the effort we go to in this country \nto lecture people to use seat belts in order to reduce automobile \naccidents or fatalities and injuries from automobile accidents, and all \nwe do about counseling in connection with suicides, and the money we \npour into AIDS prevention and attempted cures, and homicides, and the \nbattle against illegal drugs and fires, and all we do to prevent fires \nfrom occurring in households, and the lectures on alcohol--if you put \nall of those together, tobacco kills more Americans than alcohol, car \naccidents, suicides, AIDS, homicides, illegal drugs, and fires \ncombined.\n  So if we are serious about doing something about improving the health \nof Americans, we should try to make every effort to entice Americans \nnot to take up smoking and, if they are smokers, to cease smoking.\n  Here are the figures: Tobacco kills 418,000 Americans every year by \ntobacco-related diseases; alcohol is 105,000; about one-fourth of the \ndeaths result from tobacco and fires, 4,300; illegal drugs, 9,000; and \nso forth. So you add them all together, and they don't amount to the \nfigures that are causing the deaths resulting from tobacco-related \ndiseases.\n  Where is the problem? The problem lies in that every day it is \nestimated in the United States of America 3,000 children and young \npeople start smoking in schoolyards, or wherever it might be, in our \ncountry. Every day, 3,000 youngsters take up smoking, and one-third of \nthese will die prematurely as a result of that habit. In other words, \nif they smoke, the chances are that about 33 percent will die \nprematurely because of the habit of smoking. Each year, 1 million \nadditional children--3,000 a day times 365 gets you very close to 1 \nmillion--1 million additional children become smokers. What we are \naiming for in this legislation is to prevent that and reduce the number \nof children who take up smoking.\n  There are those who say, ``Oh, well, tobacco use is a matter of \npersonal choice.'' But is this true when you are talking about young \npeople, impressionable children, 14, 15, 16, 17, in their teens? Ninety \npercent of those who take up smoking do so before the age of 18. In \nother words, if you can get someone by the age of 18 without having \ntaken up smoking, the chances are excellent that individual will not \nbecome a smoker. Ninety percent of smokers have taken it up before the \nage of 18.\n  Children obviously don't possess the same level of maturity as \nadults. They can't be expected to make the most thoughtful decisions on \nthis life-and-death matter of smoking. Sometimes it is the ``cool'' \nthing to do, apparently.\n  But the tobacco industry itself, in its own words--here is the \ninternal document from R.J. Reynolds. ``If a man''--or woman--``has \nnever smoked by the age of 18, the odds are three-to-one he never \nwill.'' If you haven't smoked by 18, the chances are pretty good that \nyou won't smoke ever--``three-to-one.'' By the age of 24, if you can \nhold off and not smoke at the age of 24, the odds ``are 20-to-one'' \nthat that individual you will not take up smoking.\n  That is where we want to concentrate our efforts--on these young \npeople in their early teens--and carry it up through the age of 24 when \nthe chances are very, very good that an individual will not take up \nsmoking. But the key group is 18 or younger.\n  Is there an epidemic of smoking amongst young people? You bet your \nlife there is. In my home State, where I never thought there was a \nparticular abundance of smoking--it is not going like going to China, \nwhere everybody seems to be smoking. That doesn't seem to be true in my \nState. Yet the Centers for Disease Control say that 37 percent of high \nschool children--I am not talking about high school seniors; I am \ntalking about high school children; that would be the 12th, 11th, and \n10th, and in some instances the 9th grade--smoke. That is more than \n70,000 teen smokers in our State. We have 1 million people in our \nState, and 70,000 teen smokers, one-third of these high school \nstudents, will lose their lives prematurely because of this unhealthy \nhabit.\n  Here is a graph that shows the increase in the rates of smoking among \nhigh school seniors. Now we are talking seniors. It is remarkable. It \nwent along pretty steadily at about 30 percent. Then in 1982 it even \ndipped down to about 27 percent. ] Then it shot up starting at about \n1991, up until the middle 30s nationally.\n\n  What has caused all of this? One of the things, obviously, that has \ncaused it is the action of advertising to these young people, whether \nit is the Marlboro man, or Joe Camel, or whatever it is. All the \nadvertising from the tobacco companies has been oriented toward \ninducing the young people to take up smoking. It is the ``in thing.'' \nThey want to make it the ``in thing.'' The tobacco companies clearly \ndo.\n  One of the ironies of the opposition of the tobacco companies to the \nMcCain\n\n[[Page S5511]]\n\nbill is the suggestion that this bill was somehow dreamed up by a bunch \nof Washington bureaucrats. The fact of the matter is that most of the \nprovisions in this bill have their origins in the global settlement the \nindustry entered into with the 40 States' attorneys general last June. \nIn other words, about a year ago the tobacco industry entered into a \ndeal with 40 of the attorneys general from our 50 States. In that, they \nmade a whole series of concessions. It had nothing to do with \nWashington, DC, or Washington bureaucrats, or tax-and-spend liberals in \nthe U.S. Congress. It was all initiated and agreed to by the tobacco \ncompanies and the attorneys general.\n  Let's tackle some of the things that came up in that agreement.\n  What about the idea of a per-pack tax on cigarettes to discourage \nteenagers from smoking? In other words, what is the idea of increasing \nthe tax, or fee, if you will, on each package of cigarettes that is \nsold in order to discourage teenagers from taking up smoking? Tobacco \ncompanies signed on to a 65-cents-per-pack increase during the \nsettlement negotiations. Sixty-five cents they agreed to. That had \nnothing to do with Washington, DC. That was out in the hinterlands, out \nin the States, working with the tobacco companies and the attorneys \ngeneral.\n  What about financial penalties on the tobacco companies for failure \nto meet the annual youth smoking reduction target? This is the so-\ncalled look-back provision. If there isn't a reduction of x percent--\nthis is written out in the contract, in the deal--if those reductions \naren't achieved by 40 percent or 50 percent, whatever it might be, by \nsuch and such number of years, then the tobacco companies will have to \npay an additional penalty. That is the so-called look-back provision at \nthe end. At the end of 5 years of this deal, you look back and see if \nthere has been this percentage reduction in teenage smoking.\n  Where did that come from? Out of the bureaucrats in Washington? Not \nat all. The tobacco companies agreed to this during the settlement with \nthe attorneys general.\n  What about advertising and marketing restrictions? The industry \nsigned off on that.\n  What about receipts from those new taxes to fund public health \nprograms such as counteradvertising, cessation of smoking efforts, \ncommunity-based antismoking programs, and all of these things that we \nare now thinking are wise to reduce smoking in the United States--not \njust to get people to not take it up in the beginning, to help those \nwho are smoking cease that very dangerous habit? Where did that come \nfrom? Did that come from Washington bureaucrats? Not at all. The \nindustry agreed to it in their dealings with the attorneys general.\n  The fact is, the McCain legislation is based largely on the \nnegotiations which produced the so-called global settlement, \ncomprehensive settlement, last June.\n  Given the American public's distaste for new taxes, it is not \nsurprising that the tobacco industry has seized upon the $1.10 increase \nin the price for a pack of cigarettes and has used this as a rallying \ncry of opposition.\n  Let's understand this. Who is going to pay this tax? Only people who \nsmoke. If they give up smoking, they won't pay the tax. Anybody who \nsays they don't like the tax, quit smoking and they won't have to pay a \nnickel of it.\n  Obviously, smokers are free to go on smoking. But I think we all \nought to understand that all of us are paying when there are smokers in \nour society. Why are they paying? Because one-third of those smokers \nare going to suffer very severe sickness and illness as a result of \ntheir smoking. And the direct health care costs--in other words, \nwhether Medicaid, Medicare, or other forms of assistance to those who \nsmoke, or are suffering from smoking-related illnesses--are paid for by \nall of us in society. It costs $60 billion a year to care for those \nindividuals. And when you take the lost productivity and the disability \npayments, it is estimated that smoking-related illnesses are causing \nAmerican taxpayers over $100 billion a year. Now, even for somebody \nfrom Washington, $100 billion is a lot of money. That is what these \ntobacco-caused illnesses are costing the taxpayers in the United \nStates.\n\n  Madam President, I urge Members of this body and the public also to \nlook closely at the facts I have enunciated here and not to be \ndissuaded from doing the right thing, not to be dissuaded by this blitz \nfrom the tobacco industry and the lobbying that is taking place. S. \n1415, the McCain bill, is a comprehensive bill, it is a good bill and \naddresses a very serious problem in our country. The time for action on \nit is now, and I hope my colleagues will support efforts to pass the \nlegislation.\n  Madam President, seeing no one else wishing to speak, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/01/senate-section/article/S5494-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, it is a privilege to take this \nopportunity to recognize the extraordinary leadership of the President \nof the Fraternal Order of Police in Massachusetts, Officer Elizabeth \nGianetti.\n  Officer Gianetti has achieved many ``firsts'' in her outstanding \ncareer. She is the first person to hold this position. She was \ninstrumental in its creation in 1993, when the 4,000 law enforcement \nofficers of Massachusetts decided that they needed a statewide \norganization to represent their concerns. And once the Massachusetts \nState F.O.P was established, Officer Gianetti was overwhelmingly \nelected its first president by the local F.O.P. lodges across the \nstate.\n  She is also the first woman in the 83-year history of the national \nFraternal Order of Police to head a state F.O.P. chapter.\n  Officer Gianetti comes to this position with an impressive record of \nachievements in law enforcement and service to the community.\n  She has been a Boston School Police Officer for more than 10 years. \nIn that capacity she has been actively involved in the community, and \nespecially active in working with children through such programs as \nBoston Medical Center's Children With AIDS Foundation. She has brought \nher enthusiasm for working with children to her position as state \nF.O.P. president. This summer, for example, she will coordinate a \nsafety day with the goal of educating children and parents about \nkeeping children safe, including the distribution of bicycle helmets to \nhelp prevent accidents and injuries.\n  Elizabeth Gianetti's initiatives with the state Fraternal Order of \nPolice and her work for the people of Massachusetts are truly \nremarkable. We are proud of her accomplishments, and I know that all \nSenators join me in commending her fine record of public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/01/senate-section/article/S5511-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5511-S5512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT ENROLLED BILL \n                                 SIGNED\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 7, 1997, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on May 26, 1998, during the adjournment of \nthe Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the\n\n[[Page S5512]]\n\nSpeaker has signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 2400.

It is \n     already a prominent vehicle for doing business through \n     selling goods and services and providing information leading \n     to commercial transactions. The business value of selling \n     access to the Internet is in itself a multi-billion dollar \n     enterprise. The growth projections for the Internet and for \n     its impact on commerce are very high; and\n       ``Whereas, As with any new aspect of commerce, there are \n     numerous tax implications associated with the Internet. The \n     new technology and capabilities can be used to avoid local \n     taxes. Numerous transactions involve automatic transfers of \n     money for goods and services. Borders and jurisdictions have \n     become far less significant in this new marketplace; and\n       ``Whereas, With the rise of the Internet, state and local \n     policymakers have suggested various ways to tax this \n     activity. Some states have explored telecommunications taxes \n     and taxes on Internet service providers. Industry observers \n     are concerned that implementing a ``modem tax'' could disrupt \n     the development of a new tool for commerce and economic \n     development; and\n       ``Whereas, With the complexity of issues involved and the \n     constant changes in this new technology as it takes shape, \n     imposing taxes specific to the Internet would likely be \n     harmful. Any possible gains in revenues would be more than \n     offset by long-term changes in the evolution of the Internet. \n     Greed should not drive policy or taxation decisions; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       ``Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact \n     legislation to create a moratorium on new national, state, \n     and local taxes on the Internet; and be it further\n       ``Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted \n     to the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of \n     the United States House of Representatives, and the members \n     of the Michigan congressional delegation.''\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-444.

Jenkins (495 U.S.33, 110 S.Ct. 1691 (1990)), \n     the court held that a federal court had the power to order an \n     increase in state and local taxes; and\n       ``Whereas, The unprecedented decision by the court in \n     Missouri v. Jenkins violated a fundamental tenet of the \n     separation of power. No members of the federal judiciary, who \n     serve for life and are answerable to no one, should have \n     control over the power of the purse; and\n       ``Whereas, Section 8 of Article I of the Constitution of \n     the United States vests with the legislative branch of \n     government alone the extraordinary power to ``. . . lay and \n     collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts \n     and provide for the common Defense and general Welfare of the \n     United States''; and\n       ``Whereas, The court's actions are an intrusion into a \n     legitimate political debate over state spending priorities \n     and not a response to a constitutional directive.

which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                              S. Res. 238\n\n       Whereas President Clinton will be the first United States \n     head of state to visit China\n\n[[Page S5518]]\n\n     since the 1989 crackdown on the pro-democracy movement at \n     Tiananmen Square;\n       Whereas according to the State Department's China Country \n     Report on Human Rights Practices for 1996, ``The Government \n     continues to commit widespread and well documented human \n     rights abuses, in violation of internationally-accepted \n     norms, stemming from the authorities' intolerance of dissent, \n     fear of unrest, and the absence or inadequacy of laws \n     protecting basic freedoms.'';\n       Whereas the symbolism of the official arrival ceremony \n     which will take place in Tiananmen Square could be \n     interpreted as a message to the Chinese people that will \n     override anything the President might say about human rights \n     and the rule of law;\n       Whereas specific human rights preconditions should have \n     been set forth before setting the date for the President's \n     visit; and\n       Whereas the President can still make important human rights \n     points during his visit to Beijing: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) at the upcoming United States-China summit the \n     President should--\n       (A) secure from China's leaders a pledge to remove by a \n     certain date the names on an official reentry blacklist, \n     which now contains the names of more than fifty Chinese \n     citizens living in the United States who cannot return to \n     China because of their peaceful advocacy of greater rights \n     and freedom; and\n       (B) visit family members of victims of the 1989 massacre, \n     many of whom still suffer from political harassment, \n     discrimination or persecution; and\n       (2) in the context of the upcoming United States-China \n     summit, the President should urge the Chinese leaders to--\n       (A) engage in a meaningful dialogue with the Dalai Lama \n     with the aim of establishing genuine cultural and religious \n     autonomy in Tibet;\n       (B) revise China's vague, draconian security laws, \n     including the provisions on ``endangering state security'' \n     added to the criminal code in March 1997;\n       (C) release unconditionally all imprisoned political, \n     religious, and labor activists detained for their peaceful, \n     nonviolent involvement in public protests;\n       (D) review the sentences of more than 2,000 convicted so-\n     called ``counterrevolutionaries'' with a view towards \n     granting full amnesty and releasing those convicted solely \n     for exercising their internationally recognized rights of \n     free speech and association, especially since the crime of \n     ``counterrevolution'' has itself been abolished;\n       (E) encourage greater cooperation by the Chinese government \n     with the United Nation's human rights mechanisms and greater \n     transparency in China's legal and detention system;\n       (F) ease religious repression by abolishing the requirement \n     that all religious sites register with the official Religious \n     Affairs Bureau and implementing the 1994 recommendations of \n     the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Religious \n     Intolerance;\n       (G) lift government mandated quotas on the number of monks \n     and nuns in monasteries and nunneries, end the government's \n     current ``reeducation'' campaign, and immediately reinstate \n     all monks and nuns expelled from their monasteries and \n     nunneries for failing to denounce the Dalai Lama;\n       (H) allow access by credible, independent human rights or \n     humanitarian organizations to the nine-year-old boy \n     recognized by the Dalai Lama in 1995 as the reincarnation of \n     the Panchen Lama; and\n       (I) allow regular, unmonitored access to Tibet and \n     Xinjiiang province of China by independent human rights \n     monitors.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am going to introduce a resolution \ntoday that I will send to the desk. This will be on behalf of--I will \ndo it after my remarks--myself and Senators Durbin and Leahy.\n  This is a resolution calling upon the President to make human rights \na major priority in his June visit to China. Probably later on we will \nintroduce this resolution in the form of a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment to the Department of Defense bill.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution calling upon the \nPresident to make human rights a major priority in his June visit to \nChina. Thus far, the Administration has not articulated any concrete \ngoals or objectives for the upcoming summit, other than to demonstrate \na friendly relationship between the U.S. and China. Preliminary \nnegotiations with the Chinese leadership on the summit agenda indicate \nthat Beijing is unlikely to make any major policy concessions when it \ncomes to human rights.\n  I am not opposed--I think I need to say that again--to high-level \ndiscussions with the Chinese leadership. In fact, I think they can be \nvery useful. But I am worried about the symbolism of a Presidential \nvisit, and I think it may backfire if the President does not continue \nto speak out about our strong concerns when it comes to China's human \nrights record. The summit could be interpreted by many as legitimizing \npolicies of the Chinese regime which, despite some legal reforms, \ncontinue to repress religious freedom and political freedom as well as \npolitical dissent.\n  The Chinese have avidly sought a Presidential visit because it \nsignals to all at home and abroad that the U.S. has muffled its \nopposition to, and endorses cooperation with the Beijing government, \nthe same government that continues to deny its citizens basic human \nrights and freedoms. By agreeing to a Presidential visit, without \nsignificant human rights preconditions--not merely token gestures--I \nfear that the Administration may be squandering a tremendous source of \nleverage with the Chinese government.\n  Since the May 1994 decision to delink trade and human rights, the \nAdministration has not yet developed an effective bilateral or \nmultilateral strategy for promoting meaningful improvements in human \nrights conditions in China and Tibet. I was deeply disappointed this \nyear that despite a 95 to 5 vote in support here in the Senate, the \nAdministration did not sponsor a resolution on China's human rights \nrecord at the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva, which is exactly \nthe place you would bring such a resolution forward. We didn't do so. \nMr. Wei, China's best known political dissident, has pointed out that \nthe Chinese people view the commission's work as ``barometer'' to the \nhuman rights commission which met in Geneva by which to judge whether \nthere is any international backing for their democracy movement in \ntheir country of China.\n  Our current policy may send a message to those brave men and women \nwho risk their lives to campaign for democracy and freedom that the \nUnited States is not behind them.\n  By the way, I apply the standard to human rights or violations of \nhuman rights in all kinds of countries, be they left or be they right; \nit makes no difference.\n  In a speech that Mr. Wei presented at the Commission in Geneva, he \nrecalled, ``Last year, when the Commission failed to adopt a resolution \non China, my prison guards laughed at me and said: `Look at your so-\ncalled friends. They betrayed you,''' He went on to say, ``This is \nprecisely the time when support from our friends is most needed. And \nthis is precisely the time that Western democracies have chosen to \nwithdraw their support.''\n  The Administration claims that China has made progress in the area of \nhuman rights. In my view, this is simply not true. The recent steps \ntaken by the Chinese government are merely token, cosmetic gestures--\ndiplomatic bargaining tactics that do not amount to a more open, free \nsociety. The overall pattern of human rights violations remains \nfundamentally unchanged.\n  While I wholeheartedly welcome China's announcement to sign the \nInternational Covenant on civil and Political Rights, until it is \nactually signed and ratified, it is not fully binding. Two months after \ntheir pledge to sign, the Chinese have still not specified when they \nwill sign or ratify this treaty. Even more importantly, once ratified, \nthe Chinese must implement this treaty, which will require major \nchanges in domestic laws and policies. So, it will be a long process \nbefore this covenant translates into concrete change or greater freedom \nfor the Chinese people. A mere non-binding verbal agreement to sign \nshould not be trumpeted as a huge victory and certainly did not warrant \ndropping the Geneva resolution.\n  That is what happened. Our Government, the administration, said to me \nthat we are not going to go forward because the Chinese have agreed to \nsign this international convenant on civil and political rights. \nSeveral months have gone by. They haven't signed it. Even if they sign \nit, there is no evidence that they are necessarily going to implement a \nnonbinding international agreement, and it should not be a reason for \nhaving brought a resolution protesting their violation of human rights \nbefore the Geneva commission on civil rights. As my colleague Senator \nBiden said, ``I don't agree with Senator Wellstone and others.'' The \npresiding Chair might not as well, when it comes to linking human \nrights with trade policy. That is too blunt an instrument. But if there \nwas ever a place to bring this up, it should have been at the human \nrights gathering; it should have been in Geneva.\n\n[[Page S5519]]\n\n  I am very happy that both my dear friend Wei Jingsheing and Wang Dan \nare in good health, safe and out of prison. However, we must be clear. \nThese men were not released. They were forced into exile. Should either \nof them return to their homeland, they would be thrown into prison upon \narrival. The Chinese government maintains a re-entry blacklist which \ncontains the names of more than fifty Chinese citizens living in the \nU.S. Just last month two Chinese American democracy advocates were \ndetained and deported upon their arrival in China. The forced exile of \nWei and Wang does not represent systematic change. In early 1995 Wang \nwrote, ``A society still needs idealists--people who are willing to \nsacrifice themselves to uphold the basic ideals of freedom and \ndemocracy.''\n  I have to tell you that I don't know how they do it in these \ncountries. I don't know how they do it. Maybe if it were I, myself, and \nI lived in a repressive country, I would speak out. Maybe I would have \nthe courage to do it--maybe. But if I thought that my children, or my \nspouse, my loved ones, could also be rounded up, that they could be \nimprisoned, that they could be tortured, that they could be murdered--\nwhich is too often the case in too many countries; there are at least \n70 countries that systematically practice torture in our world today--I \ndon't know whether I could ever speak up. I think I would be afraid to, \ngiven what could happen to my loved ones.\n  It is cruel irony that these brave men's exiles are being used as \nevidence of China's progress.\n  Human rights advocates in China and around the world fear that the \nrelease of high profile dissidents could be used to justify a reduction \nin international pressure for systematic change in China, where \naccording to the government's own count, some 2,000 people remain \nimprisoned for the crime of ``counterrevolution,'' now called \n``endangering state security.'' Thousands more--political, labor, and \nreligious dissidents--are serving terms of up to three years of ``re-\neducation through labor'' without trial. The releases of Wei and Wang \nare clearly political calculations by the Chinese leadership, who have \nbecome adept at trading well-known prisoners in pre-summit diplomatic \nbargaining. Engaging the Chinese in this game of saving face and \ntrading diplomatic favors sends out a message that we are not serious \nabout human rights.\n  For years before the world ever saw the televised massacre at \nTiananmen Square, peaceful demonstrations in Lhasa have been crushed by \nthe PLA. Once imprisoned Tibetans, particularly monks and nuns, face \nunimaginable torture at the hands of prison officials. Furthermore, the \nChinese government's policy of forced migration of Han Chinese into \nTibet has rendered Tibetans a minority in cities such as Lhasa, where \nthey are marginalized and alienated. As the Chinese presence grows \nstronger, Tibet's unique culture faces the threat of extinction.\n  The Tibetan people have remained steadfast in their commitment to the \npath of non-violence. However, some Tibetan exiles are growing \nimpatient, as indicated by one man's recent death through self-\nimmolation. In a desperate attempt to draw the attention of the \ninternational community to the worsening situation in Tibet, Thubten \nNgodup, a 50-year-old Tibetan exile in Delhi, India, set himself on \nfire.\n  In a recent meeting with President Jiang Zemin, Secretary Albright \nbrought up the subject of Tibet and the American desire for a dialogue \nbetween Dalai Lama and the Chinese leadership. The Chinese sharply \ndismissed the Dali Lama and flat out refused to enter into negotiations \nin order to bring about a peaceful settlement to the Tibetan issue.\n  The resolution I am submitting outlines concrete steps that would \nindicate a serious commitment to human rights concerns. In the context \nof the upcoming summit, we call upon the administration, at the highest \nlevel, to urge the Chinese leadership to revise their vague, draconian \nsecurity laws, including provisions on ``endangering state security'' \nadded to the criminal code in March 1997; to release unconditionally \nlarge numbers of imprisoned political, religious, and labor activists; \nand to review the sentences of more than 2,000 prisoners sentenced for \n``counterrevolutionary'' activities, a crime that itself has been \nabolished.\n  With regards to religious freedom, the Administration should \nencourage the Chinese leadership to abolish the requirement that all \nreligious sites register with the official Religious Affairs Bureau; to \nlift government mandated quotas on the number of monks and nuns in \nmonasteries and nunneries; and to immediately reinstate all monks and \nnuns expelled from their monasteries and nunneries for failing to \ndenounce the Dalai Lama.\n  This resolution also calls upon the administration to encourage the \nChinese leadership to engage in a meaningful dialogue with the Dalai \nLama with the aim of establishing genuine cultural and religious \nautonomy in Tibet.\n  Another concern is the symbolic significance of the President's \nofficial arrival ceremony which will take place in Tiananmen Square. We \nask the President to make time in his schedule to meet with family \nmembers of at least one of the victims of the 1989 massacre, many of \nwhom still suffer from political harassment, discrimination or \npersecution. We also ask the President to secure from the Chinese a \npledge to get rid of the re-entry blacklist, which contains the names \nof more than fifty Chinese citizens living in the U.S. who cannot \nreturn to China. Allowing pro-democracy activists, journalists or labor \norganizers to return to China would be a significant gesture by the \nChinese authority. Finally, until the Chinese leadership takes serious, \nconcrete action on the concerns outlined above, we would strongly \noppose lifting the trade sanctions imposed after the 1989 crackdown on \ndemonstrators at Tiananmen Square.\n  Some say that we cannot influence what happens in China, that the \ncountry is too proud, too large, and that changes take too long. I \ndisagree. For years we have pressured the Chinese on human rights, and \nto let up now is tantamount to defeat for the cause of human justice. \nDissidents who have been freed and come to the United States have \nthanked advocates for keeping them alive, by keeping the pressure on, \nand focusing attention on their plight. It is our duty and in the \ninterest to make the extra effort required to promote freedom and \ndemocracy in China, and to bring it into compliance with international \nstandards on human rights.\n  Let me just make one other point. For years, before the world ever \nsaw the televised massacre of Tiananmen Square, Peaceful demonstrations \nin Tibet have been crushed. Once imprisoned, Tibetans, particularly \nmonks and nuns, face unimaginable torture at the hands of prison \nofficials. Furthermore, the Chinese Government's forced migration of \nHan Chinese into Tibet has rendered the Tibetans a minority in their \nown country, and as the Chinese presence grows stronger an stronger, \nTibet's unique culture basically faces extinction. So let me just be \ncrystal clear. Whether it is in China or Tibet as well, we ought to be \nspeaking up for human rights.\n  Jiang Zemin, in a recent meeting with Secretary Albright, made it \ncrystal clear when the subject of Tibet was brought up that the Chinese \nare not interested in sitting down in any negotiations with the Dalai \nLama and are unwilling to bring about any kind of peaceful settlement \nto the Tibetan issue.\n  So in this resolution, this is what we call upon the administration \nto do at the highest level: to urge the Chinese leadership to revise \ntheir vague, draconian security laws, including provisions on \n``endangering state security,'' added to the Criminal Code in March of \n1997; to urge the Chinese to release unconditionally a large number of \nimprisoned political, religious, and labor activists, and to review the \nsentences of more than 2,000 prisoners sentenced for \n``counterrevolutionary activities,'' a crime that has been abolished.\n  With regard to religious freedom, the administration should encourage \nthe Chinese leadership to abolish the requirement that all religious \nsites be registered with the official Religious Affairs Bureau, to lift \nGovernment mandated quotas on the number of monks and nuns in \nmonasteries and nunneries, and to immediately reinstate monks and nuns \nfailing to denounce the Dalai Lama.\n\n[[Page S5520]]\n\n  This resolution also calls upon the administration to encourage the \nChinese leadership to engage in meaningful dialog with the Dalai Lama \nwith the aim of establishing genuine cultural and religious and \npolitical freedom and autonomy in Tibet.\n  Another concern is the symbolic significance of the President's \nofficial arrival ceremony, which will take place in Tiananmen Square. \nWe ask the President to make time in this schedule to meet with family \nmembers of at least one of the victims of the 1989 massacre, many of \nwhom still suffer from political harassment, discrimination, and \npersecution.\n  We also ask the President to secure from the Chinese a pledge to get \nrid of the reentry blacklist which contains the names of more than 50 \nChinese citizens living in the United States who cannot return to \nChina. Allowing prodemocracy journalists or labor organizers to return \nto China would be a significant gesture by the Chinese authority. \nFinally, until the Chinese leadership takes serious, concrete action on \nthe concerns outlined above, we would strongly oppose lifting the trade \nsanctions imposed after the 1989 crackdown on demonstrators at \nTiananmen Square.\n  As a U.S. Senator, I cannot forget the courage of those students, \ncannot forget the murder of those students, and cannot forget their \nstruggle then and their struggle now for democracy in their country. It \ntook us a little time, but that is why I am really pleased that I \nbelieve our Government has really come out on the side of the students \nin Indonesia, and I think we are making a difference.\n  Mr. President, some say that we cannot influence what happens in \nChina; the country is too proud, too large, and the changes take too \nlong. I disagree. For years, we pressured the Chinese on human rights, \nand to let up now is tantamount to defeat for the cause of human \njustice. Dissidents who have been freed and have come to the United \nStates have thanked advocates for keeping them alive by keeping the \npressure on, by focusing on their plight. It is our duty and it is in \nour interests to make the extra effort required to promote freedom and \ndemocracy in China and to bring it into compliance with international \nstandards on human rights.\n  Mr. President, there will be a great deal of activity this week that \nwill be focusing on the President's upcoming visit, and I really hope \nthat when Senator Durbin and Senator Leahy and I bring this resolution \nto the floor as a sense-of-the-Senate amendment, we will get a very \nstrong vote.\n  I really do believe, whether it is in China or whether it is in \nIndonesia or whether it is in North Korea or whether it is in a whole \nlot of countries, the former Burma, you name them, there simply has to \nbe a way that we, as a nation, lead the way. There has to be a way that \nthe United States of America can be there to support people. We cannot \ndo everything. We don't directly intervene in all of these countries. \nBut it saddens me that all too often we just simply turn our gaze away \nfrom people who are willing to almost stand alone to challenge \nrepressive governments. We ought to be more on their side. We ought to \nbe speaking out more about human rights. We ought to be speaking out \nmore about the importance of democracy in other countries.\n  I really believe that the President's visit to China will be a test \ncase. If the President of the United States of America is going to go \nto Tiananmen Square--I wish he wouldn't. I wish he would not do so, but \nif he is going to visit, then he needs to visit with the families of \nthose who gave their lives for freedom in that country. He needs to \nspeak out about human rights. He needs to use the leverage of our \ncountry and the leadership of the United States of America to make a \ndifference. We just can't say, well, markets, markets, markets; there \nwill be all sorts of markets; we will make all kinds of money; it will \nbe great for the business community.\n  Great. I come from a State that is an export State. The Presiding \nOfficer comes from a State where agriculture is very important. \nAgriculture is very important in Minnesota. I am really proud of \nagriculture. I am proud of the business sector in our State. But these \nare not mutually exclusive goals. I am not arguing that we are not \ninterested in trade. I am not arguing that we don't look to future \nmarkets. But what I am saying is that it just makes me uneasy as an \nAmerican citizen and it makes me uneasy as a Senator that we focus \nexclusively on commercial ties, exclusively on markets, exclusively on \nmoney to be made, all of which is fine up to the point where we just \nturn our gaze away from human rights violations, countries that \nsystematically round up and imprison people because they speak out. \nThat is wrong. That is wrong. That is not what our country is about.\n  Since I have time to speak about human rights today, I will finish \nthis way. All of us, I think, develop our viewpoints based upon our own \nlife experience. I was a teacher for 20 years before having the \nopportunity to become a Senator, before the people of Minnesota gave me \nthis chance, and I used to ask students to write on the same essay \nquestion at the end of every take-home paper, and the question was: Why \ndo you think about what you think about politics? I never graded it. I \njust wanted them to think about what shaped their viewpoint--why do \nthey care about some things and not others? Why do they consider \nthemselves a liberal or conservative, whatever label you use? Was it \ntheir religion? Was it their family, mother or father? Was it some kind \nof powerful, crystallized experience where maybe--I remember one \nstudent wrote an essay and he talked about how his brother was born \nwith disabilities, developmental disabilities, and that just completely \nchanged his life and his family's life. Their whole view about whether \nor not maybe some people needed help, their whole view about health \ncare policy changed on the basis of what he saw with his brother and \nhis struggle and the struggles of his family.\n  Well, for me, I don't come to the floor to try to make life difficult \nfor our President. I don't come to the floor to criticize for the sake \nof criticizing. But my father, who is no longer alive, fled persecution \nin Russia, and the one thing that he talked about more than anything \nelse was the importance of freedom and how much he loved our country.\n  Well, I come from a background of an immigrant who fled persecution. \nI come from a background of an immigrant who fled persecution from \nRussia whose family was probably murdered by Stalin, who at age 17 left \nRussia and never saw his family again.\n  I don't even know why I am talking about this on the floor of the \nSenate, but I think it applies somehow. At the very end of my dad's \nlife he had Parkinson's disease, and we would spend the night with him. \nSheila and I would rotate spending the night with him. Here he lived in \nthe United States of America for 60 years and spoke perfect English, \nbut all of his dreaming was in Russian. But it was not good dreams. It \nwas shouting, it was torment, it was agony. As a son, I just cried. I \ndidn't know what he was saying. I don't know the language. But I knew \nthat this was anguish.\n  What I always believed, and what I believe as I speak on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate today, is that this is what happens when you can never \ngo back to your country, when you never can see your family again. \nAmericans, thank God, don't have that experience too often. What does \nit mean when you can never go back and see your family again? What does \nit mean when you probably know, because you work for the U.S. \nGovernment, and my dad worked for the Voice of America, that your \nmother and father and sister were probably murdered?\n  We should support human rights in other countries. We should be \nsupporting human rights in China.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a ``Dear Colleague'' from \nmyself and Senator Durbin, and a letter, dated May 29, 1998, that I \nsent to President Clinton, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 29, 1998.\n       Dear Colleague: As you know, President Clinton will be the \n     first U.S. head of state to visit China since the 1989 \n     crackdown on the pro-democracy movement at Tiananmen Square. \n     We intend to introduce a resolution next week urging the \n     President to use the opportunity of the upcoming U.S.-China \n     summit to press for significant, concrete\n\n[[Page S5521]]\n\n     human rights progress in China and Tibet. We are also sending \n     a letter to President Clinton, expressing our concerns. \n     Copies of both are enclosed.\n       Some specific steps which would indicate a true commitment \n     to greater openness and freedom on the part of the Chinese \n     leadership include the unconditional release of imprisoned \n     political, labor, and religious activists; an end to the \n     formal process of requiring all religious groups to register \n     with the authorities and submit to state control; the \n     initiation of a meaningful dialogue with the Dalai Lama and \n     steps to ease repression in Tibet; and a revision of China's \n     vague, draconian security laws, including the provisions on \n     ``endangering state security'' added to the criminal code in \n     March 1997.\n       Given the importance of a Presidential visit to the Chinese \n     leadership, this summit provides an excellent opportunity for \n     President Clinton to act and speak out strongly on behalf of \n     internationally-recognized human rights. Please join us in \n     signing the enclosed letter and cosponsoring the resolution. \n     If you have questions or would like to cosponsor the \n     resolution and sign the letter, please let us know or have \n     your staff contact Debra Ladner at 224-5641.\n           Sincerely,\n     Paul Wellstone,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Richard Durbin,\n       U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 29, 1998.\n     President William Jefferson Clinton,\n     The White House, Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: During the summit meeting in Washington \n     last October with Chinese President Jiang Zemin, you spoke \n     out clearly to condemn the brutal 1989 crackdown on the pro-\n     democracy movement, declaring that China's leaders were ``on \n     the wrong side of history.'' As you prepare to visit China--\n     the first U.S. chief executive to go to China since 1989--we \n     are writing to urge you to act and speak out just as strongly \n     on behalf of internationally-recognized human rights.\n       For China to become a fully reliable member of the global \n     trading community, its leadership must demonstrate greater \n     respect for fundamental rights and the rule of law. In the \n     crucial weeks leading to your visit, we hope the \n     Administration will press for significant, concrete human \n     rights progress in China and Tibet. This is a time of \n     enormous opportunity, given the importance of your visit both \n     to the Chinese leadership and to U.S.-Sino relations.\n       Specifically, we urge you to:\n       Reconsider your decision to visit Tiananmen Square, as we \n     feel it is inappropriate. However, if you do choose to visit, \n     as reports indicate, visit family members of the victims of \n     the 1989 massacre, many of whom still suffer from political \n     harassment, discrimination or persecution;\n       Call for the unconditional release and amnesty of \n     political, religious and labor activists, imprisoned solely \n     for non-violent, peaceful protests, including some 150 \n     Beijing residents still imprisoned since the 1989 crackdown;\n       Press for revisions in China's state security laws to bring \n     them into conformity with international standards, and steps \n     to abolish arbitrary administrative punishments, particularly \n     the use of ``re-education through labor;''\n       Urge steps to protect freedom of association for Chinese \n     workers, including the right to form free trade unions as \n     guaranteed in the International Covenant on Economic, Social \n     and Cultural Rights, which China signed in October 1997;\n       Promote religious freedom in China by calling for an end to \n     the current process of formally requiring all religious \n     groups to register with the authorities and submit to state \n     control;\n       Encourage a meaningful dialogue with the Dalai Lama and \n     steps by Chinese officials to ease repression in Tibet, such \n     as the release of imprisoned Buddhist monks, nuns and other \n     Tibetans; an end to the ``re-education'' campaign by Chinese \n     authorities resulting in the expulsion of thousands of monks \n     and nuns who refuse to denounce the Dalai Lama; and regular \n     access to Tibet by international human rights monitors.\n       We hope your visit will lead to meaningful progress on \n     these critical human rights issues of such urgent concern to \n     members of Congress and the American people.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Paul Wellstone,\n     U.S. Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/01/senate-section/article/S5517-4", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 239--AUTHORIZING TESTIMONY, DOCUMENT PRODUCTION, AND \n                   REPRESENTATION OF SENATE EMPLOYEES\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I wish to draw attention to \nlegislation I have cosponsored that will create the Medical Innovation \nTax Credit. This bill will facilitate the development of lifesaving \nmedical treatments at medical schools and teaching hospitals. I am \npleased to join my colleagues, Senators D'Amato, Feinstein, Boxer, and \nHutchison, in this initiative.\n  In my own State of West Virginia, and throughout this country, \nacademic medical centers are feeling the changes in the health care \nmarketplace. With limited reimbursement under managed care and cuts in \nMedicare payments, these medical institutions are under increasing \nfinancial pressures.\n  To compound these stressors, academic medical centers also support \ncertain services, such as burn units or trauma centers, which are vital \nto the community but financially draining to a hospital's budget. West \nVirginia University's Ruby Memorial Hospital, for example, operates a \ntrauma unit which serves as a lifeline to victims of serious injuries. \nOur legislation would help these academic medical centers to avoid \nchoosing between research and the day-to-day activities associated with \nthe running of a hospital.\n  Under the Medical Innovation Tax Credit, pharmaceutical or \nbiotechnology companies would receive a tax credit equal to 20 percent \nof the funds spent for medical research expenses conducted at eligible \nsites. This incentive will make them a more attractive site for \nclinical trials. Given the important role played by academic medical \ncenters, I believe this support is warranted.\n  Mr. President, our bill will add a freestanding section to the \nInternal Revenue Code to create this research incentive. It is intended \nto complement the existing research-targeted tax credits--the Research \nand Experimental Tax Credit and the Orphan Drug Tax Credit, both of \nwhich have been credited with stimulating billions of dollars in \nresearch. Initial clinical studies are just the beginning, however. \nAdditional studies are frequently needed to determine combinations for \nadministering drugs and for providing the most appropriate therapies to \npatients. The Medical Innovation Tax Credit is\n\n[[Page S5522]]\n\ngeared toward promoting this type of research.\n  Aside from medical schools and teaching hospitals, National Cancer \nInstitute-designated centers will also be eligible sites. Peer-reviewed \nclinical trials are credited with providing cancer patients the best \navailable care. Our legislation will indirectly promote these \nopportunities for care.\n  Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals affiliated with teaching \nhospitals will also be eligible under the legislation. VA research is \nnot only supported by an appropriation, but by private donations \nlargely from pharmaceutical companies in support of clinical drugs \ntrials. Clinical research conducted in VA medical centers has a \nsignificant and lasting impact on the care provided to veterans.\n  Mr. President, if America is to continue leading in the field of \nbiomedical research, we must do all we can to assure that valuable \nresearch programs at medical schools and teaching hospitals do not \nsuffer because of financial pressures and changing market conditions. \nResearch is just too important.\n  I look forward to discussing this issue and pursuing the goal of this \nlegislation in the coming months with my colleagues on the Finance \nCommittee as we look at a variety of ways to improve and strengthen our \nvaluable research program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/01/senate-section/article/S5521-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       ISTEA PROMOTES TRIBAL INFRASTRUCTURE, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT\n\n Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am very pleased to note \nthe inclusion in the Inter-modal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act \nof 1998 (ISTEA) of key provisions to provide increased funding for \nIndian roads, highways, and bridges; to provide for the allocation of \nscarce ISTEA dollars for Indian tribes pursuant to a flexible \nnegotiated rule-making procedure; and to ensure that all ISTEA funds \nwill be made available to tribes that choose to enter contracts under \nthe Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975, \nP.L. 93-638.\n  These provisions are critical because they recognize the high level \nof unfunded infrastructure needs in Indian country, and respect Indian \ntribal authority and capacity to administer ISTEA dollars in ways that \nare tailored to unique local conditions and needs. These provisions \nwill assist tribes in attracting and retaining investment and job-\ncreating activities to Indian reservations. There are many reasons why \nit is imperative that Indian tribes foster vigorous economies. In 1996, \nCongress enacted a reform of the welfare system that requires able-\nbodied Americans to be industrious and look first to themselves, not \nthe government, for help and hope. That law is now being implemented \nacross the country.\n  Most reservation economies are heavily reliant on federal transfer \npayments. Most Americans have read about the grinding poverty most \nIndian people face: high unemployment, lack of decent housing, and poor \nhealth, alcoholism, diabetes, cancer, and a staggering suicide rate.\n  The success of the welfare reform law depends on the availability of \njobs that can take the place of transfer payments and government \nassistance. In Indian country, with a national unemployment rate of \n52%, job opportunities are scarce. There is a role for the federal \ngovernment in helping Indian communities make the transition from \ndependence to self-reliance. Employment training, removing barriers to \nlending, and increasing Indian entrepreneurship are essential if tribes \nare to be successful in creating jobs. By far the most important is in \nfostering relationships with the private sector, which requires a solid \nphysical infrastructure which can support business needs.\n  In an economy increasingly reliant on global opportunities, tribes \nmust be competitive. There are many investment opportunities, and other \nthings being equal, tribal economies without basic infrastructure are \nnot as attractive as those that can provide the amenities necessary for \nsuccessful ventures. I am very pleased to have supported these \nprovisions and am committed to building a solid private sector in \nIndian country, creating job opportunities for Indian people, and \nlessening dependence on the federal government.\n  Mr. President, I would like to acknowledge the testimony of the \nHonorable Bobby Whitefeather, Chairman of the Red Lake Band of Chippewa \nIndians, and Mr. John Sunchild, Executive Director of the National \nTribal Development Association, regarding reservation infrastructure \nneeds and economic development which was submitted to the Committee on \nIndian Affairs as providing key insights into the infrastructure \nproblem in Indian country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/01/senate-section/article/S5522-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO GUYANESE INDEPENDENCE\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the May \n26, 1997 thirty-second anniversary of the independence of the Republic \nof Guyana. To the people indigenous to the region, the word ``Guyana'' \nmeans land of many waters. But Guyana is also a land of many peoples--\nGuyanese count East Indians, Africans, Chinese, Amer-Indians, and \nEuropeans counted among their ancestors. Now there is also a growing \ncommunity of Guyanese-Americans, many of whom make their home in New \nJersey.\n  My colleagues may be aware that Guyana achieved independence and \nobserved its first free and fair election in 1992, after more than \nthree centuries of British, French, and Dutch colonialism. Guyana's \nfirst Constitution bore the influence of British legal traditions, and \nformer President Jimmy Carter supervised the team of international \nobservers to guarantee the fairness of the 1992 elections.\n  Guyana's three decades of unpopular and repressive rule slowed \nprogress in the nation, but Guyanese are working to overcome these \nhurdles. I hope that they will succeed. Guyanese-Americans have much to \nbe proud of. Their history is rich, and I hope the future of Guyana \nwill be bright.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/01/senate-section/article/S5522-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO LINDA POTTER AND BILL KIRK\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK.

After working diligently to win competitions in their home \nstate, these outstanding young Oregonians participated in a three day \nnational competition to demonstrate their remarkable understanding of \nConstitutional principles, and their relevance to contemporary issues.\n  Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the We the People \nprogram has provided curricular materials at elementary, middle, and \nhigh school levels for more than 75,000 teachers and 24 million \nstudents nationwide. While demonstrating the importance of cooperative \nand collaborative work, the program teaches students a practical \nmeaning of Democracy and fosters the development of informed, \nresponsible participation in civic life. In addition, this valuable \ncurriculum gives young people the resources necessary to generate their \nown political interests, beliefs, and values essential to becoming \neffective participants in a democratic government.\n\n[[Page S5523]]\n\n  I commend the hard work and accomplishments of this award-winning \nclass of students from Lincoln High School: Alyssa Anne Aaby, Rebecca \nMae Allen, Milo Twohy Dochow, Ian James Dunlap, Joshua Josef Hansen, \nAndrea Marina Hart, Thomas Hugh Hendrickson, Misha Andrew David Isaak, \nLaura Elizabeth Kanter, Aaron Matthew Lande, Andrew Benjamin Lauck, \nDugan Alan Lawrence, Marcus Page Lindbloom, Brenna Rose McMahon, Maren \nChristine Olson, Galway Peter O'Mahoney, Nicholas Albert Peters, Emma \nRachel Pollack-Pelzvner, Jennifer Lewis Rosenbaum, Jay Boss Rubin, \nKaren Deborah Rutzick, Margaret Suzanne Schouten, Kennon Harris Scott, \nAndrew Paterson Sheets, Maghan Marie Simmons, Kristin Kiele Sunamoto, \nand Evan Miles Wiener.

HOLMES\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nRobert R. Holmes who is retiring as the Chief of Police of Rutland, \nVermont. Chief Holmes has had a long and distinguished career in law \nenforcement, and has served his community with dedication and honor.\n  Chief Holmes began his career, which has spanned four decades, as a \nrookie patrol officer in Phoenix, Arizona in 1958. He later moved to \nLittleton, Colorado and within three years had attained the rank of \nLieutenant.\n  Chief Holmes served his country for 3 years in Vietnam as an \ninternational police adviser under the Agency for International \nDevelopment. He returned to police work in Colorado in 1972, and became \nChief of the Englewood Police Department in 1975, where he served in \nthat capacity until his initial retirement in 1989.\n  The same year he decided to accept the position of Rutland City's \nChief of Police, and he and his wife relocated to Vermont. Since 1989, \nChief Holmes has earned the respect and trust of his fellow law \nofficers, as well as civic leaders and Rutland area citizens. He has \nprovided sound leadership and has worked hard to bring about positive \nchange in the department and the entire community.\n  In January of 1997, the FBI honored Chief Holmes with the Agency's \nCommunity Leadership Award for his outstanding efforts to educate the \npublic about the potential impact of the influx of gangs into Vermont. \nHe is quick to share the credit for these successes with all of the \nofficers involved, and is proud of their many accomplishments.\n  Chief Holmes has served his country and several communities with \ndistinction throughout his career, and will no doubt continue to make \ncontributions in any endeavor he undertakes. I congratulate him on this \nspecial occasion and wish him and his family every future \nhappiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/01/senate-section/article/S5523-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MUTUAL OF ENUMCLAW INSURANCE COMPANY\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I speak today in recognition of the \n100th Anniversary of the Mutual of Enumclaw Insurance Company. On June \n12, 1998, Mutual of Enumclaw will celebrate its 100th Anniversary and a \ncentury of successful service in the insurance industry. The company \noriginated in 1898 as the Farmers Mutual Insurance Company at a time \nwhen the town of Enumclaw, Washington found its economic base primarily \nin the railroad, dairy, and lumber industries. The company was \nestablished to ``insure farm and village buildings and personal \nproperty against loss by fire and lightening.''\n  This goal remained the focus of the company until 1945, when it \nexpanded to insure non-farm property. Five years later it expanded its \narea of service to include Oregon and Idaho. In 1963, the company began \nwriting commercial property and casualty insurance and three years \nlater officially changed its name to Mutual of Enumclaw Insurance \nCompany. The company sustained admirable growth throughout the \nfollowing decades, as reflected by the A+ rating it has consistently \nreceived from the A.M. Best Company, a publisher of insurance \ninformation and company ratings.\n  Mutual of Enumclaw employs approximately 500 people and helps to \nprovide a sound economic base for the Enumclaw community. As Mutual of \nEnumclaw Insurance Company celebrates its first hundred years, it looks \nto the future and to the challenge of continuing to learn and grow in \norder to meet the evolving needs of its customers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/01/senate-section/article/S5523-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BETTY HOOD\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, it is a great honor for me to \nrecognize today a young Kansan who has been nationally recognized for \nher quick thinking and valor. Betty Hood, of Wichita, Kansas, has been \nawarded the Young American Medal for Bravery for 1996 from the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice, for her heroic efforts to save her younger \nbrothers and sister from their burning apartment.\n  Then ten-year-old Betty awoke in the early morning of May 17, 1996, \nto discover that her bed had caught on fire from a lamp that had been \nleft too close to the sheets and blankets. Realizing the danger she and \nher siblings, who were in the room with her, were in, Betty carried her \nbrother, James and sister, Hallie, to safety. She returned to help her \nremaining brother Clifford, but was unable to assist him as the fire \nhad spread to the area where he was sleeping.\n  Betty Hood's award for bravery is well deserved. She did not escape \nunharmed, as both Betty and her mother were treated for burns, nor will \nshe ever forget her six-year-old brother, Clifford, who perished in the \nfire.\n  Today, I join the Department of Justice in recognizing and paying \ntribute to this extraordinary young American. Betty Hood is a true \nhero, and I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting this young woman \nfor her bravery and quick thinking that saved her brother and \nsister.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/01/senate-section/article/S5523-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5523-S5524]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SET A GOOD EXAMPLE\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise before you today to commend \nthe first place award winners of the American Set a Good Example \nCompetition.\n  Each year this contest recognizes three schools who have set \nthemselves apart as leaders in the fight against crime and violence in \nour nation's schools. In this, the 12th year of the contest sponsored \nby the Concerned Businessmen's Association of America, Arsenal \nTechnical High School of Indianapolis, Indiana, has been recognized as \none of these very special schools.\n\n  While we have seen the war against drugs and violence fought on every \nbattlefield from the streets to our homes to the workplace, there is no \nmore important battlefield than our children's schools. In an attempt \nto emphasize this message, the Concerned Businessman's Association of \nAmerica (CCBA), began this unique contest in 1985 in order to encourage \nour nation's teenagers to become involved in the war on drugs and \nviolence.\n  This year the CBAA deemed the efforts of the students at Arsenal \nTechnical High School, in conjunction with the guidance of teacher Mary \nAllen, principal Gerald McLeish, and the funding of Dr. Chris Kasle, \nworthy of this prestigious award.\n  For their project, Arsenal Technical students selected the precept of \n``Do Not Murder'' taken from the ``Way to Happiness'' by L. Ron \nHubbard. First, the students discussed murders which have affected \nthem, their families and communities. Next, students put themselves in \nthe position of Mayor and formulated ways in which they would solve the \nproblem of violence. Each student wrote essays about their plans.\n  Arsenal continued this project by planning a ``Set A Good Example \nWeek.'' When a teacher saw a student set a good example or perform an \nact of kindness, the student received a coupon redeemable for a small \npack of candy at lunch.\n  Students received the pack of candy from a booth promoting a talent \nshow dubbed ``Stop the Hate in 98,'' an event promoting non-violence.\n  The student-planned talent show included an art and rap contest and \ngenerated 100% student involvement.\n  I extend my congratulations to the students and faculty at Arsenal \nTechnical High School for this outstanding achievement and the \nexcellent example they have set for our nation's youth. I\n\n[[Page S5524]]\n\nurge each student to build upon the successes of this program and \ncontinue to set a good example every day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/01/senate-section/article/S5523-4", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5524-S5525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          IN HONOR OF BOB DOLE\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, It was two years ago, in this \nchamber, that we recognized Senator Bob Dole for his tremendous \ncontribution to the nation. I and many others stood and paid tribute to \nthis great American for his outstanding career of Public Service, a \ncareer that spanned over fifty years. I rise today, to once again pay \ntribute to this great American.\n  As I said two years ago, Senator Bob Dole's destiny was and is \nleadership. From the battlefields of World War II to the floor of the \nUnited States Senate, Bob Dole was worked tirelessly for a strong \nnational defense. That hard work was recognized recently in a ceremony \nheld at Fort Meyer, Virginia. The Secretary of Defense, joined by the \nVice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, presented Senator Dole with \nthe Department of Defense's highest civilian honor, the Medal for \nDistinguished Public Service.\n  Senator Bob Dole, a man whom I am humbled to call my friend, is most \ndeserving of the Medal for Distinguished Public Service and I wish to \njoin our former colleague Secretary Cohen, in honoring Senator Dole. \nMr. President, I send to the desk, copies of the fine remarks delivered \nby Secretary Cohen and Senator Dole at the April 29th award ceremony \nand ask that they be printed in today's Record of the body he loved--\nThe United States Senate.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n   Remarks of Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen--Presentation of \n             Distinguished Public Service Award to Bob Dole\n\n       Welcome all, and thank you for joining Janet and me and the \n     entire Department of Defense in paying tribute to a dear \n     friend and a true American hero--Bob Dole.\n       Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., who served his country \n     both as a soldier and a public servant, once spoke to his \n     fellow veterans in words that reflect the soldier and public \n     servant we honor today. Holmes said: ``As I look into your \n     eyes, I feel that a great trial in your youth made you \n     different. It made you a citizen of the world and not of a \n     little town. Best of all, it made you believe in something \n     else besides doing the best for yourself. You learned a \n     lesson early which has given a different feeling to life, \n     which put a kind of fire into your heart.''\n       Today we express our gratitude to Bob Dole, a man from the \n     little town of Russell, Kansas for whom the lessons of life \n     came early. With the Dustbowl came the lesson of hard work. \n     With the Depression came the lesson of hardship. With World \n     War II came the lesson of service and sacrifice in a way most \n     of us will never know.\n       Throughout his distinguished career, we have called Bob \n     Dole by many titles--Congressman Dole, Senator Dole, Chairman \n     Dole and Candidate Dole. Our ceremony today honors all those \n     roles, but also honors a time when he was known as Second \n     Lieutenant Robert Dole, who led the Second Battalion of the \n     85th Infantry Mountain Regiment of the U.S. Army's 10th \n     Mountain Division.\n       As the war in Europe was winding down, a spring offensive \n     was scheduled for April 12, 1945 to bring about the surrender \n     of German forces in Italy. On the same day, as it happens, \n     President Roosevelt died. But it was not the President's \n     death but a heavy fog that delayed the offensive until April \n     14 at oh-six hundred. After the intensive assault against \n     fortified German positions by heavy bombers, fighter-bombers \n     and artillery, the 10th Mountain Division began to move \n     across a ravine to a clearing to take for the Allies what was \n     known as Hill 913.\n       But even after the shelling and bombing, there was still \n     significant German resistance. The snipers were dug in. The \n     10th Mountain Division would take more casualties on April \n     14, 1945 than all the other Allied forces in Italy. Second \n     Lieutenant Robert Dole was hit and gravely wounded by a \n     mortar blast and waited in a shell hole for nine hours until \n     the medics could reach him.\n       The war in Europe ended just a few weeks later on May 8, \n     1945. Second Lieutenant Dole came back to a Topeka hospital \n     and eventually back to Russell. When he went to Europe, he \n     weighed a muscular 200 pounds and was a football, basketball \n     and track star at the State University of Kansas. When he \n     came home after the war, he was on a stretcher and weighed \n     120 pounds. At one point, his temperature reached 108.7 \n     degrees.\n       Faced with this terrible situation and the unanimously \n     gloomy opinion of his doctors, many people, even most people, \n     would have become disheartened and simply given up. But Bob \n     Dole persevered, through more than three years of arduous \n     recovery and through a lifetime of difficulty and hardship \n     which he handled with his customary humor and grace. No one \n     ever worked harder, complained less or laughed more than Bob \n     Dole. And no one ever loved his country more or had a better \n     appreciation of the honor and sacrifice of military service.\n       From the terrible trauma of his injuries, Bob Dole fought \n     back and won elective office as country attorney, US \n     Congressman, US Senator and Senate Majority Leader. He has \n     been his party's nominee for Vice President and President. He \n     even makes a pretty good VISA commercial! (Although his \n     credit is not very good in that financial mega center--\n     Russell.)\n       Also, no hero does it alone, and Janet and I also want to \n     pay tribute to a lady of grace, charm and accomplishment who \n     is Bob's partner, friend and wife--Elizabeth Dole. Elizabeth, \n     thank your for your service to America.\n       I had the privilege of serving with Bob Dole in the \n     legislative trenches of the U.S. Senate for 18 years. And I \n     can tell you he remained a warrior eager to take on a new \n     battle every day. He is and always will be an American Hero \n     of the highest order.\n       Thanks to people like Bob Dole who have worked for a strong \n     national defense, we are privileged to live in largely \n     peaceful times where the sons of Bangor, Maine, or Russell, \n     Kansas are not being sent to fight and die on distant \n     battlefields. The privilege of these peaceful times is made \n     possible by the sacrifice of many thousands who have given \n     their bodies and their lives in the cause of liberty.\n       We do not pause often enough to give tribute to the silent \n     white gravestones which dot the hills of Arlington National \n     Cemetery or give thanks to the heroes who are still among us. \n     Today, as Secretary of Defense, it makes me extremely proud \n     for our Department and our nation to pay tribute to a modest \n     man of immodest talent--a person who has defined heroism and \n     courage for millions of Americans.\n       The great American writer John Steinbeck once wrote that \n     the best measure of one's time on this earth is the \n     contribution each of us makes to the world around us. ``There \n     is,'' Steinbeck wrote, ``no other story. A man, after he has \n     brushed off the dust and chips of his life, will have left \n     only the hard clean questions: Was it good or was it evil? \n     Have I done well--or ill?''\n       For Second Lieutenant Bob Dole--Army Serial #17179287--\n     Steinbeck's question is not a hard one. He has done well--he \n     has served his nation with the highest distinction--he has \n     remained a man with fire in his heart. And it is my highest \n     privilege to award our highest civilian honor, the Department \n     of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service, to Bob \n     Dole.\n\n            Senator Bob Dole--Remarks Prepared for Delivery\n\n       If given the choice between receiving an award from a \n     Secretary of Defense or appointing a Secretary of Defense, I \n     would have picked the latter.\n       Seriously, I am humbled and honored by this award, and it \n     means all the more to me because it was presented by a man I \n     have long been privileged to call my friend. Thank you, Mr. \n     Secretary, for this ceremony, for this award, and for \n     reminding us that when it comes to our national defense, we \n     should not define ourselves as Democrats or Republican, but \n     rather, simply as Americans.\n       I am also pleased to be joined today by the president of \n     the American Red Cross. Throughout this century, wherever you \n     have found American service men and women--whether on the \n     battlefield, on the base, or in the hospital--you knew that \n     close by you would also find the American Red Cross.\n       And on behalf of all the past and present members of the \n     Armed Forces here, I thank Elizabeth for the difference the \n     Red Cross has made in our lives. And while I may not be proof \n     of the old saying that here in America, any boy can grow up \n     to be President, I take heart in the fact that I am proof \n     that any boy can grow up and be married to the president * * \n     * of the American Red Cross, that is.\n       During my life I have been privileged to be called by many \n     titles--including Congressman, Senator, and majority leader. \n     But the two titles of which I am most proud have nothing to \n     do with elective office. The first is ``Kansan,'' and the \n     second is ``veteran.''\n       I have often wondered why the Army assigned a kid from the \n     plains of Kansas to serve in the 10th mountain division, but \n     I've never wondered about the courage and heroism of those \n     who served with me, and those who have defended our country \n     in the half century that has followed. And I can't help but \n     recall today the words of General George Marshall, who was \n     asked soon after America's entrance into World War II, \n     whether we had a secret weapon that would ensure victory.\n       Marshall said, ``Yes, our secret weapon is the best darned \n     kids in the world.''\n       Marshall was right, America ensured the survival of freedom \n     in World War II precisely because we had the best darned kids \n     in the world--kids who were willing to fight and die for \n     their country and for the cause of freedom.\n       What was true in World War II, has continued to be true in \n     the decades that have followed, as more of those best darned \n     kids have fought and died in places with names like Inchon, \n     Porkchop Hill, the Persian Gulf, and countless other \n     locations around the globe.\n       I traveled to Bosnia just this past weekend, and can report \n     to you, Mr. Secretary, that our armed services can still \n     boast the best darned kids in the world.\n       Throughout my years in the battlefields of Capitol Hill, I \n     always tried to remember and stand up for those who were \n     serving or who had served. And I always tried to remember\n\n[[Page S5525]]\n\n     that the only way to ensure that future generations of those \n     kids would not be buried on foreign land was to continue to \n     provide for a strong defense and American leadership whenever \n     and wherever it was needed.\n       And any success I achieved in this regard was achieved \n     because so many others stood with me. And although this old \n     soldier has retired from elective office, I don't intend to \n     fade away. Rather, I will continue to stand up and speak out \n     on matters of importance to the United States, and I will \n     always regard this day and this award not as recognition for \n     any achievements of the past, but as a reminder of our \n     responsibilities to future generations of Americans.\n       And so, Mr. Secretary, Lieutenant Robert J. Dole is \n     reporting for duty today, ready for a mission that must be \n     shared by all Americans; a mission perhaps best defined by \n     the author Herman Wouk, who said:\n       ``(Our duty is to) reassure (our men and women in uniform) \n     that their hard, long training is needed, that love of \n     country is noble, that self-sacrifice is rewarding and that \n     to be ready to fight for freedom fills one with a sense of \n     worth like nothing else * * * for if America is still the \n     great beacon in dense gloom, the promise to hundreds of \n     millions of the oppressed that liberty exists, that it is the \n     shining future, that they can throw off their tyrants, and \n     learn freedom and cease learning war, then we still need \n     heroes to stand guard in the night.''\n       Thank you, Mr. Secretary for this day, and thanks to all \n     those heroes here today and the countless thousands who serve \n     with you who make the world a safer place by standing guard \n     in the night.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/01/senate-section/article/S5524-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO BARRY GOLDWATER\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know I speak for the entire Senate in \nexpressing to the family of Senator Barry Goldwater our sympathy for \ntheir loss and for our country's loss as well. On Wednesday, many of us \nin the Senate will attend his funeral in his beloved Arizona. The \nSenate Sergeant at Arms is making arrangements for those who wish to \njoin in this last tribute to our former colleague. All Senate offices \nwill be informed about those details soon. In fact, I believe that \ninformation has gone out and we do expect a large number of Senators to \njoin in going to the funeral services in Arizona.\n  The Senate will not be in session on Wednesday in honor of this great \nSenator and leader from Arizona.\n  If Barry were here with us today, I think he would tell us in his \ncharacteristically blunt manner not to be too solemn about this \noccasion. After all, he was an extremely fortunate man and he felt that \nway and said so himself many times. He was blessed with length of days \nand devotion of family and friends. In fact, as I looked over the \ndetails of the services, I noted that he will be carried by his \ngrandsons as poll bearers. I know that would have been really special \nto him. He loved his work. He loved the people he represented. He spoke \nhis mind. In many ways, he owed nobody, but he loved everybody. He was \na winner, not just in the sense of winning elections--with one rather \nmajor exception--but in the most important sense of having his ideas \nvindicated by the course of history.\n  In his one losing election, the Presidential race of 1964, he was \nsubject to more falsehoods, in my opinion, than any candidate should \never have to bear.\n  In losing with honor, he did more than encourage others to stand up \nfor their beliefs. I was one of those young people that was fresh out \nof college and working for my alma mater, the University of \nMississippi, and casting my first vote ever in a Presidential election \nfor Barry Goldwater in my hometown of Pascagoula, MS, and watching the \nelection returns that night from Pensacola, FL. I remember how I had \nbeen inspired by what he had to say. I think that was the moment I \ndecided I would spend a good portion of my life involved in trying to \nbe a representative of the people in Government.\n  Along with then-Governor Ronald Reagan, Barry Goldwater energized the \ngrassroots of American politics, fostered the growth of modern \nconservatism, and thereby transformed the Republican Party and the \nNation.\n  His statement of political faith--a slight book called ``The \nConscience of a Conservative''--continues to challenge and inspire \nreaders. I have my little paperback version of ``The Conscience of a \nConservative'' that I keep in a small library in my hometown. There are \nmany Members of Congress today who treasure their well-worn copies of \nthat volume, as well they might, for it remains an eloquent manifesto \nof the cause of liberty.\n  The conservative movement has had many heroes, but Barry Goldwater \nremains preeminent, even though he came to disagree with conservatives \non some issue. That disagreement has belatedly won him some new \nadmirers, even some liberals who fail to see the difference between his \nreasoning and theirs.\n  The difference is that they tend to downplay personal responsibility. \nSenator Barry Goldwater, on the other hand, demanded it. He expected \nindividuals to live with the consequences of their decisions. It was \nhis sense of responsibility that brought Barry Goldwater into \nGovernment and empowered his fight against big Government.\n  It was personal responsibility that he preached to his fellow \nAmericans. In 1964 many were unwilling to listen. Today, three decades \nlater, his message is heard and echoed from think tanks to pulpits, \nfrom classrooms to the Congress.\n  He gave so much to the country he loved so much. So many years of \nservice in government, so strong a voice for national security against \nthe threat of communism, and so passionate a confidence in the ability \nof average men and women to do extraordinary things.\n  But surely his greatest gift was preparing the way for a rebirth of \nthe conservative ideas and values which make freedom possible.\n  That long ago won him an honored place in the hearts of his fellow \nbelievers, and it now ensures for him an honored place in the history \nof America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/01/senate-section/article/S5525-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

A \nfew months prior to mailing these letters, some of the defendants met \nwith Mike Morrill of Senator Mikulski's staff to discuss plaintiffs' \nland-development proposal. Counsel for these defendants have asked Mr. \nMorrill to testify about that meeting, and Senator Mikulski would like \nMr. Morrill to be authorized to do so.\n  This resolution would authorize Senator Mikulski's staff to testify \nand produce relevant documents, with representation from the Senate \nLegal Counsel.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

For the information of all Senators, the Senate will \nreconvene at 9:30. There will be 30 minutes of morning business. \nFollowing that business, we will return to the consideration of the \ntobacco legislation with several amendments pending. It is hoped that \nthose amendments can be disposed of in a timely fashion so that the \nremaining amendments to this important bill may be offered and debated. \nI do expect at this time that there could be a vote or two on \namendments on this bill tomorrow afternoon, although that has not been \nlocked in at this point.\n  At 4 p.m. we will return to 2 hours of debate equally divided on the \nnuclear waste bill. Following that, there would be a vote to invoke \ncloture.\n  Also, any votes ordered in respect to the tobacco bill will occur in \na stacked sequence at that time. That could involve anywhere from one, \ntwo, or three votes at the 6 o'clock hour.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/01/senate-section/article/S5526-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5526]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
