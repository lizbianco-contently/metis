Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, I \nannounce today that the Senate will resume consideration of Senator \nReid's amendment to Senate Joint Resolution 1, the balanced budget \namendment. Debate is expected throughout the day on this amendment, \nwith the vote occurring on or in relation to the Reid amendment at 6 \np.m. today.\n  By previous agreement, at 2:10 p.m. today, the Senate will begin 5 \nminutes of closing remarks, followed by a rollcall vote on adoption of \nHouse Joint Resolution 36, the resolution regarding U.N. population \ncontrol.\n  On Wednesday, the 26th, the Senate will debate Senator Feinstein's \namendment from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. Following the vote at 11 a.m. on or in \nrelation to the Feinstein amendment, Senator Torricelli will be \nrecognized to offer an amendment relating to capital budgeting.

The pending question is \namendment No. 8, offered by the Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid]. The \ntime between now and 12:30 is equally divided and controlled in the \nusual form.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, unless my friend from Utah feels \ndifferently, I ask unanimous consent that we initiate a quorum call and \nthe time be charged equally against the two managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to speak for a few \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. If I could interrupt my friend from Wyoming, I ask that the \ntime of my friend from Wyoming be charged against the manager of the \nunderlying amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the regular order.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I shall be brief.\n  Continuing with this important discussion on the balanced budget \namendment, I specifically, as was the case with most of us, spent last \nweek in our home districts. I spent last week in Wyoming at town \nmeetings in places like Sheridan, Buffalo, and Casper, to talk about \nwhat people think about what is happening here.\n  Of course, the balanced budget was one of the prime issues there, and \ncontinues to be. I think people are increasingly concerned about our \nlack of financial fiscal responsibility, of having 28 years without \nbalancing the budget, of continuing to have a government that grows in \nsize, continuing to spend more than we take in. I was persuaded, \ncertainly from those who came to my town meetings, from those I talked \nto who say, ``Look, you need to get this job done.'' They say, ``You \nall collectively in Washington have been saying every year, yes, we \nwill balance the budget, I want to balance the budget.\n\n[[Page S1496]]\n\n You have not done it. You have not done it.'' Now they continue to \nsay, ``Well, we do not need a constitutional amendment. We just need to \nbalance the budget.'' We have not done it. Even those who have been \nhere for a very long time and have gone through this whole thing have \nnot balanced the budget.\n  The idea you do not need to do something rings a bit hollow to people \nat home. The Wyoming Legislature is currently meeting. Wyoming has a \nconstitutional requirement that the legislature not spend more than it \ntakes in. It works very well. We will have, I think, certainly a series \nof amendments, all of which are designed to simply detract from what we \nare seeking to do, all of which are designed to give an option and an \nopportunity to not vote for a constitutional amendment, to say, ``Well, \nI am for it,\n\nbut--'' We have been through that before. We will see that again today. \n``I am for it, but . . .'' ``. . . but we do not want Social Security \nincluded.''\n  Now, we like the President's budget, we are moving toward it. Is \nSocial Security in there? You bet it is. You bet it is. And it would \nnot balance without. It does not balance as it is. So we are moving \ntoward continuing to have an unbalanced budget in this President's \nproposal.\n  I feel even renewed, Mr. President, in my quest for a balanced budget \namendment, having been home, having talked to people who say, ``We do \nnot want more and more spending. We do not want more and more of a \ncentral government.'' Really, when it comes down to it, that is the \ndecision. That is really what it is. Those who want to see Government \ncontinue to grow larger, obviously are not for a balanced budget \namendment. Those of us who think that the real message over the last \nnumber of years from home has been, look, we want less central \nGovernment, we want less spending, we want less taxes, those kinds of \nactivities that can, should be moved to the States, and that is really \nthe core issue. That is really what it is all about.\n  I am hopeful we will continue this debate this week and have a chance \nto finally vote, have a chance to pass a constitutional amendment, have \na chance to have the discipline that is required to do the things that \neverybody says they want to do and have it done.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Would my friend withhold his call for a quorum?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Sure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the record is quite clear. The issue on the \nbalanced budget amendment is quite narrow. The issue is whether or not \nwe should balance the budget using the Social Security surplus.\n  The arguments always are, ``Well, we have been doing it in the \npast.'' That is my whole premise. Why should we continue to do it in \nthe future and enshrine it in the Constitution? I say no. I say if we \nare going to balance the budget, we should do it the right way, the \nhard way, the honest way, and not include in the calculations to arrive \nat a balanced budget the Social Security surpluses.\n  We have a number of amendments, and just speaking for this Senator, I \nhave not supported any of the other amendments to the underlying \namendment. I want my focus to be very clear. Even though I think when \nstatements are made, as was made by my friend from Wyoming, that my \nState balances its budget, the fact is they really do not. The fact is \nthat States have their capital expenditures off budget, through their \nbonding process. The State of Nevada does this, as do the vast majority \nof the other States. That is how they balance their budget. They simply \nexclude the costs of building construction and other long-term capital \nexpenditures. Even though there will be an attempt to amend the \nunderlying matter now before this body with a capital expenditure \nbudget, even though I think that makes some sense, I will not support \nthat. My emphasis, my concerns are about the permanent misuse of the \nSocial Security trust fund if my amendment is defeated. I have made \nthat very clear.\n  As I spoke yesterday, Social Security is a program we have had for \n60-plus years. It was a program for dealing with old age, principally. \nIt was not a giveaway. It was not a handout. It is a program that is \ngiven to people when they reach age 62 or 65, whatever eligibility \nmight be for that particular person. It is done without any means \ntesting. Why? Because people have paid into a Social Security trust \nfund for purposes of having those moneys set aside when they get old. \nAn employer pays in, an employee pays in. It is now about 13 percent of \nevery dollar they earn that is paid into the trust fund for their \nfuture years.\n  As I indicated, trust funds, whether handled by an insurance \nfiduciary or a lawyer, must be treated very carefully. There are \ndefinitions in any dictionary about what a trust fund is. It is \n``assured reliance on the character, ability, strength or truth of \nsomeone or something; one in which confidence is placed; reliance on \nfuture payment for property held by one for the benefit of another; \nsomething committed or entrusted for one to be used or cared for in the \ninterest of another.'' This is how Webster defines it. That being the \ncase, Mr. President, it seems to me it is unfair that we use Social \nSecurity trust fund moneys for purposes other than for which they were \ncollected.\n  It is a trust. It is an agreement between the Federal Government of \nthe United States and its workers. We hold these moneys in trust in the \ninterest of the American people. They should not be used for some other \npurpose. They should not be used for foreign aid. They should not be \nused for any other purpose. They should be used only for the old-age \nrecipients. I believe Social Security is a binding contract between the \nU.S. Government and the American people. We should not violate that.\n  The fact that we have been using those moneys in the past for other \npurposes does not mean we should continue to do it. I think we should \nbalance the budget, but we should do it in the right way, the fair way, \nthe honest way, by excluding the Social Security trust fund moneys.\n  In 1983, a commission headed by Alan Greenspan advised raising \npayroll taxes, with the end of achieving long-term actuarial balance, \nand hence to ensure that we are prepared for the retirement of the baby \nboomers. Congress voted to raise the payroll contribution made by \nworkers because these funds are not ordinary taxes but are rather \nunique moneys contributed to the trust fund that deserve our special \nconsideration and protection.\n  In 1990, the Senate, understanding the need to protect these Social \nSecurity funds, voted 98-2 to pull it out of the unified budget, \nshowing our interest in protecting Social Security trust funds from \nmisuse. The present chairman of the Budget Committee, the senior \nSenator from New Mexico, said at that time that he reluctantly voted \nfor this amendment, and his reluctance was that it wasn't strong \nenough. He felt that these moneys should be set aside and not used to \noffset the deficit.\n  I appeal to everyone to review the statement made by a person that I \nbelieve understands money about as well as anybody in this body. The \nunderlying balanced budget amendment would effectively overturn the \n1990 decision to place Social Security off budget and would undermine \nwhat then the senior Senator from New Mexico said.\n  Last year, this body went on record again with a huge vote, pledging \nwe would not raise or cut Social Security in order to balance the \nbudget. Did that vote mean anything? It didn't mean much, because we \nare in the process now of using surpluses this year to again balance \nthe budget. These votes, the one in 1990 and the one last year, \ndemonstrate the unique position Social Security holds, as well as our \ncommitment to the American people to protect this trust fund that we \nhave set up. It is our obligation to do everything in our power to \nprotect the Social Security trust fund.\n  It is no different than when any attorney in the United States takes \na client's money and puts it into a fund. They cannot use that money \nfor any purpose other than for the client. We can't pay personal \nexpenses. To do so would cause the attorney to lose his or her license. \nThe balanced budget amendment, without an express exemption, places \nSocial Security in serious danger.\n  So, Mr. President, I believe that we need to step back and understand \nwhat\n\n[[Page S1497]]\n\na simple message this is. My amendment would simply disallow Social \nSecurity trust fund moneys from being used to offset the deficit. That \nseems fair. If we want to balance the budget, let's do it the right \nway. The easy way is to use the Social Security moneys. People are \nrunning around pounding their chests about what strong people they are \nfor taking Social Security money to balance the budget. That is the \neasy way. If you really want to balance the budget in 2002, have a \nreal, honest balanced budget, do it the hard way, not the easy way, and \ntake--this year, $80 billion--that money to mask the deficit. People \nask, what would we do? We would have to either cut expenses or raise \ntaxes. That is the only way it can be done--not to circumvent what I \nthink is the clear intent of the Social Security law, that we should \nnot use Social Security surpluses to balance the budget.\n  So, in short, Mr. President, I think we should pass a balanced budget \nthat isn't a gimmick. It should be a straight on, tough, hard \nprocedure. We should balance the budget without using these huge \nsurpluses in Social Security. We have the President of the United \nStates, among others, including the Congressional Research Service and \nthe Center for Budget and Policy Review, who say that if this \nunderlying amendment passes, the courts will be deciding what should be \ncut and whether Social Security gets paid.\n  So the constitutionally permitted raiding of the trust fund would be \ndevastating to current and future beneficiaries and would undermine \nconfidence in this Nation's most successful Government program. I \nbelieve Social Security must be viewed as one leg of a three-legged \nstool, Mr. President. You should have, in addition to Social Security, \nprivate pensions and savings. However, 50 percent of all Americans do \nnot have pension protection. Hence, they rely on Social Security checks \nas the mainstay of their income in their later years. Letters come in \nto me daily from seniors in Nevada saying that, without Social Security \nchecks, they would be destitute. They plead with me--and I am sure with \nothers--to protect Social Security. Current polls have shown that young \npeople are concerned about Social Security, and well they should be \nwhen people are trying to use their moneys to mask the deficit.\n\n  A nationwide poll showed that almost 75 percent of the American \npublic do not want a balanced budget if Social Security surpluses are \nused to balance the budget. Misuse of Social Security trust funds \nmoneys must stop. If we are going to balance the budget, let's do it \nthe right way. Let's protect Social Security trust funds, as well as \nthe trust of the American worker. In the language of the honorable \nsenior Senator from New Mexico on June 10, 1990, ``We need a firewall \naround those trust funds to make sure that the reserves are there to \npay Social Security benefits in the next century.''\n  It could not be said better, because this amendment I have offered \ndoes provide that firewall that my friend, the senior Senator from New \nMexico, the present chairman of the Budget Committee, said was \nnecessary.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Thomas] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I think it is useful for us to talk a \nlittle bit about the relatively little debate that goes on here. I \nthink it is appropriate to talk a little about that. I know my friend \nfrom Nevada, whom I respect greatly, is sincere in his view. But I \ndon't agree with what he has had to say. That is what this is all \nabout. So I think we ought to talk about a combined budget, and talk a \nlittle bit about off-budget kinds of things. Again, my experience comes \nfrom Wyoming. The Wyoming Legislature has control over about 30 percent \nof the budget. All the rest of it is earmarked off to other things. I \ndon't think that is a good idea or a good way to legislate.\n  Let me, first of all, say that, naturally, if you want to sell a \npoint, you try and get some kind of an emotional thing to say like \n``save Social Security.'' There is not a soul in this place that \ndoesn't want to protect Social Security. We are not talking about \nprotecting Social Security. We are talking about the best way to \nprotect Social Security. Two years from now, when the Social Security \nrevenues have changed substantially, you are going to have it more \nprotected by having it as part of the budget than you will by having it \nsit off by itself.\n  Let me talk about this idea of spending it somewhere else. I presume \nmy friend from Nevada would want to invest those surplus dollars so \nthey would have some return to the Social Security fund. They are \ninvested. They are invested in Government securities. They are invested \nwhere the law requires they be invested. It is not a matter of spending \nSocial Security funds for other things. The fact is, when we have a \ndeficit in the operating fund of the Government, we have to sell \nsecurities. They can sell them to Social Security, to Japan, to me, or \nto you. Nevertheless, we are using borrowed money. It is borrowed from \nthe Social Security fund. This idea that you are spending it on \nsomething else is absolutely false. They are invested. They are \nprotected.\n  Now, he wants to balance the budget without it. All that takes is \n$700 billion of new money. Impossible. You can't do that. You just \ncan't do that. We ought to have a combined budget, and will we be \nresponsible for Social Security? Of course. Those funds get paid in for \nthat purpose. They will be repaid. They have to be repaid to somebody.\n  So this is a difference of view, and I understand that. But the idea \nthat we take this off budget and set it aside and pass the balanced \nbudget amendment is, of course, just not the case. The courts will \ndecide. Again, we have lots and lots of States that have a balanced \nbudget amendment. Do the courts decide? No, of course not. If the \ncourts are going to come into play, they say to the legislative body, \n``You have overspent, and you have to find a way to reduce it.'' And \nthere is nothing particularly wrong with that.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I just want to say again this sort of scare tactic \nthat somehow if you are included in there, you are going to forget \nhaving it, not think it is important to have Social Security protected, \nis a fallacy, simply a fallacy. And I just think that we ought to \nchallenge those kinds of comments. It is a little like what happened \nlast year in the election, that the Republicans were going to do away \nwith Medicare. Well, that is not true. The fact is if you do not make \nsome changes in these programs, they will not exist. Just to say leave \nyour hands off of it, leave it alone, is sure death for these kinds of \nprograms.\n  So we have a dilemma, and we solve it. We have talked about it for a \nvery long time. It is time we move forward and make some decisions that \nwill put us in a financially strong position, that will make us \nfinancially responsible and will include in a combined budget all those \nthings that are there.\n  I guess we ought to take the highway trust fund off; we ought to take \nthe airport trust fund off; we ought to take off everything that has a \ndesignation.\n  No, we are not going to do that. We are going to use the emotional \nissue of Social Security to seek to kill an amendment to the \nConstitution which says the Congress ought to exercise the kind of \nresponsibility that it ought to exercise anyway and has not.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. My only statement to my friend from Wyoming--I am happy to \nsee my western representative friend in the Chamber--is if we have a \nunified budget, why did we vote on more than one occasion to take it \noff budget? Social Security is not part of the unified budget. And \nbecause we have violated that, what we have done here on the Senate \nfloor and in the House does not make it right. I believe the highway \ntrust fund should be taken off budget. I have offered legislation on \nthis floor--it is pending right now--saying we ought to spend money in \nthe highway trust fund.\n  The reason we are talking about the Social Security trust fund is \njust like Willie Sutton; when he was asked why he robbed banks, he \nsaid, ``That's where the money is.'' Social Security is where the bucks \nare. There is very little money in the highway trust fund on a \ncomparable basis to Social Security. So that is why we are protecting \nSocial Security.\n  Emotional? Yes, it is emotional. It is emotional because people like \nmy friend, Helen Collins, from Nevada said:\n\n\n[[Page S1498]]\n\n\n       I have been a widow since age 21. I never considered \n     applying for any kind of welfare assistance. I worked and \n     raised and educated my son. He got a master's degree. Sad to \n     say, at age 71 I am totally on my own on quite a limited \n     budget. By being very careful, I get by. However, I do worry \n     about getting more seriously ill and losing Social Security. \n     For many of us, these are not the golden years. But I, for \n     one, thank God that good people like you are helping us \n     maintain our dignity and independence.\n\n  The underlined word, Mr. President, is ``independence.''\n  So there are people who do consider Social Security an emotional \nissue because it is emotional.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I yield such time as may be consumed to my friend, the \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to begin by inquiring of the \nSenator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, about his perfecting amendment. My \nunderstanding of the perfecting amendment as opposed to a substitute \nhere--this is a perfecting amendment--is that he would amend the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget in a way that prevents \nthe counting of Social Security receipts and expenditures in that \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. Is that correct?\n\n  Mr. REID. That is absolutely true. It is this Senator's feeling, as \nwell as the sponsors, of which my friend from North Dakota is one, that \nit is unfair to balance the budget the easy way, and that is to use \nthese huge Social Security surpluses that we have had in the past and \nthat we will have in the near future to offset the deficit. It is not \nfair.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask the Senator from Nevada one additional question. \nWhy Social Security? I suppose some would say, well, there other areas \nthat ought to be excluded. The Social Security area is one of the \nlargest areas of public spending and has had accrued surpluses now \navailable, needed to be available for meeting the time when the baby \nboom generation will retire. So are there other programs like it? Or is \nthis the major issue that will have a distorted impact if this \nconstitutional amendment as currently worded would be enacted by \nCongress?\n  Mr. REID. While my friend was coming to the floor, I made an analogy. \nWillie Sutton, probably the most famous bank robber of all time, after \nhe was apprehended and in jail, was interviewed, and they said--I do \nnot know if they called him ``Willie'' or ``Mr. Sutton,'' but they \nsaid, ``Why did you rob banks?'' He was very succinct and to the point. \n``Because that's where the money was.''\n  And that is why they are doing what they are doing here, I say to my \nfriend. They are going after Social Security because that is where the \nmoney is. There are huge surpluses in the Social Security trust fund. \nThere are other trust funds but they are dribbles and drabs compared \nwith the $80 billion this year alone. So they are going after this \nmoney because that is where it is.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the answer the Senator from \nNevada has provided. He and I have worked on this issue for some long \nwhile, and I want to try to frame this a little differently.\n  This debate is not about whether the budget is balanced. This debate \nis about whether the Constitution is altered. This is a question of \nshall we change the Constitution of the United States? I am prepared to \nchange the Constitution of the United States under certain conditions.\n  We have had a lot of goofy proposals over time in this country to \nchange the Constitution. We have had proposals in which there would be \na President from the North followed by a President from the South. That \nwas one proposal. Let us make sure that the Presidency goes from the \nnorthern part of the country to the southern part of the country on a \nrotating basis. That is one. Sound a little strange today? Yes, I think \nso. There have been thousands of proposals to amend the Constitution.\n  We have a bunch of folks around here who think that somehow they are \nbetter than Madison, Mason, Franklin, George Washington, and, yes, even \nThomas Jefferson, although Jefferson was not in Philadelphia at the \nwriting of the Constitution. He was in Europe at the time but \ncontributed mightily to the Bill of Rights, and especially the first \namendment. But we have folks who think the Constitution is a rough \ndraft and that they ought to get a pencil and eraser and every day make \nlittle changes in the Constitution.\n  In the last session of Congress in 1 month we had three proposals \nwhich came driving through here to change the Constitution of the \nUnited States by in some cases or in most cases people who call \nthemselves conservatives. It is strange to me that those who call \nthemselves conservatives would be so quick to alter the Constitution of \nthe United States but nonetheless there are plenty of proposals to do \nso. This is one.\n  Is there merit in altering the Constitution to require a balanced \nbudget? I think so. I think the demonstration of the lack of fiscal \ndiscipline is sufficient over the last especially decade and a half \nthat there is merit in doing so. If there is merit in doing so, why \nshould we not support any proposals that come to the floor of the \nSenate to change the Constitution? The answer is because if we are \ngoing to alter the Constitution let's do it in the right way. Let's \nsolve problems--not create problems.\n  This constitutional amendment to balance the budget is enormously \nflawed especially in one area as described by the Senator from Nevada, \nand that is the area of Social Security. One of the largest programs in \nthe Federal Government is Social Security. It is not contributing one \npenny to the Federal deficit. In fact, this year it will have $70 to \n$80 billion more collected in the program than is necessary to be \nspent. Why? Because one of the few sober things which was done in \nWashington in the 1980's, in my judgment, was the creation of a Social \nSecurity commission which created recommendations which the Congress \nenacted which resulted in the accrual of substantial savings year by \nyear to be used when the baby boomers retire after the turn of the \ncentury.\n  If this constitutional amendment is enacted by Congress and ratified \nby the States, what will the impact be of that on the Social Security \nsavings that we now have that are necessary to meet the needs of the \nbaby boomers after the turn of the century? The impact will be that \nthey will be used as offsets against other revenues, and you will not \nhave the savings. And in any event, the Congressional Research Service \nsays that after the turn of the century if you have the savings you \ncouldn't use them unless you raised other taxes, or cut other spending \nin a commensurate amount.\n  The noise on the floor of the Senate is interesting. We have folks \nwho rush to the floor to hold up this piece of paper, or that piece of \npaper. On the floor of the Senate, because we have a doctrine of free \nspeech and unlimited speech, and recognition here that when someone is \nrecognized, even the newest Member, they can be recognized and stand \nand hold the floor until they are mentally and physically exhausted. No \none can take it from them. The Senate has worked that way since its \ninception for a couple of hundred years. It is a wonderful institution \nbut allows anybody to come and say anything--anything on the floor of \nthe Senate. You can hold up this piece of paper and say, ``I have in my \nhand a purple piece of paper. Notice this green piece of paper. Notice \nthis 8,000-page document.'' It doesn't matter. You can say whatever you \nlike. And that is part of the problem that we face with a stack of \nbooks sitting on a desk over here being used to demonstrate budgets \nthat have been out of balance.\n  People say, ``Well, everyone else has to balance their budgets. So \nshould the Government.'' The Government should balance its budget. But \nit is not true that everybody else balances their budgets. We have $21 \ntrillion in debt in this country. We have nearly as much corporate debt \nas we have Federal Government debt. We have a substantial amount of \nconsumer debt. We have a substantial amount, and it is growing at an \nalarming rate with credit card debt. We have debt all around this \ncountry. And it is a problem. It is a problem with the Federal \nGovernment, and it is a problem for the entire country.\n\n[[Page S1499]]\n\n  We ought to have, in my judgment, a different kind of budget in our \ncountry. We certainly ought to have a capital budget. But I have not \nhinged my vote on a constitutional amendment to balance the budget on \nthat point. But it is interesting. Most of the State Governors who come \nhere pull out their suspenders and trumpet to anyone who will listen \nwithin a reasonable distance that they have to balance their \nconstitutional budgets. They have a constitutional amendment to balance \ntheir budgets, and their States have a constitutional amendment \nrequiring that they balance their budget. Those States are worried \nabout their credit ratings. Why? Because they are borrowing more? Why, \nif they are balancing their budgets? Because they have capital budgets. \nAnd they amortize over a longer period of time the amount of money they \nare spending on roads and other things instead of as in the Federal \nGovernment expensing it in the very year in which you do anything. If \nyou build an aircraft carrier that is going to last 30 years, expense \nit all in 1 year. Roads, the same way.\n\n  So we ought to have a capital budget. But I have not leveraged my \nsupport for a constitutional amendment on that basis.\n  The question, however, today is: Shall we put in the Constitution \nthis proposal, or shall we put in the Constitution a proposal that is \nmodified in this case by the suggestion of the Senator from Nevada, \nwhich I support? And, if a constitutional amendment is modified with \nthat provision, I intend to vote for and support the constitutional \namendment. If it is not, I will not vote for it, and will not support \nit. I will offer a substitute following this vote, if this vote is \ndefeated. I will offer a substitute constitutional amendment to balance \nthe budget that is identical to the one on the floor that includes the \nprovision offered by the Senator from Nevada as a substitute \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. I will vote for that. \nIf that passes--and I would say to those on the other side of the aisle \nthat support that, they would have sufficient votes on this side of the \naisle to perhaps pass it with 75 votes--then we would be done with this \nquestion. Are we going to alter the Constitution of the United States? \nThen we would be on to something that is important. I am not suggesting \naltering the Constitution isn't important. I am saying that the issue \nhere is balancing the budget. And you could alter the Constitution at \n10 minutes to 10 in the morning. Two minutes from now you can alter the \nConstitution to require a balanced budget, and at 10 o'clock--2 minutes \nfrom now--you will not have made 1 penny of difference in balancing the \nbudget. The only way we will balance the budget is if men and women in \nthe Senate on a budget document that describes the specific spending \nand taxing issues are willing to cast hard votes to do that.\n  I found it interesting that the people who stand the highest and seem \nto speak the loudest on this issue about altering the Constitution were \nnot around on the floor of the Senate in 1993 except to predict that if \nwe pass the Deficit Reduction Act of 1993--something I voted for--if we \npass that we would throw the country into a recession; that, if we pass \nthat, there would be cataclysmic results in impacts on the country, and \nthe country will be going down the wrong road.\n  So a group of us by one vote in 1993 passed a bill called the Deficit \nReduction Act, and the deficit has been reduced by 60 percent; 60 \npercent. Was it a smart thing to do to vote for that? No, not at all. \nWas it a smart political thing to do? No, not at all. The smart and the \neasy political thing to do was to go out that door and say to anybody \nwho would listen about how they are doing dumb things in there. But \nthey are actually casting tough votes to reduce the budget deficit. If \nenough of us did that, it would pass by one vote.\n  That is dealing with the budget deficit. This is altering the \nConstitution. And after you alter the Constitution, someone here still \nhas to decide how we are going to spend the money, where we are going \nto cut spending, how are we going to raise the revenue, and how we \nbalance the budget. And that is the tough part. The easy part is \nbraying, trumpeting, shouting, and doing all the things that make a lot \nof noise that doesn't do anything about reducing the budget deficit. \nThe tough thing is the quiet negotiations and the quiet agreements that \nare necessary to agree on budget cuts, spending cuts, and revenue needs \nto balance the Federal budget.\n  We have had a number of people here on the floor of the Senate who \nsay that the Social Security issue that has been raised is specious; it \nis an irrelevant issue. Those who ought to be concerned about the \nSocial Security trust fund and the Social Security fund itself would be \nbetter off supporting a balanced budget because the only way to really \nguarantee Social Security benefits will be to balance the budget. Let \nme respond to that for just a moment.\n  If we pass this constitutional amendment to balance the budget as it \nis currently written the savings that are now accrued in the Social \nSecurity trust fund to be available after the turn of the century will \nnot be able to be used unless somebody comes along and raises taxes, or \ncuts other spending in order to use them. And I do not understand when \nfolks say, ``Well, the best way to assure the long-term health of the \nSocial Security system is to pass this amendment.'' I do not understand \nthat in passing this amendment we are creating a circumstance where it \nwill prevent the very use of the Social Security funds we are now \ncollecting to be used after the turn of the century when it is \nneeded. I mean, that just stands logic on its head. I guess, again, in \na debate forum like this, when you are able to say whatever you want to \nsay at any time about anything, you can say that. But I am wondering \nhow many people are willing to believe that. If you tell taxpayers we \nare going to take money out of your paychecks, we are going to put it \nin a trust fund, and we promise you we will save it and use it for \nSocial Security, but then use it for something else--I wonder how many \npeople out there in the country think that is an honest way to behave.\n\n  I would like--and I am still waiting, incidentally--I would like one \nMember of the U.S. Senate, just one, to stand up, and maybe this week \nwe can find one who will, stand up and say this: ``I support telling \nthose who are going to work and working every day that we want to take \nyour money from your paycheck, we want to have a little box there on \nyour paycheck that says we have taken $1,000 out of your paycheck and \nwe have called it taxing for Social Security, and we promise you we are \ngoing to put it in a trust fund, and then we are going to take the \ntrust fund and move it over here and use that as other revenue so we \ncan now say we have balanced the budget.'' I want one Member of the \nSenate to stand up and tell me that is a proposal he or she makes to \ntheir constituents. There is not one Member of the Senate, I think, \nthat would vote for that, yet that is exactly what we have. It is \nexactly what we have in this country in our fiscal policy.\n  And this proposal wants to enshrine it in the Constitution of the \nUnited States. This proposal wants to enshrine it forever in the \nConstitution of the United States, and it makes no sense at all. As an \naffirmative proposition to misuse these trust funds makes no sense at \nall. I do not know of anybody who will say, ``That is my position. Let \nme go ahead and push this. That is what I believe in.'' Yet, that is \nexactly what will be written in the Constitution of the United States.\n  This is the Constitution of the United States, in the rules and the \nmanual of the U.S. Senate. That has the Constitution in it. The \nConstitution is actually not a very lengthy document, as most folks \nknow. The 18th amendment to the Constitution was passed:\n\n       After one year from the ratification of this article the \n     manufacture, sale or transportation of intoxicating liquors \n     within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation \n     thereof from the United States and all territories subject to \n     the jurisdiction thereof for beverage purposes is hereby \n     prohibited.\n\n  That is prohibition. The 18th amendment to the Constitution, \nprohibition. Just to demonstrate that in this country we have a right \nto make a mistake, the 21st amendment, three amendments later, says the \nfollowing:\n\n       The 18th article of amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States is hereby repealed.\n\n  It is a wonderful thing about democracy, we have a right to be wrong. \nWe have a right to make mistakes. We can even do it in the \nConstitution. But we ought to be enormously careful about\n\n[[Page S1500]]\n\nwhat we do with the Constitution because it is very hard to correct. We \ncorrected the 18th by passing the 21st amendment to the Constitution. \nLet us not create a circumstance where we amend the Constitution and \nare required to correct it again. That is not, in my judgment, the sort \nof thing we ought to do with the Constitution of the United States.\n  Let me emphasize this one more time. The Senator from South Carolina \nhas now come to the floor, Senator Hollings, who has been involved in \nthis discussion for some while on Social Security. Those who come to \nthis floor to say this is a specious argument were not in the room in \n1983 when we passed the Social Security Reform Act. I was part of the \noriginating committee that did it, the Ways and Means Committee of the \nU.S. House of Representatives. I was part of those, that group of \npeople who originally debated this in the Ways and Means Committee in \nthe House of Representatives. And the day it was marked up, I was the \none person in the committee who offered the amendment. That is 14 years \nago. I offered an amendment, on the very day this was considered, to \nsay if you do not take this money, this Social Security money that we \nare going to accrue to be used after the turn of the century, and set \nit aside so it is not part of a budget that somebody else can use, if \nyou do not do it, it is going to be misused. I was defeated that day \nwith the amendment I offered.\n  So, when people write to the Washington Post, as someone did last \nweek, or people come to the floor of the Senate and pop up here and \ntalk about what they know and what they do not know, I was part of the \ngroup in 1983 that decided to create a surplus in Social Security to be \nused when the baby boomers retire and they need it. This constitutional \namendment will enshrine in the Constitution the practice of misusing \nthat Social Security trust fund, and there is no question about it.\n  As I said, people can come and protest and hold up purple sheets or \ngreen sheets all day long and it will not alter the facts. If we are \ngoing to amend this Constitution, and I am willing to do that, if we \nare deciding to say there is merit in requiring a balanced budget, and \nI think there is, then we ought to do it right, not do it wrong. We \nought to do it even if it is hard to do. We ought to do it the right \nway, rather than to do it the easy way and misuse $1 trillion in 10 \nyears of Social Security trust funds. That is what this debate is \nabout. That is what the perfecting amendment by the Senator from Nevada \nis about.\n\n  I would say to the majority side, if you accept this perfecting \namendment, you will pass this with 75 votes. You want a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution? You will get it. Accept this perfecting \namendment and you will have it. If you do not get it, it is your fault \nbecause you have decided that you want to do something that, in my \njudgment, would not be allowed anywhere in the private sector. But you \nwant to get away with it in the public sector.\n  The Senator from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, has said before--and I \nwill say it before he says it again this morning--if you tried this in \nthe private sector as an employer, and say to the folks in your \nbusiness, ``You know I have been losing money, so what I decided to do, \neven though I have been losing money in my business, I will take your \npension funds and bring them into the business, claim I have not lost \nmoney, and use your pension funds to do it,'' you would be on your way \nto 2 years in a minimum security prison somewhere in this country, \nbecause it is against the law to do that. You cannot do that.\n  That is exactly the budget practice of the Government of the United \nStates. It is wrong, and it ought to be stopped. The last thing that \nought to happen is that we enshrine it in the Constitution of the \nUnited States.\n  If you accept this proposal, this perfecting amendment by the Senator \nfrom Nevada, then you will pass this amendment; don't, and you may not. \nBut if you don't, the failure of passing the constitutional amendment \nis on the shoulders of those who failed to perfect the amendment in a \nway that means something to the American people.\n  One final point, and I will take 30 seconds. The demonstration of the \nnaked truth of the bankruptcy of this proposed use of the Social \nSecurity trust funds is this. When the majority party has claimed to \nhave balanced its budget, the Federal debt will have to be increased by \n$130 billion the very year in which they have claimed to balance the \nbudget. Ask anybody--a fifth grader, seventh grader, high school \nsophomore--why, if you balanced the budget, would you have to increase \nthe Federal defendant limit? The answer: Because it is a scam. The \nbudget is not balanced. Plain and simple. That is the naked truth, and \nthat is what exposes this balanced budget amendment for what it is.\n  Amend it with the perfecting amendment offered by the Senator from \nNevada, and you will have my vote. It is not a bluff. You will have my \nvote. Do not amend it with that and you will not have my vote, because \nit is the wrong way to alter the Constitution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to commend the Senator from North \nDakota, and I see the other Senator from North Dakota here about to \nspeak. I will yield immediately to him.\n  You know what this debate has shown? The two Senators from North \nDakota have been in the forefront in discussing this, as was the senior \nSenator from West Virginia, in describing his own amendment yesterday, \nand will be in his discussion in the week coming up. It describes what \nwould seem to be a very simple concept: have a constitutional amendment \nto balance the budget. If you do a poll on this, ``Are you in favor of \na balanced budget,'' everybody says, ``Sure, of course we are.''\n  Then comes the question: Do we amend the Constitution? It has only \nbeen amended 17 times since the Bill of Rights--only 17 times. Now, we \nhave another issue. If we are going to do that, do we do it for \nsomething that looks good on a bumper sticker for a slogan, or do we do \nit thinking about what we are doing?\n\n  Just remember, this Senate has only been involved in successful \namending of the Constitution 17 times since the Bill of Rights. That \nmeans a lot of our predecessors had to think long and hard about \nthousands of proposals to amend the Constitution, about what would they \ndo. The Senators from North Dakota, the Senator from West Virginia, the \nSenator from Nevada, and others who have spoken do us service by \nsaying, ``Just what is it we are buying with this? Is it a balanced \nbudget?'' No, it is a very, very dangerous monkey wrench in the \nConstitution that will cost our children and our children's children a \ngreat deal. It will cost our Social Security recipients, and it will \nnot do what the President said in the State of the Union Message what \ncan be done: Do you want to balance the budget? All we have to do is \nvote to do that, and he signs it. It is as simple as that. We don't \nneed to amend the Constitution.\n  I am delighted to yield to my good friend and colleague, the senior \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont, and I \nthank him for his devotion on this issue, spending hours and hours on \nthe floor to try to make certain people have heard both sides of the \nstory before a vote is cast in this Chamber.\n  Mr. President, I come at this issue with a deficiency, and that \ndeficiency is I have a financial background. My education is in finance \nand business. My career was as a tax administrator, somebody who dealt \nwith finances and budgets on a routine basis. And I must say, when I \nhear talk about the need to balance the budget, nobody could agree more \nthan I do with that concept. I am absolutely in support of balancing \nthe budget of the United States.\n  It is imperative that we do that, because we are in a special \ncircumstance. We are on the eve of the baby-boom generation starting to \nretire, and that will put enormous stress on the budget of the United \nStates if we fail to get our fiscal house in order.\n  In fact, I think I can say, without fear of contradiction, no Senator \nhas offered more specific plans to balance the budget than I have. So I \ndon't take a back seat to anyone with respect to a desire and a \ncommitment to balance\n\n[[Page S1501]]\n\nthe budget. But when I see the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution that is before us now, I have to say what I believe to be \nthe absolute truth. This is a giant hoax. To call this a balanced \nbudget wouldn't pass the laugh test in any corporation in America.\n  If anybody told a corporate board of directors that they were going \nto balance the budget by taking the retirement funds of the employees \nand throwing those into the pot, they would be in violation of Federal \nlaw, because that is fraudulent. It is fraudulent to take retirement \nfunds of employees and use those to balance the operating budget of a \ncorporation. That is not permitted under Federal law. And yet that is \nprecisely what this so-called balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution contemplates. They are going to take every penny of the \nSocial Security trust fund surplus and throw those into the pot to \nclaim that they have balanced the budget.\n  (Ms. SNOWE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, they don't just take every penny of the \nSocial Security trust fund, they take every penny of every trust fund \nand throw it into the pot and say they have balanced the budget.\n  It is like the story of the emperor who has no clothes and everybody \nis afraid to stand up and say it. But that is precisely what is going \non here. When our colleagues come home and say to you, ``We are for a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution,'' I urge you to ask them \nthis simple question: What budget is being balanced?\n  Boy, that sounds awfully elementary, doesn't it? You would think this \nis a question that could be easily answered. Unfortunately, when you \nexamine what is going on here, what you find out is that it is at great \nvariance from the claims that are being made. Those who beat their \nchest and say they are for balancing the budget and that this balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution will do that are engaged in an \nenormous hoax.\n  Let's look at the language. It comes from section 7, and it says:\n\n       Total receipts shall include all of the receipts of the \n     United States Government except those derived from borrowing. \n     Total outlays shall include all outlays of the United States \n     Government except for those for repayment of debt principal.\n\n  Very simple concepts. What they are saying is they are going to put \nall of the revenue of the Federal Government in the pot, and they are \ngoing to look at all of the expenditures of the Federal Government, and \nthat will be a balanced budget. What is wrong with that concept is that \nthey are including all of the receipts from the trust funds and using \nthose, every penny of them, to claim that they have balanced the \nbudget.\n  Let me just show it in a different way. When I was growing up in our \nState, people would keep money in a pot. A farm wife would keep cash in \na pot. I have this teapot to kind of show what is going on here, \nbecause into the teapot goes all of the taxes, all of the corporate \ntaxes, all of the other taxes, but in this balanced budget amendment, \nthey are also including all of the Social Security taxes--all of them, \nevery penny goes into the pot. And then they are going to balance with \nwhat is being spent. All of the items that the money goes for in the \nFederal budget: Social Security is about 22 percent of the money; \ninterest on the debt, 16 percent; defense, 16 percent; Medicare, 14 \npercent; Medicaid, 7 percent; all other Federal spending, 25 percent.\n\n  Can you imagine that they are trying to claim that this is a balanced \nbudget, and what they are doing is they are taking trust fund income, \ntrust funds that are in surplus now, designed to be built up to be used \nwhen the baby boomers retire, and they are using the trust fund \nsurpluses to claim they have balanced the operating budget. What a \nhoax; what a fraud. That is not a balanced budget.\n  A balanced budget would be if you were saving your trust fund \nsurpluses for the purposes intended and you are balancing your \noperating budget. That would be a balanced budget. This is not a \nbalanced budget.\n  Let me demonstrate how massive this hoax is, because it is really \nquite stunning in its breathtaking willingness to loot every trust fund \nof the United States of every penny. That is what is going on here, \nmake no mistake, because if this thing is passed and is implemented, we \nare going to wake up and find there is no money in any trust fund; \nevery surplus nickel has been taken.\n  Look at what is happening. Some will say, ``Senator, that is what is \ngoing on now, that is precisely what is being done.'' That is true, \nthat is what is happening, and it ought to be stopped, and it ought to \nbe stopped now, because we are entering the period when those surpluses \nexplode--they explode--because the baby boomers are getting closer to \nretirement, and so the surpluses are being built up for the purpose of \nbeing ready for them when they retire.\n  Look at how massive these surpluses are. In 1998, $81 billion in that \nyear alone. By 1999, in just those 2 years, it is up to $169 billion, \nand between now and the year 2002, when they are going to claim they \nhave balanced the budget, they will have used $465 billion of Social \nSecurity trust fund surpluses and claim they have balanced the \nbudget. Again, if any private company tried to do this, tried to take \nthe retirement funds of their employees to balance the operating budget \nof the company, they would be in violation of Federal law. They would \nbe headed for a Federal facility, and it would not be Congress. They \nwould be headed for a prison.\n\n  Yet this is what we are talking about putting in the Constitution of \nthe United States. We are going to put in the organic law of our \ncountry the definition of a balanced budget, that if a private company \nwere doing it, would be a violation of Federal law. I do not think so. \nNot with this Senator's vote. I would not vote, ever, to put that in \nthe Constitution of the United States, the basic law of our country \nthat has made this the greatest Nation in human history, the definition \nof a balanced budget that is so fraudulent that if any private company \ntried to do it, it would be a violation of Federal law.\n  Now, that is a fact of the balanced budget amendment that is before \nthe Senate. When I say that is breathtaking, breathtaking in what they \nare trying to put in the Constitution of the United States, I meant \njust that. The Social Security surpluses I indicated are increasing \ndramatically. Indeed, they are. From 1998 to 2013, we will have \nsurpluses in Social Security, surpluses over and above what the \nexpenditures are during that period, of $1.8 trillion. The folks who \nare advocating this balanced budget--I call it a so-called balanced \nbudget amendment because this is not a balanced budget, no way. There \nis no serious definition of balance that would include this so-called \nbalanced budget amendment because the fact is if you passed it, you \nimplement it, the debt would continue to increase. They claim they have \nbalanced the budget. What a fraud. They are going to take $1.8 trillion \nof Social Security surpluses, throw those into the pot, and claim they \nhave balanced the budget.\n  It is very interesting if you look at this in another way and try to \ndetermine who is telling it straight here, who is telling it straight, \njust looking at the growth of the Federal debt of the United States. If \nthey are being straight with the American people and they are really \nbalancing the budget, would that not tell you that in the year 2002, \nthe year in which we will have claimed balance because that will be an \namendment to the Constitution of the United States, that the debt would \nstop increasing? Would that not be a logical conclusion? If we are \ngoing to balance the budget in the year 2002, would you not expect, \nthen, that the debt of the United States would no longer increase? You \nwould no longer be running deficits because you would have balanced the \nbudget.\n  Well, testing that proposition, this chart shows the gross Federal \ndebt of the United States. It shows what would happen if this so-called \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution were passed and became \neffective by 2002. You can see this is the year 2002, the year in which \nit claims balance; this line shows what happens to the Federal debt. It \nkeeps right on going up. The Federal debt keeps right on increasing. If \nwe look at it another way, we can see just what a fraud and a hoax this \nreally is. They call it a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. They put this definition into the Constitution of the \nUnited States and let's\n\n[[Page S1502]]\n\nsee what would happen in the year 2002. They are claiming the deficit \nwould be zero. But look what happens to the budget deficit in that \nyear. When you look at Social Security and the postal service funds, \nthe so-called on-budget deficit, what you see is not a zero. The budget \nis not balanced. The deficit is increasing $103 billion. If you look at \nthe broadest measure of debt and deficit, you include all of the trust \nfunds. What you find is that the debt and the deficit will increase in \nthat year by $110 billion.\n  Yet they are calling it a balanced budget, and they are putting it in \nthe Constitution of the United States that this is a balanced budget. \nWho are they kidding? There is nobody that has had fifth grade \narithmetic that cannot figure this out. There is nobody. My daughter, \nwhen she was 7 years old, and she was very good at math, I admit that, \nshe would have been able to figure this out. Just because you are \ncalling something a balanced budget does not make it one. That is like \nthe old story in North Dakota, you call the pig a cow, it does not make \nit a cow. This is a balanced budget, they claim it is a balanced \nbudget, but it is not one. The deficit keeps going up, debt keeps going \nup, they have looted every penny of every trust fund in sight and \nclaimed they balanced the budget and put that definition in the \nConstitution of the United States. It does not belong there.\n  If we want to do this as an amendment to the Constitution we ought to \ndo it right. This amendment does not pass the laugh test. This \namendment is not a balanced budget, No. 1. No. 2, it is fatally flawed \nin other ways, as well, because it does not provide enough protection \nin the case of a national economic emergency. In addition to that, it \nwould put us in a circumstance in which the courts could write the \nbudget of the United States. That was never contemplated by our \nforefathers, to have the Members of the Supreme Court--and I can look \nthrough the doors there and almost see the Supreme Court of the United \nStates--I tell you, our Founding Fathers did not have in mind that the \nJustices of the Supreme Court would sit around a table and write the \nbudget for the United States. That is what would happen under the \namendment that is before the Senate.\n\n  Let me just say the amendment by the Senator from Nevada, Senator \nReid, addresses the first problem with the balanced budget amendment \nthat is before the Senate. He would not permit the looting of $450 \nbillion of Social Security surplus between now and the year 2002, to \nclaim they balanced the budget. He would not permit the raiding of $1.8 \ntrillion of Social Security surpluses between now and about the year \n2019 and take all those moneys and throw them in the pot and claim they \nhave balanced the budget. It is a substantial improvement over the so-\ncalled balanced budget amendment that is before the Senate now. On that \nbasis, Senator Reid's amendment deserves support, because it would \nbegin to address the fatal flaws in this amendment.\n  I just end where I began. I really wonder what our forefathers who \nwrote the Constitution would be thinking about a Congress meeting in \n1997 that has so little regard for the organic law of our country that \nthey would put an amendment into that document that defines a balanced \nbudget in a way that raids every trust fund surplus in the Federal \nbudget, to claim that they had balanced the budget. America is a better \ncountry than that. We are a greater country than that, to put in our \nConstitution a definition of a balanced budget that is totally without \nmerit, it is fraudulent, it is fake, it is false, it is not honest.\n  We should not be putting that in the Constitution of the United \nStates. When I took the oath of office, I swore to uphold and defend \nthe Constitution of the United States. I took that pledge very \nseriously. I think it is the most serious thing we do as a Member of \nthis body--swear to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United \nStates. Well, I believe one responsibility in meeting that affirmative \npledge is to protect the Constitution from amendments that are unworthy \nof that great document.\n  I will ask any of my colleagues to read the amendment before us in \nthe context of the Constitution. Get out your Constitution and then put \nthis amendment down and read the two together and see how it fits, see \nhow it reads, see if it makes any sense to you to have this \nconstitutional amendment that is before us grafted onto the \nConstitution of the United States. It doesn't fit. It sticks out like a \nsore thumb. And it is, at its base, utterly fraudulent. It is wrong to \nput that amendment into our Constitution.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, this is an important amendment, but it is \nnot as important as the proponents think. The fact of the matter is \nthat Social Security is much better protected within the purview of the \nunified budget than it will be out there standing all by itself where \nthey can add anything to it, or take anything away from it that they \nwant to, and where it will become a spending loophole device that I \nthink will be to the detriment of the senior citizens.\n  To say that the trust funds are raided is the biggest charade I have \nheard in all my time in the Senate. First of all, when the FICA funds \ncome in, they are immediately invested into U.S. Government bonds, the \nbest securities anywhere in the world. Those bonds are kept. There is \nno great big trust fund or a big place where they keep all this money. \nThey are bonds due and owing by the American people some time in the \nfuture. The only way we are going to be able to pay back those bonds is \nif we get spending under control and get our economy under control. The \nonly way we are going to do that, after looking at 28 straight years of \nunbalanced budgets--those 28 straight years of unbalanced budgets are \nrepresented by these actual unbalanced budgets, since 1969--the only \nway we are going to do that is to pass a balanced budget constitutional \namendment.\n  Some say, well, we want another type of an amendment. The fact is \nthat this is a bipartisan amendment that has been put together over 21 \nyears. I know because I have participated in every word of it with my \nbipartisan colleagues in the House and Senate, on the Democratic side \nas well as the Republican side. This is the only amendment that has a \nchance of passage, the only thing that actually will give a real sense \nof protection and actual protection to those people who are on Social \nSecurity now.\n  For people to come on this floor and say, They are raiding the trust \nfunds, because literally they are exchanging bonds for the funds and \nhelping to balance the budget with whatever surplus exists now, is not \nonly a charade; it is absolutely false. I get a little tired of people \nsaying they are raiding the trust funds, not treating the trust funds \nright. The fact is, if you take Social Security out of the purview of \nthe balanced budget amendment--if this amendment passed and we take it \noutside the purview of the balanced budget amendment, first of all, \nthis amendment won't do what they say it will do. It is very poorly \ndrafted. Even if it does do what they say it would do--and I will, just \nfor the sake of discussion this morning, argue within that context, \nthat it will do what they say it will--and you take Social Security out \nof the budget, the surpluses that will occur between now and 2008 will \nbe invested in Federal Government bonds, which is exactly what they are \ndoing now. The only difference is that the moneys they have then may be \nused for social spending programs other than Social Security, and that \nmeans another ability to spend more without making the reforms that \nhave to be made in programs like Medicaid, Medicare, and so many others \nin our society, which are running out of control today. And the people \nwho are going to be hurt the most are going to be those people who are \ncounting on the Social Security funds being there some day, because we \nwill not get Federal spending under control without this balanced \nbudget amendment. We will continue to have these tremendous stacks of \nunbalanced budgets that will go all the way to the ceiling.\n\n  When people come to the floor and say, ``Let's just have the will to \ndo it''--and I have heard it from opponents of the balanced budget \namendment now for 21 years of unbalanced budgets--they ought to look at \nthis stack and realize it is going up every\n\n[[Page S1503]]\n\nyear, and there is no will to do it. It is too easy to spend, too easy \nto spend the taxpayers' money. It is too easy to just act \nirresponsibly. Putting Social Security outside of the purview of the \nunified budget and outside the purview of this balanced budget \namendment would be one of the most reckless things we could do. It \nwould be the most risky gimmick you could have. I think it is not only \na risky gimmick, it would be a riverboat gamble, where you are almost \nguaranteed to lose. Social Security would become a football to be \nkicked back and forth by those who want to play games with the budget, \nbecause there would be no fiscal discipline involved in that particular \nissue. They want to take the largest item in the budget out of the \nunified budget.\n  Now, to show how ridiculous it is to take that riverboat gamble, put \nit out there where it is all by itself, where it could be attacked by \nanybody, instead of keeping it within the budget, I ask this one thing. \nWhy do that when Social Security is the one item in the whole budget \nthat everybody, every person sitting in the Congress today, be they \nRepublican or Democrat, would support, would help, would keep viable? \nIt is the largest item in the budget. I have to tell you that it can \ncompete better than any other single budgetary issue. So where is the \nissue? Where is the meat here?\n  The fact is that those who are bringing these amendments to the \nfloor, by and large--and I am not talking about the distinguished \nSenator from Nevada; he is very sincere in this amendment, and he \nbelieves this. I don't know why he believes this, if you look at the \nfacts of the 28 years, and at what all of us have done throughout the \nyears. But most of the others who are bringing this to the floor and \narguing for this are people who would not want a balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment in the Constitution for any reason, or for a \nvariety of reasons, some very sincere and some because they want to \nspend and tax more with ease, and they want to do it with voice votes \nso they don't have to come here and stand up and let people know how \nthey voted. I have to tell you, they want to defeat the balanced budget \namendment. Now, that might be all right to have this out there if it \nwere a better system, but it would not be. You would be exposing Social \nSecurity to direct attack and to direct manipulation over and over.\n\n  Madam President, I will have more to say in a few minutes on this. I \nnotice the distinguished Senator from Michigan is here. He came to \nspeak.\n  I yield such time as he needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I expect to speak more than once on \nthis issue today. I would like to begin, however, by reiterating some \nof the points I made in previous speeches on the amendment, because I \nthink as we immerse ourselves in the debates on these various \nsubtopics, we often lose sight of why we are here.\n  The reason we are here is because of what that pile of unbalanced \nbudgets reflects--that this country has gone a full generation without \nonce balancing the budget. It has not balanced it using Social Security \nor excluding it. It has not been balanced at all. Therefore, we have \nbeen piling up more and more debt and responsibility, not just on \nourselves but, more importantly, on our children.\n  Last week, I was looking at what we call the national debt clock. \nSome people have questioned the rate at which the clock grows. They \nask, ``Whose calculation are you using?'' It doesn't matter. Even the \nslowest calculation of that debt clock suggests that the deficit is \ngoing up to the tune of about $6,374 per second. That is an awful lot \nof spending beyond our means. What it has done is--and I think most \nAmericans understand, even if not most of us in Washington--it has \nplaced enormous burdens on families of this country, enormous burdens \non enterprise in this country, and, most importantly, enormous burdens \non the children and future children of America.\n  In terms of its effect on families, this ever rising deficit and the \nneed of a Federal Government to borrow money to meet its payments has \nforced interest rates up dramatically in this country. Interest rates \nare estimated to be 2 percent higher because of the deficit. That means \nthe average price of a new home is $37,000 more because we can't \nbalance the budget. A student loan is estimated to be some $2,000 more \nexpensive because we can't balance the budget. A new car, an average-\npriced new car, is estimated to be $1,000 more expensive because we \ncan't balance the budget. For all of the talk that this could be done \nif we only had the will and if the White House and the Congress would \nonly get together, the fact is for 28 years we have not reached the \nfinish line.\n  But it is not just families who are paying more. People are paying \nmore in other ways as well. To the extent the Federal Government \nborrows money, it means there is less capital available to create new \nbusinesses, to expand existing businesses, to pay better wages. So our \nworkers are hurt. Our free enterprise system is hurt. Our chronic \nbudget deficits mean lower economic growth, fewer jobs, and lower \nwages.\n  Finally, at the top of the list of victims of our budget deficits are \nthe children of this country. My family was blessed 5 months ago with a \nnew child. When our son was born, at the very moment that he was born, \nhe automatically inherited responsibility to support the debt previous \ngenerations have imposed upon him. Over his lifetime, he will be forced \nto pay $187,000 in tax payments just to cover the interest on this \ndebt. If we do not try to bring this under control and do it soon \nrather than later, this burden will only get worse for future \ngenerations.\n  So that is why we are here. We should not lose sight of why we are \nhere. Our goal is to come to the finish line on an amendment that has \nthe opportunity and the ability to bring this kind of deficit spending \nunder control.\n  At the moment we are discussing a proposal with respect to Social \nSecurity. The distinguished Senator from Utah has referred to this \nproposal as a risky gimmick, because it has many consequences that have \nnot, to my knowledge, been fleshed out in any debate either in the \nJudiciary Committee when it was first brought up here or here on the \nfloor. Most importantly, in terms of the risk involved, is the fact \nthat as I read this proposal, the Reid amendment, and I have read it \nseveral times, I do not see that additional protection for the benefits \nof Social Security are provided. After all, that is really what this \ncomes down to. Are the beneficiaries going to be protected. The Reid \namendment, in my judgment, doesn't do that at all. It does something \nelse, though, which I think every Member of this Chamber should be \naware of and have a responsibility to address. That is, it requires a \nsubstantially increased amount of Federal spending to be either reduced \nor Federal revenues to be generated in order to meet the terms of this \namendment.\n  According to calculations of the Congressional Budget Office, during \nthe years 2002 to 2007, if the Reid amendment were adopted and \nratified, we would have to come up with an additional $706 billion in \neither new taxes or spending cuts over and above everything else we \nwill have to do to keep the budget in balance during those years.\n  In addition, the Senate Budget Committee has estimated that we will \nhave to come up with $181 billion more on top of the first $706 billion \nin order to reach balance in the year 2002. Those $181 billion would \nhave to be found during the years between now and 2002. That is a total \nof $887 billion beyond all of the other things that we are trying to do \nto bring spending under control that would have to be saved if this \namendment went into effect. I think it is important for people who are \nadvocating this amendment to come to this floor and explain where those \ndollars are going to come from, because $800 billion on top of all of \nthe other things required here, to me at least, does not seem \nplausible.\n  Let me put it in perspective. We would be talking about in addition \nto all of the other reductions in spending, in addition to all of the \nother taxes the Federal Government currently collects, coming up with a \nsum of $800 billion. This sum is more than the 1993 tax hike, the \nlargest tax hike in history, plus the reductions in Medicare proposed \nin last year's budget that was passed by the Congress, plus the \nreduction in discretionary spending that was in last year's budget \npassed by the Congress.\n\n[[Page S1504]]\n\n  When the tax increase in 1993 was passed, many of us on the \nRepublican side said that was too much of a tax burden to place on the \nAmerican people. We argued that it was far too great. It was the \nlargest in history. When Republicans brought to the floor a budget with \na discretionary spending cuts and reforms in Medicare last year, we \nwere told by the other side that those were reductions that were too \ngreat, that that those savings were unacceptable, and that is why the \nPresident refused to go along and sign the various bills that would \nhave effectuated that budget. Now we are talking about doing all of the \nthings required to bring the budget into balance in 2002, and then on \ntop of that, if this amendment went into effect, replicating the \nprocess one more time--in fact, more than what we have done--in order \nto meet the terms of this amendment.\n  I do not believe there is anybody in the Senate who is capable of, or \nprepared to produce any sort of plan that would even remotely \naccomplish those objectives. For that reason, Madam President, I cannot \nsupport this amendment. I have no idea how it could be effectuated, and \nI have not heard one Member on either side come forward and explain \nthat to me.\n  Moreover, even if we went through an exercise to accomplish it, why \nwe would be doing it? The terms of the amendment would not in any way \nprotect the benefits of Social Security even if we did raise taxes $800 \nbillion more dollars, or cut spending on programs like education, law \nenforcement, or infrastructure by $800 billion more.\n  In short, the amendment doesn't accomplish the goals for which it is \nbeing proposed, but the pain complying with its requirements would be \nenormous.\n  So, for those reasons, Madam President, I cannot support this \namendment. I would be happy, and will watch the debate today, to see if \nsomeone comes to the floor with a proposal of how to bring about these \nreductions that could give some assurance that they could be \naccomplished. I hope someone will. But during the debate in committee \nand in the discussions since --and certainly this has been something \ndiscussed very publicly in the last few weeks--no one has offered a \nplan, or even anything close to a plan, that could accomplish this. \nWhile I think and I am confident that advocates of the amendment are \nsincere in their advocacy, I just do not believe this is an amendment \nthat could ever been effectuated by this Congress, or any future \nCongress. I do not believe it would be feasible to do it because I do \nnot think, as I say, anyone has brought forth any solution or plan or \nproposal that would live up to the terms of the amendment.\n  For those reasons, I certainly have no intention of supporting it. \nBut maybe before the end of the day we will hear a response that \nexplains where the spending cuts are going to come from or how the \ntaxes are going to be increased or provide some insight into how this \nreally would protect Social Security benefits later on when the trust \nfund begins to run a deficit, because as I read the terms of this, it \nin no way does that, either.\n  So, Madam President, at this time, I yield the floor. I expect later, \nas the day goes on, that I will be back to speak a little bit more on \nthis. But I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum, with the time equally \ncharged.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I know the distinguished Senator from \nSouth Carolina [Mr. Hollings] will be here soon, as will the \ndistinguished Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid]. They are involved in \nanother discussion of the issue that is pending in the Chamber.\n  Again, I will say, as I said over and over again, we have to separate \nthe difference between a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution \nand a balanced budget. There is nothing to stop us today, this moment, \nright now, from bringing about a balanced budget. It could be done. It \ncould be done very easily. We could vote for it. The President could \nsign it.\n  A balanced budget amendment to the Constitution means that we amend \nthe Constitution for only 18 times since the Bill of Rights. Now, \nthousands of amendments have been proposed to the Constitution during \nthat time. The Senate and the House and the States have been wise \nenough to reject them. Otherwise, had they not, we would have a \nConstitution about 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 times bigger than it is today. We \nwould not have the bulwark of the most powerful nation known in \nhistory. But we also would not have just reflected the passing fancy of \nthe moment, and that is what this is. Not a balanced budget. We can do \nthat. All we need is the courage for it.\n  After watching the Reagan administration and the Bush administration \nand the nearly quadrupling of our national debt as they spoke of having \na balanced budget, two administrations that took all the debt of this \nNation for 200 years and tripled, quadrupled it in a matter of 12 \nyears, all the time talking about the need for a balanced budget, that \nwas the easy way. Talk about it and increase the deficit.\n  What has happened under President Clinton for the first time in my \nlifetime is that the deficit has come down 4 years in a row. It has \nmeant some very tough votes. Members of the House and Senate have lost \ntheir seats in these bodies because of these tough votes. But what they \ndid was the right thing. They left a legacy for their children and \ntheir children's children.\n  Let us stop the sloganeering. Let us talk about the tough votes. As I \nrecall, in the first two efforts, first two successful efforts to bring \ndown the deficit, most of the people now talking about the need for a \nbalanced budget amendment did not even cast a vote to bring it down. \nLet us go for reality, not rhetoric.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Nevada and the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina in the Chamber, and I will yield the floor, \nMadam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I yield whatever time the Senator from \nSouth Carolina consumes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, this crowd on the other side of the \naisle has no shame. Let me make it absolutely clear. They come here and \nuse the floor of the Senate for these demonstrations. What that pile of \nbooks over there on the other side of the aisle says is any time that \nyou can flash on C-SPAN, that side of the aisle is for cutting \nspending, reducing deficits, and balancing the budget, and this side of \nthe aisle is for spending--you know, tax and spend, liberal Democrats.\n\n  Let us find out what the record is. I believe it is too much, but let \nus just say my pile of books is about one-tenth of that pile over \nthere. If you take the average real deficit--and I put a table on \neveryone's desk so you can verify the CBO figures, Madam President--in \nthe 36 years from Harry Truman up until President Reagan--ah, those \nwere a tough 36 years; we had to pay for World War II; we had to pay \nfor Korea; we had to pay for Vietnam; and we had to pay for the Great \nSociety that Lyndon Johnson started. During that 36 years, the actual \naverage of real deficits is $20.41 billion.\n  Now, in the last 16 years, from 1982 to 1997, without the cost of a \nsingle war or the Great Society, the average deficit is $277.58 \nbillion. We have gone from $20 billion deficits with the cost of all \nthe wars to the Republican initiative of growth, growth, growth. My \nfriend, Steve Forbes, is running around again saying, ``Hope, growth \nand opportunity.''\n  What a charade. What a farce. They ought to be ashamed of \nthemselves--the unmitigated gall to put those books up there and try to \ndemonstrate that they are for cutting spending, that those are the \ndeficits that we piled up casually. The truth is we balanced the budget \nunder President Lyndon Baines Johnson, and the reason this growth \nstarted was that silly Reaganomics, which Howard Baker, who sat in that \nchair as the Republican leader, called a riverboat gamble, and which \nthen Vice President George Herbert Walker Bush\n\n[[Page S1505]]\n\ncalled voodoo. But there is no historical memory under these youngsters \nwho come here to the Senate floor and try to demonstrate, with a \npictorial thing here, with a pile of books: Now, we are concerned about \nthese deficits, and the other side does not have any regard for them. \nThey are the ones who caused it.\n  That is the Reagan-Bush memorial deficit pile right there. That is \nwhat it is. In fact, Madam President, you can go back to 1776 and take \n38 Presidents, 205 years of history, the cost of the Revolution and all \nthe other wars, and we never got to a $1 trillion debt. When President \nReagan took over, it was $909 billion, still not a $1 trillion debt. \nNow, under Reagan-Bush, President Reagan and President Bush, they have \ngone to $5.3 trillion. And do not blame President Clinton. Gosh knows, \nhe did not know how to take credit. He went down there to Texas. I \nguess we all make mistakes running for office, but I think he \noverspoke. He said he raised taxes too much. But that did not take away \nfrom my vote.\n  In 1993, we had a budget plan, and the budget plan was to reduce the \ndeficit by $500 billion. It was to raise taxes on gasoline, and, yes, \nSocial Security. And over on that side they said, pointing at us, you \nraise taxes on Social Security, they will be hunting you down like dogs \nin the street and shooting you. They said, ``We are going to have a \nrecession.'' Ah, not even a recession, but a depression. Instead, the \nstock market is going through the roof. Inflation is down, jobs are up, \nand now they want to manufacture a problem.\n  I say that is their problem. We did not get a single Republican vote \nin the Senate, we did not get a single Republican vote in the House of \nRepresentatives to do anything. We passed it by ourselves. And \nPresident William Jefferson Clinton is the only President since Lyndon \nJohnson to reduce the deficit. He spent 10 years as Governor down in \nArkansas, each with a balanced budget.  Then he comes to Washington and \nhe changes the direction of increased deficits. You can see the real \ndeficit under the last year of President Bush exceeded $400 billion. \nMadam President, $400 billion. The exact CBO figure for 1992 was $403.6 \nbillion. That is where the spending comes from. And they get up here \nand put on these silly shows of piling up books and everything else to \nappear on C-SPAN and make the most extravagant statements you have ever \nheard, really totally out of whole cloth.\n\n  Where is the spending? Interestingly, Madam President--and I wish \nsomeone would give my table of spending in real and unified deficits to \nour distinguished Presiding Officer so this can be followed. Madam \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that this table be printed in the \nRecord at this point.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                                    BUDGET REALITIES\n                                                                [In trillions of

the U.S. Government, FY 1998;'' Beginning in 1962 CBO's ``1997 Economic and Budget Outlook.''\n\n\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, if you look back to 1968-69, back when \nwe used to have budgets from July 1 around the clock to June 30. We \nhave changed now the fiscal year, so October 1 is the beginning of the \nfiscal year.\n\n\n[[Page S1506]]\n\nBut under that last year of President Johnson, let us credit him, you \ncan see going right straight across the board we had a surplus of $2.9 \nbillion. Trust funds were only $300 million--but dispel from your mind \nthat President Johnson used trust funds because even using trust funds \nhe would have had a surplus. So, here comes President Lyndon Baines \nJohnson with a surplus that year, and all he had to spend was $16.6 \nbillion on interest costs.\n  Now, Madam President, do you see today's interest costs of $360 \nbillion at the bottom of the page--$360 billion? This is how we have \nincreased spending. The Grace Commission, upon which I served, came to \ntown to do away with waste, fraud, and abuse. The biggest waste is \nspending money for nothing, just for extravagance. The biggest waste is \nthe past profligacy of not paying the bills and actually increasing \nspending on interest payments by some $344 billion during that period \nof time for absolutely nothing.\n  President Clinton is working on it. He has slowed it down. But they \nare the ones who increased it with Reaganomics, ``hope, growth and \nopportunity,'' and television buzz words they can buy up. But let us \nget to the truth. That is why I put this table here, so we can look at \nthe unified deficit, the real deficit, and gross interest, Madam \nPresident, which is forced spending, just like taxes.\n  It is an insidious way to raise taxes. We have $360 billion to be \nexpended this year on interest costs. Because these interest costs \ncontinue to grow, the debt goes up, up and away. This year, it is \nestimated that the debt will go from $5.182 trillion to $5.436 \ntrillion, an increase of $254 billion. So, while we are increasing the \ndebt, we are spending $1 billion a day in interest. In essence, we are \nincreasing taxes $1 billion a day. Because, like taxes, it has to be \npaid. It has to be paid. So the crowd against taxes is insidiously \nincreasing taxes $1 billion a day. That is where the spending is.\n  Let me get back up here where my file is, Madam President, and get to \nthe proposition and join issue, if you please, with the statements made \nby the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, the Senator from \nNew Mexico, Senator Domenici. Again yesterday, and he continues this \nwherever he goes, he referred to the Concord Coalition report as \nevidence that the matter of Social Security, again, was a gimmick, that \nis was just all nonsense.\n  I had hoped we could really avoid that, because I have tried my best \nto counsel the Concord Coalition. To justify the sincerity of my \nremarks, let me go back and show that I am not just saying so today. I \nwill read into the Record part of my letter of August 16, 1996 to the \nConcord Coalition.\n  (Mr. SMITH of Oregon assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this is addressed to the Honorable \nWarren B. Rudman and the Honorable late Paul Tsongas. We lost Paul. I \nhave the greatest respect for these gentlemen. They are the best of the \nbest. I say here in this letter:\n\n       Dear Warren and Paul: You two friends should be ashamed of \n     yourselves. I have just received the Concord Coalition Social \n     Security mailout, and in four pages and in a 13-item \n     questionnaire, there is no mention of the willful bankrupting \n     of the Social Security trust fund in violation of section \n     13301 of the Budget Act. Mind you me, I support such \n     coalition initiatives as the age increase for retirement to \n     help strengthen the trust fund, and I have voted three times, \n     now, for the Danforth-Kerrey recommendations. But back in \n     1983, the Greenspan commission recommended that Social \n     Security be put off budget so that we could take care of the \n     baby boomers through the fiscal year 2056. President Bush \n     signed this provision, making it illegal to borrow from the \n     fund or use Social Security moneys to obscure the size of the \n     deficit. Now we know both the President and the Congress \n     violated this. We know both parties violated this. But if we \n     cannot get the truth out of esteemed colleagues like you two, \n     instead of being fiscally in balance until the year 2029 we \n     will be fiscally bankrupt by the year 2002.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask that my letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                   August 2, 1996.\n     Hon. Warren B. Rudman,\n     Hon. Paul Tsongas,\n     The Concord Coalition, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Warren and Paul: You two friends should be ashamed of \n     yourselves. I have just received The Concord Coalition Social \n     Security mail-out and in four pages and a 13-item \n     questionnaire, there is no mention of the willful bankrupting \n     of the Social Security trust fund in violation of Section \n     13301 of the Budget Act. Mind you me, I support such \n     Coalition initiatives as the age increase for retirement to \n     help strengthen the trust fund and I have voted three times \n     now for the Danforth-Kerry recommendations. But back in 1983, \n     the Greenspan Commission recommended that Social Security be \n     put off-budget so that we could take care of the baby boomers \n     through FY 2056. Responding in interim steps, the Congress \n     did this in 1990 when President Bush signed the provision \n     making it illegal to borrow from the fund or use Social \n     Security monies to obscure the size of the deficit. Now we \n     know both the President and the Congress violated this, we \n     know both parties violated this but if we can't get the truth \n     out of esteemed colleagues like you two, instead of being \n     fiscally in balance until the year 2029, we will have it \n     fiscally bankrupt by the year 2002.\n       At the moment, Social Security is paid for and has a \n     surplus of $531 billion. What is not paid for, what is \n     causing the deficit and debt are the general functions of \n     government such as defense, housing, law enforcement, \n     education, etc. Working against the deficit and debt, the \n     coalition would better gain the public's attention and \n     support on this immediate problem rather than worrying about \n     the next century. In ``Breaking the News,'' James Fallows \n     outlines how the people in a democracy will do the right \n     thing if properly engaged. The reason this cancerous nonsense \n     continues in Washington is that the responsible Rudmans and \n     Tsongases are afraid to tell the people the truth.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Ernest F. Hollings.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I have the greatest respect for our friends there in \nthe Concord Coalition, the former Secretary of Commerce, Secretary Pete \nPeterson--I worked with him way back under the initial days of \nPresident Reagan when I opposed Reaganomics. We got Senator Mathias, \nthe distinguished Republican Senator from Maryland, to go along with \nus. But there were only 11 of us here that were fighting at that \nparticular time against this. What you do is you cut all your revenues \nand the money because, ``The people back home will know better than the \npoliticians in Washington and they will have so much money, there will \nbe so much spending, there will be so much income tax and sales tax \nthat, my heavens, we will have growth and we will grow out of this.''\n  Go ask the mayor of a city to cut his revenues 25 percent. Go ask a \nGovernor to cut his revenues some 25 percent. They work with common \nsense because they cannot print money like us up here in Washington. \nThey have to have a credit rating. They have to be able to keep \ninterest rates down and get the investments in their communities and in \ntheir States. But we come to Washington and lose all common sense. We \nengage in a tremendous charade up here about piling up books, and how \nsincere we are, when we disregard the Greenspan commission and we \ndisregard the law.\n  I have here the report of the National Commission on Social Security \nReform dated January 1983. From that report I read, ``A majority of the \nmembers of the national commission recommends that the operation of \nthese''--these are fancy words, but ``Social Security trust funds''--\nthey use the word ``trust funds,''--this is a study commission--\n``should be removed from the unified budget.''\n  They go right on down, ``The national commission believes the changes \nin the Social Security Program should be made only for programmatic \nreasons and not for the purposes of balancing the budget.''\n  So, pursuant to taking it out of the unified budget and building up \nthe surplus funds, that is how we got the votes. If we had said at that \nparticular time, ``Look, we are going to use this money for foreign \naid, we are going to use this money for welfare, food stamps, anything \nelse of that kind,'' you could not have gotten the votes.\n  We had a horrendous tax increase in 1983, in a conscientious fashion, \nto build up surpluses to the year 2056. I can show you that right here \nin the 75-year period. But don't depend on just what the Senator from \nSouth Carolina says. Let's get back to the vote and the actions at that \ntime of my distinguished colleague, the now chairman of the Budget \nCommittee.\n  At that particular time, the Senator from New Mexico--and I refer now \nto the committee report, Calendar No. 781, Committee on the Budget, \nU.S. Senate, dated July 10, 1990, on page 29.\n\n[[Page S1507]]\n\n I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the additional \nviews of Mr. Domenici.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Additional Views of Mr. Domenici\n\n       It is somewhat ironic that the first legislative mark-up in \n     the 16 year history of the Senate Budget Committee produced a \n     bill that does not do what its authors suggest and, more \n     importantly, weakens the fiscal discipline inherent in the \n     Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget law.\n       I voted for Senator Hollings' proposal because I support \n     the concept of taking Social Security out of the budget \n     deficit calculation. But I cast this vote with reservations.\n       The best way to protect Social Security is to reduce the \n     Federal budget deficit. We need to balance our non-Social \n     Security budget so that the Social Security trust fund \n     surpluses can be invested (by lowering our national debt) \n     instead of used to pay for other Federal operating costs. We \n     could move toward this goal without changing the unified \n     budget, a concept which has served us well for over twenty \n     years now.\n       Changes in our accounting rules without real deficit \n     reduction will not make Social Security more sound. In fact, \n     we could make matters worse by opening up the trust funds to \n     unrestrained spending. Under current law, the trust funds are \n     protected by the budget process. Congress cannot spend the \n     trust fund reserves without new spending cuts or revenue \n     increases in the rest of the budget to meet Gramm-Rudman-\n     Hollings deficit reduction requirements. If we take Social \n     Security out of GRH without any new protection for the trust \n     funds. Congress could spend the reserves without facing new \n     spending cuts or revenue increases in other programs. And if \n     we spend the trust fund reserves today, we will threaten the \n     solvency of the Social Security program, putting at risk the \n     benefits we have promised to today's workers.\n       Of course, I also understand that we might be able to \n     restore some public trust by taking Social Security out of \n     the deficit calculation. Trust that we in Congress are not \n     ``masking the budget deficit'' with Social Security. That is \n     why I believe we should take Social Security out of the \n     deficit, but only if we provide strong protection against \n     spending the trust fund reserves. We need a ``firewall'' \n     around those trust funds to make sure the reserves are there \n     to pay Social Security benefits in the next century. Without \n     a ``firewall'' or the discipline of budget constraints, the \n     trust funds would be unprotected and could be spent on any \n     number of costly programs.\n       Unfortunately, the Hollings bill does not protect Social \n     Security, which is why Senator Nickles and I offered our \n     ``firewall'' amendment, defeated by a vote of 8 to 13. The \n     amendment, drafted over the last six months by myself and \n     Senators Heinz, Rudman, Gramm, and DeConcini, included: a 60 \n     vote point of order against legislation which would reduce \n     the 75 year actuarial balance of the Social Security trust \n     funds; additional Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction \n     requirements in all years in which legislation lowered the \n     Social Security surpluses; and notification to Social \n     Security taxpayer on the Personal Earnings and Benefit \n     Estimate Statements (PEBES) each time Congress lowered the \n     reserves available to pay benefits to future retirees.\n       With just one exception, the other side of the aisle voted \n     against this protection for Social Security beneficiaries.\n       Furthermore, the Hollings bill says nothing about how or \n     when we will achieve balance in the non-Social Security \n     budget. The bill simply takes Social Security out of the \n     deficit calculation. If enacted, the Hollings bill would \n     require $173 billion in deficit reduction in 1991 to meet the \n     statutory GRH target (see attached table). Obviously, that is \n     not going to happen.\n       I believe we need to extend Gramm-Rudman-Hollings to ensure \n     we have the discipline to achieve balance in the non-Social \n     Security portion of the budget. The Budget Summit negotiators \n     are discussing a goal of $450 to $500 billion in deficit \n     reduction over the next five years. Once we reach an \n     agreement, that plan should be the framework for extending \n     the GRH law.\n       I offered a Sense of the Congress amendment during the \n     mark-up expressing this view. I offered this to put the \n     Hollings bill in some context.\n       But the Democratic members of the Committee refused to \n     consider even an amendment acknowledging the facts about our \n     budget situation, rejecting my proposal by another 8 to 13 \n     vote. In fact, the Chairman indicated that there was some \n     concern on his side of the aisle about extending the Gramm-\n     Rudman-Hollings discipline. One might infer that, for some, \n     this mark-up was really an effort to kill Gramm-Rudman-\n     Hollings.\n       I am not sure what we accomplished in reporting out a bill \n     with no protection for Social Security and with no suggestion \n     of what we think should happen regarding the deficit targets. \n     I, for one, do not want to do anything which could endanger \n     Social Security or Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget discipline. \n     At a minimum, I will offer the ``firewall'' amendment to \n     protect Social Security should the reported bill be \n     considered by the full Senate.\n                                                 Pete V. Domenici.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I moved at that particular time that we \ncomply with the Greenspan commission and we put Social Security off \nbudget, out of the unified deficit, so we could build up these \nsurpluses so that the baby boomers and the next generation could be \nsure of receiving their money. We have lost trust in Government with \nthe present activity. But here is what the distinguished chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, stated at that time:\n\n       I voted for Senator Hollings' proposal because I support \n     the concept of taking Social Security out of the budget \n     deficit calculation.\n\n  I am going to read that again. Here is what the gentleman calls \ngimmick, here is what the gentleman called nonsense when referring to \nthe Concord coalition's report yesterday.\n  Senator Domenici:\n\n       I voted for Senator Hollings' proposal because I support \n     the concept of taking Social Security out of the budget \n     deficit calculation.\n\n  Then reading further:\n\n       But I cast this vote with reservations.\n\n  He says about my particular amendment:\n\n       Unfortunately, the Hollings bill does not protect Social \n     Security sufficiently.\n\n  He says further:\n\n       That's why Senator Nickles and I offered our firewall \n     amendment. This amendment, drafted over the last 6 months by \n     myself, Senator Heinz, Senator Rudman, Senator Gramm and \n     Senator DeConcini, included a 60-vote point of order against \n     legislation which would reduce the 75-year actuarial balance \n     of the Social Security trust fund.\n\n  There is the Concord coalition, the president, the former Senator \nWarren Rudman, the best of the best, saying, ``Fine, I'm voting for the \nHollings amendment to put Social Security off budget, make it a trust \nfund, build up the surpluses so that the younger generation, who is \nworking and paying their taxes, knows the money is not being frittered \naway by an irresponsible Congress.'' And we are going to go even \nfurther. We are going to say you have to get a 60-vote majority in \norder to reduce the 75-year actuarial balance.\n  Now, they knew at that particular time it was going to be for 75 \nyears, and here is the committee vote on July 10, 20 to 1. The one \nSenator voting against it at that time was our distinguished colleague \nfrom Texas, Senator Gramm.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the vote \nrecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Hollings Motion To Report the Social Security Preservation Act\n\n       The Committee agreed to the Hollings motion to report the \n     Social Security Preservation Act by a vote of 20 yeas to 1 \n     nay.\n       Yeas: Mr. Sasser, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Johnston, Mr. Riegle, \n     Mr. Exon, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Simon, Mr. Sanford, Mr. Wirth, \n     Mr. Fowler, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Robb, Mr. Domenici, Mr. \n     Boschwitz, Mr. Symms, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Kasten, Mr. Nickles, \n     Mr. Bond.\n       Nays: Mr. Gramm.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, that was before the Budget Committee. \nAgain, on the Hollings-Heinz amendment, I got together with my good \nfriend, the late Senator John Heinz, and we worked in a bipartisan \nfashion, and we got an overwhelming bipartisan vote--98 Senators out of \nthe 100. We missed two of them, Senator Armstrong and Senator Wallop. \nBut we got 98 Senators, and any Senator, Republican or Democrat, who \nwas a Member of this body back in 1990 who votes for the proposed \nSenate Joint Resolution 1 that would eviscerate the Social Security \ntrust fund, that would turn the trust fund into a slush fund, \nconstitutionally, is breaching the trust that he voted for on October \n18, 1990 at 4:41.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record that vote \nrecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Hollings--Heinz, et al., Amendment Which Excludes the Social Security \n Trust Funds From the Budget Deficit Calculation, Beginning in Fiscal \n                               Year 1991.\n\n\n                               YEAS (98)\n\n       Democrats: Adams, Akaka, Baucus, Bentsen, Biden, Bingaman, \n     Boren, Bradley, Breaux, Bryan, Bumpers, Burdick, Byrd, \n     Conrad, Cranston, Daschle, DeConcini, Dixon, Dodd, Exon, \n     Ford, Fowler, Glenn, Gore, Graham, Harkin, Heflin, Hollings, \n     Inouye, Johnston, Kennedy, Kerrey, Kerry, Kohl, Lautenberg, \n     Leahy, Levin, Lieberman, Metzenbaum, Mikulski, Mitchell, \n     Moynihan, Nunn, Pell, Pryor, Reid, Riegle, Robb, Rockefeller, \n     Sanford, Sarbanes, Sasser, Shelby, Simon, Wirth.\n\n[[Page S1508]]\n\n       Republicans: Bond, Boschwitz, Burns, Chafee, Coats, \n     Cochran, Cohen, D'Amato, Danforth, Dole, Domenici, \n     Durenberger, Garn, Gorton, Gramm, Grassley, Hatch, Hatfield, \n     Heinz, Helms, Humphrey, Jeffords, Kassebaum, Kasten, Lott, \n     Lugar, Mack, McCain, McClure, McConnell, Murkowski, Nickles, \n     Packwood, Pressler, Roth, Rudman, Simpson, Specter, Stevens, \n     Symms, Thurmond, Warner, Wilson.\n\n\n                                NAYS (2)\n\n       Democrats: None.\n       Republicans: Armstrong, Wallop.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, here is the former law, section 13301, \noff-budget status of the Social Security trust fund. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have that statute printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Subtitle C--Social Security\n\n     SEC. 13301. OFF-BUDGET STATUS OF OASDI TRUST FUNDS.\n\n       (a) Exclusion of Social Security From All budgets.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the receipts and \n     disbursements of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance \n     Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund \n     shall not be counted as new budget authority, outlays, \n     receipts, or deficit or surplus for purposes of--\n       (1) the budget of the United States Government as submitted \n     by the President,\n       (2) the congressional budget, or\n       (3) the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act \n     of 1985.\n       (b) Exclusion of Social Security From Congressional \n     Budget.--Section 301(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n     1974 is amended by adding at the end the following: ``The \n     concurrent resolution shall not include the outlays and \n     revenue totals of the old age, survivors, and disability \n     insurance program established under title II of the Social \n     Security Act or the related provisions of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 in the surplus or deficit totals \n     required by this subsection or in any other surplus or \n     deficit totals required by this title.''.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, now we have a complete picture. They are \nrunning around here with demonstrations, with piles of books and their \npile of books is the quintupling of the national debt under their \nparticular leadership and trust, the 12 years really of Reagan-Bush, \nbecause we have reduced the deficit since then under President Clinton. \nHere is one-tenth that amount for the 205 years of our history, and \nthey have the unmitigated gall to come here and continue with that \ndemonstration. It is the Reagan-Bush memorial deficit pile. They are \nthe ones who ran up the national debt. They are the ones who quintupled \nthe national debt, and we are fighting in order to protect the Social \nSecurity trust fund.\n  I could go into other reports, but I have received a note from my \ndistinguished leader, Harry Reid, of Searchlight, NV. What we are going \nto do is have a vote for the balanced budget amendment. I have \ncosponsored one. I have been working in the vineyards for years. I \nbalanced the budget back in the fifties in the State of South Carolina \nand got for the first time in its history a triple A credit rating. I \nwas the first State from Texas up to Maryland to ever receive that from \nMoody's and Standard & Poor's.\n  I voted for a balanced budget. I worked with George Mahon in 1968. I \nworked in a bipartisan fashion with Senators Gramm and Rudman in the \nmideighties to cut deficits, and I am willing to work with them anytime \nanywhere. This is not a partisan fight. This is a bipartisan fight to \nkeep the trust. The distinguished Senator from Nevada will have a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution that we can support that \nwill protect Social Security, and I intend to vote for it. But I am not \nvoting, Mr. President, to breach the trust to vote against my own bill \nthat I worked so hard for that we got President Bush to sign into law.\n  Mr. President, here is what really happens. Here is the President's \nbudget, and on page 2--literally on page 2--you will find that in the \nyear 2002, we have a surplus of $17 billion. But if you turn--this is \nthe gamesmanship on both sides, both in the White House and the \nCongress--but if you turn to page 331, you find a deficit in 2002 of \n$167.3 billion. Why do we have to borrow $167.3 billion? That is \nbecause we increase the debt that amount, and we are going to have to \ngo out and borrow to pay the interest costs. That is the real deficit. \nIt is not a $17 billion surplus.\n  If you don't protect Social Security, then I come as a budgeteer and \nsay, ``Now, wait a minute, the other side is going to have $543 \nbillion,'' which is how much they will have borrowed from Social \nSecurity under this particular budget that we are discussing. If they \nare going to use $543 billion, some will want to use it on defense, \nsome will want to use it on education, and some will want to use it on \nhighways. If they are going to use and spend the money, I might as well \nget my projects in there. That is wherein the discipline breaks. If you \nare going to use Social Security and turn it from a trust fund into a \nslush fund, you do not have the discipline.\n\n  Again, Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague for yielding \nthe floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, could I inquire as to how much time is \nleft?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 65 minutes, and \nthe Senator from Nevada has 8 minutes and 34 seconds.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. It is my understanding, Mr. President, the Senator from \nNevada has one additional speaker who will not be coming for a bit. I \nthink what we will do is the following: I will speak briefly in \nresponse to the last comments that were made, and I believe the Senator \nfrom Maine wishes to speak, and then we have some additional speakers \nwho will be here, I am told, around 11:30. We will proceed and try to \nreduce the discrepancies in time between the two sides.\n  I want to focus this discussion on the amendment before the Senate, \nbut I cannot ignore some of the comments that were made by the previous \nspeaker, the Senator from South Carolina, who was pointing to these \nbudgets and somehow reaching a conclusion based on his experience, that \nthese budgets that are not in balance somehow are primarily the \nresponsibility of Republican Presidents.\n  Mr. President, I was not here during all these Congresses. In fact, \nthe last budget is the only one where I was present. The Senator from \nSouth Carolina was here during all these Congresses when these deficits \nwere accumulated, and I think he knows, as we all know, that the \nCongress of the United States, specifically the House of \nRepresentatives, during this period of time was controlled by the \nDemocratic Party. And, as we all know, all spending bills are required, \nby the Constitution, to originate in the House.\n  This is not a case of trying to blame each side. We are here today \ntrying to solve a problem. Indeed, it may be that a lot of the spending \nthat took place was during the 1980's, but the problems were created \nduring the 1960's. The spending kept escalating because the programs \nwere established in a way so that there was no choice but to see the \nspending programs increased. I do not believe there were a lot of calls \nfor pulling in that spending from either side, but particularly from \nthe Democratic side.\n  The other thing I wish to comment on is the issue of what took place \nin the 1980's, and the implication has been frequently made here on the \nfloor that somehow the deficits were created because tax revenues to \nthe Federal Government were starved because we let more people keep \nmore of what they earned during the 1980's. It is true, Mr. President, \nthat tax rates were reduced in the early 1980's. It is also true that \nafter those tax cuts, the economy soared in ways that we could only \nhope to see continue into the future. It is also the case, Mr. \nPresident, that revenues to the Federal Government from the income \ntaxes and other taxes increased dramatically during the 1980's, as \nwell, increased substantially beyond what had been the case in the \nbeginning of that decade.\n  What increased faster than tax revenues to Washington and what \nresulted in the deficits that we saw was Federal spending. Federal \nspending increased, I believe, something in the vicinity of 69 percent. \nIt was not one party's fault. It was not one part of the Government. It \nwas across the board. Whether it was\n\n[[Page S1509]]\n\ndefense spending, discretionary domestic spending, or spending on \nmandatory entitlement programs, spending went up faster than tax \nrevenues to Washington went up.\n  So the problem in the 1980's wasn't that we let people keep more of \nwhat they earned and somehow punished Washington; it is that we could \nnot tighten the belt at the Federal level, reduce the growth of Federal \nspending in order to keep the deficits under control. We all are \nsuffering today, as I said in my initial comments. The people suffering \nthe most are families who are paying higher interest rates because of \nthis deficit--2 percent higher rates--which produces higher prices, \nhigher costs to finance the purchase of a new home or a new car, to \nfinance student loans. Wage earners and those who create jobs suffer \nbecause of the higher interest rates and crowding out of markets. The \nFederal Government needs to borrow more. The children suffer because, \nto the extent that this debt falls on the responsibility of children in \nAmerica and will continue to fall on them, much more of their working \nlives will be committed to paying taxes to finance just the interest on \nthis deficit.\n  So, Mr. President, we have to address the problem now. We can't, \ntoday, get into exclusively a question of who is in charge of the \nCongress and who was the President during all these deficits. The \nvisual we have today for the American people to see is the fact that, \nwithout a constitutional amendment, for nearly 30 years we have not \nbeen able to balance the budget. In fact, you can go all the way back \nto 1960 before you find a budget that was balanced without using the \nSocial Security surplus. That is what we ought to address, and that is \nwhat I hope to see us accomplish today.\n  So, as I said earlier, there are a lot of issues involved in the \namendment before us. I have raised questions as to how it could \npossibly be financed because, as I said, without, to my knowledge, any \nspecific additional protections of the benefits of Social Security from \nthe amendment, we will add a burden of some $706 billion between 2002 \nand 2007, a burden of either additional taxes or reductions in spending \non programs like education and law enforcement, which will have to be \nmet to effectuate this amendment. I have not heard from any side a \nproposal to deal with that $706 billion. I don't believe it is going to \nbe feasible because I don't think we are going to see an alternative \nproposal today. And because of the absence of that alternative, I \ncannot support this amendment. I know other Senators here wish to \nspeak. So, at this time, I yield to the Senator from Maine such time as \nshe may need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine [Ms. Snowe], is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I think that it is interesting to hear the \ndebate that has been underway this morning with respect to the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. Frankly, this is \nprobably--and is in many instances--the same debate we have had over \nand over and over again on this issue. I served 16 years in the House \nof Representatives, and we debated this issue. We debated this issue 2 \nyears ago here in the U.S. Senate and lost by one vote, regrettably. \nBut we hear the same arguments over and over again. I have been in \nCongress now for a total of 19 years, in both the House and Senate. We \nhave debated this issue approximately eight times. What we have heard \ntime and time again is, if we only had the will, or the courage, we \nwould not need a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, that \nwe should, as an institution, collectively be able to balance the \nbudget without a constitutional requirement. Even the President stated \nthat fact in his State of the Union Address to the Congress on February \n4. He said, ``Rewriting the Constitution isn't necessary to balance the \nbudget. All we need is your vote and my signature.''\n\n  Well, the fact of the matter is, he got our vote in the bill, which \nwas a balanced budget submitted to the President, but we didn't get the \nPresident's signature. That's the problem. We don't have a \nconstitutional requirement because there will always be a reason or an \nexcuse as to why we can't balance the budget. Governors can't evade \nthat constitutional requirement. Most Governors in this country today \nare required by their own constitutions, and they don't avoid that \nresponsibility. The problem here is, there is a significant amount of \navoidance because there is not an institutional will, or discipline, to \nbalance the budget because it's difficult to make choices.\n  So no one is willing to set any priorities. If we don't have a \nconstitutional amendment, we are not required to establish these \npriorities and we are not willing to exhibit leadership on our own \ninitiative. So Congress has had decades and decades of good intentions. \nHistory is replete with good intentions on imposing fiscal discipline. \nBut we have failed in achieving a balanced budget.\n  Now, we have heard a lot of discussion today about the past. We heard \nabout the last 15 years. They talked about the Reagan Presidency and \nthe Bush Presidency. But what was omitted from that discussion was the \nfact that we also had a Congress, and it happened to be a Democratic \nCongress. Now, does anyone happen to believe that these budgets that \nare down here, which are unbalanced, didn't have the support of the \nDemocratic Congress? I think we all know the answer to that question. \nCongress played a very significant role in the adoption of the budget. \nThere is blame to go around on both sides. I think we all recognize \nthat. But to sit here and say that blame for the last 15 years of \nbudget deficits can be placed on the Reagan and Bush Presidencies \nclearly is ignoring reality, because that is not what happened.\n  In fact, I can recall back in the early eighties--in fact, I think it \nwas 1983--there was an agreement between President Reagan and the \nCongress that for every dollar increase in taxes, there would be a $3 \nreduction in spending. Guess what? We got the dollar increase in taxes, \nbut we didn't get the $3 reduction in spending.\n  I should also say that there was a budget agreement in 1990 that \ncertainly contributed to the declining deficits that we are \nexperiencing right now, and everybody is referring to the Clinton \nadministration and declining deficits. But what's ironic about those \ndeclining deficits--and we know there are serious problems beyond the \nturn of the century, but for now the deficits are declining compared to \nprevious years--in talking about those declining deficits, the other \nside fails to mention that they also include the Social Security trust \nfund surpluses. So they want to sort of have it both ways. Look, the \ndeficits are coming down. Yet, they do include the Social Security \ntrust fund. If we are going to talk about honesty in budgeting, they \nought to exclude them to show what the real deficit is.\n  Every President has used the Social Security trust fund surpluses. \nThere is no question that we have a serious problem beyond the turn of \nthe century when we have the beginning of the baby boomers retiring. We \nhave had an obligation, as we have always shown, since the inception of \nthe Social Security trust funds, to pay those benefits to \nbeneficiaries. That has been and will always be a sacred trust between \nthe Government and the American people.\n  We want to preserve and protect the Social Security trust fund. What \nis the best way to do it? It is to balance the budget so that we can \nrein in spending, so that we will be in a position to pay out the baby \nboomers' retirement. And that is the issue that is confronting us. If \nwe rein in the debt, we have a better ability to preserve and protect \nthe Social Security trust fund.\n  I find it interesting that the debate today has centered around the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget, not passing the \nstraight face test, because it includes the trust funds of Social \nSecurity. What I find interesting about the amendment that has been \noffered by the Senator from Nevada is that it doesn't take off budget \nall the other trust funds--the highway trust fund, the aviation trust \nfund, and the numerous other trust funds that represent billions of \ndollars. If we are going to talk about honesty in budgeting, they don't \ninclude that. In fact, here we have an enormous list of trust funds. If \nwe are talking about truth in budgeting, then we are talking about many \nother trust funds as well.\n  The point is that the best way to preserve the Social Security trust \nfund is to balance the budget. The best way to protect the Social \nSecurity beneficiary\n\n[[Page S1510]]\n\npayment checks is to keep it on budget, because that is the system that \nwe have known. We have known how that system has worked. We have paid \nthe benefits, and when there has been a problem with Social Security, \nwe have addressed it, as was the case in 1983 with the bipartisan \ncommission. But no one has told us on the other side exactly how this \ntrust fund off budget is going to work. We have had no indication of \nwhat exactly is going to happen with those surpluses. Will they \ncontinue to be invested in Government bonds as they are today to pay \noff the debt and to write off the deficit, or are they going to be \ninvested in private securities? Because that is also an issue.\n  It raises a concern for me because I am now asking the question: If \nyou place the Social Security trust fund off budget, what exactly is \ngoing to happen to those surpluses? In what way are they going to be \nused? Are they going to be privatized? I think that is an issue and a \nconsequence that should be addressed, because that does raise some \nsignificant concerns. Will they be placed in noninterest-bearing \naccounts because we cannot buy Government bonds? If the other side \nsays, ``Yes, we are going to buy Government bonds with it,'' that is \nexactly what we are doing right now. That is precisely the point.\n  So, then, the amendment really isn't changing what we are doing right \nnow. So essentially the amendment places us full circle in terms of \nwhat we are doing with the Social Security trust fund surplus. Because \nI have not heard how the surpluses are going to be used off budget. How \nare they going to be invested? That is a significant question.\n  Two years ago when we had this debate on the constitutional \namendment, there was a right-to-know amendment that was offered by the \nDemocratic leader that would have required that Congress provide a \ndetailed budget plan with binding reconciliation instructions before \nthe amendment could even be sent to the States for ratification. And \nthe intent of that amendment was essentially to say that Congress has a \nright to know how the budget is going to be balanced if this \nconstitutional amendment were to pass and were to be ratified by the \nStates. I think it is an interesting concept.\n  We did present a balanced budget to the President, as I mentioned \nearlier. But it was vetoed. The fact is, we have a right to know, as \nwas mentioned earlier by the Senator from Michigan, about exactly how \nwe would accommodate the $295 billion in cuts that would be required in \naddition to the cuts that would be required in the balanced budget \namendment. But $295 billion would have to be cut if we didn't take into \naccount the surpluses in the Social Security trust fund just between \nnow and the year 2002. But no one on the other side has identified \nexactly how we achieve that goal. That is double the amount of cuts \nthat President Clinton submitted in his plan to the Congress that he \ndeclared to be balanced. So there would be $295 billion in cuts over \nand above the cuts that will be required as well to balance the budget \nif we could not use the surpluses.\n  Then the period between the year 2002 and 2007 would require the \nCongress to come up with an additional $706 billion. And, again, we \nhave not heard from the other side exactly how that would be achieved \nbecause that would be over and above what we would be required to do in \norder to balance the budget without the surpluses.\n  So we are talking close to $1 trillion--more than $1 trillion--in \nadditional cuts that will be required by Congress over and above what \nwe have presented. These are difficult choices and difficult times. So \nwe have to account for $1 trillion more. And we have yet to hear how \nthat will be accomplished. We have not seen a detailed plan, and we \nhave a right to know, as the other side declared 2 years ago in \nsuggesting that they had the right to know what would be the detailed \nbalanced budget plan to balance the budget if we were to pass a \nconstitutional amendment. They demanded a right to know. We demand a \nright to know because many have said on the other side that if we pass \nthe Reid amendment, we can vote for the constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget. But we need to know. What is their plan for coming \nup with $1 trillion in additional cuts? One trillion dollars is a \nsignificant amount over and above what we have already proposed to do. \nBut we have yet to hear the details.\n\n  I think, frankly, since they insisted 2 years ago that we apply the \nstandard of right to know, that we should apply the same standard to \nthe Reid amendment today that we have a right to know, because to do \notherwise, I think, is failing to meet their responsibility in meeting \nthe standard of honesty in budgeting. The American people have a right \nto know exactly how that will be accommodated.\n  We have known that when the Social Security trust fund has been on \nbudget that we have met our obligations, and we will continue to meet \nour obligations. We also know that by balancing the budget, it will \nconstantly make us aware of our obligation to the Social Security trust \nfund in what we can anticipate beyond the turn of the century in more \npeople beginning to retire and with the onset of the baby-boomer \nretirements. We think that it is important to stay with the system that \nhas worked since the inception of the Social Security system. But with \nthe Reid amendment, we are being asked to act in blind faith.\n  The Social Security trust fund, as we know it, has had proven \nsuccess. But they have failed to answer the question of what occurs \nwhen this trust fund is off budget. What happens to the trust fund? \nWhat happens to the surpluses? We have not heard those questions \nanswered. And how will those trust funds be used?\n\n  So I think that these are some serious questions that need to be \naddressed and have certainly broad implications because we certainly \nshould worry that these questions remain unanswered. We understand the \ntrust fund within the context of the budget that we know. We have \nalways met our obligations under the trust fund, and we will continue \nto meet our obligations under the trust fund. But we need to hear from \nthe proponents of the Reid amendment exactly what is going to happen \nwith this trust fund off budget. Will the surpluses be diverted for \nother purposes? That is a possibility. The amendment is poorly drafted. \nWill the surpluses be invested in private securities? It is a major \nproblem. It may have major consequences. That has yet to be thoroughly \nexplored. Will they be invested in Government bonds? That is exactly \nwhat is happening here today.\n  So then I think one could conclude that really this is not \nnecessarily changing what we do today but just making a political point \nbecause, unfortunately, there are those who are not committed to a \nconstitutional amendment and do not want to see the reality of such an \namendment because of what it would require of this Congress and a \nPresident to make certain decisions in reaching a balanced budget.\n  So I hope that in the course of this debate we will hear some of the \nanswers to these questions because I certainly am troubled by the \nprospects of some of the issues that this amendment raises.\n  I am a strong supporter of the Social Security system. I want a \nstrong system. We have known how it has worked on budget, but we have \nnot heard the questions answered about how it is going to work off \nbudget, and I repeat that because that in the final analysis I think \nunderscores the issues before us today. I think it unfortunate that the \nSocial Security issue has been used so many times in the past as a \npolitical issue. And from this debate at times we would know there are \nstrong supporters of the Social Security trust fund on this side. I \nhave been a very strong supporter over the years, and I just want to \nassure senior citizens in America that we will continue to preserve and \nprotect them, and the best way to do it is to contain Federal spending \nand reduce the interest rates in America so that we can prepare \nourselves for the commitments we must make in the 21st century to the \nyounger generations as well as to retirees.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. I would like to yield 15 minutes to my friend from \nCalifornia, but I do not have 15 minutes. I am wondering if my friend, \nthe manager of the bill, could spare me 7 minutes out of their time?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, let me, if I could, consult in terms of \nother speakers coming down here.\n\n[[Page S1511]]\n\n  Mr. REID. In the meantime, I will have her go ahead.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Yes. I have been told we have some other people who have \nindicated they are coming, and I would like to find out if that is true \nbefore I relinquish any other time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield such time as I have remaining to the \nSenator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the distinguished Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the Reid amendment to the \nmajority resolution to provide a balanced budget constitutional \namendment.\n  As everyone in this body knows, the Reid amendment would exclude \nSocial Security trust funds from the balancing requirement of the \nproposed constitutional amendment. This exclusion is the only matter in \nwhich the Reid amendment differs from the majority's balanced budget \namendment. I think the amendment addresses a fundamental question to \nall of us who are in this body: Will we accept the responsibility to \nbring the Federal budget in balance without placing at risk the funds \nour constituents depend on for their retirement?\n  It must be remembered that every American worker pays 6.2 percent of \ntheir paycheck, matched by 6.2 percent from the employer, for a total \n12.4 percent, which is paid into Social Security for their retirement.\n  What has happened is that the Social Security trust fund has been \nincorporated as part of the unified budget. Therefore, those moneys \nactually go into balancing the budget, and the majority amendment would \nfreeze this practice into the Constitution for all time--for all time--\nso that forever Social Security trust funds are used to pay the salary \nof a clerk or a lawyer or build a highway or buy a battleship or do any \nnumber of the myriad of things the Federal Government does through its \noperating budget. I believe that this is the soft underbelly of this \nconstitutional amendment. This is the Achilles heel. Even if this \namendment passes both of these bodies, I do not for a minute believe \nthat three-quarters of the people of each legislature in our 50 States \nwill ratify this amendment.\n  This morning we had signatures from 890,000 Social Security \nrecipients, urging our opposition to any balanced budget amendment \nwhich does not protect Social Security. Those signatures represent just \nthe current recipients today. People like my daughter, who is in her \nmidthirties, is working and providing that money said to me, ``Mother, \nyou know that isn't going to be there when I retire. Why don't you just \nlet me have the money now. There are better things I can do with it. I \ncould use it right now.''\n  Social Security is a sacred trust with the public.\n  If I may, let me make the picture for not enshrining it into the \nConstitution with this chart.\n  What this chart does is show the amount of Social Security surplus--\nthat is all of this--that goes into balancing the budget. Up to 2002 it \nis in the vicinity of $500 billion.\n  By 2013, it is $2 trillion that is utilized cumulatively to balance \nthe budget. From 2002 to 2019, the amount that Senate Joint Resolution \n1 takes from the trust fund to balance the budget is $1.8 trillion.\n  Now, what happens after the year around 2019 when the surplus begins \nto fall? When Social Security revenue drops below Social Security \noutlays to beneficiaries, according to the Congressional Research \nService report, that is when this body will have to raise taxes or cut \nSocial Security payments or cut some other Federal programs and find \nsome way to balance the budget.\n\n  Under the majority's proposed constitutional amendment, outlays must \nmatch revenue in the fiscal year. If Social Security revenue falls, the \nrevenue needs to be made up through higher taxes or we have to cut \nspending through reduced Social Security payments or spending \nreductions elsewhere in the budget.\n  The majority's amendment is unfair because it enshrines in the \nConstitution, the principle that Social Security receipts and Social \nSecurity payments to beneficiaries are at risk. Because, at some point \nalong the way, push is going to come to shove, expenditures are going \nto exceed outlays, and then there is going to be a problem.\n  There are some in this body who will say, ``Well, that forces us to \nreform Social Security.'' That may be and it may not be, I don't know. \nBut it is not the right thing to do.\n  In 1990, adopting the Hollings amendment, which Senator Hollings has \nso eloquently described, this body said we are not going to include \nSocial Security as part of the unified budget anymore. The votes were \nvirtually unanimous. Yet, voila, the Federal Government continues to \ninclude Social Security as part of the unified budget. I think that is \nwrong. That is the soft underbelly, that is the Achilles heel. It is \njust plain wrong.\n  I support the Reid amendment. The Reid amendment's only difference \nfrom the majority resolution is the exclusion of Social Security from \nthe balancing requirement.\n  In the event that the Reid amendment is not successful, tomorrow \nmorning I will propose another version, along with Senators Cleland, \nTorricelli, and Durbin. This amendment would say: All right, we lost in \nour effort to take Social Security out of the balancing requirement for \nthe very reason that it is too difficult to achieve balance. We all \nadmit that, that there needs to be some time to adjust to the removal \nof Social Security from the unified budget. So I will propose an \namendment which essentially would do the following. It would say that \nSocial Security will be used up to the year 2002. After the year 2002, \nwhen balance is achieved, Social Security will be withdrawn from the \nunified budget and, therefore, $1.8 trillion will be preserved for \nretirees. The integrity will be saved. It will not be an IOU. It will \nbe saved. Additionally, my amendment would change extending the debt \nlimit from the three-fifths requirement of the majority balanced budget \namendment to a constitutional majority of both bodies. It would also \nprovide an exception for an economic emergency, and that way the \nstabilizers can function, and it would also clarify that the amendment \nwill not prohibit the enactment of a capital budget as well.\n  So, I believe that, in the year 2002, Congress would have the \nopportunity to develop a capital budget. At 2 percent of GDP, that \ncapital budget would be around $160 billion a year. We utilize about \n$140 billion a year now, so it would make some sense and it would fill \nthe gap.\n  If there is an interest in having a balanced budget amendment, this \nmight be a way of going about it and correcting some of the problems. \nThe Reid amendment, which I have voted for in past years, indicates \nthat the enshrinement of Social Security into the Constitution of the \nUnited States is not something that this body is going to do. We are \nnot going to take those trust funds and use them to buy battleships or \nprovide park services or pay the salaries of 96,000 workers at the \nDepartment of Justice, or to provide anything else. It will be invested \nas trust funds, as it should be, separate and discrete and held for the \nretirement of every person who pays that FICA tax every year.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, may I ask to spend a few minutes as in morning \nbusiness to introduce a matter?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I think we would be in a position, until \nthe hour of 12 noon, to grant that request.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the manager of the bill for the majority \nvery graciously extended additional time, if Senator Feinstein needed \nthat time. It was not necessary that she use that time. So, if she goes \ninto morning business that will be charged not against either one of \nus, is that right?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. What I propose is that Senator Feinstein have up to 12 \nnoon to finish her statement or add whatever she would like. I believe \nwe will have another speaker or speakers here by then, and I have \nadditional comments to fill the remainder of our time between what \nwould then be 12 and 12:30. As I understand it, we have 30 minutes, \napproximately, left then?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 12 noon the Senator would have 30 minutes, \nyes.\n  Mr. REID. I will say, Mr. President, I would not be in debt to the \nmajority for any time, 2:30, 2:40, whatever it is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n[[Page S1512]]\n\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from California.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/25/senate-section/article/S1495-4", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DENY CERTIFICATION TO MEXICO\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to read into the Record a \nletter that I have just sent to the President of the United States, \nurging decertification of Mexico:\n\n       Dear Mr. President: I am writing to urge you to deny \n     certification that Mexico has taken sufficient actions to \n     combat international narcotics trafficking when you report to \n     Congress on the anti-narcotics efforts of major drug \n     producing and drug-transit countries. I believe a reasonable \n     examination of the facts leads to no other decision.\n       Last year at this time, Senator D'Amato and I compiled a \n     list of actions we considered it necessary for the Mexican \n     government to take to beef up their anti-narcotics efforts. \n     This list is attached. Regrettably, I have concluded that \n     there has been insufficient progress, or no progress, on \n     nearly all of the items on this list. Some of these failures \n     are due to inability; others are due to a lack of political \n     will. But all have set back the urgent effort to end the \n     plague of drugs on our streets.\n       I want to bring to your attention a number of the most \n     significant examples of Mexico's inability and unwillingness \n     to deal with the drug trafficking problem effectively:\n       Cartels: There has been little or no effective action taken \n     against the major drug cartels. The two most powerful--the \n     Juarez Cartel run by Amado Carillo Fuentes, and the Tijuana \n     Cartel, run by the Arellano Felix brothers--have hardly been \n     touched by Mexican law enforcement. Those who have been \n     arrested, such as Hector Palma, are given light sentences and \n     allowed to continue to conduct business from jail. As DEA \n     Administrator Constantine says, ``The Mexicans are now the \n     single most powerful trafficking groups''--worse than the \n     Colombian cartels.\n       Money Laundering: Last year, the Mexican parliament passed \n     criminal money laundering laws for the first time, but the \n     new laws are incomplete and have not yet been properly \n     implemented. These laws do not require banks to report large \n     and suspicious currency transactions, or threaten the \n     banks with sanctions if they fail to comply. Promises to \n     enact such regulations--which prosecutors need to identify \n     money-launderers--have so far gone unfulfilled. Mexican \n     officials said that such regulations would be developed by \n     January, but they were not produced. To my knowledge, not \n     a single Mexican bank or exchange house has been forced to \n     change its operations.\n       Law Enforcement: While there have been increases in the \n     amounts of heroin and marijuana seized by Mexican \n     authorities, cocaine seizures remain low. Although slightly \n     higher than last year's figures, the 23.6 metric tons seized \n     in 1996 is barely half of what was seized in 1993. A modest \n     increase in drug-related arrests brought the total to 11,245 \n     in 1996--less than half of the 1992 figure.\n       Cooperation with U.S. Law Enforcement: Our own drug \n     enforcement agents report that the situation on the border \n     has never been worse. Last month, the Mexican government \n     forbade U.S. agents to carry weapons on the Mexican side of \n     the border, putting their lives in grave danger. Recent news \n     reports indicate that death threats against U.S. narcotics \n     agents on the border have quadrupled in the past three \n     months. Some U.S. agents believe that all their cooperative \n     efforts are undone almost instantly by the corrupt Mexican \n     agents with whom they work.\n       Extraditions: Despite the fact that the United States has \n     52 outstanding extradition request on drug-related charges, \n     not a single Mexican national has ever been extradited to the \n     United States on such charges.\n       Corruption: Mexico's counternarcotics effort is plagued by \n     corruption in the government and the national police. Among \n     the evidence are the eight Mexican prosecutors and law \n     enforcement officials who have been murdered in Tijuana in \n     recent months. There has been considerable hope that the \n     Mexican armed forces would be able to take a more active role \n     in the counternarcotics effort without the taint of \n     corruption. But the revelation that Gen. Jesus Gutierrez \n     Rebollo, Mexico's top counternarcotics official and a 42-year \n     veteran of the armed forces, had accepted bribes from the \n     Carillo Fuentes cartel, casts grave doubts upon that hope.\n       Recent news reports indicate that U.S. law enforcement \n     officials suspect judges, prosecutors, Transportation \n     Ministry officials, and Naval officers of corruption, and \n     there is persuasive evidence that two Mexican Governors--\n     Manlio Fabio Beltrones Rivera of Sonora and Jorge Carillo \n     Olea--are actively facilitating the work of drug traffickers \n     in their respective states. The National Autonomous \n     University of Mexico estimates that the drug lords spend \n     $500 million each year to bribe Mexican officials at all \n     levels, and many consider that figure to be a gross under-\n     estimation.\n       Mr. President, I believe the evidence is overwhelming and \n     can lead to no decision other than the decertification of \n     Mexico. It would send a strong signal to Mexico and the world \n     that the United States will not tolerate lack of cooperation \n     in the fight against narcotics, even from our close friends \n     and allies. Accordingly, I urge you to establish a clear set \n     of benchmarks by which you will judge if and when to \n     recertify Mexico for counternarcotics cooperation. These \n     benchmarks must include, but not be limited to: effective \n     action to dismantle the major drug cartels and arrest their \n     leaders; full and ongoing implementation of effective money-\n     laundering legislation; compliance with all outstanding \n     extradition requests by the United States; increased \n     interdiction of narcotics and other controlled substances \n     flowing across the border by land and sea routes; improved \n     cooperation with U.S. law enforcement officials, including \n     allowing U.S. agents to resume carrying weapons on the \n     Mexican side of the border; and a comprehensive program to \n     identify, weed out, and prosecute corrupt officials at all \n     levels of the Mexican government, police, and military.\n       You may feel that U.S. interests in Mexico, economic and \n     otherwise, are too extensive to risk the fall-out that would \n     result from decertification. That is why Congress included a \n     vital national interest waiver provision in Section 490 of \n     the Foreign Assistance Act. But other vital interests are not \n     a valid reason to certify when certification has not been \n     earned. If you feel that our interests warrant it, I urge you \n     to use this waiver. But an honest assessment of Mexico's \n     cooperation on counternarcotics must fall on the side of \n     decertification.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from California has \nexpired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I might be allowed 30 seconds to conclude?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I can only say I believe a strong case \ncan be made to the President to decertify Mexico, to provide a list of \nspecific accomplishments that country should meet to waive \ndecertification, and at any time during this next year that they meet \nthat list of requirements, the President has the ability to certify \nthem. I thank the President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to comment briefly on the \namendment before us. We are expecting two more speakers for the \nremainder of our time. What we may do is yield some time to Senator \nChafee to speak on another topic until those speakers arrive.\n  I just want to make a final point with respect to the amendment \nbefore us, that I do believe, as I have said twice now in speaking on \nthis amendment, that there are still many unanswered questions, ones \nwhich at least I would need to hear answers to before I could feel \ncomfortable voting in support of it. I have raised some of these \nquestions already.\n  How would we address the $706 billion shortfall that this would \nproduce in 2002 to 2007? This $706 billion is more than the total \namount of dollars that were involved in the 1993 tax hike and in the \nbudget proposals passed last year by this Congress in terms of reducing \nthe growth of Medicare and discretionary spending. $706 billion is more \nthan all of that put together. No one has come forward and explained \nwhere those dollars would come from to effectuate this amendment.\n  The second issue I have asked questions about is why is it just this \ntrust fund? There are others in the Federal Government. We are told the \ntrust fund should be taken off budget, yet the amendment only addresses \none of them. If, in fact, we are debating the definition of a balanced \nbudget, we can't have some trust funds qualifying and some trust funds \nnot qualifying.\n  In addition, we haven't had any explanation of what happens if Social \nSecurity is cut loose in the process through this amendment, and if it \nwere cut loose and runs out of money, what would be the consequences \nand how would we address such shortfall if it was not part of a unified \nbudget?\n  There are all of these questions and others before us, Mr. President. \nAs I say, I have listened this morning and have not heard answers to \nthem. There are others I will be raising later in the day. In the \nabsence of those answers, it is clear to me that trying to effectuate \nthis amendment would be a very high-risk proposal, as I said from the \noutset, with no evidence in the amendment of protecting the benefits of \nSocial Security any more than they are protected if they are part of \nthe unified budget.\n\n[[Page S1513]]\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, over the next few days, we have an \nopportunity that we want to take advantage of to correct the course of \nyears of unrestrained Government spending. Just like a consumer who has \ntoo many credit cards, barely keeping his head above water, \nparticularly because he is paying big interest on his balance, so, too, \nis the Federal Government sinking under an ocean of debt. This \ndeplorable state of affairs will force the Federal Government to make \nan annual payment of $248 billion this year alone.\n\n  We have already tried to instill fiscal discipline through a lot of \nother measures that we passed in the last 10 years, including spending \ncaps and deficit control mechanisms. They simply are not working \nefficiently enough to sustain the level of economic growth that we are \nnow experiencing. If we had the deficit under control and interest \nrates down, we would be creating many, many more jobs than what have \nbeen created by this economy. Without the discipline of a \nconstitutional amendment, we will see our interest payments further \ndrag down the economy. By 2007, interest payments on the national debt \nwill increase to $340 billion.\n  Just imagine, if we were not paying the interest right now, we would \nhave no budget deficit whatsoever. In fact, we would be running a \nsurplus until the year 2004.\n  When talking about the balanced budget amendment, one of the first \nthings to do is set the record straight on the issue we have been \ntalking about since last night: the issue of Social Security.\n  Some of my colleagues, well-meaning but wrong, have signaled that \nthey would be willing to support the balanced budget amendment if \nSocial Security was exempt from the amendment. I say wrong. Why? \nBecause exempting Social Security would create more problems for the \nprogram. They argue that a balanced budget amendment threatens the \nviability of Social Security and would harm vulnerable seniors in the \nprocess. If that were true, I would not be supporting this resolution. \nBut that is not true, and unless we get the deficit of the Federal \nGovernment under control, this Government and our economy will never be \nstrong enough to ever meet the needs of the baby boomers when they go \ninto retirement just 13 years from now.\n  Proponents of the Reid amendment apparently still believe that by \npassing Senate Joint Resolution 1, there would be some sudden \ngroundswell of support for cutting Social Security benefits to reduce \noutlays. They are wrong. Given the popularity and the need of Social \nSecurity for our seniors, because it is part of the social fabric of \nAmerican society, this Congress would not let that happen. Even if this \nCongress were inclined to let that happen, the American people would \nnot let that happen. That just isn't going to happen.\n  I am committed to the idea that balancing the budget is not about \ncutting Social Security. I voted for a resolution last year which \npromoted that view, but opponents of the amendment are not satisfied by \nwords--I suppose everybody is cynical about words from Members of \nCongress--but past experience dictates otherwise. Even though we have \nsubmitted budget resolutions which achieve balance in the year 2002 \nwithout harming Social Security, the opponents of the balanced budget \namendment continue to try to derail this amendment by claiming that \nthose of us who have always fought to protect Social Security will turn \naround and try to harm Social Security. How could that ever happen, \nwhen the experience of the last 60 years to protect Social Security has \nbeen just the opposite, the experience of this Congress, the track \nrecord of this Congress, has been just the opposite?\n  Our budget proposal does take into account the Social Security \nsurplus, projected to be about $465 billion cumulative by the year \n2002. Requiring a consolidated or unified budget in this constitutional \namendment is the right thing to do. First, we must set our policy in \naccordance with the long-term health of this Nation's economy and the \npeople of this country.\n  By chance, there is a Social Security surplus today. If we had tried \nto pass a balanced budget amendment like this in the early 1980's, we \nwould not have to worry about this argument because Social Security had \nno surplus.\n  If we waited until the year 2029 to balance the budget, we would not \nbe hearing this argument because there would be no surplus in Social \nSecurity at that time. It would be bankrupt. Social Security will be \nrunning a very real deficit by the year 2029. Whether Social Security \nis off or on budget, the decisions made about borrowing will have to \ntake this deficit into account, even though it will look as if we are \nin full compliance with the Constitution. How can we expect the people \nto have confidence in Government if this kind of ghost accounting \ncontinues to go on?\n  But this message does not seem to be getting through. Listen to \ncomments of the Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. His comments \nseem to be ignored on the issue of the unified budget. At a hearing of \nthe Senate Budget Committee held 3 weeks ago, Chairman Greenspan \ntestified that ``for the purposes of fiscal evaluation of the budget of \nthe United States, the unified budget is the appropriate one * * *''\n  Chairman Greenspan is right--financial markets take into account all \nGovernment activity. It is not segmented out into various trust funds \nas the sponsors of this amendment on Social Security would want us to \nbelieve. If we exempt Social Security we will make our job harder. That \ncould have serious ramifications for the economy, and for other \nprograms in the budget. If we are forced to make up the $295 billion \nlost from the Social Security surplus, we will have to find places to \nmake further, unnecessary reductions.\n  I see no compelling reason to exempt Social Security. It is beyond \ndispute that should Congress scrap the unified budget and exempt Social \nSecurity, truly draconian cuts in important social programs would be \nabsolutely necessary to balance the budget.\n  So, in the spirit of truth in budgeting, I challenge the supporters \nof scrapping the unified budget to identify what programs will be cut \nand how large those cuts will be. Prior to the 104th Congress, those \nwho supported the balanced budget were repeatedly asked to provide \ndetails of how a balanced budget would be achieved. I believe the same \nstandard should apply to those who propose exempting Social Security. \nWhere is the beef in their proposal?\n  One final reason I do not support exempting Social Security from the \nresolution is the possibility that the exemption will turn into a \nmagnet for new spending that is not offset with cuts--all with a simple \nmajority vote. This does not seem too far-fetched, Mr. President, at a \ntime when President Clinton is proposing to shift home health care \nspending from one Medicare trust fund to a second trust fund which is \nlargely funded by the general Treasury.\n  I believe it is clear that the best way to protect Social Security \nnow as well as in the future is to reject ill-advised efforts to exempt \nSocial Security from the balanced budget amendment. In fact, the \nrespected Robert Myers, a former chief actuary of the Social Security \nAdministration who continues to be a strong supporter of the program of \nSocial Security, is a strong supporter, as well, of this balanced \nbudget amendment as it is written.\n  Mr. Myers recognizes that continued fiscal irresponsibility on the \npart of the Federal Government is the greatest threat to Social \nSecurity, a program that is part of the social fabric of America, \nprotecting America's seniors in retirement. If we continue to run up \nthe deficit, interest payments will continue to rise. When the time \ncomes for Social Security to start cashing in its bonds, possibly as \nsoon as the year 2012, the Federal Government may find it very \ndifficult to find a creditor when the debt we carry exceeds $8 \ntrillion.\n\n[[Page S1514]]\n\n  We have another opportunity to rid ourselves of this unsustainable \nspending. I hope that we can, once and for all, keep our promise to \nbalance the budget without hanging the Social Security noose around the \nnecks of those of us supporting the balanced budget amendment. Contrary \nto the hue and cry that we hear from the other side, the balanced \nbudget amendment is the best way to continue ensuring a good quality of \nlife for seniors while preserving the American dream for all Americans.\n  Also Mr. President, I want to correct an incorrect characterization \nof a memorandum by Congress Daily.\n  The Congress Daily refers to a CRS analysis which supposedly says \nthat the balanced budget amendment will hurt the Government's ability \nto pay Social Security benefits.\n  Let me read from the report: ``Now, of course, this does not mean \nthat Social Security benefits could not be paid.'' I don't know how \nmuch clearer you can be on this subject. The balanced budget amendment \nwill not prevent Congress from honoring its commitments to seniors.\n  Better yet, the same CRS researcher who produced the report which \nsome have mischaracterized has produced yet another clarifying memo. \nLet me quote from that newest report: ``We are not concluding that the \ntrust fund surpluses could not be drawn down to pay beneficiaries.'' \nThat seems perfectly clear to me. Social Security will not be harmed by \nthe balanced budget amendment.\n  I think that it's unfortunate that those who oppose the balanced \nbudget amendment are using such deceptive arguments and tactics. We are \nmaking important decisions for the future of this great Nation. I wish \nwe could have an honest debate about the balanced budget and not resort \nto trickery.\n  The Congress Daily article also quotes several of my Democratic \ncolleagues referring to a report from the Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities. As everyone knows, this group is a liberal interest group \nthat opposes the balanced budget amendment. That's what they testified \nto earlier this year before the Judiciary Committee.\n  So, in conclusion, this page and a half CRS analysis actually \nreaffirms what the supporters of the balanced budget amendment have \nalways been saying: the balanced budget amendment will not harm Social \nSecurity.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at the hour of 12:30 \nSenators John Chafee be allowed 12 minutes to speak as in morning \nbusiness and Senator John Kerry be allowed 10 minutes as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from Iowa for the \ntremendously important statement he has made. I am amazed at what I \nthink many of us would call gimmickry when it comes to the legitimate \nand responsible debate over the balanced budget amendment to our \nConstitution. There is not a Senator on this floor who is not committed \nto upholding the fiscal integrity and the solvency of the Social \nSecurity system of our country. Many of us have voted to do that time \nand time again, and those votes have produced, in fact, a strong, \nstable, and secure system to ensure supplemental income for the senior \ncommunity of our country. But that does not deny us the responsibility \nof being fiscally responsible.\n  The amendment of my colleague from Nevada, while I believe he is \nsincere, is frustrating to me and at times angry, that it appears at \nthis moment, by press conferences recently held, that there is an \neffort to game this issue, much like the administration attempted to \ngame Medicare in the last election, when this Congress was legitimately \nand responsibly involved in trying to save and secure our Medicare \nsystem, a system that provides a critical need for the senior community \nof our country.\n  There is absolutely nothing, in my opinion, in the years I have \nstudied the balanced budget amendment to our Constitution, and I find \nmyself reasonably knowledgeable as it relates to the budget itself, \nthat you should separate any portion of the budget from its \nresponsibility of being balanced under a unified budget.\n  The week before last, prior to the recess, we saw many of our \ncolleagues on the other side of this issue rush to the floor, claiming \nthat the Congressional Research Service memo confirmed their argument \nand confirmed their logic that somehow Social Security had to be \nremoved from this amendment, or this proposed amendment. The \nCongressional Research Service came back with these words: ``We have \nbeen and are being misrepresented in what we believe to be our findings \nof the facts and our interpretation.''\n  If this is so, then there is reason to be frustrated and there is \nreason to be a little angry that some would game the system, actually \nattempting, in my opinion, to distort what is, in fact, the \nrepresentation of the Congressional Research Service. While I at times \nhave taken legitimate criticism directed toward the Congressional \nResearch Service, I have not tried to say what they said is not what \nthey said that somebody else said. That, of course, is part of the \nargument that some are using now with the issue of Social Security.\n  Oh, it is a way out and it is a way to hide. It is a way to hide from \nthe legitimate vote, up or down, on a constitutional amendment for a \nbalanced budget. Why should you be frightened of it? If you are not for \na balanced budget amendment to our Constitution, vote no. If you really \ndo not believe in it, vote no.\n  If you believe in deficit spending, vote no. But don't try the \ngimmickry that we have seen. I will repeat the use of that word. We \nhave seen a multitude of amendments come to the floor, and if each one \nof them had been attached to the constitutional amendment, three-\nquarters of the Federal budget would be off-budget again, outside of a \nbalanced budget amendment, and able to run free and in deficit for any \nlength of time the Congress so chose. I don't believe that is the \nintent of the Congress itself.\n  I do believe we are listening to the American people at this moment. \nAnd, again, the President eloquently, and I believe 12 or 13 times, in \nhis State of the Union Address, said he was sending up a balanced \nbudget. We all, quietly, appropriately, and respectfully, waited for \nhis budget to come to the Hill. We got it, but I must say that it is \nnot in balance. It is a $120 billion deficit across the board. Yet, he \ncalls that balanced.\n  Mr. President, get a new set of glasses. I know you are getting to be \nmiddle-aged. You better get bifocals because the fine print says that \nisn't what you are saying. Of course, after he leaves office, then the \ntough cuts are made to argue his point of a balanced budget, or the tax \nrelief he has proposed would simply be taken away.\n  Social Security deserves to be a legitimate and responsible part of \nthe total budget. This job I hold, to which I have sworn an oath of \noffice, also makes me a member of the board of directors of the Social \nSecurity system, in essence. The Senator from Nevada and I are \ndedicated to the long-term stability of the Social Security system. \nTaking it off budget, allowing it to run deficits, disallowing its \nresponsible and reasonable management through the budget process, does \nnot make a lot of sense. I don't argue separate accounting, I don't \nargue the legitimate approach that shows or demonstrates to the Social \nSecurity recipients what is legitimately his or hers. That is all right \nand responsible, and we can agree on that. But I suggest that the \namendment before us is subterfuge, that it does not resolve the \nproblem.\n  Social Security officials have continually said, ``How do you save \nSocial Security?'' You balance the budget. A bankrupt Government is not \ngoing to write a check to anybody in any way. It is a Government who is \nfiscally responsible, a Government whose budgets are balanced, that can \nwrite Social Security checks. It is not independent of any portion of \nthe Federal Government, and it must be taken in the whole of the \ncontext of that Government.\n  I am disappointed to have to address what are blatant scare tactics \nthat some groups are using on the balanced budget amendment and Social \nSecurity.\n  Recently, we were hit with a press item that claimed the \nCongressional Research Service had issued a memo confirming a so-called \nstudy by an outside advocacy group--the Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities--concerning Social Security and the balanced budget \namendment.\n\n[[Page S1515]]\n\n  This group has always opposed the balanced budget amendment and \nconsistently opposed reducing the deficit with meaningful domestic \nspending restraint.\n  I say I am disappointed, but I am also angry. I hate to say it, but \nwhat CRS actually said has been misrepresented. I have not read \neveryone's press releases, so I simply assume it was that outside group \nthat was overreaching.\n  CRS did not endorse any study or paper by the Center on Budget and \nPolicy Priorities. CRS did not reach the same conclusion that the \nbalanced budget amendment would in any way impair drawing down the \nSocial Security trust fund surpluses to pay promised benefits when the \ntime came.\n  We've all heard the term ``G-I-G-O--garbage in, garbage out.'' CRS \napparently was handed a narrowly written request. They responded, \nappropriately, with a technically precise memo on February 5. Others \nreleased that memo to the press on February 12.\n  Part of what CFR said was misrepresented and part was left out.\n  The CRS memo was about accounting. It was about what would and would \nnot be included in the calculations of a budget deficit, surplus, or \nbalance under Senate Joint Resolution 1, the balanced budget amendment \nto the Constitution.\n  But the spin from opponents of the balanced budget amendment was that \nthe amendment might cause some Social Security checks to be held up.\n  The two things have absolutely nothing to do with each other. But the \noriginal CRS memo was written in technical language. That made it easy \nfor someone to fabricate a scare story about what it meant.\n  On February 12, CRS issued a clarifying memo, also technically \nprecise. They told my staff that, clearly, there was what they \ncharitably called ``a misunderstanding.''\n  First of all, let's be clear: The first CRS memo talks about the year \n2019 and after. Curiously, I have not seen much about that date, 22 \nyears from now, in press reports. We might be tempted to think the \nintent was to scare today's senior citizens about their Social \nSecurity.\n  Now, what happens in the year 2019? Social Security outlays are \nprojected to start exceeding receipts. Under the balanced budget \namendment, the rest of the Government would have to run a surplus to \nmake sure the overall budget is balanced.\n  That is good--it means that, in the long run, assuming for the moment \nno other reforms are made in the meantime, the balanced budget \namendment would make sure we do not abandon our commitment to Social \nSecurity beneficiaries.\n  The real balanced budget amendment, Senate Joint Resolution 1, \nrequires us to make sure that a non-Social Security surplus covers any \nSocial Security deficit in the future. That is good for seniors, good \nfor Social Security, and good for the economy.\n  So, it all sounds like scare tactics to me. When you are losing on \nsubstance, terrorize the senior citizens.\n  Let us look at what CRS really said: In its original February 5 memo, \nCRS said, ``(T)his does not mean that Social Security benefits could \nnot be paid, if the rest of receipts into the Treasury for a particular \nyear exceed outlays, this amount could be used to offset the Social \nSecurity deficit.''\n  Well, this is exactly what our balanced budget amendment requires--\nthat those other, non-Social Security accounts run a surplus. That \nwould protect seniors.\n  The February 5, CRS memo continues, ``And of course, tax or \nexpenditure provisions, or both, could be altered to create a new \nbalance.'' Well, that's exactly what the President's Advisory Council, \nand the minority leader, and others have talked about.\n  Those are the parts of the original CRS memo that get left out when \nbalanced budget amendment opponents quote that memo.\n  Now, let us look at the February 12, CRS memo:\n\n       We are not (CRS emphasizes ``not'') concluding that the \n     Trust Funds surpluses could not be drawn down to pay \n     beneficiaries. The BBA would not require that result. . . .\n       Only if no other receipts in any particular year could be \n     found would the possibility of a limitation on drawing down \n     the Trust Funds arise.\n\n  In other words, if the Federal Government was otherwise totally broke \nwould this possibility arise.\n  And of course, we know the way to prevent the Government from going \ntotally broke: Pass the balanced budget amendment.\n  It has been said here on the floor that CRS did not change its \noriginal position. That is right. Its original position has been \nmisunderstood and misrepresented.\n  I see my colleague from Texas has arrived, and I believe he has the \ntime until 12:30 under a unanimous-consent request. My guess is if his \ncomments extend beyond that, he can find the cooperation of some of our \ncolleagues here on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. How much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes, 10 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to make a very, very simple point, \nand I think I can do it in 6 minutes. If not, I will come back this \nafternoon. First of all, everybody knows what is happening to the \nnational debt. It is exploding under both Democrats and Republicans. \nNobody tries to argue otherwise. They suggest that we wait until \nanother day to deal with it. But nobody can refute the fact that debt \nis going up.\n  Now, the second thing that we have seen throughout this whole debate \nis that we have had an effort by our Democratic colleagues to exempt \nthe budget from the balanced budget requirement. In fact, if you add up \nevery amendment that has been offered by our Democratic colleagues to \nthe balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, they have now \nproposed, in terms of amendments offered and submitted on the floor and \ndealt with in committee, to exempt Social Security, college education, \nveterans, education, nutrition, health, housing, justice, capital \nprojects, and emergencies, which is 77 percent of the domestic budget, \nif we are going to require a balanced budget.\n  I want to talk about the exemption that is before the Senate now. \nThat is exempting Social Security. Now, it is interesting that our \ncolleagues say that if you want to protect Social Security, don't \nbalance the budget. Well, let me first note that it is interesting \nbecause in committee, the Democrats propose that we count the Social \nSecurity surplus for the next 5 years and, then, thereafter, we exempt \nSocial Security from the budget.\n  Now, I have a chart here that shows what is happening to Social \nSecurity. What it shows, very briefly, is that for the next 20 years, \nit has a modest surplus, and then when baby boomers turn 65 and retire, \nit falls off the end of the Earth.\n  Now, it is interesting to note that our Democratic colleagues say, \nwhile you have this surplus, let's count that for 5 years to try to \nbalance the budget, but don't count any of this deficit. I ask you, how \ncan you balance the budget and not count the largest program of the \nFederal budget, which is Social Security? How can it be anything but a \nfraud to talk about balancing the budget and exempt the largest program \nin the budget? But there is a more important point I want to make, and \nthat point has to do with the ability to fund Social Security.\n  If you get to the heart of this amendment, what our Democratic \ncolleagues are saying is, if you don't balance the budget, you are in a \nstronger position to fund Social Security. Let me look at this very \nbriefly. We last balanced the budget in 1969--28 years ago. The last \nday we had a balanced budget, the Federal debt was $366 billion. Today, \nthe debt is $5.2 trillion, which is the gross level of Federal debt. We \ncheat a little sometimes by talking about debt held externally as if we \ndon't have a debt to the Social Security trust fund.\n  What has happened since the last day we had a balanced budget is the \nFederal debt has risen by $4.8 trillion. Since the last day we had a \nbalanced budget, we have indebted every child in America to a debt, at \nbirth, of $20,000. Every baby born in America, every day since 1969, is \n$20,000 more in debt than they were the last day we balanced the \nFederal budget. The interest on the debt that we have incurred since \n1969 is $320 billion a year, to date. The interest we are paying on the \ndebt we have incurred since the last day we balanced the Federal budget \nis $320 billion a year.\n\n[[Page S1516]]\n\n  The Social Security benefits to the elderly are only $304 billion a \nyear. So, by the deficits we have run every day since 1969, we have \npiled up an interest payment, per year, that is bigger than what we are \nspending on Social Security benefits for the retired every year.\n  Now, does anybody believe that, by incurring $4.8 trillion of debt \nsince the last day we balanced the budget, Social Security is more \nsecure today than it was in 1969? Does anybody believe that, because we \nare paying $320 billion of interest on the debt that we have incurred \nsince the last day we balanced the budget, Social Security is more \nsecure because we are piling up this debt? A baby born in America, if \nspending continues at the current rate, will, in their working \nlifetime, if they are born today, pay $187,000 of income taxes in their \nworking lifetime just to pay interest on the public debt. Are they \ngoing to be in a better position to provide Social Security benefits \nfor their parents by paying $187,000 in their lifetime on interest? \nWould they be in a stronger position to provide Social Security if they \nweren't paying that interest? I think the answer is, clearly, yes.\n  To end with a simple analogy with what our Democratic colleagues are \nsaying, which could be converted into advice to a family, say that you \nhave a family and they have one child 3 years old. They have one 2 \nyears old. They have one which is 1 year old. They have three children. \nOur Democratic colleagues are giving them advice about funding the \ncollege education of their children. Our Democratic colleagues say, \n``Look. Don't balance your budget. If you balance your budget, you may \nnot be able to send your children to college.'' Does anybody believe, \nif for the next 17 years they run up big debts, that they are going to \nbe in a better position to send those children to college than they \nwould be if they were saving the money now to do it? If you care about \nyour momma, if you care about Social Security, and if you want to \nbalance the Federal budget to stop this debt and this interest from \neating up every penny you earn, only then can Social Security be saved. \nThat is why this amendment, if adopted, would be a nail in the coffin \nof Social Security. If you want to save Social Security, stop the \ngrowth in the debt. Stop the growth in interest payments.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all amendments \nin order to the pending balanced budget constitutional amendment be \nlimited to the following, and that they be first-degree amendments:\n  Senator Bumpers amendment with regard to statutory alternative;\n  Senator Boxers amendment with regard to disaster exemption;\n  Two relevant amendments for Senator Byrd;\n  Senator Conrad, a substitute;\n  Senator Daschle, relevant;\n  Senator Dorgan substitute, and sense of the Senate;\n  Senator Durbin, tax cuts and shutdowns; two different amendments;\n  Senator Feingold, one amendment on ratification time period, one with \nregard to surplus, one with regard to enforcement, and one relevant;\n  Senator Feinstein, substitute;\n  Senator Graham, public debt;\n  Senator Hollings, one on campaign finance and one relevant;\n  Senator Kennedy, one on judicial review and one on impoundment;\n  Senator Kohl, capital budget;\n  Senator Lautenberg, implementation language, and one relevant;\n  Senator Leahy, debt limit, and one identified as relevant;\n  Senator Levin, implementing legislation;\n  Senator Moynihan, debt limit;\n  Senator Reid, Social Security;\n  Senator Rockefeller, Medicare;\n  Senator Torricelli, capital budget;\n  Senator Wellstone, proportionality, children, and sense of the \nSenate, all identified as one amendment;\n  Senator Lott, two relevant amendments;\n  Senator Hatch, two relevant amendments; and\n  Senator Kempthorne, Social Security, sense of the Senate.\n  I further ask that all amendments must be offered no later than 5 \np.m. on Wednesday, February 26, and that any amendment not offered by 5 \np.m. no longer be in order to the balanced budget constitutional \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me say \nfirst of all that I appreciate the cooperation of all Senators. This \ndoes not mean necessarily that every one of these amendments are going \nto be offered. In fact, I hope to the contrary that they will not.\n  I would also like to add, if I could, a clause that no motion to \nrecommit be in order to the unanimous-consent request, if that would be \nin keeping with the majority leader's intent.\n  Mr. LOTT. That would not be my intent. I did intend to reserve the \nright to have that motion to recommit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, based upon the conversations I have had \nwith the majority leader, I have no objection to the unanimous-consent \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Democratic leader for that \ncooperation. We will continue to have discussions and deal honestly and \nfairly with each other. This is a long list. But as he suggests, I hope \nthey will not all be offered and that we can begin then to identify a \ntime for those amendments to be considered in a regular order and move \ntoward completing action on this debate on this amendment by next \nTuesday.\n  In that regard, Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, \nhaving had several discussions with the Democratic leader as to how to \nbring to a close this important constitutional amendment, it appears \nthat it is the first step toward reaching final passage time by having \nthis list offered now, which I hope would be in the late afternoon of \nTuesday, March 4.\n  All Senators who intend to offer amendments to this constitutional \namendment must be included in the list just submitted. Also, the \nSenator on the list must then offer his or her amendment for \nconsideration prior to 5 p.m. on Wednesday. Following the 5 p.m. \ndeadline on Wednesday, the managers will then be able to determine how \nmuch work remains leading up to the final passage vote.\n  We will be able to identify the amount of time and get some time \nagreements on the amendments that will be offered. And, of course, we \nwill have adequate closing time for leaders. We should be able to come \nup with some time late Tuesday afternoon. But we will work through \nthat, and we will keep the Senators informed as to how that will work \nthrough.\n  At this point, until we see these amendments that are offered, we \nstill can't say exactly what will be the situation on Friday or on \nMonday. It is anticipated that we will, as we have been doing, have a \nvote or votes on Monday afternoon. But we will work through that very \ncarefully and will keep the Senators informed once we get the list and \nget some time agreements entered into.\n  So I thank all of my colleagues for their cooperation. I think we are \nmaking some progress by obtaining this list.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized \nfor 12 minutes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE.

Despite the fact \nthat the United States played a lead role in the U.N.\n\n[[Page S1517]]\n\nPopulation Conference in Cairo in 1994, and, indeed, we convinced other \nnations to increase their contributions to international family \nplanning efforts, in the United States in the past year family planning \nfunds were cut below 35 percent below the previous year, and then \nadditional restrictions were added to that.\n  So the net effect was the budget, which previously was $547 billion, \nhas now shrunk to $72 billion this year. These cuts are devastating \nfamilies around the world.\n  According to a recent report released by the Rockefeller Foundation, \nin 1 year 7 million couples in developing countries will lose access to \nmodern contraceptives, resulting in 4 million unplanned pregnancies. \nBut here is the important part, Mr. President. As a result of lack of \nfamily planning and information in these countries around the world, \n1.6 million of those unwanted pregnancies will end in abortion. That is \nthe last thing we want.\n  Tragically, the international family planning program which we are \ngoing to vote on at 2:30 has become bogged down over the debate about \nabortion. I am perplexed about this, Mr. President. Why should those \nwho oppose family planning also oppose abortion? Or, to put it the \nother way around, why should those who oppose abortion oppose family \nplanning? Study after study has shown that lack of family planning \nleads to more unintended pregnancies, which leads to more abortions. If \nwe want to end abortions, reduce the number of abortions, it is clear \nthat we should have greater family planning than we currently have.\n\n  Let me illustrate this with an example in two countries. Russia. \nRussia has very little contraception available and abortion is the \nprimary method of birth control. The average Russian woman has at least \nfour abortions in her lifetime. I am absolutely shocked by that.\n  Now let us look at Hungary. Hungary has made family planning services \nwidely available and the abortion rate in that country has dropped \ndramatically.\n  The impact these programs, that is, our family planning programs, \nhave on the health and well-being of women and children around the \nworld just cannot be denied. But there is another issue here that \nshould not be overlooked, and that is the important role that \npopulation programs play in improving global environment or sustaining \nthe environment of this globe which we are all traveling around on.\n  Listen to these statistics. The Earth now supports 5.7 billion human \nbeings. In 30 years, it is estimated that the world population will \ngrow from 5.7 billion to 8.3 billion, a 46-percent growth in 30 years--\na 46-percent growth in the population of this world. We are growing by \n86 million people a year; 90 percent of this increase will be in the \nso-called developing world.\n  India, let us take India as an example. India has to feed an \nadditional 16 million people a year, and so many of these additional \npeople that we have in the world are children. And 40 percent of the \npopulation of the average less developed nation is under the age of 15.\n  To say that this population explosion has put pressure on our natural \nresources is, of course, a terrific understatement. Over the past 50 \nyears, the Earth is estimated to have lost one-fifth of its topsoil and \none-fifth of its tropical rain forests, plus tens of thousands of plant \nand animal species so important to biodiversity. Overfishing in our \noceans combined with pollution has resulted in the plundering of two-\nthirds of the fisheries of the world. Fifty years ago we had these \nfisheries. Two-thirds of them are now gone.\n  Let us just take a look at Bangladesh. There are 120 million people \nin Bangladesh, crammed into a country the size of Wisconsin, and that \nnumber is expected to rise in this little country the size of \nWisconsin, rise from the current 120 million people to 200 million in \nthe next 30 years--200 million people in a country the size of \nWisconsin. Overpopulation in that country of Bangladesh and upstream in \nthe Himalayas has led to severe deforestation. The poor people there \nhave cut down every tree in sight. They have used them for firewood. \nThey have used them for building materials. They have tried to clear \nfor farmland. With no trees to hold the topsoil in place, it simply \nwashes away. Overcrowding has forced thousands of people in Bangladesh \nto settle on land that is nothing more than washed away topsoil \ndeposits from the Ganges and Bramaputra Rivers. That sorry land of \nBangladesh is horribly vulnerable to flooding and storm surges. One \nflood, in 1988, inundated three-quarters of the country, killing tens \nof thousands of people.\n  Now, what can we do about all of this? First, we must focus on \neducation in the developing nations, particularly female literacy. The \nstatistics show absolutely that if we teach young women to read, \neverything else follows: Greater marriage, greater use of \ncontraception, fewer and healthier children, better maternal health and \na smaller likelihood of living in poverty. That is the first thing. \nEducate these folks, particularly the young women.\n\n  Second, the developed nations should do everything they can to \ninfluence population growth because that leads to better maternal and \nchild health. Poor health keeps a nation poor and undeveloped. \nIronically, poor health even contributes to overpopulation. If parents \ncan be certain that their children will survive, they will invest more \nin them emotionally and materially and feel less pressure to have \nadditional children.\n  So that is the second thing. Do everything we can to improve maternal \nand child health.\n  Third, and most relevant to the matter before us today, the Cairo \nConference stressed the importance of redoubling our efforts to \nincrease access to family planning. In the 28 countries that have \nreceived the largest amount of family planning funds, the average \nfamily size has decreased 40 percent over the past 30 years--a 40 \npercent decrease in the average population size because of the family \nplanning funds that have been distributed in those nations.\n  Mr. President, the United States plays a critical role in providing \nfamily planning services abroad. I feel strongly we should continue our \nleadership role in this area. It is both humane and environmentally \nsound. I urge my colleagues to support the early release of these \nfamily planning funds. In other words, vote for the release of these \nfunds, which we will do shortly after the noon break.\n  Mr. President, I also hope that we can in future years increase the \nfunding for these critical programs in our appropriations measures.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/25/senate-section/article/S1516-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1517-S1518]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the joint resolution.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 9\n\n(Purpose: To add a provision proposing an amendment to the Constitution \n    of the United States relating to contributions and expenditures \n                     intended to affect elections)\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMassachusetts is now recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, as my colleague from Rhode Island has mentioned, this \nafternoon, when we come out of the caucuses, we will vote on the \nvitally important issue of the release of funding for international \npopulation programs.\n  I strongly support the President's finding which states that the \nfunding restriction placed on the previously appropriated population \nfunds ``is having a negative impact on the proper functioning of the \npopulation planning program.'' I strongly agree with that finding. The \ndelayed funding, combined with the massive cuts are not only doing \nsignificant damage to international family planning programs, but quite \nliterally is threatening the lives of thousands of women and children \nworldwide.\n  I hope no one here will underestimate the importance of this vote. It \nis about values--the values we place on the importance of women's \nhealth, child survival, and population assistance. The vote is not \nabout increasing or decreasing funds. The damage of large funding cuts \nunfortunately already has occurred. We will vote now simply on whether \nwe will release previously appropriated funds for population assistance \n5 months late into the fiscal year, or 9 months late into the fiscal \nyear. Let me remind my colleagues that these delays have been going on \nnow for a year and a half, and the cumulative effect is extremely \nenormously negative.\n  These programs are on the brink of bankruptcy and are close to \nshutting down because they have already sustained a 35-percent cut \nsince 1995. In dollar figures, this means a cut from $547 million in \n1995 to $385 million in 1997, compounded by a year and a half of \nunprecedented delays in metering out that which has been appropriated \nat the trickling rate of 8 percent per month.\n\n  This should not be a partisan issue. The health and survival of women \nand children and efforts to reduce infant mortality are not, or should \nnot be, partisan issues. I joined then-Senator Alan Simpson in \nrepresenting the United States at the 1994 International Conference on \nPopulation and Development in Cairo, where the United States was a \nmajor leader in galvanizing the international community to action. U.S. \nleadership was based on bipartisan values about international family \nplanning. The conference brought together people from around the \nworld--of all religious, nationality, and ethnic groups--working \ntogether toward responsible methods of family planning, and education, \nand to establish a platform from which to build toward the availability \nof these crucial social services in all corners of the globe. However, \nsince the conference in Cairo, some Members of the United States \nCongress have made it their mission to erode the bipartisan base from \nwhich the U.S. pledged to lead by slashing funds and delaying the \nrelease of those funds. I think this is punitive, it is indefensible, \nand it is wrong.\n\n  Today we have the opportunity to right at least a small part of this \nwrong by releasing the previously appropriated funds for population \nassistance March 1 instead of July 1. In my judgement it is a matter of \nfundamental responsibility that we approve the Presidential finding \nthat confirms the harm these delays are causing families worldwide, and \nprevent further delay is making the funds available.\n  Mr. President, if we do not do this, it means shutting the door to \nthousands of women and families worldwide who have asked for the \nopportunity to simply, take control of their lives and their health, \nand responsibly plan their families. We have succeeded in the difficult \ntask of raising public awareness of the benefits of family planning. As \none program coordinator in Nigeria said, ``It is one thing to raise \npublic awareness but if there is no access to birth control for poor \nwomen, what use is awareness?'' We cannot turn our backs now. We must \nfollow through. Let me stress: This vote is not about abortion, as some \nSenators have tried to argue. Opponents of family planning programs \nmistakenly believe that funds for these programs enable women to have \nabortions. That is erroneous emotionalism, Mr. President. We should \nlook at the facts. The fact is that, by law, no U.S. assistance can be \nused to pay for abortions anywhere in the world. The irony is that the \nanti-abortion advocates who oppose these programs are actually \nincreasing the incidence of abortions they decry by denying women the \nmeans to responsibly space their children. As our former colleague, \nSenator Mark Hatfield, a well respected prolife leader in support for \npopulation funding, articulated in a letter to Representative Chris \nSmith, * * * ``you are contributing to an increase of abortions \nworldwide because of the funding restrictions on which you insisted * * \n*. It is a proven fact that when contraceptive services are not \navailable to women throughout the world, abortion rates increase.''\n\n  I ask my colleagues, whether you are in favor of abortion or not, to \napprove the Presidential finding and the earlier release of family \nplanning funds. This is assuredly a vote for women's health, because it \nwill determine whether we give or deny women in impoverished countries \na critical ingredient they need to lead healthy lives and raise healthy \nchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/25/senate-section/article/S1518-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1518]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 5 minutes for debate equally \ndivided in the usual form with the vote on the joint resolution to \noccur at 2:15.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, very briefly, I urge my colleagues to \nvote against the President's request for early release of population \nfunds. Significant concessions have already been made by those of us \nwho support the pro-life position. We agreed to raise the overall level \nof funding from $356 million in 1996 to $385 million, and the disbursal \nrate from 6 percent to 8 percent a month. Now the President wants to \nmove up the date when disbursal begins. This would make $123 million \nmore available for organizations that either support or lobby for the \nlegalization of abortion.\n  The administration claims that 17 projects will be forced to close \ndown if we delay funding until July. Yet, virtually every one of these \nprograms could be funded because they are willing to abide by Mexico \nCity conditions not to support abortion or lobby to legalize it. To \nprotect a few groups who support abortion, the administration is\n\n[[Page S1519]]\n\nwithholding support from many organizations willing to provide family \nplanning services consistent with the Mexico City guidelines. They \ncomplain about a lack of funds, yet are willing to forgo an increase if \nit is linked to Mexico City.\n  I support family planning, but I cannot and will not vote to provide \nfunds to organizations which, in the name of family planning, take the \nlives of innocent unborn children. I hope the resolution will be \nopposed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we should understand what we are voting on. \nWe are about to vote on a resolution to decide when, not whether we \nrelease funds, but when.\n  Somebody said yesterday that this vote is about an additional $123 \nmillion for groups that fund abortion. That is absolutely false. We \nhave appropriated this money. There is no additional money. In fact, we \nare voting to spend and release $160 million less than we appropriated \n2 years ago. So whether or not this resolution passes this afternoon, \nthe funds are going to be spent anyway. It is just a question of when.\n  We should also understand that U.S. law, which all of us have \nsupported, says that none of this money can be used to pay for \nabortions anywhere, and very careful audits have been made of this \nmoney, and nobody has shown that a cent of it has ever been used to \npromote abortion.\n  Some say we will have another population funding vote maybe later \nthis week. That is not going to happen. This is the only vote on family \nplanning. Do we vote to release the money now, that is March 1, or July \n1? That is all it is. But if we delay, we are using the ultimate \narrogance. We are saying we know better than you; you cannot have \nfamily planning money.\n  Let me tell you what happens when we spend it. In Russia, abortion \nwas routinely used as a method for family planning. In the 4 years \nsince we started family planning programs there, just by increasing the \nnumber of contraceptives by 5 percent, the number of abortions fell \n800,000. So when we put family planning money into Russia, abortions \ncame down by 800,000. When we withhold family planning money, abortions \nthen go up. We ought to ask ourselves about that.\n  The Senator from Maine, Senator Snowe, spoke so eloquently on this. \nSenator Gordon Smith, who is very much a right-to-life Senator, spoke \nof his opposition to abortion but of his support of family planning.\n  We should listen to what is really here. We are just saying, let us \nstop abortions by voting for family planning.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today the Senate will consider House \nJoint Resolution 36, the administration's request to begin releasing \nvoluntary fiscal year 1997 international family planning funds on March \n1 rather than July 1 this year. This resolution simply reduces the \ndelay in the funds' release from 9 months to 5 since the fiscal year \nbegan October 1, 1996. Although some want to characterize this as an \nabortion vote, it simply is not. The funds to be released could be used \nonly for voluntary family planning--not for abortion. In fact, today's \nvote is about whether the Senate will help prevent unintended \npregnancies in the first place.\n  Furthermore, the resolution the Senate is considering does not call \nfor any additional funding for international family planning. Whether \nthese funds are released in March or July, the entire amount of funding \nappropriated for international family planning in fiscal year 1997 will \nultimately be spent.\n  Passage of this resolution merits the support of all Members of \nCongress who wish to see improvements in the quality of life for women \nand families around the world. U.S. contributions to international \nfamily planning programs have improved the lives of women in developing \ncountries immeasurably. The ability to plan the size of one's family is \nessential if women and children are to live longer and healthier lives, \nand if women are to make the educational and economic gains they and we \nwish to see.\n  A majority of our colleagues in the House of Representatives endorsed \nthe President's plan to release funds for voluntary family planning \nwhen it passed House Joint Resolution 36 on February 13. Now the Senate \nmust decide. The fiscal year 1997 Foreign Operations Appropriations \nbill, which Congress passed as part of the Omnibus Appropriations bill \nlast year, includes a provision that prohibits the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development [USAID] from obligating funds for \ninternational family planning until July 1, 1997. The provision also \nstates that if the President determines the delay is having a negative \nimpact on USAID's population program, funds may be made available \nbeginning March 1, 1997, if Congress approves the finding.\n  On January 31, the President certified that the restrictions imposed \nby Congress are, in fact, having a negative impact on USAID's \npopulation planning program. The President argues that family planning \nservice delivery and their supporting activities would be disrupted, \ncosts at all levels for the program would increase, and, most \nimportantly, the health and well-being of women, men, and children who \nare beneficiaries of U.S. assistance would be severely threatened. As a \nconsequence, increases in unintended pregnancies, infants and maternal \ndeaths and abortions would be inevitable.\n  The President also suggests that at least 17 bilateral and worldwide \nprograms will have urgent funding needs in the March-June period. By \ndelaying the release of U.S. funds until July these organizations would \nbe forced to suspend, defer, or terminate family planning activities. \nOne program that would be adversely impacted by the delay is the \nInstitute for Reproductive Health at Georgetown University. The \ninstitute does research on natural family planning and provides couples \nwith access to family planning methods. In a letter to Congressman \nDavid Bonior earlier this month, the president of Georgetown \nUniversity, Father Leo J. O'Donovan, stated that if funding for \ninternational family planning is delayed until July, the institute \nwould be forced to terminate work that provides services to more than \none million families throughout the world.\n  Delaying U.S. contributions to international family planning programs \nwill also inhibit the progress that many countries have made toward \nreducing abortions. The Russian Department of Health reports that the \nuse of contraceptives grew from 19 to 24 percent between 1990 and 1994 \nwith the establishment of 50 International Planned Parenthood \nFederation affiliates across Russia. During that time period, the \nnumber of abortions performed dropped from 3.6 million to 2.8 million. \nAccording to the administration, if funding for international family \nplanning is delayed until July, two of the largest organizations that \nreceive USAID funds in Russia would be unable to provide 1.7 million \ncouples with access to modern family planning methods as an alternative \nto abortion.\n  In Bolivia, USAID provides funding for both government and non-\ngovernmental organizations. Since the delivery of family planning \nservices was expanded in the country between 1989 and 1994, the use of \nfamily planning in Bolivia increased by 50 percent. The administration \nargues that if funds for international family planning are delayed \nuntil July, USAID would be forced to defer ongoing population \nassistance in that country. This would jeopardize services for 20 \npercent of Bolivia's population and reduce support to local \norganizations providing family planning services to an additional 30 \npercent of Bolivia's rural population.\n  Many other developing countries experiencing rapid population growth \nwould face similar setbacks if U.S. contributions were delayed. USAID \ncurrently assists more than 60 countries through 95 bilateral and \nworldwide programs. For more than 30 years, this organization has had a \nremarkable impact on the daily lives of people around the world. It has \nhelped millions of families determine the number and spacing of their \nchildren through voluntary family planning programs. It has reduced \nhigh-risk pregnancies and helped save the lives of hundreds of \nthousands of women. And, again, it has reduced the number of unintended \npregnancies and abortions.\n  USAID has also made a significant contribution to slowing down the \nworld population growth. Due in large part to U.S. leadership and \nbipartisan support for USAID, global population is now growing at a \nslower rate. Nonetheless,\n\n[[Page S1520]]\n\nthe world's population could double to over 11 billion by the year 2050 \nunless further progress is made. Delaying U.S. contributions to family \nplanning an additional 4 months will only exacerbate the numerous \nsocial and environmental problems associated with rapid population \ngrowth. We simply cannot afford to delay U.S. contributions to family \nplanning programs any longer.\n  The President has determined that a continued delay in funding for \ninternational family planning will cause serious, irreversible and \navoidable harm. Just as our colleagues in the House of Representatives \ndid, it is time for the Senate to lend its support to the President's \nrequest. I urge my colleagues to support House Joint Resolution 36 and \npermit the President to begin releasing funds for international family \nplanning on March 1.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I recognize the important contribution \nthat voluntary family planning programs can make to the effectiveness \nof U.S. foreign aid programs. Clearly, high rates of population growth \nare an immense barrier to economic and social change in developing \ncountries.\n  I also recognize that increased access to population planning \nprograms can help reduce the number of abortions, as I understand has \nbeen happening in Russia, for example.\n  However, we must also recognize why the Congress imposed the funding \nlimitations contained in the fiscal year 1997 foreign operations \nappropriations bill. It was because of a serious difference of views, \nwithin the Congress and between the Congress and the administration, \nover whether U.S. population planning funds should go to organizations \nthat also provide abortion services.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I have long supported the Mexico City \npolicy of the Reagan and Bush administrations, which restricted funds \nfor any non-governmental organizations that were involved in any way in \nabortion activities. Although there is a broad consensus that no U.S. \naid funds should be used to fund abortions themselves, it is \nintellectually dishonest to ignore the fact that dollars are fungible.\n  Providing funds to an organization for purposes other than abortions \ncan free up funds from other sources that can then be used for \nabortions. That organization can say, with a straight face, that the \nU.S. funds did not pay for the abortions, but the practical effect is \nthe same, which is contrary to the intent of the law and the desires of \nthe American people.\n  I have no desire to hold up the release of funds for population \nplanning programs. And if the administration agrees to return to the \nMexico City policy, there will be no future delays in the release of \nsuch funds. Funding for population programs may even increase. But if \nwe vote to release the fiscal year 1997 funds early, it will be viewed \nby the administration as an endorsement of its current policy regarding \nfunding for organizations that provide abortion services.\n  For this reason, I will vote against the early release of the funds.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I support the release of funds for \ninternational family planning. This program is essential to enabling \nthe world's poorest women to improve their lives--and the lives of \ntheir families.\n  Over the past 2 years, Congress has drastically cut funds for \ninternational family planning--and has put barriers in the way of \nimplementing the program. We have tied our international family \nplanning program in knots--and are denying health care to the world's \npoorest women.\n  Today we will vote to right part of this wrong. We are not voting to \nincrease international family planning. We are simply voting to release \nthe funds--so that our family planning program will no longer be held \nhostage.\n  What do the cuts and delays in funding mean for poor women? The Alan \nGuttmacher Institute estimates that it means that 7 million couples in \ndeveloping countries will no longer have access to contraceptives. \nThere could be almost 2 million unplanned births. And there could be up \nto 1.6 million additional abortions.\n  When we deny a woman the right to choose whether or not to have \nchildren, we deny her the right to control and improve her life. We \ndeny her the right to help herself and her family.\n  Those who oppose international family planning assistance claim to \nwant to reduce the number of abortions. But the effect of our policies \nis just the opposite. Family planning prevents unwanted pregnancies and \nabortions. You would think this basic fact would not need to be \nrestated on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  America's international family planning funds are not spent on \nabortion. So now, some insist on going after basic health care services \nthat prevent pregnancy.\n  Over 100 million women throughout the world cannot obtain family \nplanning because they are poor, uneducated, or lack access to health \ncare. Twenty million of these women will seek unsafe abortions. Some \nwomen will die, some will be disabled. We could prevent some of this \nneedless suffering.\n  This issue won't go away. I will join my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle in fighting against the irrational and cruel effort to end \nU.S. assistance for international family planning. We will continue the \nfight to enable the world's poorest women to control and improve their \nlives.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I would like to join with so many of my \ncolleagues in opposing this resolution requested by President Clinton. \nThere are several reasons why I believe it would be wrong for the \nCongress to accelerate funding for international population control \nprograms. It is the wrong thing to do fiscally, and it is the wrong \nthing to do on its own merits.\n  For the past 3 weeks, the U.S. Senate has been debating the need for \na balanced budget amendment. And now, as one of the Congress' first \nacts, we are considering spending an additional $123 million in fiscal \nyear 1997 for international population control?\n  Second, does it make sense for us to be accelerating spending on this \nextraordinarily controversial program without the kind of sensible \nprotections that existed during the Reagan and Bush administrations?\n  Mr. President, despite the claims to the contrary by the other side, \nthis is a vote that involves the issue of abortion. That is because \nthis vote involves U.S. taxpayers funding of organizations that perform \nand promote abortions overseas. During the Reagan and Bush \nadministrations, our international family planning programs were \nadministered under the Mexico City policy, so-named after the 1984 U.N. \npopulation conference in Mexico City where this U.S. policy was \nformulated. Under the Mexico City policy, this program was kept \nentirely separate from the issue of abortion. This was accomplished by \nrequiring that U.S. family planning programs overseas could only be \nadministered by private groups that do not conduct abortions, or \npromote abortion as a method of family planning.\n  Because we all know that money is fungible, funding abortion-\npromoting groups to conduct family planning programs overseas permitted \nthese groups to extend their international presence, increase their \nabortion activities, and lobby more aggressively to weaken laws \nrestricting abortion overseas. The Reagan/Bush policies helped protect \nour international family planning programs from the controversy that \ninevitably arose through their association with private pro-abortion \ngroups. With the protection of the Mexico City policy, funding for our \ninternational family planning programs increased from $251 million in \n1987 to $434 million in 1993.\n  One of President Clinton's first actions after his inauguration in \n1993, however, was to rescind the Executive order that put the Mexico \nCity policy in place. Because of the President's action, suddenly this \nonce again became one of our most controversial foreign aid programs.\n  This Congress has an opportunity to reinstate the sensible family \nplanning policies of Mexico City. I commend my colleague from Arkansas, \nSenator Hutchinson, for his leadership in introducing legislation that \nwould return family-planning funding to the principles set forth by \nPresidents Reagan and Bush. I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of \nthis important legislation.\n  There is a reason why last fall's Omnibus Appropriations Act delayed \nexpenditures for this program so that some of the expenditures of the \nmoney would not actually be spent until next year. This was the result \nof a delicate compromise between the Congress and\n\n[[Page S1521]]\n\nthe administration. The administration was offered the choice. The \nCongress was willing to lift all restrictions on the rate of spending \nfor overseas family planning funds, but only if the administration \nwould refrain from funneling those funds through abortion advocacy \ngroups like the International Planned Parenthood Federation. I would \nnote that the Clinton administration preferred to keep funding \nrestrictions in place so that it could continue administering the \nprogram through pro-abortion groups.\n  Now the administration wants to undo this compromise. The \nadministration wants all funding restrictions lifted. At the same time, \nthey refuse to accept the sensible Reagan/Bush policies that protected \nthis program from the contentious abortion debate.\n  Groups supporting this resolution have argued that a more rapid \nexpenditure of these funds by groups that perform abortions and lobby \naggressively for abortion-on-demand laws would, in the long term, \nreduce the rate of abortions around the world. This Senator, however, \nfails to understand the logic of funding pro-abortion groups to advance \nthis pro-life objective. It is a simple fact that the rate of abortions \nincreases dramatically whenever a country legalizes abortion. I do not \nbelieve sending more U.S. taxpayer dollars to an international network \nof clinics run by groups that conduct abortions is likely to reduce the \nnumber of abortions worldwide.\n  Mr. President, the answer to ensuring the long-term health and \nwelfare of women across the world and stabilizing the world's \npopulation is not to promote abortion overseas as a population control \nalternative with U.S. taxpayers' hard-earned dollars. The answer is to \npromote free markets and individual liberties in underdeveloped \ncountries. Over two-thirds of the world's recent fertility decline can \nbe accounted for by the expansion of economic opportunity and personal \nfreedoms, as women across the world are given access to greater \neducational and lifetime opportunities. Freer markets, more education \nand information and more opportunities for the world's women--that's \nthe answer.\n  Mr. President, I would gladly vote to remove spending restrictions on \nthis program if the administration would agree to protect it from abuse \nby pro-abortion advocates. But under the legislative procedures we have \nbefore us today, that sensible option is not available. Therefore, I \ncannot support this resolution, and urge its defeat.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this week, the Senate will have the \nopportunity to vote on two measures related to international family \nplanning. One, House Joint Resolution 36, which is supported by the \nClinton administration, would release population control funds on March \n1, instead of July 1. The funding could not be meted out any faster \nthan 8 percent of the total appropriated for fiscal year 1997 per \nmonth--a limitation recommended by the President's Chief of Staff last \nyear. But the funds could be made available to groups that provide \nabortions or lobby in support of more liberal abortion policies abroad.\n  The alternative measure--the so-called Smith-Oberstar bill, H.R. \n581--would provide for the immediate release of all fiscal year 1997 \npopulation control funds, subject to conditions that would preclude \ntheir use for abortion-related activities. In other words, Smith-\nOberstar would ensure that the funds are used for what we all say is \nintended here--family planning, not abortion.\n  I would point out that both measures passed the House of \nRepresentatives on February 13. But the Smith-Oberstar bill, which \npassed that Chamber with more votes than the President's proposal, \nwould make about $170 million more available for the population control \nprogram than would President Clinton's plan. And, as I just noted, it \nwould guarantee that the funds are used for their intended purpose--\nfamily planning--not for abortion or lobbying in support of more \nliberal abortion policies abroad. It would reinstate the Mexico City \npolicy, a policy initiated by the Reagan administration at the 1984 \nU.N. conference in Mexico City, attaching certain conditions to the way \nforeign organizations can use the American people's hard-earned tax \nmoney.\n  Mr. President, there were two main conditions associated with the \nMexico City policy. First, an Agency for International Development \n[AID] grantee, getting U.S. tax money for family planning overseas, \ncould not be involved in abortion, even with its own resources.\n  Second, that grantee could not lobby or pressure foreign governments \non the abortion issue.\n  At the crux of this debate is a simple question: Why did President \nReagan establish those conditions for receipt of American tax dollars? \nOnce we understand the answer to that question, we can get this debate \ninto its proper focus.\n  Let us start with this fundamental principle: Any nongovernmental \ngrantee of the United States abroad--which includes, of course, all the \norganizations that receive U.S. population assistance funds--is, in \neffect, an agent of the United States.\n  It does not matter how the group puts its own money to use. What \nmatters is that, when we give them American dollars, we give them our \nseal of approval, too. An AID grant confers more than just funds. It \nbestows respectability, standing, and clout. It is, in effect, an \nofficial endorsement.\n  And that is why, for decades, we have always imposed all sorts of \nrestrictions and requirements upon AID grantees. We do so in \nrecognition of the fact that money is fungible. Give a million dollars \nto an organization, and you free up a million dollars of its own money \nfor other activities.\n  Far more important though, we all understand that an AID grant marks \nan organization as acceptable, ideologically and ethically, to the \nUnited States.\n  Back in 1984, President Reagan saw that AID grants to groups involved \nin abortion overseas presented an ethical dilemma. Yes, it was their \nown money they were using to perform or promote abortion. But every \ndollar they got from American taxpayers freed up another dollar for \ntheir abortion-related work.\n  President Reagan understood that the international community viewed \nthose abortion groups as quasi-official agents of the U.S. Government. \nAnd for good reason. Private organizations, having the imprimatur of \ntaxpayer funding, could well be viewed by foreign leaders as speaking \non behalf of the U.S. Government about abortion-related policies.\n  In fact, some AID grantees openly ran pro-abortion lobbying \ncampaigns, with their own resources of course, in countries where \nabortion was not legal.\n  Their money, freed up by AID grants, gave them access to local media \nand local officials. In country after country, they ran sophisticated--\nand effective--campaigns in favor of abortion.\n  And they are still doing it. The tiny island nation of Mauritius is \nan example of the worldwide effort being waged by the International \nPlanned Parenthood Federation. This is what IPPF said in its own report \non activities in Mauritius:\n\n       As a direct result of the advocacy campaign, the policy \n     climate in Mauritius has changed favourably . . . The MFPA \n     (Mauritius Family Planning Association, a member of the IPPF) \n     is determined to maintain the momentum, and sees its role \n     more stimulating as it contributes to the wave of change.\n\n  There is a fundamental issue here: Should funds be earmarked for \nfamily planning as intended, or should taxpayers be required to fund \nlobbying activities with which they might disagree? While there is \ngeneral consensus in favor of family planning, most people do not \nbelieve tax dollars should be used for lobbying activities.\n\n  Back in 1984, President Reagan did not like the idea of our grantees \npressuring foreign governments--particularly with the appearance of an \nofficial endorsement by the government of the United States.\n  That is why he made a distinction, in his Mexico City white paper, \nbetween what foreign governments do with their money, and what our \ngrantees do with their money.\n  Foreign governments that might be involved in abortion would not be \nseen as agents of the United States, but AID grantees would be seen in \nthat light.\n  So in his Mexico City policy, President Reagan gave AID's population \ngrantees a choice. If they wanted to remain eligible for future grants, \nthey would have to promise not to get involved with abortion or \nabortion lobbying overseas, even with their own money.\n\n[[Page S1522]]\n\n  And the program worked very effectively with that kind of policy in \nplace. While the Mexico City policy was in effect, the program provided \nfunds to about 400 organizations worldwide, accounting for nearly half \nof the combined pool of family planning funds made available by donor \nnations. And as I recall, the amount of money appropriated for \ninternational family planning rose considerably during the Reagan-Bush \nyears.\n  Only two grantees--albeit two very powerful grantees--chose to put \nabortion advocacy ahead of their commitment to family planning. Their \ninvolvement in abortion was apparently so deep that they were willing \nto cripple the family planning work of even some of their own \naffiliates that were willing to accept the Mexico City conditions \nduring those years.\n  So when we are told today that the Mexico City policy--like the \nprovisions of the House-passed Smith-Oberstar bill--would wreck \ninternational family planning, we need only look back on past \nexperience to see what effect it really had.\n  Mr. President, past experience tells us that almost every AID \npopulation grantee would put its commitment to family planning head of \nits involvement in, and lobbying for, abortion. Only one or two would \nnot.\n  This country's approach to international family planning is seen \naround the world as part of our foreign policy. And those few grantees \nthat are zealous in their support for abortion should not be allowed to \ncall the shots for what is really an arm of American foreign policy.\n  So the question the Senate faces this week is not how much money the \nAID population account will get in March or in July. The question is \nwhether, as a matter of American foreign policy, the prestige of the \nAmerican Government and the resources of the American people should \nsupport family planning on the one hand, or a worldwide campaign for \nabortion on demand on the other.\n  If that issue had been better understood when the House of \nRepresentatives voted on this matter earlier this month, the \nPresident's resolution might not have been approved.\n  Mr. President, I want to conclude by quoting President Reagan, when \nhe first enunciated the Mexico City policy in the early 1980's. He \nsaid:\n\n       The basic objective of all U.S. assistance, including \n     population programs, is the betterment of the human \n     condition--improving the quality of life of mothers and \n     children, of families, and of communities for generations to \n     come. For we recognize that people are the ultimate \n     resources--but this means happy and healthy children, growing \n     up with education, finding productive work as young adults, \n     and able to develop their full mental and physical potential.\n\n  That goal should not be held hostage to the Clinton administration's \ndemand that we fund groups involved in abortion and in abortion \nlobbying. Fortunately, we do have an alternative, as embodied in the \nSmith-Oberstar bill. That is the legislation the Senate should vote to \nsend to the President this week.\n  Mr. President, it is a shame that some people seem to care more about \npromoting abortions and related policy than providing family planning \nservices abroad. I ask unanimous consent that a column by Robert Novak \nabout that be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. If we are going to get back to the old policy--a successful \npolicy that ensured funds were made available promptly and used for \npopulation assistance as intended--we need to reinstate limitations \nsimilar to the Mexico City policy. When we can be sure that the funds \nare to be used for their intended purpose--that is, for family \nplanning--I believe we will find a large consensus that will support \nthe program. I, for one, will do so under those circumstances.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 13, 1997]\n\n                        Family Planning Showdown\n\n                           (By Robert Novak)\n\n       President Clinton's strategy for keeping U.S. funding of \n     global population control free of restrictions on abortion \n     was exposed in a remarkable speech delivered by the first \n     lady two months ago in La Paz, Bolivia.\n       Hillary Rodham Clinton, addressing the Sixth Conference of \n     Wives of Heads of State and Governments of the Americans on \n     Dec. 3, declared: ``Some members of the U.S. Congress have \n     voted to limit American support for family planning \n     initiatives. My husband's administration remains committed to \n     encouraging a continuation of these investments.''\n       That left pro-life members of Congress open-mouthed in \n     outrage. The ``limit'' on contraceptive help to poor \n     countries that Mrs. Clinton deplored was proposed last year \n     not by them but by her husband's chief of staff at the time, \n     Leon Panetta. The Clinton administration's position: better \n     take less birth control money than accept antiabortion \n     restrictions. The House itself will choose which course in a \n     showdown vote today.\n       President Clinton, who as governor of Arkansas espoused a \n     moderate pro-life position, is now joined at the hip with \n     extreme abortion rights advocates. From his veto of the \n     partial-birth abortion bill to his current stance on world \n     population control, he will not risk alienating the feminist \n     support that is critical to Democratic success.\n       The current dispute began in August 1984, when the \n     International Conference on Population held in Mexico City \n     adopted language urged by Reagan-appointed U.S. officials. \n     The nations of the world signed a report urging all \n     governments to ``take appropriate steps to help women avoid \n     abortion, which in no case should be promoted as a method of \n     family planning.'' President Ronald Reagan then issued an \n     executive order applying the Mexico City language to U.S. \n     foreign aid. No longer would Uncle Sam be violating local \n     religious and cultural norms that oppose abortion.\n       Some 350 foreign organizations complied, but the London-\n     based International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) \n     refused to certify that it would not promote abortion for \n     family planning. Indeed, IPPF's current ``Vision 2000'' is a \n     battle plan for fighting abortion prohibitions worldwide. \n     Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who along with other \n     administration officials denies that the United States funds \n     abortions abroad, in House testimony Tuesday said she had \n     never heard of ``Vision 2000.''\n       On Jan. 22, 1993, two days after taking office, Clinton \n     signed an executive order repealing the Mexico City language. \n     With Undersecretary of State Timothy Wirth pushing hard, \n     population control money increased dramatically amid overall \n     fiscal restraint. In two years, funding increased by 79 \n     percent to $582.7 million.\n       Republicans took control of Congress in January 1995 and \n     sought to restore antiabortion restrictions. To break a \n     deadlock last September, the Republican leadership offered \n     this compromise; Organizations that followed the Mexico City \n     language would receive full funding; those that refused--such \n     as IPPF--would get 50 percent.\n       No soap, said Panetta, Instead, he made a counter-offer at \n     6:30 in the morning on Saturday, Sept. 28, after an all-night \n     negotiating session in the Capitol seeking an omnibus \n     spending agreement. Panetta proposed a 35 percent reduction \n     of family planning spending (the same as the rest of the \n     foreign aid budget). In other words, accept less money for \n     population control rather than accept antiabortion \n     restrictions. Abortion has precedence over contraception. \n     Facing another politically ruinous government shutdown, the \n     Republicans had no alternative other than to say yes.\n       The agreement also mandated a vote in the House (to be held \n     today) on full funding without the Mexico City language. But \n     pro-lifers will also offer an alternative co-sponsored by \n     Republican Rep. Christopher Smith of New Jersey and \n     Democratic Rep. James Oberstar of Minnesota for even fuller \n     funding--$713 million compared with $543.6 million--but \n     including the Mexico City language.\n       Vice President Al Gore has met privately in a strategy \n     session with abortion-rights advocates, and White House aides \n     have been whipping up public support. They have spread \n     propaganda that the Smith-Oberstar, amendment represents a \n     double cross that undercuts support of family planning. All \n     of this is incorrect.\n       Even if Smith-Oberstar passes both houses of Congress, a \n     presidential veto is likely. That would cause spending to \n     revert to the present $420.4 million level, with no \n     restrictions on IPPF or other abortion advocates. Here is not \n     a fight about contraception but about abortion.\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, today, the issue before the Senate \nis whether or not to approve the release of desperately needed \ninternational family planning funds 5 months after the start of the \nfiscal year or 9 months after the start of the fiscal year. This is not \na tough decision, we should have released the money months ago; our \nfailure to release the family planning funds has caused unnecessary \nharm to women, children, and families around the globe. However, since \nwe do not have the ability to go back in time and release the funds at \nthe beginning of the fiscal year, I urge my colleagues to prevent \nfuture harm and to support the President's request and release the \nfamily planning funds on March 1.\n  In this increasingly global economy, it is in the United States' best \ninterest\n\n[[Page S1523]]\n\nto provide international family planning assistance to developing \ncountries around the world. As the Rockefeller Foundation reports, ``* \n* * resource scarcities, often exacerbated by population growth, \nundermine the quality of life, confidence in government, and threaten \nto destabilize many parts of the globe * * *. Thus in a world made \nsmaller by global commerce and communication, such scarcities affect us \nin the United States. Civil unrest can alter the balance of power in \nkey regions, destabilize nations with large populations and extensive \nresources, or contribute to humanitarian disasters that call for \nassistance and peacekeeping services.'' The rate of population growth \nis often inversely related to the rate of economic growth.\n  In addition, developing countries provide a significant expanding \nmarket for U.S. goods. Unrest and instability can lead to a decrease in \nexports and thus a decrease in the number jobs here at home. The lack \nof jobs in a developing country, resulting from the ever expanding work \nforce, can also drive down wages and lead to job loss in this country \nby forcing U.S. workers to compete with low-wage workers overseas.\n  Developing nations with increasingly desperate needs for resources \nhave also been known to over use their natural resources to the \ndetriment of the long-term environmental stability of the nation and of \nthe world.\n  International family planning funds allow women to choose to have \nfewer and thus healthier children. In turn, studies show that when \nfamilies can count on healthier children, they are likely to have fewer \nchildren. This limits population growth around the globe.\n  Clearly, there are many other reasons to support international family \nplanning, including the documented decrease in abortions that results \nfrom access to family planning assistance and the decrease in infant \nand maternal mortality. The people of the United States have been \noutspoken in their support for programs that improve the health and \nsafety of women and their babies and that provide alternatives to \nabortion as a method of family planning.\n  Despite the great importance of family planning, not only for \nindividuals and families, but also for the economic well being of many \nnations including the United States, the last Congress sustained a 35-\npercent cut in international family planning funds, a cut that was \nfirst enacted in fiscal year 1996. This cut was enacted despite the \nfact that there are still 230 million women worldwide, one out of every \nsix women of childbearing age, that do not have sufficient access to \nmodern contraceptive methods and despite the fact that we will soon \nhave the largest population of women of child bearing age ever.\n  A study conducted by family planning and population organizations in \nearly 1996 predicted that the 35-percent cut in funding would result in \nan estimated additional 1.9 million births, 1.6 million abortions, \n8,000 maternal deaths in pregnancy and 134,000 infant deaths.\n  This study did not even consider the effect of the delay in the \nrelease of funding that was part of both the fiscal year 1996 and \nfiscal year 1997 budgets. The fiscal year 1997 budget prevents funds \nfrom being released until 9 months into the fiscal year, and even then \nonly a percentage of the funds can be released every month.\n  An additional 4 month delay in the release of funds would result in a \nfurther reduction in international family planning funds in fiscal year \n1997 of $123 million, or one-third of the money appropriated. In \naddition, because the agencies and organizations can only receive the \nfunds in small increments, there is no economy of scale in the purchase \nof contraceptives, and there is no consistency in the ability to \nprovide needed services.\n  As part of the agreement that allows these funds to be released at \nall, there is a provision that allows the President to determine that \nthe funding limitations are having ``a negative impact on the proper \nfunctioning'' of the international family planning program and request \nearly release of the funds. The Congress is required to vote by the end \nof February on whether or not to release the funds in March. Supporting \nthe early release of funds cannot undo the damage caused by the current \ndelay or by the significant cuts already incurred. It can, however, \nensure that 17 bilateral and international organizations are not left \nin urgent need of funds, that women have access to safe, effective \ncontraceptives in the next few months, and that unintended, unsafe \npregnancies are prevented.\n  The United States has a 30-year commitment to working with \norganizations and governments around the world to provide women and \ntheir families with the ability to decide freely and responsibly the \nnumber and spacing of their children, improving maternal and infant \nhealth, and improving the security and independence of women's lives.\n  Some in Congress question the success of these efforts. The U.S. \ncommitment, however, has been a success by every measure. In countries \nin which the United States has joined in family planning efforts, the \naverage number of children a woman bears has decreased from six to \nthree. The number of women utilizing modern contraceptives has grown \nfrom 10 to 50 percent. The U.S. provides people around the world with \nthe opportunity to plan for the safest births and the healthiest \nchildren possible.\n  Unfortunately, international family planning has become tangled up in \nthe debate over the ability of a woman to choose to terminate a \npregnancy. There are those who believe that fully funding the \ninternational family planning program would lead to increased \nabortions. In fact, no U.S. international family planning funds are \nused for abortion or abortion related services. It is already against \nthe law and that law is rigorously enforced. In addition, if women are \nnot able to access safe, modern contraceptives, there will certainly be \nan increase in abortion, along with maternal and infant deaths.\n  Part of the appeal of linking international family planning and \nabortion is that many in the United States are concerned with the \namount that we spend overseas and do not want funds to pay for \nactivities that are not funded in the United States, like abortions, or \nto fund programs that coerce women into not having children. No \ninternational family planning money is spent on abortions or related \nservices, or on programs that coerce women into making certain family \nplanning decisions. In addition, just about 1 percent of our entire \nbudget is spent on foreign aid of any sort, and only a fraction of that \nfunding is spent on humanitarian aid, such as family planning.\n  Last year, Congress agreed to provide family planning funds to \ncommunities around the world because the need is there and support for \nthe program exists. Congress should not prevent the funds from being \nspent by delaying the release for months beyond the start of the fiscal \nyear.\n  By voting for the immediate release of funds, we will be voting \nagainst maternal and infant ill health and death, and against increased \nabortions worldwide. We will be voting to strengthen the global economy \nand preserve our environment. We will keep faith with our duty to \nprovide constructive leadership in the world. I urge my colleagues to \nvote to release the funds now so that women and children around the \nglobe can be safe and healthy.\n  Mrs. Murray. Mr President, the Senate will soon vote to affirm or \nreject President Clinton's decision to seek the prompt release of \ninternational family planning moneys already appropriated for fiscal \nyear 1997. Let me be crystal clear on this point, the question before \nthe Senate is the release of moneys already agreed to by this body. \nVirtually every Senator who served in the last Congress has already \nvoted to support international family planning. And it is worth noting \nthat the fiscal year 1997 appropriation for international family \nplanning is significantly reduced from previous years' funding levels; \na 35 percent cut from the fiscal year 1996 figure.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support and I do urge all of my colleagues \nto support President Clinton's decision to seek the early release of \nthe $385 million appropriated by the 104th Congress for fiscal year \n1997. Traditionally, the Senate in bipartisan fashion has supported the \nPresident's position on this issue. And I want to commend the House of \nRepresentatives for earlier\n\n[[Page S1524]]\n\nagreeing to the President's request to release the monies for \ninternational family planning.\n  The politics of extremism and misinformation have turned this into a \nmuch larger vote than it should be. The American people should watch \nclosely the results of the vote on this issue. They will get an early \nglimpse of whether the popular rhetoric about working together is real \nor simply a political ploy to mask the politics of division and \nconfrontation that most agree was denounced in last fall's election by \nthe American people.\n  Today the world's population has swelled to more than 5 billion \npeople, with nearly 100 million more added each year. Without strong \nleadership in support of voluntary family planning programs, experts \npredict that in just over 30 years the world's population is likely to \ndouble to more than 10 and possibly as many as 13 billion people. Since \nthe mid-1960's, our country has led the global effort to combat \npopulation growth. Currently, the Agency for International Development \nprovides assistance in more than 60 countries through nearly 100 \nprograms.\n  Importantly, USAID is prohibited by U.S. law from using taxpayer \ndollars to pay for abortions as a method of family planning or to \nmotivate an individual to seek an abortion. USAID contracts contain \nlegally binding provisions forbidding abortion as family planning and \nstrict procedures including staff monitoring and regular audits are in \nplace to ensure that no U.S. taxpayer moneys go to pay for abortions \nabroad. Those who argue this issue is about abortion are engaging in a \ncampaign of misinformation and deceit.\n  Current U.S. international family planning moneys are actually \nreducing the frequency of abortions abroad. Thus it makes no sense to \nme that the opponents of abortion have decided to grade legislators on \nthis vote. Rather, they should be supporting these programs with the \nsame vigor they now display in opposition. Consider the recent program \nexample of Russia. Between 1990 and 1994, the use of contraception \nincreased from 19 percent to 24 percent of the population. As a result, \nthe number of abortions in Russia over that period decreased by \n800,000. Russian women used to have, on average, two to three abortions \neach over a lifetime. Family planning programs are already at work \noffering alternatives to abortion for women and families. All across \nthe former Soviet Union and in countries like Mexico and Columbia, \nthere is a body of evidence that suggests increased contraceptive use \nactually reduces the number of abortions. If the Senate rejects \nPresident Clinton's request to release the 1997 international family \nplanning moneys, the result will be more abortions performed worldwide.\n\n  I want to get away from abortion because that is truly not what \ntoday's debate is about. I want to focus for a few minutes on what \ninternational family planning moneys do accomplish and the importance \nof continued U.S. leadership in this area. United States international \nfamily planning programs are perhaps the most successful foreign aid \nprograms ever supported by U.S. taxpayers.\n  International family planning is about women's health. Death from \npregnancy related conditions is the No. 1 cause of death for women in \ndeveloping countries. According to Amnesty International, almost \n600,000 women per year die because of pregnancy related causes. The \ndeath of a mother in the developing world is particularly tragic for a \nfamily seeking to escape poverty as these women are usually both the \nprincipal care givers for children and a wage earner. U.S. foreign \nassistance moneys have increased the availability of quality \nreproductive health care, including women-centered, women-managed \nservices.\n  International family planning is about child survival. It is \nestimated that nearly 35,000 children under the age of 5 die every day \nin the world's developing countries. Allowing families to space the \nbirthing of children will ensure healthier mothers better able to \nbreast feed and care for children. Increased access to family planning, \ncombined with other factors, could reduce child survival in the \ndeveloping world by 20 percent. Rejecting the President's request for \nthe release of the 1997 moneys will surely set back efforts to reduce \nthe number of children who die each and every day in countries like \nIndia, Bangladesh, and Uganda.\n  International family planning is about helping young girls worldwide. \nCultural preferences for sons in the developing world has dire and \nsometimes deadly results for young girls. Throughout the developing \nworld girls are fed less; girls do not get adequate health care; and \ngirls do not get the opportunity to attend school. And we all know of \nthe documented cases where infanticide is practiced against young girls \nbecause of a preference for sons. It is somewhat ironic that many who \nrail against this treatment of young girls in China and other countries \nwould now seek to further restrict or end United States international \nfamily planning programs that do so much to better the lives of young \ngirls.\n  International family planning programs are fundamental to preserving \nthe endangered natural environment of our planet. We all know of the \npunishing toll that the world's population takes upon the earth: the \nair we breath; the clean water we require for healthy and sanitary \nliving; and the arable land available to feed the population. More than \none-half of the world's developing population is below the age of 25. \nAnd the number of women of reproductive age in the developing world \nwill soon total nearly 1 billion. Our population problems and the \nramifications for the United States are growing. The U.S. commitment to \ncombat overpopulation of our planet is shrinking. It is a \nresponsibility I believe we must not shirk.\n  The Senate has the opportunity to send a message of hope and \nopportunity to the women of the world today, and particularly those \nwomen in the developing world seeking to make a better life for \nthemselves and their families. It is really that simple. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in voting for the resolution to release this \ncrucial funding.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate will now resume consideration of \nSenate Joint Resolution 1, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S. J. Res. 1) proposing an amendment to \n     the Constitution of the United States to require a balanced \n     budget.\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the joint resolution.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 8\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will resume the debate on the Reid \namendment No. 8 until the hour of 6 p.m., with the time equally divided \nin the usual form.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 20 minutes to the junior Senator \nfrom Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 20 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first I thank the Senator from Nevada for \nyielding on this important amendment. It is interesting; if you ask the \nAmerican people about the balanced budget amendment, they will say in \noverwhelming numbers it is a great idea. I have to balance my \ncheckbook. Why shouldn't the Federal Government have to balance its \nbooks?\n  But then you say, well, what if in the process of balancing the books \nthe Federal Government jeopardizes the Social Security trust fund? \nWhoa. Wait a minute. Let us think about this. The people who were \noverwhelmingly for the balanced budget amendment have second thoughts, \nas well they should.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Nevada addresses that very \nreal concern. In our pursuit to balance the budget, let us not do it at \nthe expense of Social Security. That is simple. The Senator from Nevada \noffers this amendment in good faith, asking Members on both sides of \nthe aisle, Republicans and Democrats, to come together and agree on \nthis basic premise: yes, we will balance the budget but not at the \nexpense of Social Security.\n  Some would say this is a pretty simple proposition. Why are you \ndebating this? Frankly, because there is a very serious difference of \nopinion, and it gets down to the fundamental flaw in this \nconstitutional amendment. We are debating what is its greatest flaw, \nthe failure of this measure to protect Social Security. The balanced \nbudget amendment includes the Social Security trust fund in the \ncalculation of whether the budget is in balance. That means it uses the \nSocial Security trust fund to balance the rest of the Federal budget in \nthe near term and prevents the proper use of the Social Security trust \nfund surplus to offset growing benefit payments in the long term. That \nis not the way to treat Social Security, a program which for 60 years \nhas taken our parents and grandparents and their grandparents before \nthem out of poverty into dignity. That is why I voted, and I will \ncontinue to vote, only for versions of the balanced budget amendment \nthat protect Social Security by excluding the Social Security trust \nfund.\n\n  We hear a lot of witnesses. We have them come before us to talk about \nthis balanced budget constitutional amendment, as well we should. I say \nto those listening, in 205 years of this Nation's history we have only \namended that great document, the Constitution, 17 times. Let us be \ncareful. Let us listen to the counsel of those who come to speak to us.\n  I was particularly struck by the testimony of one gentleman, called \nby my friend from Utah, the chairman of the committee, as a witness in \nfavor of this balanced budget amendment. This gentleman was a Wall \nStreet financier who holds a senior position in a major investment \nfirm. He didn't see the issue of Social Security quite the same way \nthat I do. He argued that excluding Social Security from the budget \ncalculation--here are his words--``would be like going on a low-calorie \ndiet but not counting chocolate.''\n  I was struck by that analogy, that this man decided that, in the \nscheme of life, in the scheme of things, in the scheme of those \nprograms and those things that are important to American families, \nSocial Security was like chocolate candy. For 43 million Americans, let \nme suggest, Social Security is not like candy. It is not a luxury; it \nis a necessity.\n  In my home State of Illinois, visit small-town America, find the \nwidows living in town, the senior citizens living in the highrises, and \nask them what Social Security means each month. You know what it means. \nIf you have spoken to your parents and grandparents, you know it is the \nbread of life. It is what sustains so many people. For this witness, \ncalled by the majority, called by those who support the balanced budget \namendment, to say that it is like chocolate candy really suggests to me \nthat perhaps financiers, or Wall Street, see life a little differently \nthan people who live on Main Street.\n  The balanced budget amendment before us--and let me get to the heart \nof this--includes the trust fund in the budget calculation. It invites \ncuts in Social Security to balance the budget. That has always been my \nfear: Down the line the economy goes bad, revenues are decreasing, \npeople are paying fewer taxes because they are out of work, and as a \nconsequence here we are, trying to figure out how are we going to \nbalance this budget next year. We do not have enough money coming in \nbecause people are unemployed, for example. So where do we turn? Where \nis there money? This is serious business. We cannot turn around and \nraise taxes in a recession. It is not popular at any time; it is very \nunpopular in a recession. Where do you turn?\n  Lo and behold, where is the mother lode of Federal money? Open the \ndoor to the Social Security trust fund, billions of dollars being \ncontributed to the fund today by those of us who are working, including \nMembers of the Senate and House of Representatives, to build a balance \nso when the day comes that this Senator and those of like age turn up \nto ask for Social Security, the money will be there. Understood.\n  Future Congresses should not be allowed to raid the Social Security \ntrust fund, take away the savings that we planned for the rainy day \nthat we know is coming, and use it to balance the budget. That is why \nthe Senator from Nevada offers his amendment. Let us play this game \nfair. Let us say to the American people, ``If you put the money in, in \neach of your paychecks, for Social Security in hopes it will be there \nfor yourself, for your parents, that it be there.'' It seems so \nobvious.\n  Now let us take a look at Social Security in the long term. Those who \nwant to include Social Security in the budget calculation argue that \nour proposal to protect Social Security would invite future Congresses \nto run deficits 32 years from now when the trust fund is exhausted. \nThis concern is unfounded. Current law does not allow the Social \nSecurity trust fund to run a deficit. If the trust fund runs out of \nmoney, it cannot keep writing checks.\n  Second, Congress has never authorized the Social Security trust fund \nto run an extended deficit. For a temporary time, around 1982 when \nthere was a pending bankruptcy in the fund, we got close to that \nproposition, but only for time enough to develop a bipartisan solution.\n  Third, the American people are not going to allow the Social Security \ntrust fund to be depleted. This is the single most popular program in \nAmerica today, not just for seniors but for their children. It gives \npeace of mind to me to know that my mother, 87 years old, who is living \non railroad retirement, an analogous program to Social Security, has a \nmonthly check coming in based on her having worked during the course of \nher life. And it means, for me and my children, less of a concern about \nher financial security.\n\n  We are not going to turn away from that. We are never going to walk \naway from that. We are not going to allow the Social Security trust \nfund to be depleted. But we are not going to stand still and allow this \nbalanced budget amendment to create a raid on Social Security. That is \nwhy this amendment is being offered. It just stops me cold to hear \nthose on the other side say, ``We'll never touch Social Security. Trust \nus.''\n  I trust the Senator on the floor. I am not sure I will trust his \nsuccessor, or his successor's successor, who will be bound by this same \nconstitutional amendment. I don't know who they will be. I don't know \nwhat they will face. But at a minimum, let us put in this great \ndocument, this Constitution, language which protects our values. The \nReid amendment does that.\n\n[[Page S1526]]\n\n  The Congressional Research Service is an interesting group because \nit's a professional organization, neither Democrat nor Republican. They \nare here to work for us, and if we have tough questions, we often turn \nto them to say, ``What's the honest answer here? Don't give me the spin \nfrom the Republican National Committee or the Democratic National \nCommittee; give it right down the middle, black and white, as best you \ncan determine.'' They recently identified a critical reason for \nsupporting Senator Reid's amendment. ``The balanced budget amendment as \ncurrently drafted would prevent the proper use of the trust fund \nsurplus to pay extra benefits that the baby boom generation will have \nearned but which will exceed revenues when they retire.''\n  Here is what it means. We are paying more in Social Security today, \nand have since 1983, than we need to pay out. As I said earlier, we are \nbuilding up a surplus because we know down the line, when baby boomers \nlike myself show up for their Social Security, we are going to have \nmore people knocking on the window asking for checks than wage earners \npaying in. So we are building up a balance, we of this generation, \nwhich will inure to our benefit down the line. So this surplus is being \nbuilt up in the Social Security trust fund. But, if you read this \namendment to the Constitution closely, the amendment offered by the \nchairman of the committee, you will see there is a problem. The problem \nis you cannot spend that surplus out of the Social Security trust fund \nwithout making up for it somewhere else. That is a major flaw. Let me \ntell you what it means in practical terms.\n  Suppose I told you that a number of years from now you will face \nincreasing expenses related to your retirement. You might decide to \nsave up some money now so it will be available when that time comes. \nYou might even decide to put the money in a special account in the bank \nand say, I am going to keep track of it and I am not going to touch it. \nI am going to need this when I retire.\n  Now suppose I told you when the day came and the expenses occurred, \nyou were welcome to spend the money that you have personally saved but, \none condition, in order to spend the first dollar out of your savings \nyou have to cut a dollar out of your spending, a dollar that you would \notherwise spend for food or clothing or rent or utilities.\n  You say, ``Wait a minute, why did I save all this money if when the \ntime comes when I need it I have to cut other expenditures, dollar for \ndollar, to use it? That is no good. That is no savings. That does not \nhelp me.'' Let me say to my colleagues, that is exactly what is wrong \nwith this amendment. This amendment says: In future generations, if we \npass the balanced budget amendment and want to use the surplus in the \nSocial Security trust fund, we can only do it if we cut other spending, \nbalance it out.\n  Is this something that this Senator came up with? Is this something \nthat the Democrats dreamed up, an interpretation of the balanced budget \namendment? No. What I have just described to you comes directly from \nthe Congressional Research Service. It is a fatal flaw in this balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  You would think that those who would propose an amendment to the \nConstitution would be open to the possibility--the possibility--that \nwhat they want to put in that Constitution is not right and needs to be \ncorrected and changed. But there has been resistance from the start to \nany amendments to this balanced budget amendment. These are the tablets \nof Moses, untouched by humans, brought to us, to this floor, to be \naccepted as is or else.\n  I don't like that approach when it comes to amending our \nConstitution. I certainly don't believe it is fair when we are dealing \nwith the fate of 43 million Americans, and I don't believe that we \nshould allow this flawed version of the balanced budget amendment to go \nforward.\n  I think the amendment offered by the Senator from Nevada, Senator \nReid, makes good sense, and I would predict this: If those who are \npushing for this balanced budget amendment would, for a moment, stop, \ncount to 10, perhaps accept a little more humble approach to this whole \ndebate and amend in the protection of the Social Security trust fund, \nthey would find a lot of Members coming forward, Democrats and \nRepublicans, who could support it. To date, they haven't done it. But \nhope springs eternal.\n  I will be voting for Senator Reid's amendment, and I hope my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle who value the importance of a \nSocial Security trust fund to the American family will join us.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, simply put, Senator Reid's amendment would \nexempt Social Security from section 1 of the balanced budget amendment, \nwhich requires that ``total outlays for any fiscal year not exceed \ntotal receipts for that fiscal year,'' unless three-fifths of each \nHouse of Congress concur. Senator Reid, and many of those who favor \nexemption of Social Security, make rhetorical points that ``we \nshouldn't balance the budget on the backs of the elderly,'' and that \n``unless exempted, the Social Security trust funds will be raided.'' \nThose are direct quotes from those who have spoken on the other side of \nthe aisle.\n  The primary paradox of this debate, in a debate full of paradoxes, is \nthe fact that removing Social Security from the protection of the \nbalanced budget amendment will create an overwhelming incentive to do \nexactly what these critics of the amendment fear, for this would focus \nbudget pressures on the Social Security trust funds that could destroy \nthe viability of the Social Security program itself. It is a folly that \nhas no real relationship to the goals sought, which should be the \nprotection of the Social Security trust funds. What they are doing is a \nrisky gimmick; it's a riverboat gamble. Frankly, it's a real mistake \nshould this amendment be adopted.\n  Furthermore--another paradox--exempting the trust funds is simply \nunwarranted. There already exists an elaborate statutory scheme of \nfirewalls.\n  Mr. President, I notice the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \nis here. I have a rather extensive statement to make. So what I will \ndo, if he cares to make his statement, I will yield the floor at this \ntime, and then I will finish my statement afterward. I ask unanimous \nconsent I not lose my right to the floor following the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will forego, so the Senator can have the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield to the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 30 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for \nyielding this time, and I join with so many of our colleagues in the \nSenate, hopefully on both sides of the aisle, as well as our senior \ncitizens all over this country in commending him for the leadership he \nhas provided on this extremely important amendment.\n  I had the chance to offer a similar amendment in the Judiciary \nCommittee's markup, and we debated some of these issues. But I think \nthe eloquence and the force and the presentation that has been made by \nthe Senator from Nevada has been extraordinarily powerful and \nincreasingly appreciated and understood by the American people, and we \nthank him for his leadership on this issue and so many others.\n  Mr. President, Social Security is America's time-honored commitment \nto senior citizens that we will care for them in their golden years. It \nsays to every citizen that if you work hard and pay into Social \nSecurity throughout your working life, Social Security will be there \nfor you when you retire. It will help you pay the rent, buy the \ngroceries, and maintain a reasonable standard of life throughout your \nretirement years.\n  Social Security is the most successful social program ever enacted. \nIt is among the most solemn obligations that any government can make to \nits citizens, and Congress should honor it and not undermine it.\n  The proposed balanced budget constitutional amendment puts the Social\n\n[[Page S1527]]\n\nSecurity contract with senior citizens in danger. If this amendment is \nadded to the Constitution, no one can guarantee you a Social Security \ncheck every month. The Rock of Gibraltar, on which this Nation's senior \ncitizens have depended for over 60 years, would be gone, replaced by \nshifting political sands. The Reid amendment prevents this unacceptable \nchange by protecting Social Security from the proposed constitutional \namendment--no ifs, ands, or buts.\n  Millions of retired citizens live from Social Security check to \nSocial Security check. They need it to arrive on time at the beginning \nof each month to pay their bills. Martha McSteen, who headed the Social \nSecurity Administration during the Reagan administration and is now \npresident of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \nMedicare, said recently:\n\n       Keeping Social Security safe from budget tampering is, \n     frankly, a matter of life and death for millions of \n     Americans.\n       For 10 million Social Security beneficiaries age 65 and \n     older, their monthly Social Security check amounts to 90 \n     percent or more of their income. Those checks keep 40 percent \n     of America's seniors out of poverty.\n\n  But under the proposed constitutional amendment, if Government \nrevenues fall unexpectedly, or if Government expenses go up, payment on \nSocial Security checks could stop.\n  Republicans say, ``Trust us.'' We reply, in the well-known words of \nPresident Ronald Reagan, ``Trust--but verify,'' and the way to verify \nis by adopting the Reid amendment.\n  Just 3 months ago, in November 1996, the House sponsors of the \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment agreed that Social Security \ncould be in trouble. As Congressmen Schaefer and Charles Stenholm said:\n\n       Under the proposed constitutional amendment, ``The \n     President would be bound at the point at which the Government \n     runs out of money to stop issuing the checks.''\n\n  Economists say there is at least a 50-50 chance in any given year \nthat the budget projections will be wrong and that under this \nconstitutional amendment, this Government will run out of money. \nEconomic forecasting is not an exact science. If budget projections are \noff by as little as 1 percent, this constitutional amendment could put \nSocial Security checks at risk.\n  Some in this debate have said that the budget that President Clinton \njust submitted to Congress counts the Social Security surpluses \nreaching a balanced budget by the year 2002. They said if President \nClinton counts Social Security in his budget, then why not count it in \nthe balanced budget constitutional amendment? But the difference \nbetween a balanced budget, which we will achieve by 2002, and a \npermanent constitutional amendment are immense, especially for Social \nSecurity.\n  In the Clinton budget, the laws protecting Social Security from the \nrest of the budget are still in place. There is nothing that President \nClinton or any other President or Congress can do to jeopardize Social \nSecurity. Under the current law, President Clinton and future \nPresidents and Congresses must balance the budget without affecting \nSocial Security. If they want to change Social Security, they have to \nchange the Social Security law directly. The last thing we should do is \nchange it indirectly by a vague constitutional amendment.\n  In its present form, this balanced budget constitutional amendment \nundercuts Social Security. Social Security would have to fight its way \non an equal basis with highway construction, defense, welfare, \neducation, and every other Federal program. Congresses have worked for \nmany years, ever since the Reagan administration first tried to cut \nSocial Security, to protect the Nation's senior citizens and Social \nSecurity from the annual Federal budget wars.\n  For 15 years, a solid bipartisan coalition of Republicans and \nDemocrats have agreed that Social Security should be safe from that \nresult. In 1983, the Greenspan commission recommended that Congress \nshould place Social Security outside the Federal budget. The commission \nsaid that we need to build up a surplus in the trust funds now in order \nto have enough funds to provide benefits to the current generation when \nthey begin to retire. Both Democrats and Republicans support that \nresult.\n  The commission's 1983 recommendations were enacted in a law sponsored \nby Senator Dole and Senator Moynihan, and their bill required Social \nSecurity to be placed off budget within 10 years. In 1985, 2 years \nlater, Congress accelerated the process by placing Social Security \noutside the rest of the Federal budget. The Deficit Control Act of \n1985, the so-called Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law, exempted Social Security \nfrom across-the-board cuts of sequestration. That law also said that \nSocial Security could never be included in the unified budget of the \nU.S. Government. Senator Gramm emphasized during the Senate debate on \nthe Gramm-Rudman-Hollings proposal, ``This bill takes Social Security \noff budget. So if you want to debate Social Security, go to the museum, \nbecause that debate is over. The President cannot submit a budget that \nsays anything about Social Security. It is not in order for the Budget \nCommittee to bring a budget to the floor that does anything to Social \nSecurity. Social Security is off budget and is a freestanding trust \nfund.''\n  From that point out, when Congress has adopted the annual Federal \nbudget resolutions, Social Security is not included. The last time \nCongress voted on a budget that included Social Security was 1985. The \nGramm-Rudman-Hollings law was approved by overwhelming majorities, 61-\n31 in the Senate and a 271 to 154 vote in the House of Representatives.\n  Then in 1990 some Members of Congress proposed to put Social Security \nback in the Federal budget, but Senator Hollings and Senator Heinz \nrejected this unwise suggestion. They insisted that Social Security \nremain off budget and the Senate approved an amendment to protect \nSocial Security by a 98 to 2 vote. In fact, the Budget Enforcement Act \nof 1990 speaks forcefully of Congress' intention to continue to protect \nSocial Security.\n  Section 13-301 of the act reads ``Exclusion of Social Security from \nall budgets''--it says plainly that Social Security shall not be \ncounted as new budget authority, outlays, receipts, deficits, or \nsurplus for the purposes of the budget of the U.S. Government as \nsubmitted by the President, the congressional budget, or the balanced \nbudget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n  In 1995, section 22 of the congressional budget resolution amended \nthe Budget Act even further to protect Social Security in a provision \nentitled the Social Security Firewall Point of Order. It said that any \neffort to include changes in Social Security in the Federal budget were \nsubject to a 60-vote point of order in the Senate. The proposed \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment would reverse these 15 years \nof steady progress in protecting Social Security. It would be turning \nits back on all of this history and expose Social Security to all the \nbudget battles that lie ahead.\n  Further, in a major recent study, the Congressional Research Service \nsuggested that the proposed constitutional amendment may actually place \nthe trust funds off limits. The funds will be sitting there and the \nSocial Security Administration will need them to write Social Security \nchecks, but if the balanced budget amendment is adopted the \nConstitution will say no.\n  Here is what the Congressional Research Service concluded in its \nanalysis for Senator Daschle on February 5:\n\n       Because the balanced budget amendment requires that the \n     required balance between outlays for that year and receipts \n     for that year, the moneys that constitute the Social Security \n     surpluses would not be available for the payment of the \n     benefits.\n\n  Therefore, the money that had been set aside, the time when more \nfunds are being paid into the Social Security benefits, at the year \n2019 when there will begin to be some deficit between the amounts paid \nin and the amounts that have to be paid out, what the Congressional \nResearch Service is saying is you will not be able to use the surpluses \nthat have been built in all of these next 20-odd years. We will have to \nonly look at the year that the money comes in and that the money goes \nout. That is, I think, understandable when you look on page 2 of the \namendment and under line 7, it says ``total outlays for any fiscal year \nshall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal year.'' Those are the \noperative words which led the Congressional Research\n\n[[Page S1528]]\n\nService to that conclusion which puts it in danger not only of the \npossibility for balancing the budget in terms of any period in the \nfuture but risks the surpluses that have been put in place over these \nnext several years.\n  Now, Republicans asked the Congressional Research Service to clarify \nits opinion. They hoped, if they asked again, they would get a \ndifferent answer, but instead the Congressional Research Service \nreaffirmed the opinion of February 12 that Social Security is at risk \nunder the proposed constitutional amendment. CRS said again that under \nthe proposed constitutional amendment when Social Security payments are \nestimated to exceed Social Security receipts from payroll withholdings, \nwhich is expected to happen beginning in the year 2013, Social Security \npayments can be made from the trust funds only if spending for other \nprograms is reduced by the same amount. In other words, for each dollar \ndrawn down from the trust fund, a dollar must be cut from education or \ndefense or some other Government program.\n  Employees have worked hard all of their lives. Social Security has \nbeen withheld from their paycheck month after month. They are expecting \nthe money to be available when they retire. But this proposed \nconstitutional amendment suddenly freezes all that money that they had \npaid in over the years. When this happened, if Social Security is not \noff budget, we would have only three choices: We could cut Social \nSecurity benefits, we could raise taxes, or we can cut billions of \ndollars from education, health, national defense, other priorities, to \nkeep the Social Security checks flowing. Clearly, Social Security \nbenefits are at risk under the proposed constitutional amendment.\n  Now, some supporters of the balanced budget constitutional amendment \nwant this result. When the Judiciary Committee was debating this \namendment on Social Security, my amendment on January 30, Senator \nHatch, the chair of the committee, said that under the constitutional \namendment Social Security ``would have to fight its way just like every \nother program.'' Senator Hatch went on to say that he believed Social \nSecurity has the easiest of all arguments to fight its way. But half of \nthe members of the Judiciary Committee rejected that position. I had \noffered the amendment to protect Social Security during the committee's \nmarkup of the proposal. The committee was evenly split on the issue, 9-\n9. So in the very committee that is responsible for this amendment, \nhalf the membership, half of the membership, believed that Social \nSecurity is at risk under the proposed constitutional amendment.\n\n  Nothing in the proposed constitutional amendment, nothing, assures \nour senior citizens that their Social Security checks will survive the \nbudget battles that lie ahead. Elderly Americans deserve more than \nexpressions of good will by supporters of the constitutional amendment. \nIf those who favor this unwise constitutional amendment are committed \nto protecting Social Security, they should write that protection in \ntheir proposal and adopt the Reid amendment.\n  President Clinton wrote to the Senate Democratic leader on January 28 \nabout the risk to Social Security, and said to Senator Daschle, ``I am \nvery concerned that Senate Joint Resolution 1, the constitutional \namendment to the balanced budget, could pose grave risks to the Social \nSecurity system.'' We cannot let that happen. I say we must--and we \nwill, balance the budget. We must--and we will take steps to protect \nSocial Security in the future. We should have that debate openly and \nhonestly, but we should not jeopardize Social Security indirectly by \nsubjecting it to the requirements of this blunderbuss constitutional \namendment. I urge my colleagues to protect the Social Security by \nsupporting the Reid amendment.\n  Mr. President, basically, just to sum up where I believe we are, if \nwe look at the record of the Congress since the recommendation of the \nGreenspan commission of 1983, Social Security amendments in 1983 to put \nSocial Security in order, and the recommendation, the unanimous \nrecommendation was that Social Security was to be considered off \nbudget, and that the commission itself urged them to do that in the \nnext 10 years. Those recommendations were adopted 58 to 14, with 32 \nRepublicans and 26 Democrats. This was a bipartisan effort to protect \nthe Social Security system.\n\n  As I mentioned before, with Social Security, unlike other items in \nthe Federal budget, people pay in in order to be able to receive later. \nI am a great supporter of education, but the students of this country \nhave not paid in previously in order to receive either a grant or a \nloan. I am a great supporter of medical and biomedical research, but \nthe researchers have not paid in in order to be able to receive \nfunding. I am a great believer in child care, but the parents have not \npaid in so that they can receive money for child care.\n  The one program people have paid into in order to receive is Social \nSecurity. That is why, Mr. President, we have the recommendations--\nunanimous recommendations--of the bipartisan commission, supported by \nthe ranking member of the Finance Committee--by Republicans and \nDemocrats alike--that said we should take the recommendations of the \nGreenspan commission and, within 10 years, adopt a proposal that would \neffectively put Social Security off budget. We didn't wait 10 years. We \nwaited 2 years. There was Gramm-Rudman-Hollings in 1985, which was \nadopted by 61 to 31, with 39 Republicans and 22 Democrats supporting. \nThis is what it said: ``Exempt Programs, section 255. Social Security \nbenefits shall be exempt from reduction under any order issued under \nthis part.'' This is in the Deficit Control Act. What they are saying \nis that we will not put at risk Social Security. And then a little \nlater in that act, they pointed out that what we had was a \nsequestration, which meant there was going to be a reduction in various \nprograms and done so on an across-the-board percentage. What happened \nin the Congress? What was accepted at that time? It said: ``The Social \nSecurity benefits program shall be exempt from reduction under any \norder.''\n  So it is saying doubly sure, don't include it, and if somehow it gets \nin, don't reduce it. This was the overwhelming position. Why? Because, \nas I stated earlier, it is the solemn pledge and commitment of the \nUnited States to our seniors, the lifeline for their lives, their well-\nbeing, their ability not to live in poverty, their ability to live with \nsome degree of respect and dignity. These are men and women who have \nbuilt this country, fought its wars and made it the great Nation that \nit is.\n  Then we had the 1990 Budget Enforcement Act, another opportunity to \ndeal with the issues in Social Security. If it was not clear enough \npreviously under the existing amendments, which have been stated, we \nhad an amendment offered by Senators Heinz and Hollings, adopted 98 to \n2. ``Exclusion of Social Security from all budgets.'' There it is \nagain. Recommended in 1983, enacted in 1985, clarified again in 1985 \nunder the sequestration. If there is going to be any question about it, \nin 1990, here is the amendment, 98 to 2, Republicans and Democrats, to \ntake it off budget. And then, in 1995, we have the firewalls, those \nwalls to try to separate the various functions of Government as to what \nareas could be cut or shifted, in terms of budget allocations. It was \nvery clear again in 1995--Social Security firewall point of order in \nthe Senate. It points out, once again, ``Not only is Social Security \noff budget, but any budget amendments affecting Social Security are \nsubject to a point of order.'' This is what they call the pay-go \nprovisions.\n\n  Once again, every indication, coming from 1983 all the way up to the \npresent time, Republicans and Democrats alike, when it came to the \nissues of dealing with budgetary considerations and the challenges that \nwe as a country were facing, said Social Security is different. Social \nSecurity is different. The reason that it is different is self-evident \nfor, I think, every Member of this body. It is because it is different \nthat we are going to treat it differently from other general budget \nexpenditures. Sure, we are going to have belt-tightening in some areas \nthat many of us would hope that we would not necessarily have. We will \nhave differences on where we ought to tighten the budget. But \nRepublicans and Democrats have repeated time after time after time \nafter time that we were going to exclude this program and let it be \nconsidered on its own, in terms of a trust\n\n[[Page S1529]]\n\nfund, because it isn't the Social Security trust fund that has brought \nus to the kinds of deficits we have had over any period of time, and it \nis not the fault of our senior citizens.\n  I am not out here today to review what actions we took in 1981 that \nset us on a path toward the growth of the large deficits. We can debate \nthat at another time. That is not relevant to this. What is relevant \nare the actions, in a bipartisan way, that have been taken at every \nsingle opportunity when this body has addressed the issues of budget. \nAnd now we are being asked in the most significant and important \nrequest of all to say that when it comes to a constitutional amendment, \nwe are going to make sure that Social Security is going to be included. \nWe are going to make sure it is going to be included.\n  How do we know that? Because when we ask to take it out, we are told \nwe can't take it out. The primary sponsors of this program have said \nthat Social Security is going to have to fight it out with the other \nprograms, is going to have to fight it out with education, fight it out \nwith national security, fight it out with other kinds of priorities for \nthe Nation. We have to ask ourselves--some of us have very recent \nmemory when we saw the kinds of potential cuts that were being proposed \nin Social Security-related programs in the last Congress--cuts in the \nMedicare Program, not unrelated to Social Security, cuts in the program \nto pay for tax breaks for the wealthiest individuals.\n  Are we going to say now that we are going to wrap this potential cut \nin Social Security in this constitutional amendment, and that somewhere \ndown the road it may be used as a piggy bank for trading off other \nkinds of budgetary requirements? I say, no. We have a chance to prevent \nthat. This body is either serious about what we have done over the last \n15 years and what we have stated to be the position of this \ninstitution, in a bipartisan way, and say Social Security is out, or we \nare telling our senior citizens that Social Security is being put at \nrisk.\n  Now, Mr. President, we have to understand some other items. There are \nthose who have said, well, if we pass the balanced budget, some of this \nlegislation will still be out there, and it might provide some \nprotection for Social Security. Well, they ought to read the \nConstitution one more time, because the Constitution is what controls \nstatutes. It is the Constitution that is the law of the land. It is the \nConstitution that will be the driving factor and force on this \nparticular issue, not what we have done in various statutes, not what \nwe have done in budget orders, not actions that have been taken by \nother Congresses. It will be the Constitution.\n\n  So what we are saying, Mr. President, is we are going to put at risk, \nif the Reid amendment is not accepted, the future in terms of Social \nSecurity. All of these actions and protections that have existed there, \nwith strong, overwhelming bipartisan support, not just simple \nmajority--98 to 2--all of that is gone with the wind, all of that is \npast, all of that is sand, all of those pillars of marble that are out \nthere are now effectively dust, in terms of protection.\n  Now, Mr. President, I know we will hear those who will say, well, the \nbest we can do for our senior citizens is to have a sound economy. That \nis fine. We are going to work for a sound economy. But let's not put \nthe senior citizens who have paid into this fund at risk in terms of \ntheir future and vital needs. This is a lifeline for our senior \ncitizens. It is a fundamental and basic commitment that we have made \nover the more than 60 years it has been in effect. It has been \nreaffirmed and reaffirmed in this body. Without the Reid amendment, we \nare putting the Social Security system at serious and grave risk. That, \nI believe, is unwise, unjustified, and wrong. I hope the Reid amendment \nwill be accepted.\n  I thank the Senator from Nevada again, and I thank my friend from \nUtah for working out the schedule.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am always happy to work out the schedule \nfor my colleague from Massachusetts and always enjoy hearing my \ncolleague. I think it is good for the acoustics from time to time, and \nit is also good for all of us who seem to talk at just a normal level. \nI always enjoy hearing my colleague, and I have enjoyed hearing him on \nthis today, as bad and as dire and stressful as he seems to think \nthings are. But then again, let's go back.\n  Simply put, Senator Reid's amendment would exempt Social Security \nfrom section 1 of the balanced budget amendment, which requires that \ntotal outlays for any fiscal year not exceed total receipts for that \nfiscal year unless a three-fifths vote of both Houses concurs. Senator \nReid, and many of those who favor exemption of Social Security, make \nthe rhetorical points that we should not balance the budget on the \nbacks of the elderly; that the Social Security trust funds will be \nraided. Poppycock. The fact is, those funds are going to be invested in \nthe very same bonds, no matter whether it is off budget or on.\n  The question is, what is the best budgetary approach to take? What is \nin the best interests of our senior citizens? What is in the best \ninterests of our senior citizens is to understand that everybody in \nCongress will protect Social Security, and it is better off having it \nin the unified budget where it has always been protected. Show me a \ntime when it wasn't. It has always been protected, at least in all the \ntime I have been here. Put aside whether it is a riverboat gamble or \nwhether it is a risky gimmick; it is pretty pathetic when you stop and \nthink about it.\n  We have heard a lot of talk about how our uses of surpluses would be \ncriminal conduct if done by business people and done in the private \nsector. But no one is going to prison around here. The fact is that \nremoving Social Security from the protection of the balanced budget \namendment would be the worst thing we could do to senior citizens. Talk \nabout a risky gimmick, a riverboat gamble.\n  The primary paradox of this debate, as I have said before, in a \ndebate full of paradoxes is the fact that removing Social Security from \nthe protection of the balanced budget amendment would create an \noverwhelming incentive to do exactly what these critics say they fear. \nFor this would focus budget pressures on the Social Security trust \nfunds that could destroy the very viability of the Social Security \nprogram itself. It is a folly that has no real relationship to the \ngoals sought. And that goal should be the protection of the Social \nSecurity trust funds.\n  Furthermore, another paradox that I will mention is that exempting \nthe trust funds is simply unwarranted. There already exists a statutory \nscheme of firewalls that protect the trust funds from Presidential and \ncongressional tampering. Nothing in the balanced budget amendment is \ninconsistent with the statutory firewall scheme that would warrant the \nfirewall protections being declared unconstitutional. The truth is, the \npassage of Senate Joint Resolution 1, the balanced budget amendment, \nwill be the best protection to Social Security that we can get.\n\n  Yet another paradox is that the Reid amendment does nothing to \nrespond to the concern that Social Security benefits will be reduced. \nThere is no language in his proposal that would protect Social Security \nrecipients from either further budget cuts or tax increases. In fact, \nthe Reid amendment expressly reserves the right to cut benefits. Get \nthat. It expressly reserves the right to cut benefits.\n  Removing Social Security from the protection of the balanced budget \namendment would weaken the financial integrity of the Social Security \nsystem. Presently, the Social Security program is producing annual \nsurpluses because the huge baby boomer generation is still working and \npaying FICA taxes into the system. But the surpluses will end no later \nthan the year 2019, when most of the baby boomers retire.\n  Moreover, under current projections, Social Security will have \nexhausted the trust funds and will be running a huge deficit by the \nyear 2029. By the year 2070, Social Security will face a startling $7 \ntrillion annual shortfall. Excluding Social Security ignores this \nproblem and places this system in dire jeopardy. Including Social \nSecurity in the budget calculations forces Congress to address the \npending crisis in a responsible manner before it becomes too late.\n\n[[Page S1530]]\n\n  Let me just explain this in more detail. Let me talk about the Social \nSecurity exemption that they are asking for here. This risky gimmick of \nexempting Social Security would open up a loophole in the amendment and \nsiphon off revenues from the trust funds. Placing the trust funds off \nbudget will harm the Social Security program and make balanced budgets \na virtual impossibility. The consequences of this could be very dire \nindeed. Further, I must emphasize that nothing in the Reid amendment \nprotects recipients from either budget cuts or tax increases.\n  Under the Reid amendment, we would have two budgets. One would be \nbased on sound principles of solvency and the other, the Social \nSecurity budget, would not be. One budget would be required to be in \nbalance unless a supermajority votes to allow a deficit. The other, the \nSocial Security budget, if they have their way, would be raided and \nbloated with costly unrelated projects. Anybody who doesn't believe \nthat has not watched this outfit for the last 28 years as we unbalanced \nthe budgets in each of the last 28 years.\n  Social Security--don't leave it out. If you leave it out, you are \ngoing to have special interest rats eating all the Social Security \ncheese, whereas if we leave it in, it is protected by the balanced \nbudget amendment. We protect it because we keep a sound, good economy. \nWe all know who these rats are. They are special interests that come in \nhere and buy their way into influence. Taking Social Security off \nbudget will subject funds to Washington special interest scavengers. \nWhen you have rats in your house, you need to plug all of the holes. If \nyou do not, they are going to find a way in.\n  If we leave Social Security off budget, new and old special interest \nspending initiatives which cannot survive or make their way if they \nhave to compete against other programs, will smell out the scent of \nSocial Security and destroy it just like these high-class rats are \ndestroying the cheese here on this chart. That is what is going to \nhappen to Social Security. We all know it.\n\n  This is a game. The people who are arguing for it, with the exception \nof a few--certainly, Senator Reid is very sincere about this--the \npeople arguing for this hate the balanced budget amendment. It puts the \nscrews to their spending programs, programs that are eating us alive \nand mortgaging our children's and our grandchildren's future. They want \nto defeat this amendment at all costs. And, therefore, they use these \nphony arguments that taking Social Security off budget is going to \nprotect it when everybody knows it will not. This loophole will not \nonly blow a hole in the balanced budget amendment, but it would also \nseriously harm Social Security.\n  Senator Reid and supporters of the Reid amendment incorrectly contend \nthat including present day Social Security surpluses in the unified \nbudget would ``raid'' the trust funds. This is a complete misnomer. \nHere is how it works. The people pay the FICA tax. The Social Security \nAdministration gets it and then sends it to the Treasury. All FICA tax \nproceeds are commingled with the general funds. The Social Security \nAdministration receives Treasury bonds in recognition of the debt--and \nthose bonds are the greatest redeemable securities in the world, United \nStates bonds. They buy them to be redeemed later. The only way they are \ngoing to be redeemed is if we have a sound economy. The only way we are \ngoing to have a sound economy is if we live within our means. We \nclearly are not living within our means.\n  These documents are just 28 years. If we put the 58 years of the last \n66 years, my goodness, what we have done to America is criminal. That \nis the where the real criminals are: people who continue to spend.\n  The fact is if you are looking for people who have committed wrongs, \nthen look to Congress, and it would be a double wrong if we moved \nSocial Security out the protection of the balanced budget amendment, \nwhere it is vulnerable, where it is out there open, where all these \nspecial-interest rats can attack it because it is the only thing left \nto be able to spend and spend and spend. That is exactly what is going \nto happen here if we do not watch out. The FICA tax, moneys that they \nget from the bonds of Social Security, are going right now for \nentitlement spending and discretionary spending. Many of these programs \nare critical programs. If you take this Social Security off budget in \nthe sense they want to in the Reid amendment, every one of the \nimportant social spending programs we have in this country, every one \nof them is going to be hurt. And in the end Social Security will be \nhurt because then there will be that much more of a push to go to that \nnice big second budget there that is not subject to balanced budget \nrequisites and hang all these programs on it. If that happens, mark my \nword, senior citizens, every one of you are going to be hurt.\n  Social Security receipts are by law used to purchase interest-bearing \nsecurities, as I have said. Nothing in Senate Joint Resolution 1 would \nchange the Social Security program, but if Social Security were removed \nfrom the protection of the Senate Joint Resolution 1 balancing \nrequirements, the trust fund really would be raided. Under the Reid \namendment, Social Security receipts would not be designated as \n``receipts'' or ``outlays,'' as under the balanced budget amendment. \nSpending Social Security surpluses, therefore, would not have to be \noffset by other receipts as it must if there is no exemption. This \ncreates a powerful, yet perverse, incentive for Congress to spend the \nsurpluses by redesigning other programs as Social Security.\n  That is what they will do to you. You know that. They want it off so \nthey can redesign other programs, call them Social Security and eat up \nthe surpluses and add to the deficit that we are all dying from right \nnow.\n  Look, it is the biggest con job I have ever seen. Sincere or not, it \nis a con job. Let me just say this. This would be real raiding because \nwhat constitutes ``Social Security'' will be expanded, with the present \nday surpluses funding newly relabeled programs, only they will be \ncalled Social Security, and they will just continue to spend just like \nwe have been doing for 58 of the last 66 years. This is only 28 of \nthose unbalanced budgets, the last 28.\n  If projects are not immediately redesignated Social Security as I \njust discussed, thereby consuming accumulated Social Security \nsurpluses, surplus proceeds would be used in the only possible manner \nthat would avoid section 1's prohibition on outlays exceeding receipts, \nand that is to make debt repayment.\n  Normally, this would be wonderful, but, in fact, it creates a \ndangerous mechanism for the Congress to continue deficit spending if we \nadopt the Reid amendment. If the surplus is used to pay down the public \ndebt, the total debt level will be reduced, creating a gap between the \npublic debt total and the statutory debt ceiling. As a result, Congress \nwould then be able to increase spending out of Social Security, which \nis not constrained by a balanced budget rule, without immediately \nbumping into the statutory debt ceiling. This would in essence allow a \nfuture Congress to again increase the Nation's debt without facing the \nbalanced budget amendment's required three-fifths vote. Thus, any \nsurplus generated by Social Security and used to pay off the debt would \nbe squandered because the Congress could simply deficit spend under the \nSocial Security exemption until the statutory debt ceiling is reached. \nThis scenario would not be possible if Social Security was not exempted \nfrom the balanced budget amendment.\n\n  This secondary loophole constitutes an indirect way of using surplus \nSocial Security receipts.\n  So, Mr. President, through one loophole or another, the Reid \namendment would drain off the Social Security surpluses in the short \nterm and fail to protect Social Security from tremendous deficits in \nthe long term. Consequently, the Reid amendment not only fails to \nprotect Social Security but is a risky gimmick, a riverboat gamble that \nwill endanger the trust funds.\n  The net effect of the loopholes will be the depletion of the trust \nfunds years early. When the balanced budget amendment does take effect \nin the year 2002, the trust funds will stop growing as all annual \nsurplus funds would be reallocated for programs that have been \nredesignated Social Security. So instead of growing from 2002 to 2019, \nthe years the trust funds are estimated to stop growing, the system\n\n[[Page S1531]]\n\nwould become stagnant. Exemption of Social Security from the balanced \nbudget amendment will consequently speed up the system's demise.\n  If you do not believe that, then you have not watched Congress over \nthe last 28 years. I think there might be some logic to what they say \nif you really stretched the cord, if you did not have the good old 28 \nyears of unbalanced budgets sitting here, knowing the Congress cannot \nstop spending unless there is something in the Constitution that says \nwe have to stop; you have to start living within your means; you have \nto start budgeting; you have to start doing what is right for the \nAmerican people and especially the future of our children.\n  Removing Social Security from the protection of Senate Joint \nResolution 1 would make balancing the budget virtually impossible. \nBased on the gimmickry of the past, the most likely scenario Congress \nwill follow is to pass legislation to fund any number of programs off \nbudget through the Social Security trust funds. The budget could be \nbalanced simply by shifting enough programs into the Social Security \ntrust funds. Where would the senior citizens be then? You would be the \nones who are being ripped off. You talk about criminal conduct.\n  Congress could simply add to an exempted Social Security enough \nbudget items to make up any deficit from the official budget. Congress \ncould then eliminate the deficit by simply transferring costly programs \nto the exempted Social Security program. We would have a balanced \nbudget but on paper only. Talk about a risky gimmick.\n  FICA taxes have grown significantly over the years. Odds are that the \nloophole would only accelerate this increase. In fact, all kinds of new \n``Social Security'' taxes would be enacted such as a ``Social \nSecurity'' income tax or a ``Social Security'' value-added tax. As this \nprocess continues, the loophole created by this exemption by the Reid \namendment would easily swallow both the spending and taxing provisions \nof the balanced budget amendment.\n\n  The balanced budget amendment will allow the use of Social Security \nsurpluses to fund benefits.\n  Some Senators have proffered another argument in support of removing \nSocial Security from the protections of Senate Joint Resolution 1. They \nallege that the very wording of the balanced budget amendment will not \nallow the use of surpluses in following years. This is so, they claim, \nbecause in succeeding years the spending for benefits from the saved \nsurpluses becomes ``outlay'' under the constitutional amendment. They \ncreated quite a storm when they claimed that a CRS memorandum confirmed \nthis. The only problem with their elaborate theory is that it is wrong.\n  Simply put, Mr. President, I must say once more that passage and \nratification of the balanced budget amendment will not harm the Social \nSecurity Program. In fact, the very passage of Senate Joint Resolution \n1 will help stabilize the program. CRS never concluded that the \nbalanced budget amendment will harm Social Security. I believe that the \nCongressional Research Service memorandum my friend from Nevada was \nalluding to was, unfortunately, quoted out of context.\n  Let me explain. The CRS memorandum, dated February 5, that my \ncolleague was alluding to, did not conclude in any way whatsoever that \nthe balanced budget amendment would harm Social Security. All the CRS \nmemorandum concluded was that, assuming the Social Security surplus \nsurvived through to the year 2019, the year Social Security will start \nrunning huge annual deficits, this previously accumulated surplus could \nbe used to help pay for future deficits but only if it is offset by \nrevenue or budget cuts.\n  Now, despite what my good friend asserted, under the balanced budget \namendment, assets of the Federal Treasury could be drawn upon to ensure \npayments to beneficiaries when the system starts running deficits, \nannual deficits, that is.\n  To clear up any confusion, the Congressional Research Service \nproduced another memorandum dated February 12, 1997, at Senator \nDomenici's request. This memorandum stated ``We,'' that is, the \nCongressional Research Service, ``are not concluding that the trust \nfund surpluses could not be drawn down to pay beneficiaries. The \nbalanced budget amendment would not require that result.''\n  So where is the problem? In the near future, when Social Security \nruns in the red, the Congressional Research Service concluded that \nunder the balanced budget amendment, ``The trust funds will be drawn \ndown to cover the Social Security deficit in that year, and the \nTreasury will have to make good on the securities with whatever moneys \nit has available.''\n  Senator Mack and I also requested that the Congressional Research \nService clear up any confusion concerning the use of the February 5 CRS \nmemorandum. CRS stated, in a letter dated February 14, that its \nmemorandum was quoted out of context, and reiterated that under the \nbalanced budget amendment, Federal receipts, including Social Security \nsurpluses, could be used to pay for Social Security benefits.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter dated February 14, 1987, be \nprinted in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   Congressional Research Service,\n\n\n                                      The Library of Congress,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 14, 1997.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: This letter is in response to inquiries \n     made by you and Senator Mack about the conclusions CRS was \n     reported to have reached in various responses to requests \n     about the impact of the pending Balanced Budget Amendment \n     (BBA) on the Social Security program. We note that you were \n     engaged in a debate about these responses on the Senate floor \n     on February 12, 1997.\n       Let me first say that CRS will always seek to respond to \n     the specific needs of the congressional requestor, but will \n     do so in a manner consistent with our obligation to provide \n     research and information that is accurate and nonadvocative. \n     We place the highest importance on these characteristics of \n     our work and make every possible effort to maintain them. I \n     want to assure you that CRS has applied these principles in \n     responding to requests on the question of the BBA's effects \n     on Social Security.\n       Although the National Journal's ``Congress Daily AM'' \n     report of February 12, 1997 and other subsequent press \n     accounts suggest that CRS drew a conclusion in a February 5, \n     1997 memorandum to Senator Daschle that Social Security would \n     be threatened by the enactment of the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment (BBA), we did not.\n       In fact, we were careful in that memorandum to make sure \n     the reader understood that there was a range of possible \n     outcomes. We realize that considerable attention was drawn to \n     the following statement in the memorandum:\n       ``Because the BBA requires that the required balance be \n     between outlays for that year and receipts for that year, the \n     moneys that constitute the Social Security surpluses would \n     not be available as a balance for the payments of benefits. \n     [The word `surpluses' here was referring to the accumulated \n     securities held by the Social Security trust funds.]''\n       The reader, however, only needed to go to the next and \n     final paragraph of the memorandum to know that we were not \n     concluding that this would be a problem for Social Security. \n     It stated:\n       ``Now, of course, this does not mean that Social Security \n     benefits could not be paid. If the rest of the receipts into \n     the treasury for a particular year exceed outlays, this \n     amount could be used to offset the Social Security deficit. \n     And, again of course, tax or expenditure provisions, or both, \n     could be altered to create a new balance.''\n       We came to realize from the immediate Congressional \n     inquiries we received that there was a perception among some \n     Members and staff that the statement, when taken in \n     isolation, meant that if the BBA were enacted, the Social \n     Security trust funds could not be drawn down to pay benefits \n     if in any year the program was running a deficit. The \n     statement in question simply was referring to how the \n     drawdown from the trust funds would be scored under BBA \n     accounting rules, not to what would happen to the program or \n     trust funds. Nevertheless, in responding to subsequent \n     congressional requests, we addressed this perception. In a \n     February 12, 1997 memorandum prepared for Senator Domenici, \n     which he inserted in the Congressional Record the same day, \n     we pointed out first that\n       ``the Trust Funds will be drawn down to cover the Social \n     Security deficit in that year, and that the Treasury will \n     have to make good on those securities with whatever moneys it \n     has available.'' [Congressional Record, February 12, 1997, \n     pp. S1294, 1295.]\n       We further pointed out that the earlier statement--that the \n     drawdown from the trust funds would not count as receipts \n     under BBA scoring rules--was not a conclusion by CRS that the \n     trust Funds surpluses could not be drawn down to pay \n     benefits. In fact, we said that the BBA would not require \n     that result.\n       In both instances, CRS was asked specific questions on the \n     same issues, but from different Members with different \n     perspectives,\n\n[[Page S1532]]\n\n     and we gave consistent answers. I further would point out \n     that in a CRS memorandum for general congressional \n     distribution prepared February 7, 1997 for the purpose of \n     discussing the impact of the BBA on Social Security \n     generally, where we did not have to respond to a specific \n     question from a Member, we made a similar statement about the \n     topic:\n       ``Regardless of whether Social Security is included in \n     calculating the budget, under the intermediate projections \n     [of the 1996 Social Security trustees' report] its outlays \n     must be reduced or its revenues increased to avoid insolvency \n     in 2029. Whether it is more or less likely that these changes \n     would occur if Social Security were or were not included in \n     the Balanced Budget Amendment is a matter of conjecture.'' \n     [Memorandum entitled ``Analysis of effects of the balanced \n     budget amendment on Social Security, including the effect of \n     enactment of H.R. 3636,'' by Geoffrey Kollmann, February 7, \n     1997]\n       With numerous CRS staff from different disciplines \n     responding to questions from many Members and offices with \n     varying perspectives, which is a common occurrence on major \n     legislative issues, we are conscious of the possibility that \n     we could approach and respond to questions about an issue \n     inconsistently. Consequently, we expend considerable effort \n     to coordinate our analyses and responses, particularly \n     through the extensive CRS review process. On this particular \n     issue, I believe we have taken a consistent position on what \n     we do know and don't know about the impact of the BBA on \n     Social Security, both in responses to specific questions from \n     individual Members and in our general products.\n       In closing, I would emphasize again the importance CRS \n     attaches to its unique role as a source of accurate and \n     balanced research and information. I trust this communication \n     has demonstrated our commitment to preserving the reputation \n     for integrity that we have earned from the Congress over \n     eighty years.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Daniel P. Mulhollan,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Furthermore, to nail the point home, the nonpartisan \nConcord Coalition entered the fray. In a memorandum dated February 18, \n1997, the Coalition concluded that the Senate position--that if the \nbalanced budget amendment does not exempt Social Security it will \nsomehow nullify Social Security benefits and prevent payments of \nbenefits to retired baby boomers--is, and I quote, ``nonsense.'' Let me \nquote further.\n  ``What the balanced budget amendment would do is to raise national \nsavings, and thus make Social Security--along with the myriad other \nclaims on tomorrow's economy--more affordable. It would be ironic \nindeed if concern about funding Social Security, whether real or \npretended, turns out to be the issue that sinks the balanced budget \namendment.''\n  ``Let us be clear,'' they go on to say, ``The balanced budget \namendment would in no way alter the status of the Social Security trust \nfunds.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article entitled ``Facing Facts, The \nTruth about Entitlements and the Budget, A Fax Alert from The Concord \nCoalition,'' dated February 18, 1997, be printed in the Record at this \npoint.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Concord Coalition, Feb. 18, 1997]\n\n              More Nonsense on Social Security and the BBA\n\n       Last week, Senator Byron Dorgan and several like-minded \n     colleagues held a news conference at which they warned that \n     if the balanced budget amendment (BBA) does not exempt Social \n     Security it will somehow nullify the program's trust-fund \n     surpluses and prevent Congress from paying promised benefits \n     when Boomers retire. This conclusion, they said, has been \n     corroborated by the Congressional Research Service (CRS).\n       All of this is nonsense. What the BBA would do is to raise \n     national savings and thus make Social Security--along with \n     the myriad other claims on tomorrow's economy--more \n     affordable. It would be ironic indeed if concern about \n     funding Social Security, whether real or pretended, turns out \n     to be the issue that sinks the BBA.\n\n\n                          a deficit time bomb\n\n       Let's be clear: The BBA would in no way alter the status of \n     the Social Security trust funds. After enactment of the BBA, \n     the Treasury IOUs held in the trust funds would be precisely \n     as meaningless as they are today. With or without the BBA, \n     these ``assets'' can only be redeemed if Congress hikes \n     taxes, cuts other spending or borrows more from the public to \n     raise the cash. The BBA, by requiring that the unified budget \n     be in balance in every future year, would simply curtail the \n     borrowing option--which, in effect, is all CRS says.\n       Apparently, what the senators really want is some guarantee \n     that Congress translate Social Security's trust-fund \n     surpluses into genuine economic savings by running unified \n     budget surpluses of equal size. This may be a laudable policy \n     goal--and there is nothing in the BBA to prevent Congress \n     from pursuing it. But embedding trust-fund accounting in the \n     Constitution by exempting Social Security from the BBA is a \n     terrible idea.\n       Why? While the Social Security trust funds are officially \n     projected to run modest surpluses until 2019, thereafter they \n     are due to run ever-widening deficits. And once the deficits \n     begin, the BBA-cum-exemption would allow Congress to run a \n     unified budget deficit equal to the Social Security trust-\n     fund deficit every year. By 2025, the allowable annual \n     unified budget deficit would rise to $315 billion; by \n     2040, it would rise to $2.1 trillion. if the economy takes \n     a dip, moreover, deficits could begin much sooner--by \n     2007, according to the Trustees' high-cost projection. In \n     this case, a BBA that goes into effect in 2002 would \n     guarantee very little near-term addition to national \n     savings--but would allow a Niagara of deficit spending in \n     future years.\n       And even this assumes that legislators won't redefine \n     ``Social Security'' so that the exemption becomes an \n     immediate highway for any amount of deficit spending. With \n     the White House now proposing to keep Medicare ``solvent'' by \n     shuffling outlays between its trust funds, such shenanigans \n     hardly seem farfetched.\n\n\n                            time to wake up\n\n       It's time we focus less on process and more on substantive \n     economic results. Trust-fund accounting is (and always has \n     been) an arbitrary legislative artifact. Whether a trust fund \n     is in surplus or deficit has little economic relevance. What \n     does matter is the net difference between total federal \n     revenues and outlays, otherwise known as the unified budget \n     balance.\n       The senators should wake up and look around. The principal \n     effect of their exemption would be to allow the nation to run \n     huge unified budget deficits at a time when a massive age \n     wave will be straining the productive capacity of America's \n     younger generations.\n       Yes, it probably is sound policy to run unified budget \n     surpluses today to boost our lagging savings rate and prepare \n     for the coming demographic transformation of our society. But \n     let's not do so merely to fulfill some narrow trust-fund \n     logic--and especially not as way to justify and allow massive \n     budget deficits in the future.\n       Right now we find ourselves waist deep in deficit water. \n     The purpose of the BBA is to require Congress to raise the \n     deck above water and keep it there. The Social Security \n     exemption would defeat this purpose. As for running budget \n     surpluses, nothing in the BBA prevents Congress from doing so \n     whenever it so decides.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Even more important, yesterday, the very same Concord \nCoalition revealed a major analysis studying the effects of exempting \nSocial Security from the unified budget.\n  This is the Balanced Budget Amendment and Social Security, the \nConcord Coalition Issue Analysis, 97-1, dated February 24, 1997, as of \nyesterday. Because of the significance of the analysis, let me quote \nits major conclusion:\n\n       Trust fund accounting is, and always has been, an arbitrary \n     legislative artifact. Whether a trust fund is in surplus or \n     deficit has little economic relevance. What does matter is \n     the net difference between total Federal revenues and \n     outlays, otherwise known as the unified budget balance.\n       Although some Senators and Representatives mistakenly \n     believe that exempting Social Security from the balanced \n     budget amendment would protect boomer retirees, it would, in \n     reality, do nothing to guarantee future Social Security \n     benefits, which would remain mere statutory promises, subject \n     to change by Congress at any time.\n\n  ``Instead,'' and let me go to this next chart--``Instead,'' it says:\n\n       . . . legislators should focus on how the balanced budget \n     amendment without an exemption for Social Security would \n     strengthen the Social Security program and the ability of our \n     Nation to finance retirement benefits not only for the baby \n     boom generation, but for succeeding generations as well. The \n     BBA, the balanced budget amendment, would raise national \n     savings and thus make Social Security--along with Medicare \n     and other claims on tomorrow's economy--more affordable.\n\n  That's a statement of the Concord Coalition, The Balanced Budget \nAmendment and Social Security--6, in 1997.\n\n       The Concord Coalition is a nonpartisan group made up of \n     Democrats and Republicans, business people and nonbusiness \n     people, people who are concerned about fighting these budget \n     battles in an appropriate way. They do not have any axes to \n     grind except they are leading the fight to try to balance the \n     budget. They are not playing games with the letters from the \n     Congressional Research Service. Which really has occurred in \n     this matter.\n\n  ``Right now we find ourselves waist deep in deficit water,'' the \nConcord Coalition goes on to say.\n\n       The purpose of the balanced budget amendment is to require \n     Congress to raise the deck above water and keep it there. The \n     Social Security exemption would defeat this purpose.\n\n\n[[Page S1533]]\n\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the Concord Coalition's Issue \nAnalysis 97-1, the Balanced Budget Amendment and Social Security, \nprinted in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Concord Coalition, Feb. 24, 1997]\n\n           The Balanced Budget Amendment and Social Security\n\n                          Issue Analysis 97-1\n\n       On February 5, 1997, the American Law Division of the \n     Congressional Research Service (CRS) issued a one-page \n     memorandum (Appendix 1) evaluating whether the proposed \n     balanced budget amendment (S.J. Res. 1) would preclude, at a \n     future time, the use of Social Security trust fund surpluses \n     to pay out benefits. This memorandum was Exhibit One at a \n     press conference held by Senator Byron Dorgan and several \n     like-minded colleagues to warn that the balanced budget \n     amendment to the Constitution (BBA) would somehow nullify the \n     program's trust-fund surpluses and prevent the payment of \n     benefits when the baby boom generation retires.\n       In fact, the CRS memorandum did not buttress the Senators' \n     point. After explaining that payments from the trust fund \n     would, indeed, count as federal outlays, the CRS memorandum \n     stated explicitly.\n       ``. . . this does not mean that Social Security benefits \n     could not be paid. If the rest of the receipts into the \n     Treasury for a particular year exceed outlays, this amount \n     could be used to offset the Social Security deficit.''\n       Because the point of the February 5 memorandum was so \n     widely misreported to say the opposite of what the author \n     intended, CRS issued a second, clarifying memorandum on \n     February 12. (Appendix 2) The second memorandum stated,\n       ``We are not  concluding that the Trust Funds surpluses \n     could not be drawn down to pay beneficiaries. The BBA would \n     not require that result. What it would mandate is that, in as \n     much as the United States has a unified budget, other \n     receipts into the Treasury would have to be counted to \n     balance the outlays form the Trust Funds and those receipts \n     would not be otherwise available to the Government for that \n     year. Only if no other receipts in any particular year could \n     be found would the possibility of a limitation on drawing \n     down the Trust Funds arise. Even in this eventuality, \n     however, Congress would retain authority under the BBA to \n     raise revenues or to reduce expenditures to obtain the \n     necessary moneys to make good on the liquidation of \n     securities from the Social Security Trust Funds.''\n       These two CRS memoranda make clear that the Senators' \n     allegations are nonsense.\n\n\n                          a deficit time bomb\n\n       Let's be clear: The BBA would in no way alter the status of \n     the Social Security trust fund. After enactment of the BBA, \n     the Treasury IOUs held in the trust fund would be precisely \n     as meaningless as they are today. With or without the BBA, \n     these ``assets'' can only be redeemed if Congress hikes \n     taxes, cuts other spending, or borrows more from the public \n     to raise the cash. This bears repeating: even if the BBA is \n     never enacted, when the time comes to draw several hundred \n     billion dollars from the Trust Fund in a particular year in \n     order to pay benefits, the money to turn the government bonds \n     held by the Trust Fund into cash will have to be found \n     somewhere, and it will have to be found in that year. These \n     funds can come from only three sources: raising taxes, \n     reducing other spending elsewhere in the budget, or borrowing \n     from the public. The BBA, by requiring that the unified \n     budget be in balance in every future year, would simply \n     curtail the borrowing option--which, in effect, is all the \n     CRS memoranda say.\n       Apparently, what some Senators and Representatives really \n     want is some kind of guarantee that Congress translate Social \n     Security's short term trust-fund surpluses into genuine \n     economic savings by running unified budget surpluses or equal \n     size. This is a laudable policy goal--and there is nothing in \n     the BBA to prevent Congress from pursuing it. In fact, the \n     Concord Coalition hopes that Congress will run substantial \n     surpluses during extended periods of peacetime prosperity, \n     and we invite Senators and Representatives to work with us on \n     budget plans that not only reach balance by 2002 but contain \n     credible, equitable, and politically realistic policies to \n     achieve annual surpluses shortly thereafter roughly equal to \n     Social Security surpluses.\n       But embedding trust-fund accounting in the Constitution by \n     exempting Social Security from the BBA is a terrible idea.\n       Why? While the Social Security trust funds are officially \n     projected to run modest surpluses until 2019, thereafter they \n     are due to run ever-widening deficits. These deficits will \n     not be a temporary phenomenon that will subside once the \n     period of the baby boomers' retirement is over. The boomers' \n     retirement marks the abrupt beginning of what will be a \n     permanent demographic shift. The analogy is not a python \n     trying to swallow a pig; the analogy is a python trying to \n     swallow a telephone pole.\n       While one might be able to make a case for borrowing money \n     to ride out a temporary crisis, no one can justify trying to \n     borrow our way out of a permanent change. Once the deficit \n     begins, the BBA with the Social Security exemption would \n     allow Congress to run a unified budget deficit equal to the \n     Social Security trust-fund deficit every year. By 2025, the \n     allowable annual unified budget deficit would rise to $315 \n     billion; by 3040, it would rise to $2.1 trillion. If the \n     economy takes a dip, moreover, deficits could begin \n     much sooner--by 2007, according to the Trustees' high-cost \n     projection. In this case, a BBA that exempts Social \n     Security that goes into effect in 2002 would guarantee \n     very little near-term addition to national savings--but \n     would allow a Niagara of deficit spending in future years.\n       And even this assumes that legislators won't redefine \n     ``Social Security'' so that the exemption becomes a \n     superhighway for any amount of deficit spending. With the \n     White House now proposing to keep Medicare ``solvent'' by \n     shuffling outlays between its trust funds, this hardly seems \n     farfetched.\n\n\n                            time to wake up\n\n       It's time we focus on substantive economic results. Trust-\n     fund accounting is (and always has been) an arbitrary \n     legislative artifact. Whether a trust fund is in surplus or \n     deficit has little economic relevance.

The BBA would raise \n     national savings and thus make Social Security--along with \n     Medicare and other claims on tomorrow's economy--more \n     affordable.

Briefly \n     stated, the contention is that the terms of the proposal, if \n     proposed and ratified, would preclude, at a future time when \n     Social Security outlays in a particular year begin to exceed \n     Social Security receipts in that particular year, the use of \n     surpluses built up in the Social Security trust funds to pay \n     out benefits.\n       At the present time, surpluses are being accumulated in the \n     Social Security trusts funds, at least as an accounting \n     practice, as a result of changes made in 1983. It is expected \n     that when the receipts into the funds fall below the amount \n     being paid out that moneys from the surpluses will be used to \n     make up the differences.\n       The BBA would have its impact on this legislated plan \n     because under Sec. 1 of the proposal ``[t]otal outlays for \n     any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that \n     fiscal year, . . . .'' Under Sec. 7 of the BBA, the two terms \n     are defined thusly: ``Total receipts shall include all \n     receipts of the United States Government except those derived \n     from borrowing. Total outlays shall include all outlays of \n     the United States Government except for those for repayment \n     of debt principal.''\n       Therefore, under the BBA's language, there is mandated a \n     balance in each year of the outlays that year and the \n     receipts that year. Payments out of the balances of the \n     Social Security trust funds would not be counted as \n     Government receipts under the BBA, when in the year 2019, or \n     whenever the time occurs, the receipts in those particular \n     years into the Social Security funds are not adequate to \n     cover the outlays in those years. That is, payments out of \n     the trust fund surpluses could not be counted in the \n     calculation of the balance between total federal outlays and \n     receipts. Because the BBA requires that the required balance \n     be between outlays for\n\n[[Page S1534]]\n\n     that year and receipts for that year, the moneys that \n     constitute the Social Security surpluses would not be \n     available as a balance for the payments of benefits.\n       Now, of course, this does not mean that Social Security \n     benefits could not be paid. If the rest of the receipts into \n     the Treasury for a particular year exceed outlays, this \n     amount could be used to offset the Social Security deficit. \n     And, again of course, tax or expenditure provisions, or both, \n     could be altered to create a new balance.\n\n                                            Johnny H. Killian,\n\n                                                Senior Specialist,\n     American Constitutional Law.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Appendix 2\n\n                                   Congressional Research Service,\n\n\n                                      The Library of Congress,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 12, 1997.\n     From: American Law Division.\n     Subject: Treatment of Outlays from Social Security Surpluses \n         under BBA.\n       This memorandum is in response to your inquiry with respect \n     to the effect on the Social Security Trust Funds of the \n     pending Balanced Budget Amendment (BBA). Under S.J. Res. 1 as \n     it is now before the Senate, & I would mandate that ``[t]otal \n     outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts \n     for that fiscal year .  .  .  .'' Outlays and receipts are \n     defined in Sec. 7 as practically all inclusive, with two \n     exceptions that are irrelevant here.\n       At some point, the receipts into the Social Security Trust \n     Funds will not balance the outlays from those Funds. Under \n     present law, then, the surpluses being built up in the Funds, \n     at least as an accounting practice, will be utilized to pay \n     benefits to the extent receipts for each year do not equal \n     the outlays in that year. Simply stated, the federal \n     securities held by the Trust Funds will be drawn down to \n     cover the Social Security deficit in that year, and the \n     Treasury will have to make good on those securities with \n     whatever moneys it has available.\n       However, Sec. 1 of the pending BBA requires that total \n     outlays for any fiscal year not exceed total receipts for \n     that fiscal year. Thus, the amount drawn from the Social \n     Security Trust Funds could not be counted in the calculation \n     of the balance between total federal outlays and receipts. We \n     are not concluding that the Trust Funds surpluses could not \n     be drawn down to pay beneficiaries. The BBA would not require \n     that result. What it would mandate is that, inasmuch as the \n     United States has a unified budget, other receipts into the \n     Treasury would have to be counted to balance the outlays from \n     the Trust Funds and those receipts would not be otherwise \n     available to the Government for that year. Only if no other \n     receipts in any particular year could be found would the \n     possibility of a limitation on drawing down the Trust Funds \n     arise. Even in this eventuality, however, Congress would \n     retain authority under the BBA to raise revenues or to reduce \n     expenditures to obtain the necessary moneys to make good on \n     the liquidation of securities from the Social Security Trust \n     Funds.\n\n                                            Johnny H. Killian,\n\n                                                Senior Specialist,\n                                      American Constitutional Law.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. The Reid amendment will make it harder to balance the \nbudget. And it will harm not only Social Security, but other social \nprograms.\n  Furthermore, in another paradox, the exclusion of the present-day \nsurpluses in the budget would make it extraordinarily difficult to \nbalance the budget by the year 2002, the date Senate Joint Resolution 1 \nmandates balancing. Between now and the year 2002, the surplus is \nestimated to be over $500 billion; over $500 billion. On this chart we \nhave 10 years of the surplus. You will notice at the bottom the \nsurpluses are worth $1.067 trillion, that is 10 years from now. Mr. \nPresident, $1.067 trillion is more than our expenditure this year on \nMedicare, education, veterans' benefits, the environment, national \ndefense, Social Security, transportation, and infrastructure and \nnational resources combined. In fact, between the year 2002 and 2019 \nwhen Social Security outlays will exceed receipts, the trust fund is \nexpected to earn more than $1.9 trillion.\n  Where do supporters of the Reid amendment propose to come up with the \nmoney necessary to cover this supposed shortfall? This is an annual \nsurplus average of approximately $100 billion each year. According to \ncurrent budgetary figures, $100 billion per year is more than our \ncurrent annual expenditure on education, the environment, \ntransportation and infrastructure. Where will we come up with the money \nif this goes off budget to fund these programs if we exclude Social \nSecurity surpluses from the unified budget, and if we are serious about \ngetting to a balanced budget by the year 2002? Show me the money. We \nare going to have to come up with $1.067 trillion, and it is going to \nhave to come out of these programs that are critical programs, if you \nfollow this amendment that the distinguished Senator from Nevada has \nfiled here.\n  Federal programs would have to be cut under his amendment, or taxes \nraised by that amount to reach the balanced budget goal. If the \nAmerican people think they are taxed enough now, wait until they have \nto be taxed to make up part or all of $1.067 trillion in the next 5 \nyears. Keep in mind, the fact of the matter is, Social Security goes \nfrom the people to the Social Security Administration, funds go into \nthe Treasury, and then they are invested, the surplus funds are \ninvested in bonds that go back to the Social Security Administration to \nbe redeemed later. They happen to be invested in the most important \nsecurities in the world. The only way we are going to be able to pay \nthose bonds is if we have a balanced budget amendment without any \ngimmickry or games, and especially risky gimmicks at that, that \nliterally help us to have a good enough economy to redeem those bonds.\n  If we do not do that, then many of these discretionary spending \nprograms such as Head Start, education, entitlement spending programs \nsuch as veterans' pensions and benefits are going to be seriously \nharmed. It is just that simple.\n  Additionally, I have to point out again, not all of President \nClinton's budgets have included the Social Security surpluses in their \ncalculations. Doesn't that bother you, that the President says, ``Oh, I \nthink we ought to take Social Security out just like Senator Reid \ndoes?'' Why doesn't he? Why doesn't he take it out? Because he knows he \ncannot even make a claim to getting close to a balanced budget without \nthose surpluses and he also knows he would have to cut most of the \nexpensive social welfare programs that he and most of us up here would \nlike to keep going in the best interests of people.\n\n  Indeed, Secretary Rubin, the Secretary of the Treasury, testified in \na recent judiciary hearing, that without including the surpluses in \nbudget calculations, it would be virtually impossible to arrive at a \nbalanced budget. In his recent press conference President Clinton \nadmitted the same when he confessed, and this is what he said, \n``Neither the Republicans nor I could produce a balanced budget \ntomorrow that could pass if Social Security funds cannot be counted.'' \nAnd the reason is because those surpluses are now being used to help \nbalance the budget. But the obligation will be the same. The bonds are \nstill going to be there. It will still be invested in bonds, whether \nthe Reid amendment passes or whether we continue the same system. So, \nto say if we were in the private sector doing this we would all go to \njail is not only a misnomer, or a misstatement, the fact is that we are \nputting them into the securities that are the only great securities in \nthe world.\n  But they are only as great as this country is. And if this country \ncontinues to spend into bankruptcy, we will not have the money to \nredeem those securities. If we do what the distinguished Senator from \nNevada wants done here, we will not have the monies. Then you really \nwill harm those trust funds by putting them out there all alone, not \nsubject to balanced budget requisites, not subject to any reforms that \nneed to take place with regard to the whole budget as a whole, but out \nthere, vulnerable to the special interest rats who come along and eat \nit like cheese.\n  The Social Security trust funds consist not of cash but of debt \nsecurities, as this chart shows. And they will be, whether this \namendment passes, the Reid amendment passes, or not. But these debt \nsecurities have to be paid back.\n\n  How do you pay them back if you don't get the country's spending \nunder control? If you look at reality--that is these 28 budgets that \nhave been unbalanced since 1968--how are we going to get spending under \ncontrol so we can pay back those bonds and redeem those bonds and pay \nback that money to the Social Security fund?\n  Part of the problem in addressing the Social Security issue in this \ndebate results from the confusing terminology used by our opponents. \nThey complain that the present trust fund surplus will be ``raided'' if \nwe have a unitary budget that includes Social Security. But the fact is \nthe Social Security trust funds are not a giant wallet of $100 bills or \n$1,000 bills or gold, for that matter. The\n\n[[Page S1535]]\n\nFICA tax receipts come from the people to the Social Security \nAdministration, and the bonds are given to the surplus, which are used \nto balance the budget today, and it will be the same system if the Reid \namendment is adopted. The only difference is there is no balanced \nbudget amendment. That is the only difference.\n  (Mr. GORTON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. HATCH. The Social Security FICA tax receipts are used to pay \nbenefits, and any excess is, by law, loaned to the Treasury to pay \nother Federal obligations in exchange for Treasury bonds. These bonds \nare interest-bearing bonds. That is all. They are evidence of the debt \nthe Federal Government owes itself.\n  The most important question for future retirees is whether the \nFederal Government will be able to pay off its debts. The only way they \nwill be redeemed in the future is if a budget is balanced and we have \nenough revenue to redeem the securities.\n  Mr. President, the best protection for Social Security is passing and \nratifying Senate Joint Resolution 1. This would create the needed \ndiscipline to balance the budget. Payments on debt interest would be \nsubstantially reduced. The chance for Government default would be \nsignificantly diminished. The economy will grow at a brisker pace, \nrepayment of Social Security obligations will be more secure, and we \nwill end this process of never-ending mounting national debts, which \nhave been continuing since--well, 58 of the last 66 years, but 28 of \nthe last 28 years.\n  As I stated, the Social Security system is facing a future crisis. By \nthe year 2029, the system will be bankrupt. We will put that chart up \nand you can see, when you get up to 2029, the system is bankrupt and we \ngo into very serious deficit. Sadly, the Social Security trust fund's \nboard of trustees estimates that by the year 2070, Social Security will \nbe facing a $7 trillion annual deficit. In 1996 dollars, that amounts \nto more than $1 trillion in deficits each year. Our current total \nannual Federal budget is only $1.5 trillion. Where will we get the \nrevenue to redeem the Social Security securities, then, unless we plan \nand budget for it as required under our balanced budget amendment?\n  The trust fund securities are only a claim on the General Treasury \nfunds with no capital to back up that claim. If the country ever \ndefaults on its debts, the Social Security trust funds will suffer. For \nthis reason alone, Social Security recipients, both current and future \nand those who are concerned about them, should strongly support the \nbalanced budget amendment--for that reason alone.\n\n  The biggest threat to Social Security, therefore, is our growing debt \nand concomitant interest payments. The Government's use of capital to \nfund debt slows productivity and income growth and, thereby, lessens \nthe pool of revenues available to fund Social Security. The real way to \nprotect Social Security benefits is to pass Senate Joint Resolution 1. \nThe proposal to exempt Social Security will not only destroy the \nbalanced budget amendment, or any plan to balance the budget, but in \nall probability will also pose a real risk to the Social Security \nsystem.\n  Section 13301 of the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 does not require \nthat Social Security be placed ``off budget.'' Supporters of exempting \nSocial Security argue that section 13301 of the 1990 Budget Enforcement \nAct literally exempts Social Security trust funds from the President's \nand the Congress' budget calculations. They claim that the balanced \nbudget amendment would change this because it requires a unified \nbudget.\n  These critics of the balanced budget amendment are wrong on both \ncounts. Under section 13301(a) of the Budget Enforcement Act, the \nreceipts and outlays of the Social Security trust funds are, indeed, \nnot counted in both the President's and Congress' budgets, but only for \ncertain specific purposes. The primary purpose for this exclusion was \nto exempt Social Security from sequestration by the President under the \nGramm-Rudman-Hollings procedures and from the act's pay-as-you-go \nrequirement.\n  In addition, as added protection, sections 13302 and 13303 of the \nBudget Enforcement Act also created firewall point of order protections \nfor Social Security trust funds in both the House and the Senate. All \nthis is made clear by the conference report accompanying the 1990 act.\n  Indeed, the 1990 Budget Enforcement Act does not preclude both \nCongress and the President from formulating a unitary budget that \nincludes Social Security trust funds for national fiscal purposes. \nSurely the opponents of the balanced budget amendment are not \nsuggesting that the President of the United States and the Congress \nhave been flouting the law when they include the Social Security trust \nfunds in their respective budget calculations. Look, we all know that \nSocial Security will need reform if it is to continue to be viable over \nthe long haul. This chart shows that. There is no way that we can \ncontinue to go the way we are going without reforming Social Security.\n  We all know that, but the problem is not the inclusion of Social \nSecurity trust funds in the budget. The problem is that at the time of \nthe retirement of baby boomers, there will not be enough FICA taxes to \nfund their retirement. Moreover, the surplus Social Security taxes \nbeing collected today will not cover the future cost of the system. \nMost of the current Social Security taxes are used to cover benefit \npayments to present retirees.\n  Outlays will exceed receipts of the system in about the year 2019, \nmaybe even before. The guarantee of future benefits, therefore, will \ndepend on the Federal Government's future ability to pay benefits.\n  Not including Social Security in the budget would harm the program. \nCongress could redesignate programs as part of the exempted Social \nSecurity system. The distinguished Senator from Nevada yesterday said \nSocial Security is statutorily defined. Let's understand what that \nmeans. When something is statutorily defined, a subsequent statute can \nchange the definition of it, and that only takes a simple majority in \nboth Houses of Congress to do. Anybody who doesn't understand that \ndoesn't understand the legislative process.\n\n  Let me tell you, if you don't include Social Security in the budget, \nthe program is going to be harmed. Congress could rename anything \n``Social Security,'' as they have done before, by a simple majority \nvote. If they just name it Social Security and use the FICA taxes to \nfund these programs, then you will really see the program raided.\n  The problem that the Reid amendment raises in reality is not with the \nbalanced budget amendment, but with the problems that the Social \nSecurity Program faces. We need to fix that, and adopting the balanced \nbudget amendment and getting rid of these unbalanced budgets is a heck \nof a good start.\n  The balanced budget amendment does not overturn existing statutory \nprotections for Social Security. In a related argument that seeks to \njustify the exemption, some have argued the balanced budget amendment \nwill override the existing statutory protections for Social Security. \nContrary to this assertion, it is clear that the current statutory \nprotections for Social Security would not be eliminated by the \namendment. Of course, the supremacy clause of the Constitution provides \nthat any legislation contrary to a constitutional provision must fail. \nAs the great Chief Justice John Marshall held in the landmark 1803 \ndecision of Marbury versus Madison: An act of the legislature repugnant \nto the Constitution is void.''\n  But what critics fail to mention is that there is absolutely nothing \nin the balanced budget constitutional amendment that is inconsistent \nwith current statutory schemes. The Social Security statutory \nprotections are not legislative acts ``repugnant to the Constitution'' \nas amended by Senate Joint Resolution 1. Congress, under the balanced \nbudget amendment, can also create statutory protections for the Social \nSecurity Program.\n  Further, the Reid amendment has absolutely no protection against \nSocial Security benefit cuts. The plain fact is that the best thing we \ncan do for Social Security, the best thing we can do for retirees, and \nthe best thing we can do for all Americans is to enact the balanced \nbudget amendment without loopholes, without exemptions, and bring \nfiscal sanity and a little common sense back to Government.\n  Opponents of Senate Joint Resolution 1 who argue for a Social \nSecurity exemption contend that the balanced\n\n[[Page S1536]]\n\nbudget amendment will not in reality produce a balanced budget because \ngross debt will still rise. This is clever but it is misleading.\n  Mr. President, the balanced budget amendment does indeed require a \nbalanced budget. Outlays must not exceed receipts under section 1 of \nSenate Joint Resolution 1. But it is also true that gross debt may \nstill increase even if the budget is balanced. That is because the \nGovernment's exchange of securities for incoming FICA taxes is counted \nas gross debt. It is merely an accounting or bookkeeping notation of \nwhat one agency of Government owes another agency. It is analogous to a \ncorporation buying back its own stock or debentures. Such stock and \nbonds are considered retired obligations that once paid have no \neconomic or fiscal significance. Thus if we enact the balanced budget \namendment the debt the United States owes to everyone but itself will \nstop growing.\n  This is very different from obligations owed by the Federal \nGovernment to the public. This type of debt--termed net debt or debt \nheld by the public--is legally enforceable and is what is economically \nsignificant. If net debt zooms--because of interest payments of debt--\nwhich last year amounted to more than $250 billion--budget deficits \nballoon with all the dire economic consequences. To assure that budgets \nwill be balanced unless extraordinary situations arise, debt held by \nthe public cannot be increased unless three-fifths of the whole number \nof each House concur.\n  That net debt is considered to be of far greater economic \nsignificance than gross debt is a widely held truism among economists. \nIndeed, in the study ``Analytical Perspectives: Budget of the U.S. \nGovernment Fiscal Year 1998,'' the Clinton administration no less \nconcludes that net debt or ``borrowing from the public, whether by the \nTreasury or by some other Federal agency, has a significant impact on \nthe economy.''\n  On the other hand, the study also maintains that gross debt or debt \nissued to Government accounts ``does not have any of the economic \neffects of borrowing from the public. It is merely an internal \ntransaction between two accounts, both within the Government itself.''\n  Now, it is true that the balanced budget amendment does not by itself \nreduce the $5.3 trillion national debt. But what it does do is \nstraighten out our national fiscal house and make it orderly. Passage \nof Senate Joint Resolution 1 will increase economic growth and allow us \nto run surpluses. With this, our national debt may be decreased if \nCongress desires to do so in the interest of national economic \nstability and prosperity. Without Senate Joint Resolution 1, this would \nbe and will be an impossibility.\n  The Reid amendment, on the other hand, adds nothing to protect the \ntrust funds from accumulating debt. In fact, by creating this loophole, \nthis risky gimmick, this riverboat gamble, the Reid amendment may cause \nthe trust fund to dry up sooner and run deeper deficits. Thus, the Reid \namendment is a risky gimmick that endangers Social Security.\n  The Reid amendment is confusing and its application is going to harm \nSocial Security. Let me just say, finally, Mr. President, the Reid \namendment should be rejected because it is confusing. As I have said, \nits application may harm the Social Security Program, the very thing \nthe Reid amendment claims to protect. The amendment exempts the Social \nSecurity trust funds from the balancing requirement, but it also \nincludes the proviso ``as and if modified to preserve the solvency of \nthe Funds.''\n\n  Explicitly exempting Social Security by placing it in the \nConstitution may ``constitutionalize'' the program in perpetuity unless \na subsequent constitutional amendment provides for the program to be \naltered or abolished. As a result of the Reid amendment, do minor \ntechnical changes to Social Security every year require amendments to \nthe Constitution? The constitutional amendment process was designed by \nthe Framers to be lengthy, to prevent specious changes to the \nConstitution. If we must go through this time-consuming process for \nevery change to Social Security because we have written specifically a \nstatutory scheme into the Constitution, a statutory program into the \nConstitution --even minor technical alterations--I fear major needed \nreforms to Social Security will come far too late if at all.\n  Similarly, does the proviso language mandate the solvency of the \nSocial Security system, or does that language merely allow the Congress \nto take such steps? If the answer is that Congress must take measures \nto assure solvency, does this require mandated tax increases or benefit \ncuts?\n  Frankly, this proviso language strands us in unchartered territory. \nWe do not know exactly how this language is going to be interpreted. \nOnce it becomes part of the Constitution, assuming this amendment would \npass, this language could also very well mean that the scope of Social \nSecurity as a constitutional provision could be amended by statute. For \ninstance, in 1965, Social Security was broadened by a statue to include \nhospital insurance. That is, part A of Medicare. My question is this: \nIf under the Reid amendment Social Security can be variously modified \nby statute, would we be constitutionalizing a massive loophole through \nwhich we could constitutionally enforce spending on any program \nredesignated as ``Social Security?'' If, on the other hand, we can only \nmodify Social Security by constitutional amendment, will that not \nrequire a two-thirds Senate vote, approval of 37 States, and a 7-year \ndelay to enact even the most minor changes?\n  All of this demonstrates the danger that the Reid amendment as a \nwhole creates--that Congress ought to be responsible and not amend the \nConstitution to include specific statutory programs like Social \nSecurity. A constitutional amendment should be timeless and reflect a \nbroad consensus and not make narrow policy decisions. We should not \nplace technical language or overly complicated mechanisms in the \nConstitution and undercut the simplicity and universality of the \nbalanced budget amendment. Explicitly exempting Social Security may \nconstitutionalize the program in perpetuity unless a subsequent \namendment provides for the program to be altered or abolished. It would \nalso invite, in the opinion of many, gaming, and I can tell you it will \ninvite gaming and endless litigation as the terms of the program are \naltered.\n  Former Assistant and Acting Attorney General Stuart Gerson and \nattorney Alan Morrison, on different sides of the fence, both \nhave extensive experience litigating constitutional issues and \ntestified in a Judiciary Committee hearing on Senate Joint Resolution \n1. Although the two disagree about the wisdom of the balanced budget \namendment, they agree that exempting Social Security is a bad idea, and \nboth strongly oppose exempting Social Security from the balanced budget \namendment. Stuart Gerson is for the balanced budget amendment. Alan \nMorrison was against. But both agree Social Security should not be \nexempted. Nothing should be. It ought be in the unified budget, to \napproach it intelligently.\n\n  According to Alan Morrison, a liberal, against the balanced budget \namendment, a litigator with Public Citizen who opposes the balanced \nbudget amendment and testified for the minority:\n\n       Various proposals have been floated to exclude Social \n     Security from the amendment, presumably as a means of \n     attracting additional votes. Given the size of Social \n     Security, to allow it to run at a deficit would undermine the \n     whole concept of a balanced budget. Moreover, there is no \n     definition of Social Security in the Constitution and it \n     would be extremely unwise and productive of litigation and \n     political maneuvering to try to write one. If there is to be \n     a balanced budget constitutional amendment, there should be \n     no exceptions.\n\n  That is pretty important testimony given before the Judiciary \nCommittee by a person who, although he hates the balanced budget \namendment and does not want it as a liberal, nevertheless believes it \nwould be tremendously detrimental to the Constitution if we put a \nstatutory scheme in the Constitution.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, the biggest threat to Social Security \nis our growing debt and concomitant interest payments. Debt-related \ninflation hits hardest on those on fixed incomes, and the Government's \nuse of capital to fund debt slows productivity and income growth and \nsiphons off needed money for worthwhile programs. The way to protect \nSocial Security benefits is to\n\n[[Page S1537]]\n\npass Senate Joint Resolution 1, get rid of the year after year of \nunbalanced budgets, get us living within our means. The proposal to \nexempt Social Security will not only destroy the balanced budget \namendment, but in all probability would also cause the Social Security \ntrust funds to run out of money sooner than they would have without an \nexemption, perhaps mortally wounding the very program the Reid \namendment was designed to protect. That would be the paradox indeed.\n  Let me just finally conclude, anyone who believes Social Security \nwill not be harmed are simply wrong.\n  The Reid amendment is a risky gimmick. The Reid amendment is a \ngamble. Special interest scavengers will sniff out Social Security. \nBefore long, we will be using Social Security to fund all sorts of \nperks like the S.S. Social Security battleship. If we can put that \nchart up to make the point. We can see it happening. Now, that is \nbizarre but not nearly as bizarre as what has been done for 28 years, \nwith all these unbalanced budgets. There is nothing in the Reid \namendment that protects Social Security. Indeed, the Reid amendment \nthreatens Social Security. It is a risk, it is a gamble, and it should \nbe defeated.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator from Utah entertain a \nunanimous-consent request? I will explain it. I was going to ask that \nwe lay aside the Reid amendment, call up the Kennedy amendment No. 10, \nhave it considered, then lay that aside and go back to the Reid \namendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me first suggest the absence of a quorum with the time \nto be divided equally.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the \ntime be divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I yield the floor and the control of the \ntime on the Reid amendment to the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, \n[Mr. Feingold].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the floor manager. I yield myself such time as \nis necessary.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Susanne \nMartinez, Sumner Slichter, Mary Murphy, and Michael O'Leary, of my \nstaff, be granted the privilege of the floor during Senator Joint \nResolution 1 and all rollcall votes thereto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to support the Reid amendment. I \nwant to commend my friend and the distinguished Senator from Nevada for \noffering it.\n  Mr. President, Social Security is unlike any other program in the \nunified budget. In fact, the surpluses generated by Social Security are \nthe principal reason that the unified budget was created in the first \nplace.\n  Social Security is, fiscally and politically, a special program, and \nthose special traits require us to separate it out from the rest of the \nbudget. Social Security is singular as a public contract between the \npeople of the United States and their elected Government.\n  What happened here with Social Security, Mr. President, is that the \nelected Government promised that if workers and their employers paid \ninto the Social Security fund, they would be able to draw upon that \nfund when they retire--a simple proposition. But the singular nature of \nSocial Security and the special regard in which it is held by the \npublic, Mr. President, does not flow from some fleeting sense of \nnostalgia. Rather, Social Security has provided real help for millions \nof seniors.\n  According to AARP, Social Security keeps 15 million beneficiaries of \nall ages out of poverty. Today, 13 percent of recipients rely on Social \nSecurity for all of their income; 1 in 4 count on it for at least 90 \npercent of their income; 3 in 5, Mr. President--60 percent--depend on \nit for at least half of their income.\n  For those seniors, and for millions of others, the Social Security \ncontract is very real and a vital necessity, and anything other than \npartitioning Social Security off from the rest of the budget risks a \nbreach of that public contract, Mr. President.\n  Beyond the issue of our moral obligation to such a contract and \nkeeping our promise, there are critical fiscal reasons for making a \nspecial distinction in this new constitutional budget structure.\n  Most obvious is the enormous temptation Social Security will provide \nto those who might seek to raid the trust fund to alleviate the \ndeficit. This scenario is not hard to imagine. It is not some kind of a \nnightmare or a pipe dream. We already do it now. A unified budget masks \nthe true, on-budget deficit. This is not a weakness of one party or one \nbranch of Government. But it is a problem that we need to address, and \nit is a problem we need to address quickly. If we do not, the Social \nSecurity surpluses will be used to distort the true deficit picture, \nand it will undercut the deficit reduction that needs to be done. In \nfact, what will happen is we will pretend that we really have a \nbalanced budget. But we will not because we will have used Social \nSecurity dollars to make it look in balance.\n  So, Mr. President, we have to begin to rid ourselves of the addiction \nto the Social Security trust fund and to begin to learn how to balance \nthe budget without it if we are to fulfill the promise we made to \ntoday's workers that the Social Security benefits would be there for \nthem when they retire; that those benefits will be there for them when \nthey need it.\n  Some may argue that current law provides adequate protection for \nSocial Security; or, many say, that, if the balanced budget amendment \nis ratified, Social Security can and will be protected though passage \nof implementing legislation. There are several responses to those \nclaims.\n  First, let us recall that many of those who make that argument are \nalso the people who maintain that mere statutory mandates are \ninsufficient to move Congress to do what it has to do. The argument, \nwhen it comes to the subject of balancing the budget, is that only \nconstitutional authority is sufficient to engender the will necessary \nto reduce the deficit.\n  Let's use the reasoning of these supporters. Using their reasoning, \nthe willpower needed to resist the temptation to raid the Social \nSecurity ``cookie jar'' can presumably only come from\n\n[[Page S1538]]\n\na constitutional mandate, or, more specifically, a specific reference \nin this amendment that protects Social Security. Those who oppose \ngiving extra constitutional protection for Social Security often \nsuggest that there is no practical need for the protection because \n``Social Security will compete very well * * *'' with other programs.\n  I heard the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nreassure us time and again during the committee proceedings of this \nclaim that we don't have to worry; that once we pass the balanced \nbudget amendment Social Security is going to do very well; nothing to \nworry about.\n  Mr. President, Social Security should not have to compete with \nanything. As many have noted, it is a separate program with a dedicated \nfunding source intended to be self-funding.\n  In addition, any assessment of the political potency of any \nparticular program is going to have to be reappraised if we ever enter \nthe brave new world of the balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. President, let us take a look at the current environment to get a \nclue as to what might happen after the balanced budget amendment is \npassed, ratified, and implemented. In the current environment, it isn't \neven Social Security that receives the most preferred treatment. In the \nlast 2 years that status, the greatest preferential status, has been \nreserved for military budgets that receive billions more than the \nPentagon even asks for. That higher status has also been reserved not \nfor Social Security but for corporate tax loopholes which were \nspecifically exempted from the new line-item veto authority that many \nof us supported and sent on to the President last year.\n\n  What is more important, Mr. President, the proposed constitutional \namendment imposes a new burden on Social Security that it doesn't even \nimpose on other programs. Not only is Social Security not exempted, or \nprotected, but it has the problem the way this amendment is drafted \nthat other programs don't face. Because outlays cannot exceed receipts \nin any year, we are effectively barred from drawing on savings built up \nto fund future outlays. It is the very approach that we have to rely on \nto fund the expected ballooning of Social Security benefits as \ngenerations such as the baby boom generation reach older age.\n  Mr. President, the surplus of Social Security revenues produced today \ncontribute to the equivalent of a giant savings account which will have \nto be used to pay for the expected bulge in beneficiaries when the baby \nboomers begin to retire. By 2002 the combined Social Security trust \nfund balance will exceed $1 trillion. By 2010, the balance will exceed \n$2 trillion. And by the year 2020, Mr. President, that figure will \napproach $3 trillion. All of this money is intended for and is supposed \nto be for Social Security benefits. And we are going to need it. But \nthe proposed constitutional amendment would impose a three-fifths \nmajority requirement on that financing structure, and no statutory \napproach would be able to overcome the problem. It will have been \nenshrined in the Constitution.\n  So, if we want to address the problem, if we want to be able to use \nthat surplus fund to pay for these benefits in the future, it has to be \ndone as part of the constitutional amendment itself.\n  So, Mr. President, the bottom line on this proposed constitutional \namendment is--that is right--that it does not treat all programs alike. \nPrograms like Social Security which require a buildup of savings into \nthe future somehow have to reach the higher standard and muster a \nthree-fifths majority. But the defense budget, special interest \nspending done through the Tax Code, and corporate welfare all get a \nfree pass in the brave new world of the balanced budget amendment.\n  So, Mr. President, unless this is altered along the lines perhaps of \nthe amendment proposed by the Senator from Nevada, the proposed \nconstitutional amendment will not only enshrine the current practice of \nusing Social Security surpluses to disguise the size of the budget \ndeficit, it will actually make it nearly impossible to use those \nsurpluses for Social Security when we need them. It will turn a \nbookkeeping gimmick into a $3 trillion heist.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleague to support the Reid amendment and \nat least give Social Security the same chance every other program has.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time does the Senator need?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not recall how much I had.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield such time as the Senator needs.\n  I yield 15 minutes to the distinguished Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, and fellow Senators, I note that my good \nfriend, Senator Reid, is on the floor. Let me say that it is with great \nreluctance that I say to the Social Security recipients across America \nthat the Reid amendment threatens Social Security. Let me repeat. The \nReid amendment threatens Social Security. Senator Reid and others have \nintroduced their own version of a balanced budget amendment which would \nrequire a balanced budget in 2002 excluding the Social Security trust \nfund.\n  It is interesting right off. The President of the United States \nopposes the constitutional amendment for a balanced budget. One of the \nreasons he gives is that Social Security ought to be off budget. \nEveryone should know the President has been touting to all Americans \nthat he has a balanced budget. And he said to the Republicans, ``Why \ndon't you work with me, and maybe together we can have a balanced \nbudget by 2002?'' Everybody should know that the President does that \nbalanced budget with Social Security on budget--not off budget. He has \nnever once ever said in a budget document that he sends up here that we \nought to take Social Security off budget so we will protect Social \nSecurity. Never, never, never has he done that.\n  The people on the other side of the aisle have proposed their own \nbalanced budgets in the past, and I am going to say, since I am not \nsure of one those budgets, that every single one ever offered included \nSocial Security on budget--not off budget. Isn't it interesting when \nthe time comes that you are really going to insist that the American \npeople are protected in the future from big Government and big deficits \nthat now the excuse is Social Security should not be on budget. It \nshould be off budget.\n  Those same people argue that Social Security in the balanced budget \neffectively authorizes the raiding of the Social Security trust fund \nand the surpluses that are in that trust fund for purposes of balancing \nthe budget.\n  Mr. President and fellow Senators, I believe the argument that is \nbeing made, and this argument in particular and the Reid proposal in \nparticular, is nothing more than a smokescreen. It is intended to \ndivert public attention from the real issue--constitutionally required \nfiscal discipline. It provides an excuse for some who supported the \nbalanced budget in the past to vote against it now, now that their vote \nreally matters, for this is obviously within one or two votes at the \nmost of leaving the Senate and going to the House, after which there is \na real chance it will go to the sovereign States to see if three-\nfourths of them want constitutionally imposed fiscal restraint.\n  Let me repeat. Now that the chips are down, that a vote is a real \nvote, excuses are coming forth from the walls in abundance, and the \nbiggest excuse and risky gimmick is that we should leave the largest \nprogram of the Federal Government, into which the largest amount of \nAmerican taxes are entrusted, that we should not have it on the budget. \nI believe the American people will ultimately see through this \nsmokescreen because it is obviously a charade. It is not about Social \nSecurity. It is about defeating the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution.\n  It is clear to me that it is their version of a balanced budget that \nwould lead to the so-called raiding of Social Security, while our \nbalanced budget would protect the trust funds. Let me repeat, it is \nvery, very interesting to note that the argument is being made that you \nmust take Social Security off budget or you will harm Social Security \nwhen as a matter of fact from what I can tell, and I think I understand \nbudgeting, to take it off is to put it more at risk. Let me see if I \ncan explain why.\n\n[[Page S1539]]\n\n  Make no bones about it. The Social Security trust fund, who gets paid \nand how much they get paid, what is subject to the trust fund and what \ncan they pay out of it, is not enshrined in the Constitution. It is \ntotally, purely, Mr. President, legislation. Social Security is defined \nby whom? It is not defined by God. It is not in the Ten Commandments. \nIt is written by legislators. They define it. They write into that law \nwho can get money, what programs might be within the Social Security \ntrust fund, and here we go.\n  The Reid amendment says balance the rest of the budget but leave this \nvery large trust fund to float hither and yon on its own, subject to \nwhat, Mr. President? Subject to what Congress wants to do with it. \nSenior citizens, you are being duped, if you are coming here in large \nnumbers telling us to leave it off the budget. Leave it off the budget, \nfor what? For what? So that Congress can do with it what it wants \nwithout regard to the budget.\n  Now, I am not suggesting that any Member of the Senate has that in \nmind, I say to the Senator from Oklahoma. I am not suggesting that my \ngreat friend from the State of Nevada has that in mind, but I am \nsuggesting that when you enshrine in the Constitution a balanced budget \nthat leaves Social Security out of the budget, you then have to ask the \nquestion over time, what might happen to that trust fund? I submit, in \nthe past 15 years on at least one occasion that I am aware of, believe \nit or not, the now bankrupt Medicare fund, a trust fund, had a surplus, \nI say to my friend from Oklahoma, and Social Security was hurting. So \nguess what we did under the leadership of the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Russell Long. We borrowed money from the Medicare fund and \nput it in the Social Security fund.\n\n  We made up for that later. But now what we are going to do is take \nSocial Security and put it out there all by itself. Guess what is going \nto happen in the next decade. The Social Security fund has a lot of \nmoney in it. It is growing. It has a lot of surplus. And guess what. \nIts sister fund for hospitalization for seniors is diminishing. We are \nall running around saying let us keep it from bankruptcy. What if we do \nnot keep it from bankruptcy, I say to my friend, the occupant of the \nChair? What if we do not keep Medicare from bankruptcy and in 8 years \nit is desperately in need of money? Where do you think Congress might \nlook to get the money? This budget that has Medicare on it will be a \ntough budget because it has to be in balance. So I think it will be as \neasy and as axiomatic as anything that goes on, like day following \nnight, Congress will say, let us take it out of the trust fund. Then \nsomebody will rise up and say, but what about the balanced budget? Then \nsome will stand up and say, well, we did not put it in that balanced \nbudget because we wanted to protect it. Then somebody will say, protect \nit? Let us use it. So they will borrow from it. Or in fact make the \npayments for Medicare out of it saying we will fix it later.\n  Now, frankly, I truly believe there is a higher probability of that \nhappening than there is the probability that when the Social Security \ntrust fund needs the cash that its reserves represent, that we have \nborrowed for the Federal Government, there is a higher chance of \nharming it by taking money out of it than there is the chance we will \nnot have the money when the time comes that the surpluses have to \nreally be turned into cash available.\n  Then, might I suggest, if the whole purpose of a constitutional \namendment--and I do not deny the sincerity of those who propose a \nconstitutional amendment other than ours, than the one we propose. My \nfriend from Nevada probably really wants a constitutional balanced \nbudget, but the truth of the matter is the purpose of that is so that \nyou get to the point in time, fellow Senators, the point in time when \nyou cannot borrow any more money. Right? That is the whole purpose of \nthis constitutional amendment. It is structured in that way and there \nis no question about it.\n  Now, I ask you to just take a look at this one chart. I will use no \nmore than this one. You see the black dotted line. That comes down to \nabout 2020. That is the period of time when there will be a surplus \nthat Congress can play with and spend if they would like because it is \nsitting out there, and in the Reid constitutional amendment it is \nsubject to no limitation.\n  Now, if the purpose then of the balanced budget amendment that my \nfriend, Senator Reid, introduces is to say we are not going to be \nborrowing more money after we get to balance, then I ask what is going \nto happen in 2022 when that trust fund starts going in the red and you \nneed to borrow money if you have not fixed the program? That is the red \nline. If we do not fix Social Security out there in the future, the \ndifference between that green line and that red line, that great big \ntriangle, is the amount of money that would have to be borrowed if we \ndo not fix Social Security.\n  Now, let us assume that it is sitting out there in 2024. That is not \nfarfetched because the constitutional amendment is supposedly forever, \nright, for 100, 200 years. Now, here we are. The whole purpose of the \nReid constitutional amendment is to put us in the position where you \ncannot borrow any money after you are in balance.\n  I ask the Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] what happens when Congress \nsays, well, we need $650 million for Social Security; it is going in \nthe red? So somebody proposes, why, America has a great, strong \neconomy. Let us borrow the money. Right?\n  Mr. HATCH. Right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What will there be in the constitutional amendment, if \nthe Reid amendment became law, that says we cannot borrow that money? \nNothing, Senator Nickles. It can be borrowed. So we have kind of a \ncharade going. You write a constitutional amendment that says when you \nfinally get to balance you cannot borrow any more money, right? But \nthat is only on that budget. On this other budget that is floating over \nhere, there is no limitation on borrowing. I ask, if you are trying to \nprotect the American economy and future generations from borrowed \nmoney, is there any difference between the borrowed money that might go \ninto the first budget as compared with borrowed money that might go \ninto the Social Security fund? I think not. I think both have the same \nnegative effect on the future of our children and the growth and \nprosperity of the Nation.\n  So, if we want to stop at $5 trillion in deficits, when we finally \nget to balance under the Hatch constitutional amendment, we are saying \nwe should not borrow any more money. But if the Reid amendment becomes \nlaw, we are not saying that. We are saying, for Social Security \npurposes you can borrow as much as you want. If that isn't a sorry \nstate of affairs, after we have adopted a constitutional amendment if \nwe were to adopt the Reid constitutional amendment, then I have not \nseen one; a situation which is more dissimilar after the fact than \nthis. For after the fact there is no limitation on borrowing money.\n  Having said that, I choose, today, not to take up the second part of \nmy comments other than to say we are struggling here today--have I used \nall my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 15 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. May I have an additional 2 minutes?\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are struggling today to see if we can make a deal \nwith the President of the United States. We are trying to get a \nbalanced budget by the year 2002. It is hard to do. The President \nstruggled, he said, with putting one together and said how hard it was. \nWe are now looking at how we would do it and we say the President's is \nnot a very good budget, but still we have to get there.\n  If, in fact, we got a constitutional amendment like the one my friend \nfrom Nevada offers, it says you will be balanced in 2002 without Social \nSecurity surpluses being counted. I will just tell you what the \nPresident would have to add to his budget in order to be in balance \nunder that definition by 2002: $75 billion more in Medicare cuts. We \nare having trouble, arguing between $120 billion in savings and $160 \nbillion in savings. But you would have to add $75 billion to the \nPresident's. Mr. President, $35 billion more in Medicaid; $28 billion \nmore in civil service, military retirement, and other mandatories, and \n$158 billion more in education, environment, law enforcement and \ndiscretionary spending. Mr.\n\n[[Page S1540]]\n\nPresident and fellow Senators, we all know that cannot happen. I mean, \nwe cannot even settle on a balanced budget using the unified budget. It \nis difficult to get done.\n  So I must submit, in all deference and with as much respect as \npossible, that the Reid amendment is not intended to become the law of \nthe land. It is not intended to become the constitutional amendment \nthat goes to our sovereign States for ratification. For, if it was, it \nwould have no chance of being ratified, for who would support it under \nthe circumstances I have described?\n\n  I thank the Senate and thank Senator Hatch for yielding and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield me 8 minutes?\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 8 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first I wish to compliment my colleague, \nSenator Hatch from Utah, for his leadership in this bill as well as \nSenator Domenici for his excellent statement. I hope our colleagues had \na chance to listen to the Senator from New Mexico. He probably knows \nmore about the budget than most all of us. He made an outstanding \npresentation.\n  I urge our colleagues to vote against this amendment. I recognize \nthis amendment may be good politics. It sounds kind of good. I have \nheard some people say, ``If you vote for this amendment you are going \nto protect Social Security.'' I totally disagree. As a matter of fact, \nI think it may have just the opposite result, or opposite conclusion. \nBut it looks good. And, if it is reported by the press, ``Well this one \namendment was trying to protect Social Security,'' if they write it \nlike that, some people are going to assume that is correct. I think it \nhas just the opposite result.\n  I think, if we pass a constitutional amendment that says we are going \nto balance the budget, we are not going to spend any more than we take \nin but, oh, incidentally, we are going to exempt the largest and most \npopular program in Government, in other words we want to be in balance \nexcept for this very important, popular program, you just gutted the \nbalanced budget amendment. There is no reason to have a balanced budget \namendment. The amendment would say we are going to exclude the old age \nand survivors and Federal disability insurance program. You could \ninclude a lot of other things. Why not include Medicare? A lot of \npeople think Medicare is the same thing as Social Security. It is all \npaid for by a payroll tax. Right now American citizens pay 12.4 percent \nfor Social Security, which includes retirement and disability. And they \npay another 2.9 percent in Medicare. There is no reason why we would \nnot include that. You could define that as Social Security.\n  As a matter of fact, in the President's budget he takes home health \ncare--basically he takes it out of the Medicare trust fund and moves it \nover from part A to part B, and then says it is all going to be paid \nfor by the Federal Government.\n  My point is, you can shift around trust funds and I think you would \nfind a multitude of programs running to be defined as Social Security. \nLet us throw in Medicare. Let us throw in welfare. Let us throw in \nanything else, and it will all be exempt from the balanced budget \namendment requirement. That makes the balanced budget amendment a \nfacade, it makes it a fraud, it makes it worthless.\n  I am not saying this is from the sponsor of the amendment, but I \nthink a lot of people who are going to vote for the amendment want that \nto happen. There are a whole lot of people who are going to vote for \nthe amendment of the Senator from Nevada--not that they hope it will \npass, they do not support a balanced budget amendment anyway. And I \nwould include President Clinton in this category. He does not support a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. But now he raises the \nspecter of Social Security, maybe to scare people into thinking that is \na good way to kill the amendment; to kill the constitutional amendment \nto balance the budget. I regret that.\n\n  I looked at a statement President Clinton made on January 28 at a \npress conference. He said, dealing with whether or not we should \nexclude Social Security that we couldn't right now. ``Neither the \nRepublicans nor I [and the Congress] could produce a balanced budget \namendment tomorrow that could pass if Social Security funds cannot be \ncounted,'' if you will, as part of the budget.\n  So the President is saying: Wait a minute, I use Social Security \nsurpluses right now in my budget to get down to zero in the year 2002. \nSo do the Republicans. President Clinton has in every single budget \nthat he has had in the past. So have other Presidents. My point being \nhe is now saying we will try to pass that amendment because he knows it \nis a killer amendment, not because he believes it is good policy. He \nknows it is bad policy. I think everybody, if they were asked \nlegitimately, is this good policy, they would say, ``No.'' Is it good \npolitics? They may say, ``Well, it may be.'' It might be good politics \nbut it certainly is bad, bad policy.\n  You should not have a constitutional amendment that says we are not \ngoing to spend any more than we take in and exclude the largest program \nin Government. You should not open it up to a program that is not \nreally defined by the Constitution, and therefore every other program \nin Government could be added as part of Social Security. All of which \nwould be excluded from the constitutional requirement.\n  I think, frankly, when you are talking about the Constitution you \nshould not be trying to write in the Constitution an exclusion for a \nparticular Federal program. That does not fit. Again, it may fit for \npolitical purposes but it does not fit in the Constitution. It does not \nbelong in the Constitution.\n  So, Mr. President, I mention this, I have the greatest respect for my \ncolleague and friend from Nevada. I am afraid a lot of people will be \nlooking at this amendment and saying it has a lot of political appeal \nbut substantively it should not be in the Constitution. We are dealing \nwith serious business. We are right on the throes of having the vote to \npass a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. I hope that we \nwill in the next few days. We will not, in my opinion, I will tell my \ncolleagues, we will not if we come up with this amendment.\n  I have heard some people say if we just agree to this amendment I \nwould vote for it in a minute. I don't think they would, not if they \nlooked at what the results would be, not if they looked at the changes \nthat would have to be made. I don't think that is accurate. This \nSenator would not vote for it because I think of it as a fraud. I think \nit would be misleading the American people and I don't want to do that. \nI think we should be serious in our legislating and I think we should \nbe doubly serious when we are talking about a constitutional amendment \nin any form, and certainly one to balance the budget.\n  So, Mr. President, with all respect I urge my colleagues to vote \n``no'' on the Reid amendment and, hopefully, it will go down and then \nwe will be able to pass a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget in the next few days.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has 46 minutes 35 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. REID. And my friend from Utah?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirteen minutes forty-seven seconds.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wrote a letter to a number of people in \nNevada, and this is what I said in the last paragraph of the letter:\n\n       There is no question Congress must face up to the tough \n     task of balancing the Federal budget. I'm the first to accept \n     responsibility for this task, but I draw the line on \n     devastating the Social Security trust fund to accomplish this \n     task.\n\n  Franklin D. Roosevelt, upon signing the Social Security Act, said,\n\n       We can never insure 100 percent of the population against \n     100 percent of the hazards and vicissitudes of life, but we \n     have tried to frame a law which will give some measure of \n     protection to the average citizen and to his family against \n     the loss of a job and against poverty-ridden old age.\n\n  I received numerous responses after writing this letter, but one \nresponse I received, as I mentioned on the floor yesterday, was from \nHelen Collins who said:\n\n\n[[Page S1541]]\n\n\n       I have been a widow since age 21. I never considered \n     applying for any kind of welfare assistance. I worked, and \n     raised and educated my son. He got a master's degree. Sad to \n     say, at age 71, I am totally on my own on quite a limited \n     budget. By being very careful, I get by. However, I do worry \n     about getting more seriously ill and losing Social Security. \n     For many of us, these are not the golden years. But I, for \n     one, thank God that good people like you are helping us \n     maintain our dignity and independence.\n\n  That is what this debate is all about. It is about the Helen \nCollinses of the world, not the people who are running full-page ads in \nthe New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. The people on Wall \nStreet want this to pass because it gives them an easy opportunity to \nbalance the budget.\n  Mr. President, I heard my friend, my good friend, with whom I serve \non a subcommittee--I am the ranking member of the subcommittee, and I \nhave served on the Appropriations Committee with him since I have been \nin the Senate--I heard my friend, the senior Senator from New Mexico, \nsay that what we are trying to do is keep Social Security on its own. \nThat is absolutely true, we are. We are trying to keep Social Security \non its own. It is not part of the unified budget. It shouldn't be part \nof the unified budget. We have passed laws in this body so it would not \nbe part of the unified budget.\n  Here is what happened over the last decade: The Greenspan commission, \nwhere we established, by a majority vote, a bailout of the Social \nSecurity system, and it was to last to the year 2060; in 1985, we \npassed the Deficit Control Act, which further strengthened Social \nSecurity; in 1990, we passed the Hollings-Heinz amendment which took \nSocial Security off budget.\n  What right do we have to suddenly start including it in the unified \nbudget? We don't have any right to do that. Everyone has said you can't \nbalance a budget unless you use Social Security. That is my whole \npoint. If we are going to balance the budget, we should do it the right \nway, the hard way.\n\n  I think the most telling thing, Mr. President, was when my friend \nfrom New Mexico came and gave this very well-meaning speech--he is a \nsincere man, but I think it is glaring that he did not respond to the \nstatements that I have made and the junior Senator from South Carolina \nhas made over the last 2 days about his own words from 1990. These were \nhis own words:\n\n       I voted for Senator Hollings' proposal because I support \n     the concept of taking Social Security out of the budget \n     deficit calculation. But I cast the vote with reservations.\n\n  What were his reservations that he came to this floor and did not \nrespond to? His reservations:\n\n       We need a firewall around those trust funds. . . .\n\n  That is what this amendment is all about.\n\n       We need a firewall around those trust funds to make sure \n     the reserves are there to pay Social Security benefits in the \n     next century. Without a firewall or without the discipline of \n     budget constraints, the trust fund would be unprotected and \n     could be spent on any number of costly programs.\n\n  It is here, and that is what my amendment is all about. Social \nSecurity should not be used to pay--in the words of the present \nchairman of the Budget Committee, ``the trust funds would be \nunprotected and could be spent on any number of costly programs.'' \nThese moneys should be spent on one thing and one thing only: paying \nold-age benefits.\n  Silence is golden. My friend from New Mexico did not, in his 20 \nminutes on the floor, even respond to the statements he gave in 1990. \nThey are in the Congressional Record. Not a word.\n  Mr. President, we received today almost a million signatures from a \ngroup of senior citizens who signed these petitions in the last few \ndays. They have a right to do that. Of course they do, because, Mr. \nPresident, American seniors are exercising a powerful right to stop a \ndevastating wrong. The right to petition our Government for wrongs is \nguaranteed in the first amendment of the Constitution. This right is a \ncornerstone of our democracy and deserves to be enshrined in the \nConstitution, and it was. Giving Congress and the courts the power to \npermanently raid Social Security should not be guaranteed by the \nhighest, most powerful legal document in our country.\n  So, Mr. President, I believe that what is taking place here is a \ncheap, easy, deceitful way to balance the budget. It is contrary to law \nto take the Social Security surpluses and use them for other purposes. \nAnd even if it weren't law, you shouldn't do it because it is a trust \nfund, and a trust fund should not be spent for any purpose other than \nfor what the trust fund was established.\n  My friend from Utah, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, talked \nabout the Concord Coalition and others who last Congress said we would \nprotect this program through enabling legislation. What they were \nsaying in the last Congress is maybe what we can do is have a statute \nto preserve Social Security. I am sure they must have checked with \nsomebody who is in their first year of law school who told them that a \nstatute will not override the Constitution. And after having checked \nwith a first-year law student, they came up with a new pitch, and that \nis, ``Let's go along with it. Let's just raid Social Security.'' And \nthat is what they have said.\n\n  Mr. President, my good friend from Utah has also said the \nCongressional Research Service changed the memo the second time, it \ndoesn't really say what they said it says. The Center on Budget and \nPolicy Priorities disagrees. The Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities, among other things, says, all three memos, the two from CRS \nand theirs, explain that under the Hatch balanced budget amendment, \noutlays in any year, including outlays for benefits paid from the \nSocial Security trust fund, may not exceed receipts in that year. All \nthree memos note that any funds drawn down from the accumulated Social \nSecurity surpluses to help pay for Social Security benefits of retired \nbaby boomers would not count as receipts in those years.\n  They go on to say:\n\n       Under the balanced budget amendment, the Social Security \n     surplus could not be tapped and interest earnings on the \n     surplus could not be used unless there was offsetting surplus \n     in the rest of the budget.\n\n  Mr. President, we have a number of other people saying that, and one \nperson saying it is not a first-year law student but a graduate of one \nof the finest universities in America today, the person who is in \ncharge of the Office of Management and Budget, a person who has a great \nreputation, Franklin D. Raines.\n  Franklin Raines said, in writing this letter to Senator Daschle, the \nminority leader:\n\n       Dear Mr. Leader: I am writing in response to your inquiry \n     regarding the February 5, 1997, Congressional Research \n     Service memorandum entitled ``Treatment of Outlays From \n     Social Security Surpluses Under a Balanced Budget \n     Amendment.''\n       That memorandum noted that the 1983 Social Security reforms \n     called for accumulating those surpluses to allow payments \n     even when annual trust fund income is no longer sufficient to \n     make those payments. It concluded that, under S.J. Res. 1 and \n     without further congressional action, accumulated trust fund \n     surpluses could not be used for the full payment of Social \n     Security benefits in any year when outlays would otherwise \n     exceed receipts. That conclusion is correct.\n       Under current law, expenditures from trust funds are \n     governed by the amount of funds available in the trust fund \n     balances and by congressional spending authorizations. This \n     general rule applies to the Social Security trust funds.  .  \n     .\n       S.J. Res. 1 would require overall federal government cash \n     flow balance on a year-by-year basis. In the event that \n     revenues are projected to fall below outlays for a given \n     year, outlays would need to be adjusted for the remainder of \n     the year. Such a shortfall would most likely occur toward the \n     end of a fiscal year, when only a limited base of \n     discretionary outlays would be available for reduction. \n     Consequently, programs with monthly payments would be unable \n     to avoid exposure to such reductions.\n       All entitlement expenditures--including Social Security--\n     would be treated as expenditures under S.J. Res. 1 and, thus, \n     would be exposed to reductions. This would mean that, due to \n     operation of the proposed constitutional amendment, the \n     government might not be able to make payments from trust \n     funds with both available balances and full congressional \n     authority to make expenditures from the trust fund. \n     Reductions in entitlement spending would have a particularly \n     perverse effect if the revenue shortfall was caused by a \n     recession, and where payments subject to limitation are part \n     of the automatic stabilizers.\n\n  So, Mr. President, it is very clear that the underlying amendment \nwould devastate Social Security. Well, there are some who say, ``Why \nare you trying to protect Social Security, there are other trust \nfunds?'' Mr. President, the reason I am trying to protect Social \nSecurity is that is where the money is. The other trust funds are \npittances.\n\n[[Page S1542]]\n\n They are bits and kibbles. There really is not much money there. \nSocial Security is the finest social program in the history of the \nworld, and I feel an obligation, a moral obligation, to protect it.\n  The reason that there has been all this emphasis on Social Security \nis they are going after the moneys just as Senator Domenici in 1990 \nsaid we should try to prevent. ``We need a firewall around those trust \nfunds,'' said Senator Domenici, ``to make sure the reserves are there \nto pay Social Security benefits in the next century. Without a firewall \nof the discipline of budget constraints, the trust funds would be \nunprotected and could be spent on any number of costly programs.''\n  That is a direct quote.\n  So, Mr. President, I think we have to narrow the focus of what this \nis all about. The focus is whether or not we are going to allow the \nSocial Security trust fund to be raided on a yearly basis until it runs \nout of money and then, of course, Social Security would be wiped out.\n  I say, Mr. President, that I suspect, and I feel that I cannot direct \nthis to anybody in the Senate because I do not know, but there are \npeople in the leadership in the House of Representatives who believe \nthe Social Security program is a bad program. Again, I do not think you \nhave to be real bright to figure out that is how they feel. This is a \nstatement from the majority leader, the present majority leader of the \nHouse of Representatives. Again, I quote: ``Social Security is a rotten \ntrick. I think we are going to have to bite the bullet on Social \nSecurity and phase it out over time.''\n  Now, does that appear to be somebody that is pushing a balanced \nbudget amendment and wanting to protect Social Security? Would you \ntrust someone of that philosophy to try to draft a statute to avoid a \nconstitutional provision? First of all, you cannot. But even if you \ncould, would you trust someone with that philosophy? I think not. There \nare people supporting this amendment, recognizing that doing so will \nwipe out Social Security.\n  I think we should not do that. I think we should look at the Helen \nCollinses of the world and say the money that she is talking about is \njust a small amount of money. We have a number of letters here that my \nstaff has brought me. One woman talks about getting 300-some-odd-\ndollars a month. That gives her a little bit of independence. This \namendment protects her interest by excluding Social Security from the \ncalculations of the balanced budget amendment. It protects the interest \nof the Helen Collinses of the world.\n  Social Security is, therefore, not at fault for the deficits that \nhave been accumulated. Not a single Social Security recipient is the \ncause of the deficit. Social Security is not running up deficits. In \n1983 we passed legislation to forward fund Social Security. The reason \nthis amendment is so important to some people is that is where the \nmoney is. They do not want to balance the budget the hard way.\n\n  We heard statements here from President Clinton saying it is going to \nbe real hard to balance the budget if you do not use Social Security. \nNo kidding. I understand that. We all understand that. But if we pass \nmy amendment we would have a true balanced budget and we would also \npreserve Social Security. I think that is a pretty good deal and I \nthink it is worth the risk.\n  The Social Security trust fund is being used to mask the size of the \ndeficit. Each time the Government dips into the Social Security trust \nfund to help pay for the deficit it hurts Social Security. We should \nstop that.\n  Because the Constitution will require the Federal Government to \nbalance the budget, Social Security moneys will have to come from one \nof four places.\n  I see my friend from Florida. Does he care to make a statement? I am \nhappy to withhold and allow my friend from Florida to make a statement.\n  Mr. MACK. If you want to take a few more minutes to finish your \nthought, fine. However I would like to have the opportunity to speak.\n  Mr. REID. Please go ahead.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, again, I thank my colleague for allowing me \nto take this time to address the Senate on the issue of the balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  I have spoken many times in the past years on this issue, both in the \nHouse and here in the Senate. I think it is a vital one. It is truly a \ndebate about whether we are committed to the belief that the era of big \nGovernment is over. The reason there is such a debate about this issue \nis because it really is fundamental to that.\n  Before I make some additional comments I think I might just make a \nstatement or two with respect to the issue of Social Security. I \nrepresent the State of Florida, and therefore I think it is fair to say \nI am pretty sensitive to the retiree, the elderly vote in my State and \ntheir concerns about Social Security. I make the claim that probably \nthe most significant way to protect Social Security is, in fact, to \npass a balanced budget constitutional amendment.\n  My feeling is that, in fact, it is a risky gimmick, I think, to be \ntaking Social Security off budget. For that matter, I think it is to be \nproposing that a whole series of programs be taken off budget. We need \nto address the balanced budget constitutional amendment from the \nstandpoint of all the expenditures, all the income and all the \nexpenditures of the Federal Government, not separating them off into \ndifferent accounts and considering only one group of expenditures at a \ntime. Again, I think it is a risky gimmick to take Social Security off \nbudget.\n  Mr. President, over the last couple years I had the opportunity to \nread several books on the Constitution. One written by Catherine \nDrinker Bowen, and maybe this comes back to my mind after having \nwatched the special on Thomas Jefferson that was on PBS last week. I \nthought it was a terrific 3-hour presentation and discussion about the \nroots of our Government, the roots of this Nation. Catherine Drinker \nBowen's book, called ``Miracle at Philadelphia,'' was all about the \ndebate about the establishment of the Constitution. I know that some \nhave said, ``Well, the Constitution did not have a balanced budget \namendment or a balanced budget requirement as part of it.'' Therefore, \npeople would make the claim if they did not feel it was important then, \nand they were certainly some of the brightest minds we have ever \nexperienced in Government, who are we to claim that there needs to be \nan amendment to the Constitution to address this issue, the need for a \nbalance within our expenditures?\n  I think that the people who make that claim fail to take into \nconsideration how our Constitution has been amended over the years and \nthe fact that the Senate used to be appointed. I believe it was either \nin 1912 or 1916--I have forgotten the specific date--when the \nConstitution was changed to require a direct vote on Members of the \nSenate. Well, there was an intricate balance that the writers of the \nConstitution came up with that was changed, with the result of the \nSenate being directly elected by the people. If you will remember, the \nfear that many had in those days was that the House, directly elected \nby the people, would be off pursuing many different ideas of great \npopular support, and that there needed to be some kind of restraint \nthat would be placed on the people's House, and that would come from \nthe Senate. Again, that has been changed. So some of the restraint was \nbuilt into the system to be able to say, no, we don't think we ought to \npursue that particular program or that particular expenditure. That was \ntaken out as a result of the change in the direct election of Members \nof the U.S. Senate.\n  I think it is fair to say that we ought to address the particular \npoint that, today, there is a tendency to think of this debate as being \na debate about economics. The reality is this is about human behavior \nand how we are going to control the desire on the part of some people \nto support all the different initiatives that might come from our \nconstituents. So I think, from a constitutional perspective, one can \nsay that the conditions have changed significantly, to the point where \nit is completely legitimate to be arguing today that we need an outside \nrestraint on the ability of the Members of the Congress to spend our \ntaxpayers' dollars. I have supported the constitutional amendment since \nI have entered Congress, which was back in 1982.\n\n[[Page S1543]]\n\n  I want to take just a moment or two to talk about the benefits that \nare derived. Again, all too often we find ourselves talking about some \nvery intricate aspect of this debate, and we fail to address what I \nbelieve are the important benefits that come from a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget, a requirement that we balance the \nbudget. I believe, in the long term, we will end up with lower taxes, \nhigher growth, more jobs, less Government, and lower interest rates.\n  Again, lower interest rates can, I think, produce some very tangible \nbenefits to our constituents. We have made estimates, for example, that \nlower interest rates would save the average family $125 a month. Now, \nsome people might say that is not a great deal of money. I say to my \ncolleagues, then go stand out in front of a grocery store and ask the \nindividuals coming out whether they think an extra $125 a month is \nmeaningful. I believe it is. We believe the way they can save that kind \nof money is, again, because of lower interest rates. Mortgage payments \nwould be lower, automobile loans would be less expensive, student loans \nwould be more affordable. That is a direct benefit that is passed on to \nour constituents.\n  Again, I have a tendency to think at this time about the kinds of \npeople that will be affected by what we do. I again ask my colleagues \nto consider the folks back home--the mother who might have two jobs who \nis being asked to support funding of all these various programs at the \nFederal level, the family where the husband and wife both work. In \nfact, I remember one particular individual coming up to me and \nexplaining that he works all week and comes home and takes care of the \nchildren over the weekends while his wife works over the weekend. These \nare the kinds of people who we are asking to pay taxes to the Federal \nGovernment to fund the various programs. I can only think of one way we \ncan finally put some restraint, again, on the Members' ability to spend \ntheir money, and that is to pass a balanced budget constitutional \namendment.\n  At this point, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to my friend, the Senator \nfrom North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was listening to my friend from Florida, \nSenator Mack, someone for whom I have great regard and affection. The \ninteresting thing about this debate is that we essentially agree that \nwe ought to balance the budget. There is no disagreement about the goal \nhere. There is a disagreement about the methods of achieving that goal.\n  Earlier this afternoon, I heard someone come to the floor of the \nSenate and speak of the Reid amendment. He said that the Reid amendment \nactually threatens Social Security. Well, that is the most byzantine \nargument I have heard, perhaps, in all the time I have served in the \nU.S. Senate--the Reid amendment injures or threatens Social Security. \nThe Reid amendment is designed to make sure that we do two things at \nonce--balance the Federal budget by exacting the discipline needed to \ndo that in the Constitution, but while we do it, keeping our promise to \nthose who we made a promise to with the Social Security system, saying \nthat you are paying taxes into the system, that taxes are dedicated for \none purpose, and we are going to honor that. That is what the Reid \namendment is about.\n  Without the Reid amendment, this constitutional amendment doesn't \nbalance the budget. I came here this morning at 9:40 and spoke in favor \nof this amendment. I asked a question, and I am going to ask the \nSenator from Nevada, who has been on the floor all day because he has \nbeen managing his amendment, whether anybody has come to the floor to \nrespond to that question. I asked this question, and the question \nitself strips naked the proposition that what is on the floor from the \nmajority party requires a balanced budget. If we passed this proposal, \njust like that, 20 seconds from now, and if we then passed a proposal \nto balance the budget, as offered by the majority, just like that, 20 \nseconds later, and it is the year 2002, why then does the budget \nrequire that the Federal Government increase its debt limit by $130 \nbillion in a year in which the proponents claim the budget is balanced? \nI have not heard anyone respond to that. If the budget is balanced, why \nis there a requirement to increase the Federal debt limit by $130 \nbillion?\n\n  I know the answer, but I am asking it of the other side because I \nwant to hear them say what I know to be the case. The reason you have \nto increase the debt limit by $130 billion when you claim the budget is \nin balance is because the budget isn't in balance, precisely because of \nthe kind of thing Senator Reid is trying to address. You take, on that \nside, the Social Security revenues and add them in over here and say, \nlook what we have done, we have balanced the budget, implying somehow \nthere is no obligation over here to use those moneys in Social Security \nwhen the baby boomers retire.\n  The Senator from Nevada offers an amendment that says if we are going \nto do this, let's do it the honest way. I suspect there are not the \nvotes in the Senate to pass the amendment of the Senator from Nevada. I \nintend to vote for it. But I suspect it will be defeated so we can have \nthe same old same-old here of claiming to balance the budget when, in \nfact, the Federal debt limit continues to increase.\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada, has anybody come and answered the \nquestion of why, using this approach, enshrining this practice into the \nConstitution, when they say they have balanced the budget, why the \nFederal debt would then increase by $130 billion in the very year they \nclaim they balanced the budget?\n  Mr. REID. I left breakfast early so I could be here early to hear all \nthe debate. The Senator has asked this question more than one time, and \nI thought this would be an appropriate time for someone to respond to \nthe question. You have asked it at least a half dozen times. I thought \nthat, with all the power behind this underlying amendment, Senate Joint \nResolution 1, someone would come and be prepared to answer your \nquestion. There has not been a single word spoken in response to your \nquestion.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I think the reason for that is that this is a giant dance \nthat goes on. The farther they get from the truth, the faster they \ndance. I am talking about those who are suggesting to us that they have \nan approach that will balance the budget, even as that balanced budget \nrequires the Federal debt to continue to increase.\n  There was a hearing on this subject. I went and testified at the \nhearing. At the hearing they had the debt clock. That is the neon clock \nwith the numbers that keep increasing that shows how the Federal debt \nis increasing. I made the point that debt clock actually reinforces \nwhat I was asking. I said, it is interesting. When you say that you \nhave balanced the budget that debt clock is going to keep increasing. \nUntil you turn the debt clock into a stopwatch you have not balanced \nthe budget and nobody in my home town thinks you are going to balance \nthe budget.\n  So, if you accept the Reid amendment, which is a perfecting amendment \nto the underlying constitutional amendment that balances the budget, \nyou will solve that problem. It is not so hard to do. Accept the Reid \namendment, and I think we can enact this constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget with 70 to 75 votes, mine included. But this is \nimportant because it relates to the underlying question of are we \nreally about balancing the budget, or are we about altering the \nConstitution so that we can claim we have done something that we have \nnot in fact done? That is what is at the root of this issue.\n  Mr. President, we will have an opportunity to vote for a perfecting \namendment that Senator Reid is offering. If we lose that, we will have \nthe opportunity to vote for a substitute constitutional amendment which \nincorporates the Reid amendment that I will offer.\n  So we will have two votes on this. If those who study this subject \ndecide that they don't want to change it so that we do this in a way \nthat really does balance the budget, which does require a balanced \nbudget, and which does not increase the Federal debt after you have \nclaimed the budget is in balance--if they don't want to do that, then I \nguess there will not be a constitutional amendment. If they want to do \nit, all they have to do this afternoon is accept the Reid amendment. \nThis is not just on our side of the aisle. Congressman Neumann, Senator \nSpecter,\n\n[[Page S1544]]\n\nand many other folks said the same thing that Senator Reid and I are \nsaying. So this is not just a group of folks who are on one side of the \npolitical aisle that makes this case. This is a $1 trillion issue over \nthe next 10 years. It is very important to a very important program. It \nis also important in terms of the question of whether we actually are \ngoing to balance the budget and at the same time meet our obligations \nfor Social Security in the years ahead.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Nevada yielding to me.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and \nI had an agreement that I would have the last 5 minutes and that he \nwould have 5 minutes prior to that. So will the Chair notify me when I \nhave about 5 minutes left on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Chair would be happy to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, when I yielded to my friend from Florida, I \nwas saying at that time that if it passes it will require the Federal \nGovernment to balance the budget and Social Security moneys after that \nwill have to come from four places.\n  No. 1, raise the payroll taxes in order to cover the difference; No. \n2, cut benefits to beneficiaries; No. 3, cut Government expenditures \nand other needed programs to pay its debt to Social Security; and No. \n4, because of the language in the constitutional amendment, to get a \nthree-fifths majority of each House to constitutionally raise the debt.\n  That is a pretty rough row to hoe.\n  Also, it is quite clear that because there is no vote required to \nborrow from the Social Security trust funds that there is a powerful \nincentive to borrow from those funds to pay for general programs.\n  So I believe we should pass a balanced budget, which is not a \ngimmick. It isn't going to make it easy. I acknowledge that. If my \namendment passes, it is going to be extremely difficult to balance the \nbudget. But when we do, it will be a fair way to balance the budget. We \nwill not be using the surpluses out of Social Security to balance that \nbudget.\n  Mr. President, last Saturday the President gave his weekly statement \nto the American public over the radio. He said in that radio address:\n\n       Over the last several weeks, we've received the full data \n     on our country's economic progress for the last four years. \n     The economy created 11.5 million new jobs, for the first time \n     ever in a single term. That includes a million construction \n     jobs and millions of other good paying jobs.\n\n  In fact, Mr. President, 60 percent of the jobs were high-paying jobs.\n\n       Entrepreneurs have started a record number of new \n     businesses, hundreds of thousands of them owned by women and \n     minorities. We've the largest increase in home ownership \n     ever, a big drop in the poverty rate, and a big increase in \n     family income. And just this week, we learned that the \n     combined rate of unemployment and inflation over the last \n     four years is the lowest for a Presidential term since the \n     1960's.\n\n  That is a direct quote from the President's address.\n  There is more that he said. But, among other things, he said, if this \namendment passes, that:\n\n       . . . it could force the Secretary of the Treasury to cut \n     Social Security, or drive the budget into courts of law when \n     a deficit occurred when Congress was not working on the \n     budget. In a court of law, judges could be forced to halt \n     Social Security checks, or raise new taxes just to meet the \n     demands of the constitutional amendment.\n\n  I say that isn't very pleasant.\n  Also, there are millions of people out there young and old who \nbelieve that this Senate Joint Resolution 1 is bad. For example, the \nNational Committee to Preserve Social Security stated in a February 11 \nletter that my amendment will preserve the integrity of the Social \nSecurity fund under a balanced budget constitutional amendment. \nBorrowing from a reserve to finance the current debt will place a heavy \nburden on future generations because the debt to the trust fund must be \nrepaid with interest.\n  The American public support my position. Almost 75 percent of the \npeople in the polling data in the last week say we want a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget, but not if you include \nSocial Security.\n  The argument being used by the proponents of this amendment is \nOrwellian. They are saying that because we have been stealing money \nfrom the Social Security trust fund in the past that we should go ahead \nand stick it in the Constitution. We are saying exempt it. That is what \nshould be done.\n  I know that my friend, the minority whip, wishes to speak. I am very \nhappy to have him speak. But I want to just say, Mr. President, that \nthis is not a group of Democrats only. Maybe in the Senate. But in the \nHouse we have some courageous Republicans--most of them sophomores--who \nhave said we are not going to be taken down the path to destroy Social \nSecurity, and we will not vote for a balanced budget amendment unless \nwe can vote on an amendment like Senator Reid is propounding.\n  This is what Congressman David McIntosh, a sophomore Republican House \nMember from Indiana, said, ``Republicans cannot allow us to be defined \nas cutting Social Security even as we move forward with the balanced \nbudget amendment.''\n  I say that Congressman McIntosh has it right. We should follow his \nlead. Some of the people on the other side of the aisle and over here \nshould follow this courageous young man and vote for my amendment.\n  Mr. President, how much time does this side have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seventeen minutes and thirty seconds.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Nevada for allowing \nme the time to speak. I compliment him for his courage, for his \nability, and for his tenacity. We have seen that before. We have never \nneeded it any more than we do right now.\n  Mr. President, just before I came up I was going through some letters \nthat came into my office today. You always see something personal which \njust happened. Here is a fellow--I will not use his name--who said, ``I \ntruly am concerned about my future as a citizen of the United States of \nAmerica.'' He also adds, ``I am worried about my future. Will there be \nany Social Security money left for me to have and live on after I am \nretired?'' The concern is there. If you want a balanced budget, vote \nfor the Reid amendment.\n  Tomorrow you will have 70-some-odd votes. Now we are scrambling to \nget one more trying to pass it and force it down people's throats.\n  In 1983, I had to cast a very, very hard vote. That is when we \nincreased the taxes on Social Security. We did it so it would be there \nfor the so-called baby boomers. We developed a surplus on purpose so \nthey would be taken care of in the outyears. Now we find that, if this \nbalanced budget amendment is passed as is without the Reid amendment, \nit will be a piggy bank that will not stand the crowbar of balancing \nthe budget. They will break that piggy bank and use that Social \nSecurity money like it is going out of style. And I will not vote for a \nbalanced budget amendment that desecrates the Social Security vote I \ncast in 1983.\n  How many would have voted with Senator Dole when he came from that \ncommission if he had told us that someday this money will go for \nwelfare reform, that someday this money will go for foreign aid, and \nfor other programs? I doubt seriously if it would have passed at that \ntime.\n  No. Here we are now with a balanced budget amendment that says to \nthose that we have committed to--the senior citizens--that we are not \ngoing to cut them. But what happens to those that come after those that \nare on Social Security now? They are almost there. What about your \nchildren and my children that are 45 and 48 years old? They have been \nrequired to pay higher taxes. Some of them pay more Social Security \nthan they pay withholding taxes. Now we are saying to them that in your \nolder age for Social Security retirement it will not be there if this \npasses.\n  There is one thing that ought to make everybody shiver. There is a \npossibility of the courts telling the legislative bodies to raise taxes \nand not to issue checks. So then we come subservient, and we are not a \nthree-part Government any longer. Under this amendment the courts can \ntell a legislative body what to do. If that doesn't send chills up your \nspine, if that doesn't tell the people of this country that nonelected, \nappointed-for-life people, are\n\n[[Page S1545]]\n\ngoing to tell a legislative body, the Congress, what to do--that ought \nto send shivers up and down the spine of every American.\n  We have been here for over 200 years; the best and strongest country \nin the world. And we are about ready to say the system that brought us \nto this point is about to be eliminated; the system that brought us to \nthis point today is about to be eliminated because of the possibility \nof the courts telling the Congress to raise taxes and not to issue \nchecks; things of that nature. Oh, we will hear the crocodile tears, \nthe Reagan-Bush memorial over here on my right, you know. We hear all \nof that. But I say to my friends that I made a commitment. It is called \nthe Social Security trust fund, and I gave my word, and the trust of \nthe people of this country in this Congress ought to be upheld.\n\n  In the last Congress, the Senate voted 83 to 17 to adopt a sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendment stating that Social Security should not be cut in \norder to balance the budget.\n  Protecting the Social Security trust fund is not jut a seniors issue, \naccording to this letter from this young person. We have promised not \nto reduce benefits for current Social Security beneficiaries in order \nto balance the budget, but what about this young person's concern about \nwhether they will be able to secure Social Security based on what we \nhave in this balanced budget amendment.\n  Let me just go back to the possibility of what the courts might do. I \ndo not think there is anyone in this body who wants the courts telling \nus what to do and how to do it. They will interpret whether it is \nconstitutional or not. That is their prerogative. That is the way the \nsystem works. But I tell you when we pass an amendment that says the \ncourts have the authority to run this country--unelected, appointed for \nlife--I have some real concerns.\n  ``Will there be any Social Security money left for me when I \nretire?'' this young person writes. ``I am truly concerned about my \nfuture as a citizen of the United States.'' I say to that young person, \nmy vote will secure Social Security for her or him or whoever it might \nbe out there, and I want their future as a citizen of the United States \nto be brighter. We can balance the budget, as the President says, if we \ncast the vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has 10 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. REID. I extend my appreciation to the Senator from Kentucky, a \nman who not only has served with distinction here in this body but who \nhas balanced a few budgets as Governor of one of the biggest, most \npopulous States in the Nation, the State of Kentucky. We respect his \nwork on budgetary and other matters.\n  Mr. President, I would ask the Chair to advise me when I have 5 \nminutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so advise.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my amendment is not one I want to direct to \nbig numbers, even though that is what this body has talked about during \nthese past few days. But I want to draw your attention to small \nnumbers, people who draw Social Security checks on a monthly basis. \nThey do not understand the billions and trillions of dollars we are \ntalking about. They understand the hundreds of dollars they receive on \na monthly basis because the check they receive represents the \ndifference between retirement with dignity and retirement in poverty.\n  The reason President Roosevelt signed the bill in August 1935 was to \ngive seniors dignity, and, Mr. President, that is what Social Security \nhas done. I repeat, it is the most successful social program in the \nhistory of the world. And we are about to give everyone an opportunity \nto see how they stand for Social Security.\n  We have had people come to this floor and say, well, I am a big \nsupporter of Social Security. I have a lot of seniors in my State.\n  I have no doubt that is true. But if you want to protect Social \nSecurity, exclude it. Why? Because to do otherwise, these funds will \ncontinue to be raided and the Social Security trust fund will be a \nslush fund.\n  Most, as I have indicated, express public support for continued \nmaintenance of Social Security. But this is the test right now. Vote to \nsupport a balanced budget amendment, a true, honest, nondeceptive \nbalanced budget amendment. Those who say they will not use Social \nSecurity to balance the budget cannot have it both ways. You cannot say \nwe are not going to use Social Security, we are going to protect Social \nSecurity and say that we are going to do it. And I agree with the \nchairman of the Budget Committee when he said in 1990 there should be a \nfirewall developed to protect Social Security. I want that firewall, \nand that is what this amendment is.\n\n  We have communication from the Congressional Research Service, the \nPresident of the United States, the Office of Management and Budget, \nthink tanks, who say if you pass this amendment, you are going to \ndestroy Social Security. Absent an express exemption of the Social \nSecurity trust fund, we will place at risk the ability to draw down \nthose reserves when the baby boomers begin to retire. We have both a \nmoral and a fiduciary relationship to prevent this.\n  We all know that the practice of misusing Social Security trust funds \nis wrong, so let us stop it. Let us terminate it. This is the chance to \ndo that. About 75 percent of the American public agrees with us. Why do \nwe not do something for a change that the American public thinks is the \nright thing to do, not continue the smoke and mirrors process that has \nbeen going on in this country so long that we have stacks of deficits \nthat big, 4 or 5 feet high as indicated by my friend from Utah. It has \nbeen referred to as the Reagan-Bush budget deficit memorial. That is \nwhat it is. Huge deficits have accumulated during these years. They \nmust stop. They have gone down in the last 4 years from over $300 \nbillion to a little over $100 billion. We can do better.\n  My amendment, even as my opponents concede, is the only way to do \nthis. But they say if you do it, it is going to be hard to balance the \nbudget. I am willing to take that chance and make the hard, make the \ndifficult choices because when we do it, it will not be smoke and \nmirrors. It will not be a gimmick. We will be balancing the budget the \nright way, the proper way, and we will protect the most important \nsocial program in the history of the world.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. I would ask the time run equally against the opponents and \nproponents of this amendment during the time that I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Each side has 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is my fervent hope that during the \ndebate over the proposed exemption of the Social Security funds from \nthe requirements of Senate Joint Resolution 1, I have convinced my \ncolleagues to support the balanced budget amendment. As Justice \nBrandeis so eloquently wrote in the 1927 case of Whitney versus \nCalifornia, ``It is the function of speech to free men from the bondage \nof irrational fears.''\n  I truly believe that many of my well-meaning colleagues' desires to \nexempt the Social Security Program is based on unfounded fears.\n  Look, if we take the largest item in the Federal budget and put it \noutside of balanced budget purview, we are left with no mechanism at \nall for its protection. Social Security will be out there all alone, \nwith no protections whatsoever. Whereas, if we keep a unified budget \nand keep everything in it, Social Security will be protected because \neverybody in the Congress wants to protect it, and it can compete \nbetter than any other Federal program for the available funds. Frankly, \nI know it would get them. Every one of us would vote for Social \nSecurity, for its protection.\n  But if you agree to the risky gimmick of putting Social Security \noutside the budget, and everything else is\n\n[[Page S1546]]\n\nsubject to balanced budget amendment requirements but Social Security, \nthen those who want to destroy Social Security or those who want to \ncontinue to spend for social programs, all they have to do is \nstatutorily--because that is all Social Security is, a myriad of \nstatutes--statutorily add anything they want to to Social Security and \ngo on spending forever more without any budgetary restraint at all. The \nmore provisions they add to the total Social Security bill outside the \npurview of the budget, the more Social Security will be watered down, \ndiminished, and eaten away. That is the difference here.\n  We have a unified budget, and with a balanced budget amendment that \nunified budget is going to have to be balanced by the year 2002 or we \nare going to have to stand up and vote not to balance it. There is no \nreason in the world to put the largest item in the budget outside of \nthe purview of the balanced budget amendment, since every dime that \ncomes in from the FICA funds will be invested in Federal Government \nsecurities anyway. Whether we keep it in budget or put it out on its \nown without any budgetary restraints, those surpluses are going to go \ninto Federal Government bonds, and the only way we can pay those bonds \noff, the absolute, only way, is if we pass this balanced budget \namendment intact without excluding any program from its purview.\n  Last but not least, in this limited time, if you write a statute into \nthe amendment, that means you make it constitutional. Can you change \nSocial Security to reform it or make it better or help people or \nincrease funds without a constitutional amendment? Unfortunately, I am \nnot sure we can answer that today. It might well be the case that it \nwould take a constitutional amendment to do it. If that is so, that \nwould be a tragedy.\n  I do not think this amendment is well thought through. I hope our \ncolleagues will not support it. Constitutionally, it is the wrong thing \nto do. Most important, even if you do what the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nevada sincerely wants to do here, you are not protecting Social \nSecurity because you cannot protect it outside of the budget from \nsuspect spending practices. It is free floating without any of the \nbudgetary restraints that the balanced budget amendment would put on \nthe whole unified budget.\n  Let us do what budget people really know we have to do, and that is \nlive within the constraints of the unified budget, keep Social Security \nin there where it will compete better than any other program, and, in \nthe end, I think our country will be so much better off because we will \nbe able to balance the budget, reduce interest rates, and make this \ncountry really run properly.\n  It is always helpful to put this debate in a larger context. Today, \nthe accumulated national debt is nearly $5.4 trillion. Interest \npayments on this debt consumes $250 billion annually, which the \nWashington Times recently estimated, is more than the combined budgets \nof the Departments of Commerce, Agriculture, Education, Energy, \nJustice, Interior, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, State, and \nTransportation. This means that the share of the debt for every infant \nborn today is about $20,000.\n  There is a crying need for sound fiscal reform. Unless we do \nsomething, this Nation will continue to have stagnant economic growth \nwith less jobs. Unless we do something, the interest payment on the \ndebt will continue to devour capital that could be otherwise used for \ninvestment or Federal programs. Let's not kid ourselves that Washington \npoliticians will remedy this problem; the blunt truth is that no \nbalanced budget deal has worked in the past, that is why we need to \namend the Constitution to provide for fiscal sanity.\n  Yet, opponents of Senate Joint Resolution 1 argue that Social \nSecurity should be removed from the protection of the balanced budget \namendment. But to do so as they request would be a risky gimmick that \nwould harm Social Security and open a loophole in the constitutional \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Nevada has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, even the great mind, Justice Scalia, who \ndoes not like legislative history, does not like to look at it, even \nJustice Scalia would recognize we have established in this matter a \nlegislative history that is second to none. We are taking Social \nSecurity from the confines of this balanced budget amendment. This is \nnot all alone, floating in the air. It is out on its own, as it was \nrequired by law in 1990. All of a sudden we are ignoring this law we \npassed. Any one of the Senators who voted for this in 1990 and now does \nnot vote for my amendment better check his or her record on \ninconsistency, because this would probably be at the top of their \ninconsistency list.\n  The only way to protect Social Security is the way we are doing it. \nWe are not running full-page ads paid for by the Wall Street brokers \nand power brokers. We are trying to establish, through petitions signed \nby a million people that were received today, that what is being done \nwith Senate Joint Resolution 1 is wrong. We are representing the \nrecipients, the beneficiaries of Social Security, not the people who \nwant to raid Social Security so it will be easier to balance the \nbudget.\n  We are supported by the beneficiaries past and those in the future \nand those in the present. We are supported by the American public by \nalmost 75 percent in polls taken. We are supported by the National \nCommittee to Save Social Security, by the President, in letter and in \nradio address. We are supported by the Office of Management and Budget.\n  Mr. President, we are supported by Republicans in the House of \nRepresentatives who have stepped forward courageously to say we are not \ngoing to be seen as trying to cut Social Security. I repeat, I hope \nsome of my friends on the other side of the aisle will step forward \nwith the courage shown by Congressman McIntosh, Republican of Indiana.\n  Mr. President, Franklin Roosevelt, when this legislation was signed, \nsaid that he had an obligation not only to protect business interests. \nI feel that same obligation to protect business interests. I am for \nreduction in the capital gains tax. I was for the legislation that gave \nsignificant incentives to small businesses last year that we passed in \nconjunction with the minimum wage bill. But as President of the United \nStates, Franklin Roosevelt, said:\n\n       . . . just as Government in the past has helped lay the \n     foundation of business and industry. We must face the fact \n     that in this country we have a rich man's security and a poor \n     man's security and that the Government owes equal obligations \n     to both. National security is not a half and half manner: it \n     is all or none.\n\n  We have to help business and we have to help the small person. We are \ntrying to help those people who are trying to survive to maintain their \ndignity. That is what this amendment is all about. I repeat, anyone who \nvoted in 1990 to take Social Security off budget and now votes against \nmy amendment had better recognize that that is probably about as \ninconsistent as you can be, legislatively.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment. It is the right thing \nto do for the American public.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, I hold in my hand a press statement sent \nto my office and I believe to all of the Senate and House offices from \na Congressman from Oklahoma, Congressman Tom Coburn, regarding the \nshowing of ``Schindler's List,'' this past Sunday. I have to tell you, \nwe had to call the office to assert whether or not this was a joke. We \nthought it was a prank. The Congressman in his press release goes on to \nraise concerns on behalf of the family caucus, and says that the airing \nand demonstration of the television program that depicted sex and \nviolence was inappropriate. He complains about the nudity of the \nprogram.\n  I cannot believe, and I am shocked and appalled, that any Member of \nCongress would put out a statement of this kind that shows those who \nwere imprisoned and being sent to their death--it seems to me that \nanyone who would make a statement condemning ``Schindler's List'' is \ntotally out of touch with the importance of this historic film, \ndepicting the monstrous deeds that took place and the heroism that was \nalso displayed.\n  To equate the nudity of the Holocaust victims in a concentration camp \nwith any sexual connotation is outrageous and offensive. I am shocked \nand appalled that any Member of Congress would make these kinds of \nstatements. I am particularly embarrassed that they were made by a \nMember of my own party.\n  I understand that the Congressman is planning to make a clarification \nof his statement. While I await them, I think that everyone should seek \nthat clarification. Certainly, this should not be a view expressed by \nanyone in public office who is right-thinking.\n  Again, I thought this press release was a prank at first, and it was \nonly when I called that we verified it was not the case. The \nCongressman should respond quickly and clarify exactly what he meant by \nthis statement.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/25/senate-section/article/S1547-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nUNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 1, AMENDMENT NO. 7\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

Mr. President, reports of alleged mismanagement within \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation have been in the news, recently. \nMost of the reports reflect issues in the FBI's vaunted crime lab. \nThese allegations of mismanagement come on the heals of FBI management \ndisasters with Waco, Ruby Ridge, Filegate, and Atlanta, as well as \nothers.\n  The average citizen is wondering if this premiere law enforcement \nagency is out of control. The deputy director of the FBI, Weldon \nKennedy, understands the significance. Two weeks ago, he said the \nfollowing:\n\n       The single thing most responsible for the success of the \n     FBI is that ``people are confident that if they come to the \n     FBI, the matter will be handled professionally and well. If \n     that trust ever breaks down, not only is the FBI in trouble, \n     but the American people are in trouble.\n\n  Mr. President, that is the issue. Weldon Kennedy hit the nail \nsquarely on the head.\n  The issue is trust and confidence in the Nation's No. 1 law \nenforcement agency. And in the context of other, recent management \nfiascos at the FBI, skepticism is validly the order of the day.\n  Indeed, allegations of problems in the FBI lab are troubling. I have \nbeen working, parallel to the Justice Department's inspector general, \nto find out if the allegations are true or not. The IG's report is due \nfor public release on or about March 14.\n  So far, the FBI has responded to the allegations in a less than \ncredible way. First, they shot the messenger--Dr. Frederic Whitehurst, \nthe lab scientist who first raised the allegations.\n  Next, the FBI used the typical ``everything's okay'' strategy to make \nthe public think there was no problem. But that was contradicted by the \nfacts. Weldon Kennedy said the problems in the lab wouldn't compromise \nany past, present, or future case.\n  That statement raised a lot of eyebrows. The deputy attorney general, \nJamie Gorelick, refused to confirm Mr. Kennedy's wild optimism. Her \nrefusal to do so totally undercut Mr. Kennedy's statement. Mr. \nKennedy's credibility came into question. Even Mr. Kennedy had to back \noff his own statement. On February 6, he admitted, ``Maybe I was \noverstating the case.''\n  But then, in a letter to me dated February 21, Mr. Kennedy went right \nback to defending his wildly optimistic statement--that no past, \npresent or future case is in danger. In my view, Mr. Kennedy is playing \nfast and loose with reality, with a purpose to mislead the public, and \nmislead Congress. The simple fact is, it is much too premature for Mr. \nKennedy to be making groundless predictions. For him to do so anyway \nshows a strategy to mislead.\n  Third, I have learned that it is not just Dr. Whitehurst who has \nalleged wrongdoing in the FBI crime lab. Others have as well. So in the \nnear future, I will resume speaking to my colleagues about this issue, \nMr. President. At that time, I intend to discuss a very specific case \nwith specific allegations of alleged wrongdoing. Today, however, I \nintend for my remarks to remain general.\n  Finally, I fear the FBI has covered up the lab's shortcomings. The \nFBI has been aware of many of these specific problems for more than 10 \nyears. Yet, there have been few, if any, fixes to the problems. I \nsuspect the reason is that the obvious solution is for the lab to be \naccredited; but the lab is so poorly configured and maintained that it \ncan't be accredited. So instead, the FBI calculated that it's better to \n``cover it up''\n\n[[Page S1548]]\n\nuntil the new lab is constructed down at Quantico in the year 2000.\n  If true, Mr. President, this decision by the FBI would be appalling. \nI am not prepared at this time to conclude that this is the FBI's \nintent. But if it is, not only is the FBI in trouble, so are the \nAmerican people, as Mr. Kennedy so aptly put it. Because if this is \ntrue, it is not just a problem with the FBI crime lab; it's a problem \nwith the FBI's overall leadership.\n  As I mentioned, the IG report will be released to the public no \nsooner than March 14. Meanwhile, the FBI is out there spinning. In Mr. \nKennedy's February 21 letter, he says the IG report, once we all read \nit, will ultimately reveal no problems. Here's what he says:\n\n       [T]he Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General \n     found no instances of perjury, evidence tampering, evidence \n     fabrication, or failure to report exculpatory information.\n\n  That's true, but irrelevant. Mr. President, never in my 16 years of \nsitting on the Judiciary Committee have I found a more misleading \nstatement by an official of the FBI. It has a designed purpose of \nmaking the public think everything is under control at the FBI crime \nlab.\n  Well, everything is not under control. The fact of the matter is--and \nthe FBI is well aware of this, which is why Mr. Kennedy made this \nstatement--the IG did not investigate to determine if there were any \ncrimes committed by FBI agents--like, perjury, evidence tampering, \nevidence fabrication, or failure to report exculpatory information. The \nIG's charter was to determine management problems and administrative \nproblems--not crimes.\n  The criminal investigation comes next. Because the IG also has the \nright the refer issues for possible criminal referral. And I predict, \nMr. President, that the FBI will have to back off of that statement as \nwell, when all of this is over.\n  Mr. President, what we're seeing in the FBI lab issue is systemic. It \nreflects a culture that says the FBI is more interested in a conviction \nthan they are in the truth. They don't reveal all the facts. Only \nenough to make their case. This is what I intend to show in a future \nstatement before this body. The issue will be the FBI shaving evidence \nto get a prosecution.\n  That's not cricket. It's not American. And it can't be tolerated. I \ngrew up the son of a farmer. My father taught me to be proud of the \nFBI. Its image was that it could do no wrong. A whole generation of \npeople like me grew up believing the FBI could do no wrong. Now, that \nconfidence, that trust, has been shaken.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me send a shot across the bow. There are \nrumors I'm hearing that the FBI intends to fire Dr. Whitehurst right \nafter the IG report is released. My message today to the Bureau is, \n``you fire Dr. Whitehurst, and you will cause a protracted battle with \nthe Congress over the integrity of the FBI's leadership.''\n  In the end, it will be shown that the standards of the FBI crime lab \nhave been far short of their vaunted reputation. It will be shown that \nthe FBI was well aware of these problems, but chose to do little, if \nanything, to fix them. It will also be shown that the problems, would \nnot have been addressed by the IG were it not for the courage of Dr. \nWhitehurst.\n  This is a wake-up call to the FBI. The public will not tolerate an \narrogant response by the FBI in this matter. Too much is at stake; \nnamely, the integrity of the criminal justice system in America. I \nintend to keep this issue before the American people. I will make sure \nthey understand they have a choice between an FBI with integrity, and \nan FBI that plays fast and loose with the truth.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Weldon Kennedy's February \n21 letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Department of Justice,\n\n\n                              Federal Bureau of Investigation,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 21, 1997.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: The Attorney General shared a copy \n     of your February 13th letter with me. While the Department of \n     Justice will respond directly to you, because you suggested \n     that I misled you and the public I am compelled to respond to \n     the inferences which you have raised about my personal \n     integrity.\n       First, let me state that I share your belief that any \n     public servant who misleads the public or Congress should be \n     held accountable regardless of his rank or position. As not \n     only a career civil servant but a sworn law enforcement \n     officer with more than thirty-five years of service to this \n     Nation, I hold dear not only my personal reputation for \n     integrity but also my duty to uphold and defend the \n     constitution. As one who has been charged with the \n     responsibility to investigate the alleged criminal acts of my \n     fellow citizens, I assure you that I am extremely sensitive \n     to my own responsibility, as well as that of other \n     governmental officials such as you to avoid rash judgments \n     and to devote every effort to insure the accuracy of my \n     conclusions.\n       I remain convinced everything said during our briefing of \n     you is accurate. I further do not believe what Ms. Gorelick \n     said is inconsistent with our position, a position fully \n     supported by the facts.\n       If you recall from our briefing, Mr. Maddock explained in \n     great detail about how every allegation with even the \n     slightest potential for Brady implications was referred to \n     the appropriate prosecutor to determine if the information \n     should be supplied to the defense counsel. This process has \n     been ongoing for more than a year and was undertaken out of \n     an abundance of caution to ensure there is no doubt we have \n     more than met any legal obligation to disclose even \n     potentially exculpatory information to criminal defendants. \n     The fact that information is provided to defendants ensures \n     their right to a fair trial, but is does not mean that a \n     defendant is not guilty or that a successful prosecution \n     will not or should not be brought. That is the process to \n     which Ms. Gorelick referred and which the FBI fully \n     supported.\n       What I said during our briefing and to the public was that \n     no prosecutions have been compromised. That remains as \n     accurate today as when I said it. No past or current \n     prosecutions have been compromised and we know of no \n     information that indicates a future case will be compromised. \n     There is no basis to conclude otherwise in spite of \n     journalistic sensationalism which has misled you and the \n     public to believe the contrary.\n       Through a series of malicious leaks and gross speculation \n     by the press and other uniformed persons, doubt has been cast \n     on the whole of the FBI Laboratory. As I reported to you, \n     after 16 months of intensive investigation, the Department of \n     Justice Office of the Inspector General found no instances of \n     perjury, evidence tampering, evidence fabrication, or failure \n     to report exculpatory evidence. Neither did the inquiry find \n     any support for spurious allegations charging systemic \n     evidence contamination or improper evidence handling.\n       I believe when you are afforded the opportunity to review \n     the report including our lengthy response, the basis on which \n     I made the statement will be apparent. I also hope this helps \n     you understand why the comments by Ms. Gorelick are not ``at \n     odds'' with what I said either to you or to the public.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                Weldon L. Kennedy,\n     Deputy Director.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/25/senate-section/article/S1547-4", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

NEDROW\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, one of the most unsung professions in \nthe United States is law enforcement. It is a dangerous and demanding \ncareer field that offers few tangible rewards, yet it is an occupation \nthat attracts men and women of tremendous dedication and determination, \nindividuals who are committed to making a difference in their lives and \njobs. Today, I rise to pay tribute to one such person, Roy D. Nedrow, \nthe Director of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, who is about \nto end a distinguished career in local and Federal law enforcement \nafter more than 30 years.\n  Director Nedrow began his service in law enforcement as a street cop \nin Berkeley, CA, during the turbulent 1960's. As many know, that city \nis the home to a beautiful University of California campus, but at that \ntime in Berkeley's history, the plazas, walkways, and streets of, and \nsurrounding, Cal became a kind of urban battleground. No doubt, it was \nin this contentious and frequently violent environment that Officer \nNedrow learned\n\n[[Page S1549]]\n\nsome very valuable lessons about law enforcement, people, and managing \ncrises, all which would help him throughout his career.\n  After 6 years in local law enforcement, Sgt. Roy Nedrow traded the \nseven-pointed star and khaki uniform of the Berkeley Police Department \nfor a business suit, a set of credentials, and a job as a U.S. Secret \nService special agent. For more than the next 20 years, he handled \nnumerous cases involving fraud, counterfeiting, forgery, and \nprotection. In the process, he steadily climbed the command ladder of \nthat agency, holding a number of positions of great responsibility, \neventually rising to the office of Deputy Assistant Director of the \nOffice of Investigations, where he was responsible for managing 1,200 \nspecial agents in more than 100 field locations throughout the world.\n  His experience with the U.S. Secret Service gave him invaluable \ntraining in managing investigations, people, and budgets, and made him \nan ideal candidate to head-up a law enforcement agency. When the Naval \nCriminal Investigative Service was looking for a new director in the \nearly 1990's, they very quickly spotted Roy Nedrow as a desirable \ncandidate to take charge of their agency.\n  Assuming the helm at NCIS in 1992, Director Nedrow moved swiftly and \nsurely to change the public's perception about this agency which had \nsuffered from several public relations misfortunes, and he made turning \nNCIS into a more effective and streamlined organization his priority. \nManaging a Federal agency in this era of shrinking budgets, downsizing, \nand hiring freezes, is very challenging and Director Nedrow had to find \na way to continue to meet the many international missions with which \nhis special agents are tasked, particularly force protection and \nantiterrorism, with fewer available resources. Not deterred by the size \nof the task before him, the Director established many successful \ninitiatives, a number of which were particularly effective in making \nNCIS an even better law enforcement agency.\n  During his tenure as Director, Roy Nedrow oversaw the establishment \nof a Cold Case Homicide Squad which has reinvestigated murder cases \npreviously thought unsolvable, bringing closure to 18 cases and earning \n13 convictions. Realizing the importance of reigning in fraud and \nensuring that the money of the American taxpayer was not wasted, the \nDirector fought to keep the fraud investigation mission at NCIS. Over \nthe past 5 years, his special agents assigned to pursuing such cases \nhave recovered more than $900 million in procurement fraud, fines, and \nrestitution, helping to cut out fiscal waste and abuse, as well as \nessentially compensating the Government for what it costs to operate \nNCIS. Another innovative solution discovered by the Director, was to \nbetter integrate Navy Reserve personnel into his agency, providing him \nwith the ability to secure a surge of qualified and trained individuals \ncapable of helping NCIS meet its force protection mission in times of \nnational crisis.\n  Mr. President, anyone who dedicates their life to protecting the \npeople of this Nation from criminal elements is worthy of our thanks, \nand for 33 years, Roy Nedrow has done just that. He has established an \nimpressive reputation for professionalism and leadership at every level \nof law enforcement he has worked, and has left the Berkeley Police \nDepartment, the U.S. Secret Service, and the Naval Criminal \nInvestigative Service all better places for his efforts. His \nstewardship as the Director of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service \nhas greatly benefited that agency, and has helped to strengthen the \nFederal law enforcement community. We are proud of the work he has \ndone, are grateful for his many sacrifices, and wish he and his lovely \nwife Claudia, much health, happiness, and continued successes in the \nyears to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/25/senate-section/article/S1548-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR JOHN GLENN\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a friend \nand colleague; one who has both orbited the Earth and walked the Halls \nof Congress. Performing either responsibility on its own has been the \ndream of many. Achieving both has been realized by very few. Senator \nJohn Glenn is a truly remarkable man.\n  So it was with sadness that I received the news of his plans to \nretire at the end of this Congress. His early announcement will give us \nsome time to try to get used to the idea of a Senate without his calm \nleadership, his uncommon commitment and dedication, and his tremendous \ndecency and civility.\n  Senator Glenn has helped make our Space Agency, NASA, what it is \ntoday. Senator Glenn's Mercury space mission 34 years ago sparked a \nnational interest in space exploration that continues to this day. John \nGlenn is a national hero who is the personification of astronaut. Since \nhis daring and heroic mission, children all over the country have \ndreamt of becoming astronauts.\n  The environment of Washington is as foreign to many as the Moon. \nSenator Glenn left the Moon in orbit, while trying to bring Washington \nmore down to Earth--closer and more responsive to the needs of the \nAmerican people. John Glenn has played a vital role in helping to pass \nseveral measures important to reinventing our Government.\n  Senator Glenn and I share a strong respect for the environment. I was \na proud cosponsor of Senator Glenn's Department of the Environment Act, \nwhich would have elevated the Environmental Protection Agency to \nCabinet-level status. In introducing this important bill, Senator Glenn \nnoted that, having had the rare privilege to view the Earth in all of \nits beauty and grandeur from space, he was struck by how thin and \nfragile the environment is that sustains life on our planet. I \nabsolutely agree with him and appreciate what he has done for the \nenvironment. Our environment has had a strong ally in the Senate, and \nwe will miss his leadership on these issues.\n  When this Congress is over, and Senator Glenn touches down in his \nhome State of Ohio, we will remember him as a friend and hero whose \nachievements have displayed a strong respect for the Earth and its \ninhabitants.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/25/senate-section/article/S1549-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/25/senate-section/article/S1549-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1549-S1550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT OF THE SUPPLEMENTARY AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND \n            GREAT BRITAIN--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 15\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to section 233 (e)(1) of the Social Security Act, as amended \nby the Social Security Amendments of 1977 (Public Law 95-216, 42 U.S.C. \n433(e)(1)), I transmit herewith the Supplementary Agreement Amending \nthe Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America \nand the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern \nIreland on Social Security (the Supplementary Agreement), which \nconsists of two separate instruments: a principal agreement and an \nadministrative arrangement. The Supplementary Agreement, signed at \nLondon on June 6, 1996, is intended to modify certain provisions of the \noriginal United States-United Kingdom Social Security Agreement signed \nat London February 13, 1984.\n  The United States-United Kingdom Social Security Agreement is similar \nin objective to the social security agreements with Austria, Belgium, \nCanada, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, \nThe Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. Such \nbilateral agreements provide for limited coordination between the U.S. \nand\n\n[[Page S1550]]\n\nforeign social security systems to eliminate dual social security \ncoverage and taxation, and to help prevent the loss of benefit \nprotection that can occur when workers divide their careers between two \ncountries.\n  The Supplementary Agreement, which would amend the 1984 Agreement to \nupdate and clarify several of its provisions, is necessitated by \nchanges that have occurred in U.S. and English law in recent years. \nAmong other things, the Supplementary Agreement removes certain \nrestrictions in the original agreement concerning payment of UK \ndisability benefits to residents of the United States. The \nSupplementary Agreement will also make a number of minor revisions in \nthe Agreement to take account of other changes in U.S. and English law \nthat have occurred in recent years.\n  The United States-United Kingdom Social Security Agreement, as \namended, would continue to contain all provisions mandated by section \n233 and other provisions that I deem appropriate to carry out the \nprovisions of section 233, pursuant to section 233(c)(4) of the Act.\n  I also transmit for the information of the Congress a report prepared \nby the Social Security Administration explaining the key points of the \nSupplementary Agreement, along with a paragraph-by-paragraph \nexplanation of the effect of the amendments on the principal agreement \nand the related administrative arrangement. Annexed to this report is \nthe report required by section 233(e)(1) of the Act on the effect of \nthe Agreement, as amended, on income and expenditures of the U.S. \nSocial Security program and the number of individuals affected by the \namended Agreement.

This strategy renews our bipartisan commitment to \nreducing drug abuse and its destructive consequences. It reflects the \ncombined and coordinated Federal effort that is directed by National \nDrug Control Policy Director Barry McCaffrey and includes every \ndepartment and over 50 agencies. It enlists all State and local leaders \nfrom across the country who must share in the responsibility to protect \nour children and all citizens from the scourge of illegal drugs.\n  In the 1996 National Drug Control Strategy, we set forth the basis of \na coherent, rational, long-term national effort to reduce illicit drug \nuse and its consequences. Building upon that framework, the 1997 \nNational Drug Control Strategy adopts a 10-year national drug-control \nstrategy that includes quantifiable measures of effectiveness. The use \nof a long-term strategy, with annual reports to the Congress and \nconsistent outreach to the American people on our progress, will allow \nus to execute a dynamic, comprehensive plan for the Nation and will \nhelp us to achieve our goals.\n  We know from the past decade of Federal drug control efforts that \nprogress in achieving our goals will not occur overnight. But our \nsuccess in reducing casual drug use over the last decade demonstrates \nthat drug abuse is not an incurable social ill. Thanks to the \nbipartisan efforts of the Congress and the past three administrations, \ncombined with broad-based efforts of citizens and communities \nthroughout the United States, we have made tremendous progress since \nthe 1970's in reducing drug use.\n  Nonetheless, we are deeply concerned about the rising trend of drug \nuse by young Americans. While overall use of drugs in the United States \nhas fallen dramatically--by half in 15 years--adolescent drug abuse \ncontinues to rise. That is why the number one goal of our strategy is \nto motivate America's youth to reject illegal drugs and substance \nabuse.\n\n  Our strategy contains programs that will help youth to recognize the \nterrible risks associated with the use of illegal substances. The \ncornerstone of this effort will be our national media campaign that \nwill target our youth with a consistent anti-drug message. But \ngovernment cannot do this job alone. We challenge the national media \nand entertainment industry to join us--by renouncing the glamorization \nof drug abuse and realistically portraying its consequences.\n  All Americans must accept responsibility to teach young people that \ndrugs are wrong, drugs are illegal, and drugs are deadly. We must renew \nour commitment to the drug prevention strategies that deter first-time \ndrug use and halt the progression from alcohol and tobacco use to \nillicit drugs.\n  While we continue to teach our children the dangers of drugs, we must \nalso increase the safety of our citizens by substantially reducing \ndrug-related crime and violence. At the beginning of my Administration, \nwe set out to change this country's approach to crime by putting more \npolice officers on our streets, taking guns out of the hands of \ncriminals and juveniles, and breaking the back of violent street gangs. \nWe are making a difference. For the fifth year in a row serious crime \nin this country has declined. This is the longest period of decline in \nover 25 years. But our work is far from done and we must continue to \nmove in the right direction.\n  More than half of all individuals brought into the Nation's criminal \njustice systems have substance abuse problems. Unless we also break the \ncycle of drugs and violence, criminal addicts will end up back on the \nstreet, committing more crimes, and back in the criminal justice \nsystem, still hooked on drugs. The criminal justice system should \nreduce drug demand--not prolong or tolerate it. Our strategy implements \ntesting and sanctions through coerced abstinence as a way to reduce the \nlevel of drug use in the population of offenders under criminal justice \nsupervision, and thereby reduce the level of other criminal behavior.\n\n  Our strategy supports the expansion of drug-free workplaces, which \nhave proven so successful and we will continue to seek more effective, \nefficient, and accessible drug treatment to ensure that we are \nresponsive to emerging drug-abuse trends.\n  We must continue to shield America's air, land, and sea frontiers \nfrom the drug threat. By devoting more resources to protecting the \nSouthwest border than ever before, we are increasing drug seizures, \nstopping drug smugglers, and disrupting major drug trafficking \noperations. We must continue our interdiction efforts, which have \ngreatly disrupted the trafficking patterns of cocaine smugglers and \nhave blocked the free flow of cocaine through the western Caribbean \ninto Florida and the Southeast.\n  Our comprehensive effort to reduce the drug flow cannot be limited to \nseizing drugs as they enter the United States. We must persist in our \nefforts to break foreign and domestic sources of supply. We know that \nby working with source and transit nations, we can greatly reduce \nforeign supply. International criminal narcotics organizations are a \nthreat to our national security. But if we target these networks, we \ncan dismantle them--as we did the Cali Cartel.\n  We will continue to oppose all calls for the legalization of illicit \ndrugs. Our vigilance is needed now more than ever. We will continue to \nensure that all Americans have access to safe and effective medicine. \nHowever, the current drug legalization movement sends the wrong message \nto our children. It undermines the concerted efforts of parents, \neducators, businesses, elected leaders, community groups, and others to \nachieve a healthy, drug-free society.\n  I am confident that the national challenge of drug abuse can be met \nby extending our strategic vision into the future, educating citizens, \ntreating addiction, and seizing the initiative in dealing with \ncriminals who traffic not only in illegal drugs but in human misery and \nlost lives.\n\n[[Page S1551]]\n\n  Every year drug abuse kills 14,000 Americans and costs taxpayers \nnearly $70 billion. Drug abuse fuels spouse and child abuse, property \nand violent crime, the incarceration of young men and women, the spread \nof AIDS, workplace and motor vehicle accidents, and absenteeism in the \nwork force.\n  For our children's sake and the sake of this Nation, this menace must \nbe confronted through a rational, coherent, cooperative, and long-range \nstrategy. I ask the Congress to join me in a partnership to carry out \nthis national strategy to reduce illegal drug use and its devastating \nimpact on America.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe \nStreets Act of 1968 to encourage States to enact a Law Enforcement \nOfficers' Bill of Rights, to provide standards and protection for the \nconduct of internal police investigations, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n        THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS' BILL OF RIGHTS ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, American families turn on the \nnews every night and get bombarded by the reality that the war against \ncrime and drugs is escalating. No one understands the dangers of this \ndomestic war better than the men and women who serve on the front \nlines. I'm talking about our Nation's police officers.\n  These dedicated individuals offer up their lives as an act of service \nevery day. They know the stress and the strain of walking the daily \nbeat, of being caught in the crossfire in a world of gangs and drugs. \nThese officers experience first-hand the casualties of our national \nepidemic.\n  As the Washington Post reported this Sunday, seven law enforcement \nofficers right here in the Nation's Capital have been killed--in little \nmore than 2 years. Moreover, the ambush of these ``men and women \nwearing badges [occurred]--even though the officers posed no immediate \nthreat to their attackers.''\n  Our Nation's police officers endure unfathomable pressure every day \nas they fight to take back our streets. In the words of one officer, \n``the ultimate sacrifice could occur at any time. * * * [The gangs and \ncriminals] have rewritten the rule book.''\n  To make matters worse, the pressure of crime and drugs--of gangs and \nthugs--is multiplied by the fear of unjust disciplinary actions. Our \nlaw enforcement officers face intrusive investigations into their \nprofessional and personal lives--oftentimes at the behest of some \nrecently arrested criminal looking for a payback.\n  Our officers live in the fear of: being investigated without notice; \nbeing interrogated without an attorney; and being dismissed without a \nhearing.\n  We must act now to address this situation by guaranteeing our police \nofficers their basic and fundamental rights. So, today, along with Mr. \nBiden and Mr. Leahy, I proudly introduce the Law Enforcement Officers' \nBill of Rights.\n  This bill protects rights that most of us take for granted. For \nexample, it allows police officers to be involved in, or refrain from, \npolitical activity.\n  The bill also gives significant due process rights to every police \nofficer subject to investigation for noncriminal disciplinary action. \nSome of these rights include:\n  The right to be informed of the administrative charges prior to being \nquestioned; the right to be advised of the results of an investigation; \nthe right to a hearing and an opportunity to respond; and the right to \nbe represented by counsel or other representative.\n  We owe our law enforcement officers a national debt of gratitude for \ntheir valiant fight in a battle that must be won. I ask my colleagues \nto show their appreciation and understanding of the plight of our \npolice force. We must act boldly to equip every officer with basic and \nfundamental rights.\n  Finally, I must conclude by explaining that this bill is a product of \nyears of input from the men and women who have experienced these daily \npressures, and continue to endure them. This legislation has benefited \nfrom the thoughtful ideas and past support of many law enforcement \ngroups, including the Fraternal Order of Police, the National \nAssociation of Police Organizations, and the International Brotherhood \nof Police Officers.\n\n[[Page S1554]]\n\n  In particular, I am grateful to the contribution made by the \nFraternal Order of Police. Over the past 6 years, I have worked closely \nwith the Kentucky FOP to develop and promote this legislation. Seasoned \nand well-informed officers like Ray Franklin and Mike Hettich, both of \nwhom are National FOP officers from my home State, have worked with me \nin refining the language of this bill and developing grassroots \nmomentum. I would also like to say a personal word of thanks to Verlin \nFlaherty, Rick McCubbin, and Martin Scott.\n  The time has come to protect those who protect us. We must give our \nlaw enforcement officers the basic and fundamental rights that they \ndesperately need and deserve.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 348\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Rights of law enforcement officers.''.\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today, we renew our call for the \ncongress to pass the ``law enforcement officers' bill of rights act.'' \nFor 6 years, I have been working with Senator McConnell, other \nSenators, and the Nation's police officers to pass into law a bill \nprotecting the rights of law enforcement officers on the front line of \nthis Nation's fight against violent crime and drug trafficking.\n  Before addressing the specifics of this legislation, I want to \ndiscuss the reality of law enforcement today. The simple fact is that \nas Federal, State, and local officials push to expand ``community'' or \n``problem-solving'' policing we are necessarily requiring police \nofficers to move away from standard procedures and towards more \ncreative approaches.\n  Of course, as we encourage creativity, there is always the need to \nguarantee the highest standards of police conduct.\n  Unfortunately, because police department's internal disciplinary \nprocedures vary so widely across the Nation, we are literally moving at \ncross-purposes. On the one hand, we are calling on police officers to \ntake more creative approaches--which naturally raises the\n\n[[Page S1556]]\n\nchances of technical violations of department procedures.\n  While, on the other hand, we subject police officers to varying, \noften ad hoc, disciplinary procedures which do make clear what specific \nconduct is appropriate, nor what will happen should the conduct turn \nout to be a mistake.\n  In fact, the practices that many departments use to guide internal \ninvestigations frequently allow police executives to take arbitrary and \nunfair actions against innocent police officers, while allowing \nculpable officers to avoid any punishment at all.\n  The law enforcement officers' bill of rights is designed to replace \nthe ad hoc nature of many internal police investigations by encouraging \nStates to provide minimum procedural standards to guide such \ninvestigations. The standards and protections offered by this bill are \nmodeled on the standards for law enforcement agencies developed by the \nNational Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement.\n  As the preface to the commission's standards on internal affairs \nnotes:\n\n       ``The internal affairs function is important for the \n     maintenance of professional conduct in a law enforcement \n     agency. The integrity of the agency depends on the personal \n     integrity and discipline of each employee. To a large degree, \n     the pubic image of the agency is determined by the quality of \n     the internal affairs function in responding to allegations of \n     misconduct by the agency or its employees.''\n\n  The specific standards and rights guaranteed by the law enforcement \nofficers bill of rights are designed to improve and enhance the quality \nof the internal affairs function, including: The right to be informed \nby a written statement of the charges brought against an officer; The \nright to be free from undue coercion or harassment during an \ninvestigation; and The right to counsel during an investigation.\n  The provisions of this bill will take effect at the end of the second \nfull legislative term of each State. After such time, a law enforcement \nofficer whose rights have been abridged may sue in state court for \npecuniary and other damages, including full reinstatement.\n  Although the bill provides certain procedural rights, it gives States \nconsiderable discretion in implementing these safeguards, including the \nflexibility to provide for summary punishment and emergency suspensions \nof law enforcement officers.\n  It is also important to note what the bill does not do. The bill \nexplicitly provides that the standards and protections governing \ninternal investigations shall not apply to investigations of criminal \nmisconduct by law enforcement officers. As a result, criminal \ninvestigations of law enforcement officers would not be affected by \nthis bill.\n  Moreover, the protections in this bill do not apply to minor \nviolations of departmental rules or regulations, nor to actions taken \non the basis of an officers' employment-related performance.\n  I would also like to acknowledge the hard work of several of the \nNation's leading law enforcement organizations on this important bill. \nThe real leaders behind this effort--and they have been the leaders \nsince the police officers' bill of rights won passage in the Senate in \n1991--are the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of \nPolice Organizations, the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, \nand the National Troopers Coalition. No one should be confused about \nwhere the force behind the law enforcement officers bill of rights \nlies--it lies with these organizations.\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I join as an original sponsor of the \nLaw Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights Act of 1997.\n  Our State and local law enforcement officers are the backbone of our \nnation's anticrime, antigang and anti-drug efforts. Together with local \nprosecutors and an energized public, our local law enforcement officers \nare responsible for much of the good news we have had over the last few \nyears, as crime rates across the county have declined. The President's \ncommunity policing program, which is assisting local law enforcement to \nadd 100,000 additional cops on the beat, is paying off. More police \nofficers are patrolling our neighborhoods, towns, cities, and rural \nareas, and it is helping communities across America.\n  On the first day of this Congress, I joined in sponsoring S. 15 with \nthe minority leader and other Democrats. With that bill, we hope to \ntake the next step against crime by redoubling our efforts against \nyouth gangs and drugs. State and local officers are essential \nparticipants in these initiatives.\n  When I was privileged to serve as state's attorney for Chittenden \nCounty, I had the good fortune to work alongside a number of dedicated \nState and local officers. These public servants literally put their \nlives on the line each day to protect all of us. Since coming to the \nSenate, I have tried to do my best to support local law enforcement. \nTheir responsibilities require split-second judgment, dedication, \ntiming, and guts. We hold the men and women who serve in law \nenforcement to the highest standards because public respect for the law \nis so critical.\n  This legislation is an effort to spell out what the Constitution's \nguarantee of due process means to law enforcement officers subjected to \nadministrative disciplinary proceedings. It is our hope that these \nstandards will serve the public by helping specify fair, prompt \nprocedures for determining whether a rule relating to an officer's \nservice has been violated. This measure should make unnecessary \nprolonged litigation challenging whether disciplinary procedures were \nsufficient to satisfy officers' constitutional rights to due process. \nThese kinds of fair processes should provide the public and law \nenforcement officers with confidence in both the outcome of such \nadministrative proceedings as well as the fairness of the procedures \nused to determine questions of possible misconduct.\n  When a law enforcement officer engages in wrongdoing, it reflects \nbadly on all law enforcement. No one is harder on those few officers \nwho go bad than fellow law enforcement officers. This bill will do \nnothing to protect those wrongdoers. Officers under criminal \ninvestigation or those subject to immediate suspension because there is \nprobable cause to believe they committed a felony or pose a threat to \npublic safety will find no comfort here. This bill should not affect \ncriminal investigations, nor for that matter, civil lawsuits against \nofficers.\n  The procedural protections provided by this bill attach in \nadministrative proceedings. They provide officers with a minimum \nthreshold of due process protection by requiring that the officers be \ninformed of charges against them, have a right to a fair hearing, be \nallowed representation, be advised of the results of internal \ninvestigations and be afforded an opportunity to review and comment on \nadverse actions.\n  I hope that we can make progress on this bill and look forward to \nworking with representatives of State and local government, police \nchiefs, sheriffs, troopers, and other interested parties as we proceed. \nAs a cosponsor, I will work to improve this bill. For example, I would \nlike to be able to provide greater privacy protection for officers' \nmedical records as well as for the financial information already \nincluded in the bill. At the same time, I remain concerned that \ndisciplinary actions be open to the public. When a hearing is \njustifiably closed, its results should nonetheless be made public. I am \nconfident that we can work out such details in a consensus, bipartisan \neffort.\n  I am convinced that it is worth the effort to reassure those who \nserve us that we respect their rights and reputations. While no one is \nabove the law, everyone is entitled to be treated fairly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Hollings):\n  S. 349. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nexpanding, intensifying, and coordinating activities of the National \nHeart, Lung, and Blood Institute with respect to heart attack, stroke, \nand other cardiovascular diseases in women; to the Committee on Labor \nand Human Resources.\n\n\n    THE WOMEN'S CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES RESEARCH AND PREVENTION ACT\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Women's \nCardiovascular Diseases Research and Prevention Act, a bill to expand \nand intensify research and educational outreach programs regarding \ncardiovascular diseases in women. This bill will aid our Nation's \ndoctors and scientists in developing a coordinated and comprehensive \nstrategy for fighting this terrible disease.\n\n[[Page S1557]]\n\n  Cardiovascular disease is the No. 1 killer of women in the United \nStates. Over 479,000 women die from cardiovascular disease each year \nand 1 in 5 women has some form of the disease. Research is our best \nhope for averting this national tragedy which strikes so many of our \ngrandmothers, mothers, aunts, and daughters.\n  The Women's Cardiovascular Diseases Research and Prevention Act \nauthorizes $140 million to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute \nto expand and intensify research, prevention, and educational outreach \nprograms for heart attack, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases in \nwomen.\n  This bill will educate women and doctors about the dire threat heart \ndisease poses to women's health. It will help train doctors to better \nrecognize symptoms of cardiovascular disease which are unique to women. \nIt would also teach women about risk factors, such as smoking, obesity, \nand physical inactivity, which greatly increase their chances of \ndeveloping coronary heart disease.\n  For years, women have been under-represented in studies conducted on \nheart disease and stroke. Models and tests for detection have been \nconducted largely on men. This legislation will help ensure that women \nare well represented in future heart and stroke research studies.\n  The Women's Cardiovascular Diseases Research and Prevention Act is \nbeing introduced in the House today by Representative Maxine Waters.\n  I urge my colleagues to commit to combating cardiovascular disease by \nsupporting this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 349\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Women's Cardiovascular \n     Diseases Research and Prevention Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows with respect to women in the \n     United States:\n       (1) Heart attack, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases \n     are the leading causes of death in women.\n       (2) Heart attacks and strokes are leading causes of \n     disability in women.\n       (3) Cardiovascular diseases claim the lives of more women \n     each year than does cancer. Each year more than 479,000 \n     females die of cardiovascular diseases, while approximately \n     246,000 females die of cancer. Heart attack kills more than 5 \n     times as many females as breast cancer. Stroke kills twice as \n     many females as breast cancer.\n       (4) One in 5 females has some form of cardiovascular \n     disease. Of females under age 65, each year more than 20,000 \n     die of heart attacks. In the case of African-American women, \n     from ages 35 to 74 the death rate from heart attacks is \n     approximately twice that of white women and 3 times that of \n     women of other races.\n       (5) Each year since 1984, cardiovascular diseases have \n     claimed the lives of more females than males. In 1992, of the \n     number of individuals who died of such diseases, 52 percent \n     were females and 48 percent were males.\n       (6) The clinical course of cardiovascular diseases is \n     different in women than in men, and current diagnostic \n     capabilities are less accurate in women than in men. Once a \n     woman develops a cardiovascular disease, she is more likely \n     than a man to have continuing health problems, and she is \n     more likely to die.\n       (7) Of women who have had a heart attack, approximately 44 \n     percent die within 1 year of the attack. Of men who have had \n     such an attack, 27 percent die within 1 year. At older ages, \n     women who have had a heart attack are twice as likely as men \n     to die from the attack within a few weeks. Women are more \n     likely than men to have a stroke during the first 6 years \n     following a heart attack. More than 60 percent of women who \n     suffer a stroke die within 8 years. Long-term survivorship of \n     stroke is better in women than in men. Of individuals who die \n     from a stroke, each year approximately 61 percent are \n     females. In 1992, 87,124 females died from strokes. Women \n     have unrecognized heart attacks more frequently than men. Of \n     women who died suddenly from heart attack, 63 percent had no \n     previous evidence of disease.\n       (8) More than half of the annual health care costs that are \n     related to cardiovascular diseases are attributable to the \n     occurrence of the diseases in women, each year costing this \n     Nation hundreds of billions of dollars in health care costs \n     and lost productivity.\n\n     SEC. 3. EXPANSION AND INTENSIFICATION OF ACTIVITIES REGARDING \n                   HEART ATTACK, STROKE, AND OTHER CARDIOVASCULAR \n                   DISEASES IN WOMEN.\n\n       Subpart 2 of part C of title IV of the Public Health \n     Service Act (42 U.S.C. 285b et seq.) is amended by inserting \n     after section 424 the following:\n\n\n   ``heart attack, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases in women\n\n       ``Sec. 424A.

A bill to authorize payment of special annuities to surviving \nspouses of deceased members of the uniformed services who are \nineligible for a survivor annuity under transition laws relating to the \nestablishment of the Survivor Benefit Plan under chapter 73 of title \n10, United States Code; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n                          annuity legislation\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwould authorize a modest annuity of $165 a month for a group of \nsurviving spouses of former service members who died before March 21, \n1974, and were retired from active duty. The bill would also apply to \nsurviving spouses of service members retired from the Reserves between \nSeptember 21, 1972 and October 1, 1978.\n  At the time these service members retired from the military, there \nwas no plan to take care of these widows as we have today. The same \nconcerns that moved the Congress to authorize the current survivor \nbenefit plan are true for this group of forgotten widows. The \nbeneficiaries of this plan are all seniors now. For some, this small \nannuity will make the difference between a life of dependency and a \nlife of dignity and independence. Let us correct this situation and \ntake care of the service members spouses who had the courage to serve \ntheir Nation in the troubling time periods of the Korean and Vietnam \nwars.\n  I have tried to get this legislation passed in previous Congresses \nonly to be frustrated by budget rules and CBO scoring.\n  Mr. President, we must not allow bureaucratic rules to stand in our \nway because, one fact remains true. The\n\n[[Page S1558]]\n\nlonger we delay, the fewer of these widows there are to benefit from \nthe legislation. I do not want to be remembered as one who forgot this \ngroup who have become known as the Forgotten Widows. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me and support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                            By Mrs. MURRAY:\n\n  S. 351. A bill to provide for teacher technology training; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n              THE TEACHER TECHNOLOGY TRAINING ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, technology is changing our world. It \naffects the way we communicate, the way we conduct commerce, and the \nway our children learn in school. Young people today are in the midst \nof a technology explosion that has really opened up limitless \npossibilities in the classroom. In order for our students to tap into \nthis potential and be prepared for the 21st century, they have to learn \nhow to use technology. But all too often today, teachers are expected \nto incorporate technology into their instruction without being given \nthe training to do so.\n  A recent study by the Office of Technology Assessment shows that a \nmajority of teachers feel they need additional training in order to \nadequately use a personal computer. In fact, school districts across \nthe country spend less than 15 percent of their technology budgets on \nteacher training. Hardware, software, access to the Internet are only \nhelpful to the educational process if teachers are equipped with the \nknowledge to use that technology.\n  That is why I am introducing today the Teacher Technology Training \nAct of 1997, which will add technology to the areas of professional \ndevelopment and teacher training on the Elementary and Secondary \nSchools Act of 1994. My legislation will require States to incorporate \ntechnology requirements in teacher training content and performance \nstandards. School districts and local educational agencies that receive \nFederal funding for professional development have to include technology \nclasses in their programs. In addition, institutions of higher \neducation will be strongly encouraged to include technology in their \neducation programs.\n  There are two parts to providing students access to technology: \nputting computers into the schools, and training teachers in how to use \nthem. Last year, I authored and we passed two amendments that would \nallow surplus computers from Government agencies to be made available \nto educational institutions across this country. In addition, Congress \nprovided the E-rate in the telecommunications legislation we passed \nlast year that will provide Internet connections to schools at \ndiscounted rates. I also fought for a fivefold increase in \nappropriations for new technology and classrooms.\n  These are steps toward ensuring that all schools have computer \ntechnology. Now I want work to make sure that teachers are properly \ntrained to use these computers.\n  Recently, the Department of Education reported that only one in five \nof our Nation's teachers currently use computers in our classrooms--one \nout of five. Since technology training today focuses primarily on the \nmechanics of operating equipment, not on integrating technology into \nthe curriculum, this is not surprising.\n  Washington State, my home State, has become a State synonymous with \nMicrosoft, Boeing, and thousands of other leading high-technology \ncompanies. The Information Technology Association of America reports \nthat these information technology companies are short 190,000 employees \ntoday. These are employees dependent upon a technology curriculum and \ntrained teachers in our schools.\n  When I toured my State of Washington last week, I was astounded by \nthe advances made within our classrooms. At Seattle's Nathan Hale High \nSchool, I saw a science class that utilized computers to track weather \npatterns and charts the effects on their region. They have created \ntheir own web pages and are able to hourly tap into the National \nWeather Service. Their final grade was then based on their ability to \nproduce an accurate 5-day weather forecast.\n  I also saw physically challenged students openly communicate with \ntheir teacher through enhanced computer technology. In the city of \nBellingham, I spoke with a student-teacher who was concerned that when \nshe and others went out into the field, there would be teachers who did \nnot know how to use the technology. She felt that many of the students \nare far ahead of the teachers in their ability to use technology. In \nGrays Harbor County, I toured a facility supported by a public-private \npartnership. This lifelong learning center takes surplus computers and \nteaches student how to repair them and maintain their technology. The \npossibilities for learning are limitless.\n  Having technology available for instructors does not directly change \nteaching or learning. What matters is how successfully teachers can \nincorporate technology into their classrooms.\n  We know that technology is only one tool the teachers need to be \neffective in their jobs. My bill seeks to promote technology training. \nI have received support for this legislation from the National \nEducation Association, the Washington Software and Digital Alliance, \nUniversity Presidents and Deans, Washington School Principals, and many \ncorporate and educational institutions.\n  Mr. President, as a former preschool teacher, a parent education \ninstructor, a former school board member, and as a parent, I know the \nneeds of students and teachers have changed dramatically in recent \nyears. My own children have benefit from the use of technology in their \nclassrooms. But a school full of computers is useless if teachers don't \nhave the necessary training to show students how to use them.\n  As a member of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, I intend to \nfight for this legislation in Congress. I urge my colleagues' support \nfor this bill so that we can provide teachers with the tools necessary \nto teach in today's changing classrooms and tomorrow's work force.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN:\n  S. 352. A bill to require the United States Sentencing Commission to \namend the Federal sentencing guidelines to provide an enhanced penalty \nfor follow-on bombings; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               The Police and rescue squad protection act\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the bombings in Atlanta over the \npast 2 months--the second of which occurred last weekend--have marked \nthe opening of yet another unfortunate new chapter in the escalation of \ndomestic terrorism.\n  While the magnitude of these attacks were far less than the World \nTrade Center and Oklahoma City bombings, they were noteworthy for the \npernicious technique this criminal--or criminal organization--used:\n  First, the terrorists attracted police, firefighters, and rescue \nworkers to the scene by detonating one bomb,\n  And then, with the unmistakable intent to injure the public safety \nofficers responding to the first explosion, detonated a second \nexplosive device in the parking lot outside the location of the first \nbombing.\n  According to the experts, this tactic is one imported from the hotbed \nof terrorist activity--the Middle East.\n  On two occasions last year, follow-on bombs were detonated in \nSouthern Lebanon. One almost killed Israel's northern commander--Maj. \nGen. Amiram Levine.\n  Then this January, only 6 days before the Atlanta abortion clinic \nbombing, two bombs were detonated only 10 minutes apart near a bus \nstation in Tel Aviv. Thirteen people were injured, including one police \nofficer who came to the scene in response to the first bomb and was \nwounded by the second.\n  Last month in Atlanta, the first bomb injured no one, but the \n``follow-on'' bomb wounded seven people, including two FBI agents, one \nATF agent, and two local firefighters. Experts have stated that many \nmore rescue workers would have been injured had the force of the second \nblast not been deflected by a car, which just happened to be parked in \nthe right spot.\n  Five people were injured by the bomb that exploded in an Atlanta \nrestaurant last Friday, but fortunately, the police found the second \nbomb and detonated it with a remote-controlled robot.\n  Of course, all terrorist acts are horrific. But this follow-on \nbombing tactic\n\n[[Page S1559]]\n\nis especially henious because the technique is designed to do one \nthing-- kill the police, firefighters, paramedics, and all the other \nprofessionals who unhesitatingly rush to the scene of a bombing to \nprovide aid to the wounded.\n\n  Mark my words: now that this tactic has been employed in Atlanta, \ncovered by the national media, and probably communicated across the \ncountry through the Internet, some other devious, sick, individual, \nsomewhere in the United States, will do it again. Mark my words.\n  I believe that those who employ tactics aimed exclusively at injuring \nthe police, firefighters, and other public safety officers should be \npunished above and beyond whatever punishment they would receive for \ndestroying property or causing injury.\n  That is why today I am introducing the Police and Rescue Squad \nProtection Act.\n  The bill will increase the punishment for anyone who plants a follow-\non bomb with the intent to injure public safety officers. And it \nclearly states that anyone who detonates, or attempts to detonate one \nbomb right after another bomb in the same location is acting with the \ncriminal intent to injure law enforcement and emergency medical \nofficials.\n  In my view, this legislation will send a strong message that we will \nnot tolerate the grotesque tactics that we've seen in the streets of \nTel Aviv, and now, in Atlanta.\n  More importantly, this legislation honors those who, without fear or \nhesitation, put themselves in jeopardy at a time of crisis.\n  If this bill deters one terrorist from planting a follow-on bomb and \nsaves the life of one police officer, firefighter, ambulance driver, or \nparamedic that rushes to the scene of a crime, then it will have been \nwell worth the energy expended to enact it.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in this effort.\n                                 F_____\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY:\n  S. 353. A bill to amend title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act \nand part 7 of subtitle B of title I of the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act of 1974 to establish standards for protection of consumers \nin managed care plans and other health plans; to the Committee on Labor \nand Human Resources.\n\n\n              THE HEALTH INSURANCE BILL OF RIGHTS OF 1997\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am introducing today the Health \nInsurance Bill of Rights Act to provide quality assurance and patient \nprotection. Companion legislation is being introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by Congressman Dingell, Congressman Waxman, Congressman \nCardin, and others.\n  This legislation is a needed response to the surging growth of \nmanaged care and the rapid changes taking place in the health insurance \nmarket--changes that too often put insurance industry profits ahead of \npatients' health needs.\n  Managed care has mushroomed over the past decade. In 1987, only 13 \npercent of privately insured Americans were enrolled in HMOs. Today, \nthat figure is 75 percent. At its best, managed care offers the \nopportunity to achieve both greater efficiency and higher quality in \nhealth care. In too many cases, however, the pressure for profits leads \nto lesser care--not better care. Too many managed care firms and other \ninsurance companies have decided that the shortest route to higher \nprofits and a competitive edge is by denying patients the care they \nneed and deserve.\n  Some of the most flagrant abuses by insurance plans have been \ndocumented in recent months:\n  Just last year Congress enacted legislation to block drive-by \ndeliveries and prevent new mothers and their babies from being evicted \nfrom hospitals in less than 48 hours.\n  Breast cancer patients are being forced to undergo mastectomies on an \noutpatient basis, when sound medical advice requires a reasonable \nhospital stay.\n  Children are being permanently injured or even losing their lives \nbecause their parents are forced to drive past the nearest emergency \nroom to a more distant hospital because it has the contract with their \nhealth plan.\n  Doctors are being subjected to gag rules that keep them from giving \ntheir patients their best medical advice.\n  People with rare and dangerous diseases are being denied access to \nspecialists to treat their conditions.\n  Patients can't get needed pharmaceutical drugs, because the \nparticular drug they need is not on the list of drugs approved for \ncoverage by their insurance plan; sometimes such lists are developed \nand administered by pharmaceutical companies bent on selling their own \ndrugs and blocking competition.\n\n  Patients are being misdiagnosed, sometimes with fatal results, \nbecause insurance plans cut corners on diagnostic tests.\n  Victims of cancer and other serious diseases are being denied \nparticipation in quality clinical trials offering the only hope of cure \nfor otherwise incurable conditions.\n  Children afflicted with serious, chronic conditions are being denied \naccess to the medical centers with the only available expertise to \ntreat their conditions effectively.\n  These abuses are not typical of most insurance companies. But they \nare common enough that an overwhelming 80 percent of Americans now \nbelieve that their quality of care is often compromised by their \ninsurance plan to save money. It is time to deal with these festering \nproblems. Good business practices can improve health care, but health \ncare must be more than just another business.\n  The legislation we are introducing today establishes basic standards \nfor insurance plans in six specific areas:\n  First, access to care, including specialty care, emergency care, and \nclinical trials.\n  Second, standards for quality of care.\n  Third, information that must be available to patients.\n  Fourth, expeditious and fair appeal procedures when physicians or \npatients disagree with plan decisions.\n  Fifth, protection of the doctor-patient relationship, by banning gag \nrules and objectionable compensation arrangements.\n  Sixth, a requirement that plan guidelines may not override good \nmedical practice.\n  These steps will not eliminate every abuse that occurs in the \ninsurance industry, but they will go a long way to addressing the major \nproblems patients confront.\n  At the most basic level, the legislation establishes a right to \nneeded care. A patient facing a health emergency should not be required \nto go to a distant emergency room, or to obtain prior authorization for \ncare. Someone suffering from a serious condition requiring specialty \ncare should not be denied that care because an insurance company thinks \nit is too expensive. Someone with a condition that cannot be addressed \nby conventional therapies should have a reasonable opportunity to \nparticipate in a quality clinical trial that offers the hope of \neffective treatment. Plans should set up clear, fair, and timely appeal \nprocedures for cases in which the plan fails to fulfill its \nobligations.\n\n  Historically, patients have relied on their personal physician to be \nthe best source of impartial advice on needed care. This legislation \nmaintains that critical role by prohibiting plans from restricting \ndoctor-patient communications or from establishing compensation plans \nthat bribe or penalize doctors into representing the plan's interest at \nthe expense of their patients' health.\n  To maintain and improve quality of care, all managed care plans will \nbe required to set up a separate unit dedicated to quality, and to \ncollect data to verify that the plan, in fact, is providing care that \nmeets objective quality standards.\n  Patients will be guaranteed full information about plan coverage, \nappeal rights, access to primary care doctors and other specialists, \nand other needed information. Plans will be required to collect and \nmake available standardized data for consumers to compare plans.\n  These provisions add up to a health insurance bill of rights that \nwill protect millions of Americans.\n  I look forward to working with a broad range of physician, patient, \nand industry groups as Congress considers this legislation. Action is \nessential and overdue to provide these needed protections. The bottom \nline in health care must be patient needs, not industry profits. \nConcerned citizens in all parts of the country are demanding action, \nand Congress owes them a response.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S1560]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 353\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Prior \n     authorization for such care is not required. After assessment \n     and stabilization, further needed care is covered if \n     medically necessary.\n       Access to specialty care.--Obstetrician/gynecologist \n     care.--If a plan requires patients to designate a primary \n     care physician, women have the right to choose an \n     obstetrician/gynecologist as their primary care provider. In \n     any case, they have the right to direct access to an \n     obstetrician/gynecologist for routine gynecological care and \n     pregnancy services without prior authorization from their \n     primary care provider.\n       Other specialty care.--Enrollees with life-threatening, \n     chronic, degenerative or other serious conditions which \n     require specialty care must be provided access to the \n     appropriate specialists or centers of excellence capable of \n     providing quality care for the condition. If a plan does not \n     have a participating specialist for a condition covered under \n     the plan, the plan must refer the patient to a non-\n     participating specialist at no additional cost.\n       A plan must have a procedure to allow individuals with a \n     serious illness and ongoing need for specialty care to \n     receive care from a specialist who will coordinate all care \n     for that individual.\n       A plan must have a procedure for standing referrals for \n     individuals requiring on-going specialty care if a primary \n     care provider, in consultation with the patient, the medical \n     director of the plan and specialist (if any) determine that a \n     standing referral is needed.\n       Continuity of Care.--If a plan or provider terminates a \n     contract for reasons other than failure to meet quality \n     requirements, the plan must allow an enrollee continued \n     treatment with the provider for a transitional period. Time \n     frames vary depending upon type of care being provided (e.g. \n     primary, institutional, pregnancy, terminal, etc.)\n       Participation in clinical trials.--If an enrollee has a \n     serious condition for which there is no effective standard \n     treatment and is eligible for an approved clinical trial that \n     offers the potential for substantial clinical benefit, the \n     plan must pay for the routine patient costs of participation \n     in the trial.\n       Choice of Provider.--A plan must provide an updated list of \n     all participating providers and their ability to accept \n     additional patients. Enrollees must be permitted to obtain \n     services from any provider within the plan identified in the \n     plan documents as available to the enrollee.\n       Prescription Drugs.--If a plan provides benefits for \n     prescription drugs within a formulary, the plan must allow \n     physicians to participate in the development of the plan \n     formulary, disclose the nature of formulary restrictions, and \n     provide for exceptions when medically necessary.\n\n\n                      Subpart 2: Quality Assurance\n\n       Internal quality assurance program.--Every plan is required \n     to establish and maintain a quality assurance and improvement \n     program that uses data based on both performance and patient \n     outcomes.\n       Collection of standardized data.--Plans must report certain \n     standard information to state agencies and the public. The \n     information must be reported in accordance with uniform \n     national standards to be specified by the Secretary. This \n     information will include at least utilization data, \n     demographic data, mortality rates, disenrollment statistics \n     and satisfaction surveys, and quality indicators.\n       Selection of providers.--The plan must have a written \n     process for selection of providers including a listing of the \n     professional\n\n[[Page S1569]]\n\n     requirements. The process must include verification of the \n     provider's credentials. Plans may not use a high risk patient \n     base or a provider's location in an area serving residents \n     with poor health status as a basis for exclusion.\n       Drug utilization program.--If the plan covers prescription \n     medications, it must have a plan to encourage appropriate \n     drug use and monitor and reduce illness arising from improper \n     use.\n       Standards for utilization review activities.--Utilization \n     review refers to the plan's review of requests for care. It \n     is defined as evaluation of clinical necessity and efficacy. \n     Written clinical review criteria are required. Utilization \n     review must be supervised by a licensed physician. Its \n     activities must be executed by appropriately qualified staff. \n     There can be no incentives to render adverse determinations. \n     Deadlines for response to requests for authorization of care \n     are established. Adverse determinations must be in writing \n     and include the reasons for the determination. Such notices \n     must also include instructions for making an appeal.\n\n\n                     Subpart 3: Patient Information\n\n       Patient Information.--Plans must describe and make \n     available to current and prospective enrollees procedures for \n     providing emergency care and care outside normal business \n     hours, for selecting and changing physicians, and for \n     obtaining consultations. They must also list participating \n     providers by category and make clear which members of that \n     list are available to a prospective or current enrollee. The \n     plan must provide information which describes coverage, \n     financial responsibilities of enrollees, methods of obtaining \n     referrals, utilization review processes, and grievance \n     procedures and must include a description of how the plan \n     addresses the needs of non-English speaking enrollees and \n     others with special communication needs. It must describe how \n     providers are paid.\n       Protection of patient confidentiality.--A program to assure \n     compliance with state and federal confidentiality \n     requirements must be in place.\n\n\n                    Subpart 4: Grievance Procedures\n\n       Provisions relating to appeals of utilization review \n     determination and similar determinations.--A plan must \n     establish and maintain a system to handle and resolve \n     complaints brought against the plan by enrollees and \n     providers. The system should address all aspects of the \n     plan's services, including complaints regarding quality of \n     care, choice and accessibility of providers, and network \n     adequacy. The legislation specifies several components of \n     such a system, including provisions for staffing and staff \n     accessibility, information about appeal procedures, and the \n     time frame within which the plan must respond to complaints. \n     The bill provides for a two stage appeal process, with \n     requirements for a review panel of non-involved providers and \n     consultants employed by the plan in the second phase. Written \n     explanation of each stage of an appeal must be provided. \n     Timely decisions are required. Examples of adverse \n     determinations include denial for emergency care, access to \n     specialists, choice of provider, continuity of care, or \n     payment for routine costs in connection with an approved \n     clinical trial. In the case of experimental therapy to save \n     the life of a patient, an external independent review process \n     with mandatory decision powers is available if the plan \n     chooses not to provide coverage for the treatment. For \n     appeals of other important issues, the plan must either (1) \n     participate in an independent review process established by \n     the state (or the Secretary of Labor for self-insured plans) \n     to make advisory determinations; or (2) establish a third \n     stage of appeal within the plan certified by the Secretary as \n     fair, impartial, and involving independent reviewers to make \n     advisory decisions.\n       Health Insurance Ombudsman.--A Health Insurance Ombudsman \n     will be established in each state to assist consumers in \n     choosing health insurance, and to provide assistance to \n     patients dissatisfied with their treatment. Assistance \n     includes aiding enrollees in filing complaints and appeals, \n     investigating poor quality or improper treatment, and \n     bringing such instances to the attention of the applicable \n     state authority or, in the case of self-insured insurance \n     plans, to the attention of the Secretary of Labor. The \n     legislation authorizes funds to be appropriated to the \n     Secretary to provide grants to state authorities to establish \n     the program.\n\n\n Subpart 5: Protection of Providers against Interference with Medical \n                 Communications and Improper Incentives\n\n       Prohibition of interference with certain medical \n     communications.--The plan may not prohibit or restrict the \n     provider from engaging in medical communications with the \n     enrollee. Such communications may include discussion of the \n     enrollee's health status, medical care, or treatment options; \n     provisions of the plan's utilization review requirements; or \n     any financial incentives that may affect the treatment of the \n     enrollee.\n       Ban on improper incentive arrangements.--There may be no \n     incentives to limit medically necessary services. Provider \n     risk is limited. The Secretary shall apply the same rules \n     which apply to the Medicare program. The plan may not have a \n     contract which requires transfer of liability for malpractice \n     caused by the plan from the plan to the provider.\n\n\n Subpart 6: Promoting Good Medical Practice and Protecting the Doctor-\n                          Patient Relationship\n\n       Plans are prohibited from denying coverage for medically \n     necessary and appropriate care otherwise covered by the plan, \n     as determined by the treating physician and consistent with \n     generally accepted principles of good medical practice. This \n     provision would prohibit plans from arbitrarily limiting care \n     provided, for example, by requiring that mastectomies be \n     provided on an outpatient basis.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 354. A bill to amend the Federal Property and Administrative \nServices Act of 1949 to prohibit executive agencies from awarding \ncontracts that contain a provision allowing for the acquisition by the \ncontractor, at Government expense, of certain equipment or facilities \nto carry out the contract if the principal purpose of such provision is \nto increase competition by establishing an alternative source of supply \nfor property or services; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n        the fair competition in federal procurement act of 1997\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Senator Kerry and I are offering \nlegislation today to present a serious injustice in Federal \nprocurement. Congressman John Olver is introducing identical \nlegislation in the House of Representatives. This issue has come to our \nattention in the context of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing's \ncontract for U.S. currency paper production, but it could arise in \nother contexts that would pose similar inequities.\n  A respected, long-standing family-owned business in Dalton, MA, Crane \nand Company, has supplied currency paper for the Treasury for the past \n117 years. Crane has been a trusted supplier to the Federal Government, \nproviding high quality products on a timely basis. It has negotiated \nreasonable terms with the Government, keeping its price increases below \nthe rate of inflation. And it has made substantial investments over the \nyears to ensure that it has the sophisticated equipment needed to \nproduce the currency, including the special security features now built \ninto the paper itself.\n  This year, however, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing has proposed \nto go to extraordinary lengths to create alternate sources for currency \npaper production. The Bureau has proposed subsidies to other companies \nto help them become competitive and buy the state-of-the-art equipment \nthat Crane bought on its own. This is not fair competition. It's a \nmisguided policy that will give other companies an unfair advantage and \ncreate an unlevel playing field.\n  Our legislation is straightforward. It amends section 303 of the \nFederal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to prohibit \nnondefense agencies in the executive branch from financing equipment or \nfacilities to help a contractor compete against an existing contractor \nin Federal procurement. With all the pressures of the deficit, we \nshould not be spending taxpayer money on this sort of sham competition. \nIt's unfair to leading-edge firms like Crane that have invested their \nown resources to obtain Government contracts, and it's hard to see how \nany taxpayers will benefit. Crane is in a class by itself. There is no \nsuggestion of antitrust problems. Crane wins these contracts fair and \nsquare against potential competitors, and it should not have to compete \nwith Uncle Sam.\n  I urge the Congress to enact this legislation and prevent an \nextremely unfair and unwise policy from moving forward at the Treasury \nDepartment or other Federal agencies.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAMM (for himself, and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 355. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make the \nresearch credit permanent; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                      research credit legislation\n\n Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, today Senator Hutchison and I are \nintroducing a bill to permanently extend the research and development \ntax credit. The R tax credit was originally enacted as a part of \nPresident Reagan's Economic Recovery and Tax Act of 1981 in order to \nencourage greater private sector investment in research and \ndevelopment. Since its creation, the credit has been extended seven \ntimes, and it is currently set to expire on May 31, 1997.\n  Since its enactment in 1981, the benefits of the R credit have been \nenormous. Studies show that in the short\n\n[[Page S1570]]\n\nrun, every dollar of the R credit stimulates a dollar of additional \nprivate R spending, and in the long run, each dollar of the credit \nyields up to $2 in additional private R spending. Furthermore, the \nrate of return from R spending to society as a whole is estimated to \nbe as high as 60 percent.\n  Given these facts, we can easily expect that the benefits of the \ncredit will only be enhanced if it is extended permanently. A permanent \nextension of the R credit would encourage companies to take on \nadditional research and development projects by allowing them to be \ncertain that the credit will be in effect during these long-run \ninitiatives. In fact, the ratio of R spending to output rose over 40 \npercent in the 1980's when the R credit was in effect for the longest \nperiod of time.\n  The R credit is an effective and proven incentive for companies to \nincrease investment in U.S.-based research and development. The \ncontinued existence of the R credit is particularly important given \nthe substantial tax incentives provided by many of our international \ncompetitors to their domestic R industries. The jobs created by R \nexpenditures are exactly the kind of jobs we all claim to vote. In my \nhome State of Texas alone, the average high-technology job pays $47,019 \na year--almost $20,000 more per year than the average private sector \nsalary of $27,147.\n  The need to make the credit permanent is only further highlighted by \nthe fact that in 1996, for the first time in its history, the R \ncredit was allowed to lapse--there was a gap in the law between July 1, \n1995, through July 1, 1996. Haphazard and unpredictable temporary \nextensions of the credit, combined with this recent lapse, have set a \nnegative precedent for the research community.\n  Businesses cannot and do not ignore the possibility of future gaps in \nthe R credit, and will be understandably driven to scale back new \nlong-term projects if they cannot be certain that the credit will \ncontinue. We should permanently extend the R tax credit to finally \nremove this unnecessary barrier to long-term research and development \nwhich has been created by the stop-and-go extension process.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to point out that the R credit has a \nlong history of bipartisan support. The President has signaled his \nsupport for the credit, not only by signing last year's extension as a \npart of the Small Business Job Protection Act, but also by proposing a \nfurther extension as a part of his fiscal year 1998 budget. \nUnfortunately, his proposal follows the ill-advised precedent of merely \ntemporarily extending the credit.\n  I believe that this credit must be made permanent, and I am proud to \nhave joined 17 members of the Texas delegation in a letter to Chairman \nArcher and Chairman Roth calling for a permanent extension of the R \ntax credit. I ask unanimous consent that the text of this letter and \nthe text of the bill be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks. The time has come for us to demonstrate our long-term \ncommitment to research and development, and I urge my colleagues to \njoin me and Senator Hutchison in sponsoring this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 355\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF RESEARCH CREDIT.\n\n       (a) Credit Made Permanent.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 41 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 is amended by striking subsection (h).\n       (2) Conforming amendment.--Section 45C(b)(1) of such Code \n     is amended by striking subparagraph (D).\n       (3) Effective date.--The amendments made by this subsection \n     shall apply to amounts paid or incurred after May 31, 1997, \n     in taxable years ending after such date.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 13, 1997.\n     Hon William Roth,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Bill Archer,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Gentlemen: We want to thank you for your leadership \n     last year in extending the Research and Development (R) tax \n     credit, and to solicit your further support. As you know, the \n     R credit will expire on May 31, 1997. We would like to \n     express out strong support for a prompt, permanent extension \n     of the credit.\n       There are a number of excellent reasons why Congress should \n     permanently extend the credit. According to a recent study, \n     each dollar of tax benefits generates as much as two dollars \n     of long-term investment spending by the private sector. Also, \n     the ``spillover effects'' of R are outstanding; the rate of \n     return derived by society generally from R spending is \n     estimated to be as much as sixty percent.\n       The R credit enjoys broad, bipartisan support and \n     provides a critical, effective and proven incentive for \n     companies to increase their investment in U.S.-based research \n     and development. The continued encouragement of private \n     sector led R is particularly important in light of the \n     substantial tax and other financial incentives offered by \n     many of our major foreign trade competitors. Moreover, \n     targeted almost exclusively at wages and salaries paid to \n     employees engaged in direct U.S.-based research and \n     development, the credit promotes the creation of new, high-\n     skilled jobs.\n       Texas companies lead the nation in many areas of research \n     and development and the growth of high wage jobs. Continued \n     growth of our economy is closely tied to the ability of our \n     companies to make a sustained commitment to long-term high \n     cost research. Again, thank you for your outstanding effort \n     on Texas' behalf in the past, and we look forward to working \n     with you to continue our shared commitment in research and \n     development.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Phil Gramm\n                                   (and 17 other Members).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Hutchinson, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. \n        Chafee):\n  S. 356. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the Public \nHealth Service Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of \n1974, the title XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act to assure \naccess to emergency medical services under group health plans, health \ninsurance coverage, and the Medicare and Medicaid Programs; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n              THE ACCESS TO EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES ACT\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Graham in \nintroducing the Access to Emergency Medical Services Act of 1997. This \nbill prohibits health plans from denying coverage and payment for \nemergency room visits. I support this bill for three reasons. It \nprotects patients and patients' pocketbooks. It respects medical \ndecisions made by doctors and nurses. It gives HMO's the opportunity to \ndo the right thing.\n  Personal health is not something to take chances with. That's why \nmany people seek emergency assistance when they think something may be \nseriously wrong with their health. They go to the emergency room \nthinking their insurance company covers emergency room treatment. But \nwhen the problem turns out to be a nonemergency, the insurance company \ndenies payment. This is called retrospective denial. I want to end \nretrospective denials. No family should have to second guess getting \nthe care they need because they are worried about being stuck with an \nenormous bill.\n  Last week my office received a phone call from a woman in Frederick, \nMD. She was distraught. She had begged her husband not to take her to \nthe emergency room when she complained of serious chest pains. She knew \ntheir insurance company wouldn't pay. It had happened before. But her \nhusband insisted she go. He was worried about her and wanted her to see \na doctor. She cried all the way to the hospital. A few weeks later she \ngot the notice--her claim was denied. She was stuck with the bill.\n  She was right to go to the emergency room. There are approximately \n200 medical problems that could cause the type of chest pain she \nexperienced ranging from a heart attack to pulmonary emboli to simple \nindigestion. The point is, no one knows for sure what problem they are \nhaving until they get treatment from an emergency room physician.\n  Maryland already has laws in place to guarantee that HMO's will cover \nto emergency services. But we can't practice good emergency medicine \none patient, one ER room, or one State at a time. That's why we need a \nnational law that ensures that medical decisions are made in the ER \nroom, not the corporate boardbroom.\n\n[[Page S1571]]\n\n  This bill will set a new national definition for the term \n``emergency'' without preempting stronger State laws. The ``Prudent \nLayperson Standard'' means that a person with average knowledge of \nhealth and medicine can seek emergency treatment when they think they \nhave a serious medical condition. Quite often, patients do not know \nwhen they go to an emergency room whether their illness is life-\nthreatening or not. With this standard, they are not required to know--\nthey can use their own best judgment. After all, we can't expect the \naverage person to be able to diagnose like a doctor.\n  I am proud that the State of Maryland was the first State to enact \nlegislation to counter these unfair practices. They passed their first \nlaw in 1993. But it took two follow-up laws to clarify the intent of \nthe first one. Work still needs to be done to make sure the law is \nenforced. I salute the Maryland emergency physicians who took this \nissue on, and continue to fight for fair play on behalf of their \npatients.\n  I want to see managed care, but I don't want to see doctors managed. \nThere is a fundamental distinction. We have to start getting our \npriorities straight and decide where we are going to be making our \ndecisions. And in the case of emergencies--I believe the decisions need \nto be made in the emergency room and not the boardroom.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BENNETT (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Craig, \n        Mr. Burns, and Mr. Thomas):\n  S. 357. A bill to authorize the Bureau of Land Management to manage \nthe Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n         THE GRAND STAIRCASE-ESCALANTE RESOURCE PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, in the last Congress, by coincidence, on \nmy birthday, President Clinton announced the creation of the Grand \nStaircase-Escalante National Monument, taking 1.7 million acres in the \nState of Utah and creating a national monument under the authority of \nthe Antiquities Act of 1906. This, frankly, caught a number of us by \ncomplete surprise --well, maybe not complete surprise, because we had \nseen reports in the newspaper that this might be coming. But whenever \nwe spoke to anybody in the administration about it, we were constantly \ntold that no decision has been made.\n  Congressman Orton, the Democratic Congressman in the district in \nwhich this land was located, was told ``nothing is imminent.'' Even 24 \nhours before the announcement was made, people in the White House were \ninsisting that nothing was coming down on this particular subject. And \nthen, as I say, on the morning of my birthday, I received a phone call \nfrom Leon Panetta, not to wish me happy birthday, but to inform me that \nthe President would indeed be creating a new national monument in Utah \nunder his authority as outlined in the Antiquities Act.\n  The process by which the monument was put together was entirely \nclosed to any elected official. No one from the State of Utah who holds \nelected office--not the Governor, neither of the Members of this body, \nnot the Members of the other body, no one--was allowed to make comments \nor be involved in the process of creating the monument. We now know, \nhowever, from press reports that members of what is called the \nenvironmental community were involved in writing this proclamation. \nThey had access to the White House, to the Department of Interior, and \nto administration officials that the rest of us were denied.\n  Out of this closed process came the national monument and, with it, \nfrankly, Mr. President, considerable antagonism and disappointment on \nthe part of many people in Utah--if polls can be believed, a large \nmajority of the people of Utah--at the way they were treated in this \nmatter. ``Not to worry,'' we were assured by the President at the Grand \nCanyon. And I was assured personally on the phone by Leon Panetta that \nthere would be protections of the rights of ordinary citizens written \ninto the pattern of the way this monument would be managed.\n  Mr. Panetta outlined those to me, and I wrote them down. Then, when \nthe President appeared on national television, I followed my list and \nsaw that the President was going down the same list. That is, he made \nexactly the same promises that Mr. Panetta had made as to the way \nthings would be handled in the monument.\n  Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill. It will be known as the \nGrand Staircase-Escalante Resource Protection Act. Its sole purpose is \nto codify the promises the President made when he created the monument. \nI said to my staff, ``Do not put everything in this bill you think we \nmust have. Just make sure the act is entirely just what the President \npromised he would do.''\n  Let me give you some examples of what I mean. On this chart we have \nthe President's statement made on September 18 when he said: ``Families \nwill be able to use this canyon as they always have. The land will \nremain open for multiple uses, including hunting, fishing, hiking, \ncamping, and grazing.''\n  Many of the people who have reacted to the creation of the monument \nhave made it clear that there should never be multiple uses on this \nland. They say that this would be incompatible with its designation as \n``wilderness.'' But the President did not designate the land as \nwilderness. He designated it as a national monument, and he \nspecifically promised--these are his words--that ``The land will remain \nopen for multiple use . . .'' This was taken off the transcript that \nwas available to us the day the President made his statement.\n  Another promise the President made is on this chart. It is a little \nbit longer, but to the people in Utah it may be even more important. He \nsaid, ``Mining revenues from Federal and State land help to support \nyour schools.''\n  He was speaking to the people of Utah.\n\n       I know the children of Utah have a big stake in school \n     lands located within the boundaries of the monument that I am \n     designating today . . . creating this national monument \n     should not and will not come at the expense of Utah's \n     children.\n\n  That is a very important commitment made by the President. It has to \ndo with the fact that almost 200,000 acres in this monument are owned \nby a trust that administers these lands for the benefit of Utah's \nschoolchildren. Under the monument designation, conceivably the trust \nwould lose that ownership unless there can be a pattern of swapping out \nschool acres for other acres outside the boundaries of the monument.\n  These are a few of the President's promises.\n  There was another one which I do not have on the chart but that \nstruck me personally. The President said, ``We will appoint an exchange \nworking group, including Congressman Orton and the two Senators as well \nas the Governor and others, that will examine this issue of school \ntrust land.''\n  It has now been 6 months since the President made that statement, and \nno such group has been proposed by anybody. It has been 6 months since \nthe President made that proclamation, and we don't see any indication \nthat he intends to instruct people to follow through on the promise \nthat the people will be able to use the canyon as they always have. And \nwe see no indication that the people in the administration are taking \nany steps to make Utah's schoolchildren whole for the income that they \nwill lose as a result of the creation of this monument.\n  If I were to pick up the phone and call the White House today and ask \nfor Leon Panetta to remind him of the pledge he made to me, I would be \ntold, ``Mr. Panetta doesn't work here anymore.'' So I have decided to \ntake the promises that the President made in this speech, which was \nbefore the entire country on national television, and write those \npromises into law. Many people have said, ``Oh, you are going to do \nterrible things if you write those into law. You are going to undo \nevery protection that is important to this monument.'' To them I say, \nif you do not like these promises, argue with William Jefferson \nClinton. Don't argue with me because they were his pledges; not mine.\n  Some groups have seized on some language that I have in the bill \ndescribing what will be permitted in the monument and say, ``You go far \nbeyond the President in the things you allow. Where did you get the \nidea that mining and timber and those kinds of things should be \nallowed?'' My answer is, I took the definition of ``multiple use''\n\n[[Page S1572]]\n\nthat is in the FLPMA handbook produced by the Department of the \nInterior and reproduced it, neither subtracting nor adding anything. I \nmade no attempt to put my judgment as to what ``multiple use'' means. I \nused the manual that is produced by the Department of the Interior to \ndefine what ``multiple use'' means.\n  By virtue of the introduction of this bill, we will now \nhave hearings. There will be hearings both in the House and the Senate. \nI am told that a companion bill will be introduced on the other side of \nthe Capitol.\n\n  I myself point out that these hearings are open, unlike the process \nthe President followed, which was closed. These hearings will allow \nthose who disagree with me--and I heard from some people this afternoon \nwho disagreed with me quite vehemently--an opportunity to come before \nthe Congress and tell the Congress what they think the President meant \nwhen he used these words. These hearings will give the Department of \nthe Interior the opportunity to come before the Congress and tell the \nCongress what they think the President meant when he used these words. \nIf they can make a plausible case to the Congress, I am perfectly \nwilling to amend the bill and accept changes. The thing I am not \nwilling to do is to accept, as some have said, that ``This was merely a \ncampaign speech. The President should not be held to honor any \ncommitment he made in that speech because it was in the heat of the \ncampaign.''\n  We are talking, Mr. President, about 1.7 million acres of land in my \nState. That is a land mass bigger than some of the States represented \nby Senators who sit here in this Chamber. We are talking about a major \naction that impacts the future of the people of southern Utah. That \nbeing the case, we must codify what the President said so that these \ncommitments are kept whether they were made in a campaign speech or \nnot.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 357\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Grand Staircase-Escalante \n     Resource Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the designation of the Grand Staircase-Escalante \n     National Monument applies only to Federal land within the \n     boundary of the Monument;\n       (2) multiple use has been and continues to be the guiding \n     principle in the management of public land;\n       (3) in accordance with Proclamation 6920, issued by the \n     President on September 18, 1996 (61 Fed. Reg. 50223 (1996), \n     Federal land within the Monument should remain open for \n     multiple uses;\n       (4) the United States should not lay claim to Federal water \n     rights in lands within the Monument except in accordance with \n     the substantive and procedural requirements of the State of \n     Utah, and designation of the Monument and enactment of this \n     Act should not impair exercise of water rights by the State \n     of Utah;\n       (5) mining revenues from Federal and State School and \n     Institutional Trust Lands have generated considerable \n     revenues for Utah schools;\n       (6) an estimated 176,000 acres of surface land containing \n     significant coal and other resources managed by the School \n     and Institutional Trust Lands Administration for the benefit \n     of Utah's school children are located within the boundary of \n     the Monument;\n       (7) the creation of the Monument must not come at the \n     expense of Utah's school children;\n       (8) designation of the Monument will produce a considerable \n     loss of future Federal royalties, State royalties, and school \n     trust royalties resulting in significant revenue loss to \n     Utah's school children; and\n       (9) the lack of congressional, State, and local \n     consultation prior to designation of the Monument and the \n     failure of the Proclamation to establish a specific boundary \n     for the Monument are certain to give rise to disputes that \n     will require boundary adjustments.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Advisory committee.--The term ``advisory committee'' \n     means the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument \n     Advisory Committee established under section 12.\n       (2) Director.--The term ``Director'' means the Director of \n     the Bureau of Land Management.\n       (3) Existing.--The term ``existing'' means in existence as \n     of September 18, 1996.\n       (4) Management plan.--The term ``management plan'' means \n     the management plan for the Monument submitted to Congress \n     under section 9.\n       (5) Monument.--The term ``Monument'' means the Grand \n     Staircase-Escalante National Monument established by \n     Proclamation of the President on September 18, 1996.\n       (6) Multiple use.--The term ``multiple use'' has the \n     meaning given in section 103 of the Federal Land Policy and \n     Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1702).\n       (7) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior.\n       (8) Special management area.--The term ``special management \n     area'' means an area that is managed by the Secretary in \n     accordance with the principles of multiple use and sustained \n     yield in accordance with this Act.\n       (9) Sustained yield.--The term ``sustained yield'' has the \n     meaning given in section 103 of the Federal Land Policy and \n     Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1702).\n\n     SEC. 4.

IRISH AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Mack, Mr. Moynihan, and Mr. D'Amato) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non the Judiciary:\n\n                               S. Res. 59\n\n       Whereas by 1776 nearly 300,000 persons had emigrated to the \n     United States from Ireland;\n       Whereas following the Revolutionary War victory of \n     Washington's troops at Yorktown, a French Major General \n     reported that Congress and America owed its existence, and \n     possibly its preservation, to the support of the Irish;\n       Whereas at least 8 signers of the Declaration of \n     Independence were of Irish origin;\n       Whereas more than 200 Irish Americans have been awarded the \n     Congressional Medal of Honor;\n       Whereas 19 Presidents of the United States proudly claim \n     Irish heritage, including the first President, George \n     Washington;\n       Whereas 44 million American citizens are of Irish descent; \n     and\n       Whereas the Irish and their descendants have contributed \n     greatly to the enrichment of all aspects of life in the \n     United States, including military and government service, \n     science, education, art, agriculture, business, industry, and \n     athletics: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the month of March of each year as ``Irish \n     American Heritage Month''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     designating the month of March of each year as ``Irish \n     American Heritage Month'' and calling on the people of the \n     United States to observe the month with appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Mack, Senator \nMoynihan, Senator D'Amato, and myself, I am proud to submit a Senate \nresolution designating the month of March each year as ``Irish-American \nHeritage Month.''\n  Since 1621, when the first Irish settlers arrived on our shores, \nAmericans of Irish descent have made invaluable contributions to all \naspects of American life. Between 1840 and 1910, more than 3 million \nIrish immigrants reached our shores and contributed immensely to the \ndevelopment of our country.\n  In fact, this year marks the 150th anniversary of the Great Famine in \nIreland that led to one of the most tragic migrations in history. The \npotato crop failed, and hundreds of thousands fled in desperation to \nthe New World. They found hope and opportunity and new lives in \nAmerica. They powered our industrial revolution. They took jobs as \nlaborers. They dug the canals. They built the railroads that took \nAmerica to the West. Even today, it is said that under every railroad \ntie, an Irishman is buried. In a very real sense, their greatest legacy \nis our modern nation.\n  Today, over 44 million Americans are of Irish descent. They are proud \nof America and proud of their Irish heritage, and it is a privilege to \nintroduce this legislation designating the month of March in the years \nahead as ``Irish-American Heritage Month.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/25/senate-section/article/S1574-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1574-S1575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              THE BALANCED BUDGET CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 HOLLINGS (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 9\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Biden, Mr. \nReid, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Daschle) proposed an amendment to the \njoint resolution (S.J.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Child Labor \nDeterrence Act of 1997. The bill I'm introducing today prohibits the \nimportation of any product made, whole or in part, by children under \nthe age of 15 who are employed in manufacturing or mining. This is the \nfourth time I have come to the floor of the Senate to introduce this \nbill, and I will continue to introduce it until it becomes law.\n  Mr. President, recently, the International Labor Organization [ILO] \nreleased a very grim report about the number of children who toil away \nin abhorrent conditions. The ILO estimates that over 200 million \nchildren worldwide under the age of 15 are working instead of receiving \na basic education. Many of these children begin working in factories at \nthe age of 6 or 7, some even younger. They are poor, malnourished, and \noften forced to work 60-hour weeks for little or no pay.\n  Child labor is most prevalent in countries with high unemployment \nrates. According to the ILO, some 61 percent of child workers, nearly \n153 million children, are found in Asia; 32 percent, or 80 million, are \nin Africa and 7 percent, or 17.5 million, live in Latin America. Adult \nunemployment rates in some nations runs over 20 percent. In Latin \nAmerica, for example, about 1 in every 10 children are workers. \nFurthermore, in many nations where child labor is prevalent, more money \nis spent and allocated for military expenditures than for education and \nhealth services.\n  The situation is as deplorable as it is enormous. In many developing \ncountries children represent a substantial part of the work force and \ncan be found in such industries as rugs, toys, textiles, mining, and \nsports equipment manufacturing.\n  For instance, it is estimated that 65 percent of the wearing apparel \nthat Americans purchase is assembled or manufactured abroad, therefore, \nincreasing the chance that these items were made by abusive and \nexploitative child labor. In the rug industry, Indian and Pakistan \nproduce 95 percent of their rugs for export. Some of the worst abuses \nof child labor have been documented in these countries, including \nbonded and slave labor.\n  Venezuela and Colombia exported $6,084,705 and $1,385,669 worth of \nmined products respectively to the United States in 1995. Both were \ndocumented by the Department of Labor as using child labor in mining. \nMining hazards for children include exposure to harmful dusts, gases, \nand fumes that cause respiratory diseases that can develop into \nsilicosis, pulmonary fibrosis, asbestosis, and emphysema after some \nyears of exposure. Child miners also suffer from physical strain, \nfatigue, and musculoskeletal disorders, as well as serious injuries \nfrom falling objects.\n  Children may also be crippled physically by being forced to work too \nearly in life. For example, a large-scale ILO survey in the Philippines \nfound that more than 60 percent of working children were exposed to \nchemical and biological hazards, and that 40 percent experienced \nserious injuries or illnesses.\n  These practices are often underground, but the ILO report points out \nthat children are still being sold outright for a sum of money. Other \ntimes, landlords buy child workers from their tenants, or labor \ncontractors pay rural families in advance in order to take their \nchildren away to work in carpet weaving, glass manufacturing, or \nprostitution. Child slavery of this type has long been reported in \nSouth Asia, Southeast Asia, and West Africa, despite vigorous official \ndenial of its existence.\n  Additionally, children are increasingly being bought and sold across \nnational borders by organized networks. The ILO report states that at \nleast five such international networks trafficking in children exist: \nfrom Latin America to Europe and the Middle East; from South and \nSoutheast Asia to Northern Europe and the Middle East; a European \nregional market; an associated Arab regional market; and, a West Africa \nexport market in girls.\n  In Pakistan, the ILO reported in 1991 that an estimated half of the \n50,000 children working as bonded labor in Pakistan's carpet-weaving \nindustry will never reach the age of 12--victims of disease and \nmalnutrition.\n  I have press reports from India of children freed from virtual \nslavery in the carpet factories of Northern India. Twelve-year-old \nCharitra Chowdhary recounted his story--he said, ``If we moved slowly \nwe were beaten on our backs with a stick. We wanted to run away but the \ndoors were always locked.''\n  Mr. President, that's what this bill is about, children, whose dreams \nand childhood are being sold for a pittance to factory owners and in \nmarkets around the globe.\n  It's about protecting children around the globe and their future. \nIt's about eliminating a major form of child abuse in our world. It's \nabout breaking the cycle of poverty by getting these kids out of \nfactories and into schools. It's about raising the standard of living \nin the Third World so we can compete on the quality of goods instead of \nthe misery and suffering of those who make them. It's about assisting \nThird World governments to enforce their laws by ending the role of the \nUnited States in providing a lucrative market for goods made by abusive \nand exploitative child labor and encouraging other nations to do the \nsame.\n\n[[Page S1576]]\n\n  Mr. President, unless the economic exploitation of children is \neliminated, the potential and creative capacity of future generations \nwill forever be lost to the factory floor.\n\n  Mr. President, the Child Labor Deterrence Act of 1997 is intended to \nstrengthen existing U.S. trade laws and help Third World countries \nenforce their child labor laws. The bill directs the U.S. Secretary of \nLabor to compile and maintain a list of foreign industries and their \nrespective host countries that use child labor in the production of \nexports to the United States. Once the Secretary of Labor identifies a \nforeign industry, the Secretary of the Treasury is instructed to \nprohibit the importation of a product from an identified industry. The \nentry ban would not apply if a U.S. importer signs a certificate of \norigin affirming that they took reasonable steps to ensure that \nproducts imported from identified industries are not made by child \nlabor. In addition, the President is urged to seek an agreement with \nother governments to secure an international ban on trade in the \nproducts of child labor. Further, any company or individual who would \nintentionally violate the law would face both civil and criminal \npenalties.\n  This legislation is not about imposing our standards on the \ndeveloping world. It's about preventing those manufacturers in the \ndeveloping world who exploit child labor from imposing their standards \non the United States. They are forewarned. If manufacturers and \nimporters insist on investing in child labor, instead of investing in \nthe future of children, I will work to assure that their products are \nbarred from entering the United States.\n  Mr. President, as I said when I first introduced this bill 4 years \nago, it is time to end this human tragedy and our participation in it. \nIt is time for greater government and corporate responsibility. No \nlonger can officials in the Third World or U.S. importers turn a blind \neye to the suffering and misery of the world's children. No longer do \nAmerican consumers want to provide a market for goods produced by the \nsweat and toil of children. By providing a market for goods produced by \nchild labor, U.S. importers have become part of the problem by \nperpetuating the impoverishment of poor families. Through this \nlegislation, importers now have the opportunity to become part of the \nsolution by ending this abominable practice.\n  Mr. President, countries do not have to wait until poverty is \neradicated or they are fully developed before eliminating the economic \nexploitation of children. In fact, the path to development is to \neliminate child labor and increase expenditures on children such as \nprimary education. In far too many countries, governments spend \nmillions on military expenditures and fail to provide basic educational \nopportunities to its citizens. As a result, over 130 million children \nare not in primary school.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, my bill places no undue burden on U.S. \nimporters. I know of no importer, company, or department store that \nwould willingly promote the exploitation of children. I know of no \nimporter, company, or department store that would want their products \nand image tainted by having their products produced by child labor. And \nI know that no American consumer would knowingly purchase something \nmade with abusive and exploitative child labor. These entities take \nreasonable steps to ensure the quality of their goods; they should also \nbe willing to take reasonable steps to ensure that their goods are not \nproduced by child labor.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 332\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Labor Deterrence Act \n     of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS, PURPOSE, AND POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Principle 9 of the Declaration of the Rights of the \n     Child proclaimed by the General Assembly of the United \n     Nations on November 20, 1959, states that ``. . . the child \n     shall not be admitted to employment before an appropriate \n     minimum age; he shall in no case be caused or permitted to \n     engage in any occupation or employment which would prejudice \n     his health or education, or interfere with his physical, \n     mental, or moral development . . .''.\n       (2) Article 2 of the International Labor Convention No. 138 \n     Concerning Minimum Age For Admission to Employment states \n     that, ``The minimum age specified in pursuance of paragraph 1 \n     of this article shall not be less than the age of compulsory \n     schooling and, in any case, shall not be less than 15 \n     years.''.\n       (3) According to the International Labor Organization, \n     worldwide an estimated 200,000,000 children under the age of \n     15 are working, many of them in dangerous industries like \n     mining and fireworks.\n       (4) Children under the age of 15 constitute approximately \n     11 percent of the workforce in some Asian countries, 17 \n     percent of the workforce in parts of Africa, and a reported \n     12-26 percent of the workforce in many countries in Latin \n     America.\n       (5) The number of children under the age of 15 who are \n     working, and the scale of their suffering, increase every \n     year, despite the existence of more than 20 International \n     Labor Organization conventions on child labor and laws in \n     many countries which purportedly prohibit the employment of \n     under age children.\n       (6) In many countries, children under the age of 15 lack \n     either the legal standing or means to protect themselves from \n     exploitation in the workplace.\n       (7) The prevalence of child labor in many developing \n     countries is rooted in widespread poverty that is \n     attributable to unemployment and underemployment, precarious \n     incomes, low living standards, and insufficient education and \n     training opportunities among adult workers.\n       (8) The employment of children under the age of 15 commonly \n     deprives the children of the opportunity for basic education \n     and also denies gainful employment to millions of adults.\n       (9) The employment of children under the age of 15, often \n     at pitifully low wages, undermines the stability of families \n     and ignores the importance of increasing jobs, aggregated \n     demand, and purchasing power among adults as a catalyst to \n     the development of internal markets and the achievement of \n     broadbased, self-reliant economic development in many \n     developing countries.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to curtail the \n     employment of children under the age of 15 in the production \n     of goods for export by--\n       (1) eliminating the role of the United States in providing \n     a market for foreign products made by under age children;\n       (2) supporting activities and programs to extend primary \n     education, rehabilitation, and alternative skills training to \n     under age child workers, to improve birth registration, and \n     to improve the scope and quality of statistical information \n     and research on the commercial exploitation of children in \n     the workplace; and\n       (3) encouraging other nations to join in a ban on trade in \n     products described in paragraph (1) and to support those \n     activities and programs described in paragraph (2).\n       (c) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to discourage actively the employment of children under \n     the age of 15 in the production of goods for export or \n     domestic consumption;\n       (2) to strengthen and supplement international trading \n     rules with a view to renouncing the use of under age children \n     in production as a means of competing in international trade;\n       (3) to amend United States law to prohibit the entry into \n     commerce of products resulting from the labor of under age \n     children; and\n       (4) to offer assistance to foreign countries to improve the \n     enforcement of national laws prohibiting the employment of \n     children under the age of 15 and to increase assistance to \n     alleviate the underlying poverty that is often the cause of \n     the commercial exploitation of children under the age of 15.\n\n     SEC. 3. UNITED STATES INITIATIVE TO CURTAIL INTERNATIONAL \n                   TRADE IN PRODUCTS OF CHILD LABOR.\n\n       In pursuit of the policy set forth in this Act, the \n     President is urged to seek an agreement with the government \n     of each country that conducts trade with the United States \n     for the purpose of securing an international ban on trade in \n     products of child labor.\n\n     SEC. 4.

I wanted to take a few minutes of Senate \nbusiness today and share this very moving experience with my \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. President, I had the honor and privilege of participating in the \nKing Day celebration. The annual program in Philadelphia is a very \nmoving tribute to Dr. King and is the largest national celebration of \nthis great civil rights leader. Additionally, the program serves as the \nmost ecumenical and multicultural annual gathering for the city of \nPhiladelphia.\n  In recent years, this program has featured such special guests as \nGen. Colin Powell and Vice President Al Gore. The King Association has \nalso honored such dignitaries as Rosa Parks, Bishop Desmond Tutu, Judge \nLeon Higginbotham, Attorney Bernard Segal, and one of our colleagues in \nthe U.S. Senate, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun.\n  Under the leadership of the Honorable C. DeLores Tucker, the King \nAssociation has the unique mission of promoting and implementing the \nprinciple of nonviolence throughout the Northeast. The fact that the \nassociation serves as the only affiliate of the King Center in Atlanta, \ncommissioned by Coretta Scott King, reflects the importance of the King \nAssociation's mission and services.\n  For allowing me to be a part of this year's King Day Luncheon, I \nwould like to again express my very sincere and genuine gratitude to \nthe King Association president, the Honorable C. DeLores Tucker, and \nthe executive director, Dr. Teta V. Banks. As we honor and recognize \nDr. King, there is no greater living tribute than the thousands upon \nthousands of national community leaders of all ethnic backgrounds who \ncontinue working to make Dr. King's dream a reality.\n  Mr. President, the work done by the King Association in Philadelphia \nand the Annual King Day Luncheon certainly embody the legacy of Dr. \nMartin Luther King, Jr.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/25/senate-section/article/S1578-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1578]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE 220TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE U.S. CAVALRY\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 220th \nanniversary of the U.S. Cavalry and the contributions the town of \nWethersfield, CT, made to the Revolutionary War effort.\n  In my home State of Connecticut, the town of Wethersfield is proud to \nbe recognized as the first home and training ground for the Continental \nArmy's first cavalry regiment, known as Sheldon's Horse, the Second \nContinental Light Dragoons. In a time when armies were slow moving, the \nSecond Continental Dragoons were unique for their swiftness and daring. \nThe Second Dragoons were composed of mounted and dismounted men able to \nquickly advance on the enemy's flank.\n  By orders of the First Continental Congress and General Washington, \nthe Second Dragoon Regiment was the first cavalry regiment directly \norganized by the Continental Army. According to the Connecticut \nHistorical Commission, on December 12, 1776, the Continental Congress \nappointed Elisha Sheldon of Salisbury as lieutenant colonel commandant \nof a regiment of the Continental Cavalry, the first such unit of the \nContinental Army. He was ordered to enlist six troops to form his \nregiment at Wethersfield. Among the first officers chosen by Colonel \nSheldon was Wethersfield resident, Maj. Benjamin Tallmadge. In the late \nwinter and early spring of 1977, Major Tallmadge erected a training \nground for the training and breaking of horses for the regiment in \nWethersfield.\n  Under Major Tallmadge's direction and leadership, the Second Regiment \nfought in the battles of Short Hills, Brandywine, Trenton, Saratoga, \nand White Plains, and during the harsh winter at Valley Forge, the \nDragoons patrolled the area for General Washington.\n  Currently, the U.S. Cavalry is based in Fort Riley, KS, but it will \nbe forever linked to the town of Wethersfield and Connecticut. I \napplaud the efforts of the people of Wethersfield to celebrate their \nhistory and the contributions they have made to ensuring the \nindependence of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/25/senate-section/article/S1578-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1578-S1579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     GLENN H. ROTTMANN RETIRES FROM THE GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, concluding nearly 53 years of \nFederal service, Glenn H. Rottmann recently retired from the U.S. \nGovernment Printing Office [GPO], where he had risen through the ranks \nfrom junior offset platemaker to Director of GPO's Production Services \nwith responsibility for all printing performed at GPO, including many \nof the essential products needed by Congress for its daily operation \nsuch as the Congressional Record.\n  Following 14 months of service in the U.S. Army, Mr. Rottmann began \nhis career at the GPO on July 23, 1945, as a junior offset platemaker. \nIn 1971, he was made foreman of the offset plate section, and in 1975 \nhe was named Superintendent of the Offset Division. In 1981, Mr. \nRottmann was promoted to production manager with overall responsibility \nfor GPO's inplant production facilities, including the Press Division, \nthe Binding Division, and prepress operations under the Electronic \nPhotocomposition, Graphic Systems Development, and Electronic Systems \nDevelopment Divisions. In 1993, he was promoted to Director of \nProduction Services following an agencywide reorganization.\n  As one of the Nation's largest printing plants and the largest \nmanufacturing operation in the District of Columbia, GPO produces a \nwide variety of products, from essential legislative documents for \nCongress and critical information such as the U.S. Budget, to other \nimportant publications such as the daily Federal Register, U.S. \npassports and postal cards, and a broad variety of other items. Some \npublications, such as the Congressional Record and the Federal \nRegister, are printed on demanding schedules overnight, each containing \nas much type as four to six metropolitan daily newspapers. Mr. \nRottmann's responsibility was to ensure that this essential Government \nprinting was accomplished with the highest possible quality, in the \nmost timely manner, at the lowest possible cost.\n  During his tenure, Mr. Rottmann oversaw the upgrading of GPO's \ninplant production operations with modern graphic communications and \nelectronic information technologies. Under his leadership, GPO \ncompleted the conversion from hot metal to electronic photocomposition \ntechnology, expanded desktop publishing opportunities on Capitol Hill \nand in Federal agencies through GPO's dialup composition system and \nMicroComp software package, began the production of CD-ROM products, \nacquired and installed state-of-the-art offset press\n\n[[Page S1579]]\n\ntechnology, expanded the use of environmentally sensitive products such \nas recycled paper and vegetable-oil inks, and developed the technology \nand databases supporting GPO Access, GPO's award winning online \ninformation dissemination service. As a result of these changes, \ncitizen access to Government information has been substantially \nimproved, and the productivity increases from new technology have \npermitted substantial staff downsizing and increased savings to the \ntaxpayers. Beyond these achievements, Mr. Rottmann was widely \nconsidered an able administrator and a friend by GPO's employees.\n  Mr. Rottmann earned numerous GPO awards, served as an apprentice \ntraining representative, completed several training programs, and is a \ngraduate of the Federal Executive Institute in Charlottesville, VA.\n  I extend congratulations and sincere appreciation to Mr. Rottmann for \nhis 53 years of dedicated public service to Congress and the Nation, \nand I wish him a long and happy retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/25/senate-section/article/S1578-3", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       HONORING THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF BUREAU COUNTY REPUBLICAN\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate \nthe Bureau County Republican on its 150th anniversary.\n  Since 1847, the people of Princeton and Bureau County have turned to \nthe Republican for accurate news and information. What began as a \nsmall, weekly paper dedicated to the abolition of slavery is now known \nas the primary local morning newspaper in the region.\n  The Bureau County Republican is a great American success story, and \nIllinois is proud of its long and distinguished history.\n  In honor of the paper's sesquicentennial, I ask that an article from \nthe January 2, 1997, edition of the Bureau County Republican be printed \nat this point in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n              The Tradition of Community Publishing Grows\n\n       The Bureau County Advocate was first published on December \n     2, 1847 by Ebenezer Higgins.\n       Justin Olds and J.M. Wilkinson purchased the Advocate in \n     the summer of 1851 and changed its name to the Princeton \n     Post. In 1858, the Princeton Post was changed to the Bureau \n     County Republican. John W. Bailey I purchased the Bureau \n     County Republican in 1863. In the early days, he was \n     identified with the Abolition Party and also with the \n     underground railroad.\n       According to the ``Big Bureau and Bright Prairies'' edited \n     by Doris Parr Leonard and published by the Bureau County \n     Board of Supervisors, Bailey, 33, had worked in Ohio, \n     Indiana, Tennessee and Washington, D.C. and was directed to \n     Princeton by Joseph Medill of the Chicago Tribune who had \n     heard that a paper was for sale in the county seat of Bureau \n     County. Ironically both the Bureau County Republican and the \n     Chicago Tribune were founded the same year, 1847.\n       He continued as head of the Republican for 40 years until \n     his death May 28, 1903. He was succeeded by his son, Harry U. \n     Bailey, who also headed the paper for 40 years until his \n     death Sept. 20, 1943.\n       Third in the line of Baileys to head the newspaper was John \n     W. Bailey III, son of H. U. Bailey. He was publisher from \n     1943 until his death May 13, 1946, in a fire in his home. His \n     widow, the former Mary Potter of Henry, whose life he had \n     saved in the fire, subsequently became the publisher and \n     continued that role for 31 years.\n       John W. Bailey III, a graduate of the University of \n     Wisconsin, had become a junior partner in 1935 and had \n     directed his efforts toward a vigorous program to make the \n     Republican a stronger force, enhancing the potential of \n     Princeton as a mercantile, agricultural and small industrial \n     center.\n       In June 1963, the newspaper which had been a weekly since \n     its inception, became a semi-weekly. Thursday's paper \n     remained the Republican while the newspaper published on \n     Tuesday was called the Bureau County Record.\n       On May 12, 1977, the BCR/Record was sold to the B. F. Shaw \n     Printing Co., publishers of the Dixon Evening Telegraph.\n       Illinois Valley Shopping News was purchased in 1982 \n     replacing the Bureau County Advertiser.\n       In 1987, the Saturday edition was added and in 1992 the BCR \n     converted to an AM newspaper, making it the only local \n     morning newspaper.\n       The Bureau County Republican won the distinction of being \n     the best weekly newspaper in the state in 1988 and 1991 as \n     judged by the Illinois Press Association in winning the Will \n     Loomis and Harold and Eva White trophies.\n       Publishers succeeding Mary Bailey have included William \n     DeLost, William Shaw, Vern Brown, Robert Sorenson and Sam R. \n     Fisher, current publisher.\n       Editors have included Theodore A. Duffield, Scott Caldwell, \n     James Dunn, Ron DeBrock and James F. Troyer, and current \n     editor, Lori Hamer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/25/senate-section/article/S1579-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1579-S1580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     A HIGH PROBABILITY OF FAILURE\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, we now have a consensus that the \nyear 2000 is going to arrive before the Federal Government has prepared \nits computers for the date.\n  Yesterday, in a hearing held by my esteemed colleague Representative \nStephen Horn, officials from the General Accounting Office [GAO] warned \nthat many of the Government's computers will stop working in 2000 \nbecause agencies have failed to take the appropriate precautions. Joel \nWillemsen, GAO's Director of Information Resources Management, warned: \n``There is a high probability there will be some failures.''\n  Though widely pronounced in small circles for a year now, this fact \nis now being heralded by the General Accounting Office--Congress' \ndutiful investigative arm. To its credit GAO has added the year 2000 \nproblem to its list of ``High Risk Government Programs;'' promised to \nreport periodically on the status of the agencies' responses; asked \nagencies to focus on their most critical computer systems; and now, has \nwarned that we must be prepared for some amount of failure.\n  Are we ready for failure? In Medicare payments? In our air traffic \ncontrol system? In our national defense system? We must act, and place \nresponsibility in a body to ensure compliance. My bill, S. 22, would \nset up a commission to do just that. I can only hope that my colleagues \nand the leaders of the executive agencies take heed of GAO's warnings \nof probable failure.\n  I ask that an article from today's Washington Post entitled ``Double \nZero Will Arrive Before the Fix'' be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 25, 1997]\n\n                 Double Zero Will Arrive Before the Fix\n\n\n     GAO Says Reprogramming Some Computers for 2000 Is Running Late\n\n                       (By Rajiv Chandrasekaran)\n\n       The General Accounting Office warned for the first time \n     yesterday that some of the government's computers will stop \n     working in 2000 because agencies will not be able to finish \n     reprogramming their equipment to understand years that do not \n     begin with ``19.''\n       ``There is a high probability there will be some \n     failures,'' Joel Willemssen, the GAO's director of \n     information resources management, told a House subcommittee. \n     He urged government agencies to focus their efforts on the \n     country's most critical computer systems, including those \n     that handle air traffic control, Medicare and national \n     defense.\n       Many large computer systems use a two-digit, year-dating \n     system that assumes 1 and 9 are the first two digits of the \n     year. If not reprogrammed, those computers will think the \n     year 2000--or 00--actually is 1900, a glitch that could \n     cripple many systems or lead them to generate erroneous data.\n       It's a particularly serious problem for the federal \n     government, experts said, because most agencies have older \n     computers that use the two-digit system. Earlier this month, \n     the GAO, the watchdog arm of Congress, added the ``Year 2000 \n     problem'' to its list of high-risk issues facing the nation.\n       The GAO does not have any estimates on how many computers--\n     or which systems--might fail in 2000.\n       Although every Cabinet department has told the Office of \n     Management and Budget that it is aware of the complicated and \n     costly process of fixing its computers, some congressional \n     leaders yesterday questioned whether the agencies were moving \n     fast enough and have allotted enough money to make the \n     changes in time. Some agencies still are studying--and have \n     not yet begun actually reprogramming--their systems, \n     according to a recent OMB report.\n       ``Only a few of them have specific, realistic plans to \n     solve the problem before the stroke of midnight on the last \n     day of 1999,'' said Rep. Stephen Horn (R-Calif.), chairman of \n     the House subcommittee on government management, information \n     and technology, who oversaw yesterday's hearing before an \n     overflow crowd. Six departmental chief information officers \n     testified before the panel, each trying to describe just how \n     complex the glitch will be to fix.\n       At the State Department, for example, chief information \n     office Eliza McClenaghan said there are 141 programs totaling \n     27.7 million lines of computer code written in 17 programming \n     languages that need to be changed. Almost half of the code \n     cannot be reprogrammed and will have to be replaced, she \n     said.\n       Others highlighted the fact that many government officials \n     only recently have become aware of the problem.\n       ``I didn't even know there was such a thing as a year 2000 \n     problem until August,'' said\n\n[[Page S1580]]\n\n     Michael P. Huerta, the acting chief information officer at \n     the Department of Transportation, which last year was given \n     an ``F'' by Horn for its inattention to the date issue.\n       Horn and Rep. Thomas M. David III (R-Va.) said they were \n     concerned that some agencies have allotted only six or seven \n     months to test the changes to their computer systems. \n     Yesterday the GAO recommended agencies give themselves at \n     least a year for testing.\n       ``They're pushing the envelope so close to D-Day,'' Horn \n     said.\n       The chief information officers, however, promised the \n     subcommittee that their systems would be fixed in time. ``You \n     can be confident we'll get the job done,'' said Emmett Paige \n     Jr., an assistant secretary of defense. He complained that a \n     requirement to report the department's progress regularly to \n     the OMB, the GAO and the subcommittee ``stretches our \n     resources [to fix the glitch] a little thinner.''\n       Some computer systems already are experiencing the date \n     problem, said Keith A. Rhodes, a GAO technical director. A \n     Defense Department contractor last month received a 97-year \n     delinquency notice on a three-year contract due to be \n     completed in January 2000, he said.\n       Horn also questioned the OMB's latest cost estimate for \n     fixing the problem, which it has pegged at about $2.3 \n     billion. After the hearing, Horn called the figure ``way too \n     low'' because it does not include devices such as elevators \n     that rely on microprocessors that might need to be \n     reprogrammed. The estimate also does not take into account \n     higher labor costs for computer programmers as December 1999 \n     draws closer, he said.\n       Yesterday, some department officials stood by their \n     estimates, while others took the opportunity to slightly \n     revise projections. The Department of Transportation, for \n     example, added $10 million to its estimate, raising it to \n     about $90 million. At the Defense Department, which faces the \n     largest problem of any federal agency, Paige said its current \n     $1.2 billion price tag is only temporary.\n       ``I submit that as we continue the assessment [of computer \n     systems], that figure will continue to rise,'' Paige \n     said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/25/senate-section/article/S1579-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1580-S1581]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         POPULATION ASSISTANCE\n\n Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask that the following \nbackground statement be printed in the Record.\n  The statement follows:\n\n    [From the National Right to Life Committee, Inc., Jan. 28, 1997]\n\n   Background on the Clinton administration's Promotion of Abortion \n     Through the State Department and the Foreign Aid Program for \n                       ``Population Assistance''\n\n       Abortion should not, and need not, be interjected into the \n     ``population assistance'' program as the Clinton \n     Administration has done. At the end of the Bush \n     Administration, under the pro-life ``Mexico City Policy'' \n     (described below), the U.S. ``population assistance'' program \n     provided 45% of the total pool of ``family planning'' funds \n     contributed by all donor nations. Much of this money went to \n     some 400 private foreign organizations that provided non-\n     abortion services in developing countries.\n       NRLC takes no position on contraception, or on federal \n     funding of contraceptive services, whether in the U.S. or \n     overseas. Throughout the Reagan and Bush Administration, NRLC \n     testified that it had no objection regarding the increases in \n     ``population assistance'' funding that were approved during \n     that era, because the Reagan-Bush ``Mexico City Policy'' \n     governed those funds. The ``Mexico City Policy,'' in effect \n     from 1984 through 1992, provided that U.S. population \n     assistance funds would not support private foreign \n     organizations that perform abortions (except in cases of life \n     endangerment, rape, or incest) or lobby to legalize abortion \n     in foreign nations.\n       However, President Clinton radically changed the thrust of \n     the program. Upon taking office, he immediately nullified the \n     Mexico City Policy. Subsequently, the Clinton Administration \n     granted massive funding to certain organizations that are \n     heavily involved in promoting the legalization and provision \n     of abortion in foreign nations, chief among these the London-\n     based International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF). \n     (IPPF-London had refused to accept U.S. funds under the \n     Mexico City Policy. However, about half [57] of IPPF's \n     national affiliates did accept U.S. funds under the ``Mexico \n     City'' conditions.)\n       IPPF-London has often made it clear that the legalization \n     of abortion and the expansion of abortion networks are among \n     its primary goals. The IPPF's 1992 mission statement, \n     Strategic Plan-Vision 2000, repeatedly and unambiguously \n     instructs IPPF's 140 national affiliate organizations to work \n     to legalize abortion as part of a mandate to ``advocate for \n     changes in restrictive national laws, policies, practices and \n     traditions.'' Precise strategies for accomplishing this end \n     are discussed in the summary of IPPF's Mauritius Conference. \n     (See ``Promotion of Abortion in the Developing World by the \n     IPPF,'' Population Research Institute report, 1996) \n     ``Progress'' toward abortion legalization that IPPF has \n     recently accomplished in specific nations (including \n     Thailand, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Uruguay) are described in \n     the IPPF Annual Report Supplement in 1994-95.\n       Donald P. Warwick of the Harvard Institute for \n     International Development has written the IPPF ``has in word \n     and deed been one of the foremost lobbyists for abortion in \n     the developing countries.'' In a 1996 report, the Population \n     Research Institute observed: ``No other organization has done \n     more to spread abortion throughout the world than the \n     International Planned Parenthood Federation . . . the IPPF \n     has forcefully and repeatedly stated its intention to assist \n     in the legalization of abortion in every country of the world \n     . . . and has also voiced its willingness to equip abortion \n     centers and provide the expertise required to perform \n     abortions on a massive scale.''\n       The Clinton Administration has pressured foreign \n     governments to get in line with its forcefully declared \n     doctrine that legal ``abortion is a fundamental right of all \n     women.'' Indeed, on March 16, 1994, Secretary of State Warren \n     Christopher sent an ``action cable'' to all U.S. diplomats \n     and consular posts. The cable called for ``senior level \n     diplomatic interventions'' to urge host governments to \n     support U.S. priorities for an upcoming U.N. population \n     conference. The cable read: ``The priority issues for the \n     U.S. include assuring . . . access to safe abortion. [. . .] \n     The United States believes that access to safe, legal and \n     voluntary abortion is a fundamental right of all women.''\n       In May, 1993, Under Secretary of State Tim Wirth gave a \n     speech on population control in which he proclaimed, ``A \n     government which is violating basic human rights should not \n     hide behind the defense of sovereignty . . . Our position is \n     to support reproductive choice, including access to safe \n     abortion.'' At about the same time, Mr. Wirth said that the \n     Administration goal was to make this ``reproductive choice'' \n     available to every woman in the world by 2,000 AD. At the \n     1994 Cairo conference on population control, sponsored by the \n     United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), and at more recent \n     U.N.-sponsored conferences, the Clinton Administration has \n     zealously promoted this doctrine, and has brought pressures \n     to bear on delegates that resist it.\n       Groups that support the Administration's abortion doctrine \n     often insist that ``U.S. law already prohibits the use of \n     population assistance funds for abortion.'' This is a red \n     herring. The ``existing law'' referred to is the 1973 Helms \n     Amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act, it has been \n     construed very narrowly, as barring the direct use of U.S. \n     funds to pay for abortion procedures overseas. But the real \n     issue is not the direct payment for individual abortion \n     procedures, but the Clinton Administration's perversion of \n     the population assistance program to promote the legalization \n     and expansion of access to abortion as a birth control method \n     in developing nations. It is noteworthy that after less \n     than three months in office, the White House urged \n     Congress to repeal the Helms Amendment, declaring abortion \n     to be ``part of the overall approach to population \n     control'' (White House press security, April 1, 1993).\n       The Clinton Administration's extrapolations regarding how \n     many abortions U.S. funds supposedly ``prevent'' completely \n     ignore the abortion-promoting activities of the \n     Administration and those of its taxpayer-funded surrogates \n     such as IPPF. For example, they completely disregard the vast \n     increases in the number of abortions that result when a \n     nation's laws protecting the unborn are removed. As Stanley \n     Henshaw, deputy director of research for the Alan Guttmacher \n     Institute, a pro-abortion advocacy group, acknowledged in a \n     June 16, 1994 document, ``In most countries, it is common \n     after abortion is legalized for abortion rates to rise \n     sharply for several years, then stabilize, just as we have \n     seen in the United States.''\n       The Clinton Administration's overseas abortion crusade is \n     on a collision course with the laws, and the cultural and \n     religious values, that predominate in most developing \n     nations, including nearly all of Latin America, most of \n     Africa, and many places in Asia. About 95 U.N. member states \n     have laws that permit abortion only in narrowly defined \n     circumstances. These laws cover 37 percent of the world's \n     population, or over two billion (2,000,000,000) persons. \n     (Under Secretary Wirth has been quoted as saying that all \n     except 17 U.N. countries ``permit'' abortion, but this is \n     highly misleading, since he refers only to nations with total \n     bans on abortion. Typical abortion laws in developing \n     nations, permitting abortion only to save the life of the \n     mother or in other narrowly defined circumstances, are far \n     removed from the Administration's ``fundamental right,'' \n     abortion-on-demand doctrine.)\n\n\n                    action during the 104th congress\n\n       During 1995, the House of Representatives repeatedly voted \n     in favor of amendments offered by Congressman Chris Smith (R-\n     NJ), the chairman of the House International Relations \n     Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, to \n     restore the Reagan-Bush policy. The Smith language would deny \n     U.S. ``population assistance'' funds to foreign private \n     organizations that perform abortions (except life of the \n     mother, rape, or incest), that violate foreign abortion laws, \n     or that lobby to change foreign abortion laws. (Note: neither \n     the Mexico City Policy, nor the Smith amendments, placed any \n     restrictions no counseling regarding legal abortions.) \n     However, the White House threatened to veto any bill that \n     contained Rep. Smith's language, which contributed to the \n     defeat of the House-passed language in the Senate.\n       Finally in January, 1996, in order to disentangle the \n     foreign operations appropriations bill (HR 1868) from this \n     debate, a compromise was reached under which (1) the\n\n[[Page S1581]]\n\n     Smith policy language was dropped, (2) FY 1996 \n     appropriations for population assistance was reduced by \n     35%, and (3) a formula was adopted to delay USAID's \n     ability to obligate some of the appropriate money, in \n     order to allow Congress further opportunities to curb the \n     Administration's pro-abortion crusade.\n       During 1996, the House offered a compromise in the form of \n     a far weaker pro-life provision, the ``Callahan 50/50 \n     Amendment.'' Under this provision, organizations that \n     violated the ``Mexico City'' conditions would have remained \n     eligible for funding, but at only 50% of the FY 1995 level. \n     (This restriction would have applied only to new, FY 1997 \n     funds--not to the $303 million carried over from FY 1996.) In \n     a September conference committee, appropriators coupled the \n     Callahan provision to additional language that would have \n     allowed obligation of an additional $293 million in \n     population-control funding during FY 1997--for a total of as \n     much as $713 million. But White House Chief of Staff Leon \n     Panetta told the appropriators that President Clinton would \n     veto the entire omnibus funding bill rather than accept this \n     proffered compromise.\n       Because of this veto threat, the final September funding \n     bill [now PL 104-208] contained no new policy language to \n     constrain the Administration's pro-abortion activities--but \n     again set a population-control funding level about one-third \n     lower than the 1995 figure, and placed ``metering'' \n     limitations on how soon the Administration can obligate those \n     funds.\n       This episode perfectly illustrated the White House's \n     ideological commitment to keeping abortion as a fundamental \n     component of the program, at all costs--reflecting its close \n     alliance with organizations such as the Planned Parenthood \n     Federation of America (PPFA), an organization that has openly \n     proclaimed its operating ``principal'' that ``reproductive \n     freedom is indivisible'' (i.e., that abortion must not be \n     treated differently from other birth control options). \n     Immediately following the episode described above, Gloria \n     Feldt, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of \n     America, said her side had won ``a moral victory in defeating \n     abortion restrictions,'' but added, ``The cost has been \n     enormous.''\n       The September law also guaranteed the White House a chance \n     to substantially increase the amount of money that it can \n     obligate during FY 1997. Under the law, President Clinton \n     must file a ``finding'' with Congress no later than February \n     1, stating his opinion regarding the effects of funding cuts \n     on ``the proper functioning of the population planning \n     program.'' The law further requires that, before the end of \n     February, both the House and the Senate must vote on a joint \n     resolution which, if approved, would release an additional \n     $123 million in population-control funds during the current \n     fiscal year--without any restrictions on the use of these \n     funds for the Administration's pro-abortion \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/25/senate-section/article/S1580-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1581]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MEXICO AND DRUG CERTIFICATION\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this week, President Clinton must \nmake an important decision regarding our Nation's fight against illegal \ndrug trafficking. He must decide by March 1 whether to certify that \nMexico and Colombia have, in the past year, taken all appropriate and \nnecessary actions in the fight against international narcotics \ntrafficking.\n  Under the international antidrug law, in order for a country which is \neither a major source of narcotics or a major drug transit country to \ncontinue to receive U.S. aid, the President must certify as adequate \nthe performance of that country in cooperating with the United States \nor taking its own actions in the drug fight.\n  The law gives the President three choices. First, he can certify that \nthe country is either fully cooperating with the United States or has \ntaken adequate steps on its own to combat the narcotics trade. Second, \nhe can decertify the country, concluding that the country has failed to \nmeet the requirements of cooperation or action. Third, he can provide a \nvital national interest waiver--essentially a finding that the country \nhas not met the standards of the law, but that our own national \ninterest is best protected by continuing to provide assistance to the \ncountry.\n  With respect to Colombia, I believe the only appropriate course for \nthe President to follow is to decertify Colombia, just as he did last \nyear. There is too much credible evidence that Colombian President \nSamper has taken millions in campaign contributions from the Cali \nCartel and that he has failed to take the antidrug and anticorruption \nactions that he pledged to us in 1994.\n  The question of Mexico is more complicated. Mexico is the leading \ntransit country for cocaine coming into the United States: 50 to 70 \npercent of all cocaine shipped into the United States comes through \nMexico. It is also a significant source of heroin, methamphetamines, \nand marijuana.\n  President Zedillo seems to be strongly committed to rid the Mexican \nlaw enforcement system of corruption and to fight the Mexican drug \ncartels. However, the reports and events of the past few weeks have \nmade it clear that corruption in police ranks--even up to the very top \nranks--is still rampant in Mexico.\n  Just last week, it was revealed that the man hired only 3 months ago \nto be Mexico's drug czar--the head of their antinarcotics agency--was \nfired abruptly after being accused of taking bribes from one of \nMexico's most powerful drug lords. It would be as if our own drug czar, \nGen. Barry McCaffrey, were found to be in league with drug gangs in our \ncountry.\n  Why didn't the Mexican Government tell us weeks ago that their man \nwas under investigation? Why did they let our own drug agency brief him \nand give him important intelligence about our antidrug efforts? That is \nnot cooperation by any standard.\n  Mexico has also failed in the past year to take its own steps to meet \nthe standards of the certification law. It has not acted boldly to root \nout corruption in its law enforcement establishment; it has acted to \nextradite to the United States only a few Mexican nationals suspected \nof involvement in United States drug activities; it has failed to \nimplement new anticrime laws enacted last year.\n  Given these facts, I do not believe Mexico should be certified in \ncompliance with the drug law. However, I believe the President would be \njustified in granting a vital national interest waiver of the \nrequirements of the law. That would send a message to Mexico that its \nactions in the past year were inadequate; but it would allow the United \nStates to continue joint efforts with President Zedillo and others in \nhis administration who are committed to the drug fight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/25/senate-section/article/S1581-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1581-S1582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, for more than 70 years, February \nhas been designated as the month in which we honor the achievements and \ncontributions of African-Americans to our history, our culture and our \nfuture. One remarkable African-American leader, W.E.B. DuBois, made an \nobservation in 1903 that bears great significance for this celebration. \n``Herein lies the tragedy of the age,'' he said, ``that men know so \nlittle of men.'' Since 1926, Black History Month has challenged us to \nmitigate that tragedy, encouraging us to study the lives of both our \nmost noted heroes and those whose stories have remained untold.\n  As it does each year, the Association for the Study of Afro-American \nLife and History has selected a theme for this month's celebration. \nIt's theme for 1997, ``African-Americans and Civil Rights: A \nReappraisal,'' focuses on the pioneers, leaders, and venues in the \ncivil rights struggle that are often unrecognized. In light of this, I \nwant to pay tribute to an extraordinary group of African-American \nartists from my State of Maryland who, despite their undeniably \nsignificant contributions to our culture, nevertheless remain \nrelatively unknown. Yet, given their landmark accomplishments, these \nindividuals would be important role models for aspiring artists of all \nbackgrounds. By pushing the limits of their artistic mediums, the \ninternational respect earned by these artists advanced the struggle for \nthe equal recognition of all people, both in our society and under its \nlaws. I salute the association for selecting a theme that focuses on \nmore of our Nation's unsung heroes.\n  At the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon, there \nsits a memorial chair dedicated to Ira Aldridge, one of the greatest \nShakespearean tragedians of his day. Born in Baltimore in 1805, \nAldridge's performances were so popular with heads of state that he was \nthe first African American to be knighted. He drew praise from New York \nto Prussia, with a diverse repertoire of roles that included Othello, \nMacbeth, Shylock, Lear and Richard III. Known as ``The Celebrated \nAfrican Tragedian,'' Aldridge was called ``without doubt the greatest \nactor that has ever been seen in Europe,'' by a Viennese critic, and \n``the most beautiful male artist that one can imagine,'' by a Prussian. \nPioneers like Aldridge made possible careers like those\n\n[[Page S1582]]\n\nof Sidney Poitier, Lawrence Fishburne and Denzel Washington.\n  From offstage, inspiring women of every color, we find Frances Ellen \nWatkins Harper. This poet, writer, and lecturer was the first African-\nAmerican female novelist to be published in this country. She was born \nin Baltimore, in 1825, and attended a school for African-Americans on \nthe present site of the Baltimore Convention Center. A writer of \npaperbacks and pamphlets on topics from abolition to the Bible, her \npopularity has been well documented. Records show that two of her \npoetry collections had sold 50,000 copies each by 1878. Her talents and \nperseverance were such that she was also the first African-American \nwoman to have her work published in the Atlantic Monthly. Without \nsomeone like Harper, we may never have seen a Gwendolyn Brooks or an \nAlice Walker.\n  Joshua Johnson was the first African-American artist in the United \nStates to earn his living as a professional portrait painter. A freed \nslave, Johnson worked in Baltimore for more than 30 years and painted \nmore than 80 portraits of Baltimore's sea captains, shopkeepers, and \nmerchants, and their families from 1795 to 1825. Described as a ``self-\ntaught genius,'' Johnson's subjects were mostly white and his style, \nquite realistic for the age in which he lived. While little is known of \nJohnson's personal history, the success and historical significance of \nhis professional endeavors are clear. Johnson's portraits are still \nwidely displayed in museums across the Nation, including the \nMetropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the National Gallery here in \nWashington.\n\n  The Broadway classics, ``I'm Just Wild About Harry'' and ``Memories \nof You'' are the works of another Baltimorean, Eubie Blake. The famous \nvaudevillian, ragtime pianist and composer of more than 3,000 songs was \nthe cocomposer of the first all African-American Broadway musical, \n``Shuffle Along.'' After its 1921 debut on Broadway, ``Shuffle \nAlong's'' successful 2 year run in New York paved the way for a \ncontinued African-American presence on Broadway's brightly-lit strip. \n``Shuttle Along'' also influenced other composers, including Gershwin \nwho, many critics say, might never have written ``Porgy and Bess'' had \nBlake never written his musical. At age 86, Blake astonished the \nentertainment world by coming out of retirement to join the ragtime \nrevival of the 1970's, inspiring a whole new generation of listeners. \nTwo years after receiving the Medal of Freedom from President Reagan in \n1981, Blake was honored at galas across the country that marked his \n100th birthday with evenings of his own music.\n  Baltimore is proud to claim another musical legend. Raised as Eleanor \nFagen, Billie Holiday rose to outstanding levels of acclaim and \npopularity for her unique approach to jazz singing: She was as able to \nalter the rhythm and tone of her voice as the players accompanying her \nwere able to do on their instruments. In the course of her 26-year \ncareer, so-called Lady Day recorded with musical giants including Benny \nGoodman, Count Basie, Artie Shaw and Teddy Wilson. Frequently called \nthe greatest jazz singer ever, she inspired audiences from New York's \nCotton Club to Baltimore's Royal theater, with ballads such as \n``Strange Fruit,'' a song protesting lynching and discrimination.\n  Baltimore is also home to the Afro-American newspaper group, the \nNation's oldest continuously published African-American newspaper \nchain. Founded in 1892, the chain has produced as many as 13 editions, \nand served readers from New Jersey to South Carolina. The pages of the \nAfro-American have borne the bylines of the paper's many reporters who \nlater became national figures in the struggle for civil rights. One \nsuch individual was Clarence Mitchell, Jr., the Baltimore lawyer and \nactivist who ultimately became director of the Washington Bureau of the \nNAACP. Today, the Afro-American publishes editions in Baltimore and \nWashington DC as well as a Wednesday weekly.\n  First knight, first novelist, first painter, first composer, first \nlady of jazz, the list goes on and on. Maryland is very proud of these \ngreat men and women. In succeeding against enormous odds, only did they \ninspire us, but they laid the groundwork upon which other African-\nAmerican actors, painters, writers, and musicians have followed. Like \nMaryland's history, the history of this country is replete with the \ncontributions of African-Americans, many of which have gone \nunrecognized. The names I have mentioned today are but a small sample, \na reminder that Black History Month is also a time to silently honor \nthose heroes whose names we may never know.\n\n  It was another writer who often worked in Maryland, Langston Hughes, \nwho wondered,\n\n     What happens to a dream deferred?\n     Does it dry up.\n     Like a raisin in the sun?\n\n  The accomplishments of the African-Americans I have recognized today \nprove that some dreams can surmount even the most difficult obstacles. \nA 100 years ago, who could have imagined the success of writers like \nHughes and Toni Morrison? Who would have dreamed of public servants and \nleaders such as Maryland's own Parren Mitchell, Thurgood Marshall, and \nKweisi Mfume? The achievements of these as well as the outstanding \nindividuals who had the courage to take the very first steps, \nindividuals like Joshua Johnson and Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, \nchallenge us to ensure that today's budding artists and leaders will \nnever have to confront the barriers that faced earlier generations. \nGiven the extraordinary achievements of the artists and activists who \ndid overcome those barriers, one can only imagine the wealth of poems, \npaintings, and compositions that never made it into our libraries, \nmuseums, and concert halls. Let us create an America that is America \nfor all Americans, and let us make our history, our culture, and our \nfuture that much richer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/25/senate-section/article/S1581-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1582-S1583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH DAKOTA PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT CENTER\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I would like you to join me in \ncongratulating the accomplishments of a special program that benefits \nthe students, educators, and communities of South Dakota. In 1993, the \nUniversity of South Dakota [USD] started the Professional Development \nCenter [PDC] with the hope of strengthening the important relationship \nbetween rural economic growth and the professional development of \nteachers. Even those in the PDC had no idea then that, 4 years later, \nthis program would have impacted the State to such a large degree with \nunlimited potential for the future.\n  A career in education is subject to a number of barriers including \nfeelings of isolation as a new teacher and a sense of being stuck in a \nrut as an experienced teacher. These feelings can influence the overall \neffectiveness of teachers by not allowing them to achieve their \npotential as professional educators. The PDC is designed to counter \nthese feelings by pairing first year teachers as interns with more \nexperienced teachers as mentors. In addition, a member of the USD \nfaculty is assigned to each pairing. This arrangement allows for the \nexchange of ideas, materials, teaching demonstrations, and technologies \nin a supportive social and professional environment. Interns benefit by \nlearning from talented and experienced peers; mentors are rejuvenated \nwith new ideas; and the university faculty provide both parties with a \ndirect link to the resources and opportunities available at USD.\n  The impact of this relationship is felt outside the classroom walls. \nBy creating an environment of shared learning within a community, the \nPDC empowers teachers to come up with creative educational \nopportunities for their students and, most importantly, to act on these \nideas. In the process of enhancing the curriculum, educators enhance \ntheir own professional development.\n  Ultimately, the PDC benefits the children and communities of South \nDakota the most. Students receive quality instruction and are \nchallenged to develop their own new ideas from motivated teachers. In \naddition, students are exposed to positive role models in education, \nencouraging some to pursue a similar career. For their part, \ncommunities reap the rewards of an environment with higher educational \nstandards for students, teachers with a strengthened commitment to \ntheir profession, and established links to USD.\n  Mr. President, the Professional Development Center at the University \nof\n\n[[Page S1583]]\n\nSouth Dakota is a perfect example of a program that enhances \ncommunities through education. It is a model for future efforts to \nimprove the overall quality of life in rural America. I invite you to \njoin me in congratulating the following members of the PDC for \nreceiving the Distinguished Program in Teacher Education Award at the \nrecent Association for Teacher Educators conference: University of \nSouth Dakota interim president, Dr. Paul Olscamp; dean of the College \nof Education, Dr. Larry Bright; Dr. Sharon Lee, Dr. Michael Hoadley, \nDr. Don Monroe, Dr. Lana Danielson, Dr. Royce Engstrom, Donna Gross, \nDr. Sharon Ross, Dr. Rosanne Yost, Dr. Roger Bordeaux, and Mindy \nCrawford.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/25/senate-section/article/S1582-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1583-S1588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE URGENT NEED TO OUTLAW POISON GAS\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I intend to address one of the \nmost important matters that should come before the Senate in the next \nseveral weeks: the Chemical Weapons Convention. This convention--\nnegotiated under Presidents Reagan and Bush--would outlaw poison gas \nweapons.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention represents a significant step forward \nin our efforts to contend with the greatest immediate threat to our \nnational security--the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention will make it illegal under \ninternational and domestic laws for a country to use, develop, produce, \ntransfer, or stockpile chemical weapons.\n  The CWC will help protect our citizens from the use of poison gas \nweapons by terrorist groups. It will benefit our military by requiring \nother nations to follow our lead and destroy their chemical weapons. It \nwill improve the ability of our intelligence agencies to monitor \nchemical weapons threats to our Armed Forces and our Nation. The \nconvention has the strong support of the American chemical industry, \nwhich was centrally involved in the negotiation of the CWC. It also \ntakes into account all of the protections afforded Americans under our \nConstitution.\n  This is a bipartisan treaty, initiated and negotiated under President \nReagan, further negotiated, finalized, and signed under President Bush, \nand strongly endorsed and submitted for the Senate's advice and consent \nto ratification by President Clinton.\n  The costs of the CWC are small, but its benefits are potentially \nenormous.\n  At present, international law permits the Libyas and the North Koreas \nof the world to produce limitless quantities of chemical weapons. That \nwill change when the CWC enters into force.\n  The CWC will make pariahs out of states that refuse to abide by its \nprovisions. Through the sanctions required by the convention, it will \nmake it more difficult for those pariah states to obtain the precursor \nchemicals they need to manufacture poison gas. It will create \ninternational pressure on these states to sign and ratify the CWC and \nto abide by its provisions. The CWC will create a standard for good \ninternational citizens to meet. It will brand as outlaws those \ncountries that choose to remain outside this regime.\n  The entry into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention will mark a \nmajor milestone in our efforts to enlist greater international support \nfor the important American objective of containing and penalizing rogue \nstates that seek to acquire or transfer weapons of mass destruction.\n  Ironically, should the Senate fail to give its advice and consent, \nthis milestone will pass with the U.S. On the same side as the rogue \nstates.\n\n\n                        Consequences of inaction\n\n  Mr. President, with just over 2 months remaining until entry-into-\nforce, we have reached the eleventh hour.\n  The convention has been signed by 161 countries and ratified by 68. \nIt will enter into force on April 29 of this year, with or without the \nparticipation of the United States. While the United States led the \neffort to achieve the CWC, the Senate, which received the convention \nfrom President Clinton in 1993, has not yet given its advice and \nconsent to ratification.\n  Our failure to ratify this convention before April 29 will have \ndirect and serious consequences for the security of this country.\n  First, the CWC mandates trade restrictions that could have a \ndeleterious impact upon the American chemical industry. If the United \nStates has not ratified, American companies will have to supply end-\nuser certificates to purchase certain classes of chemicals from CWC \nmembers. After 3 years we will be subject to trade sanctions that will \nharm American exports and jobs.\n  Second, an overall governing body known as the Conference of States \nParties will meet soon after April 29 to draw up rules governing the \nimplementation of the convention. If we are not a party to the CWC, we \nwill not be a member of that conference. This body with no American \ninput could make rules that have a serious negative impact on the \nUnited States.\n  Third, there will be a standing executive council of 41 members, on \nwhich we are assured of a permanent seat from the start because of the \nsize of our chemical industry--that is, if we have ratified the \nconvention by April 29. If we ratify after the council is already \nconstituted, then a decision on whether to order a requested surprise \ninspection of an American facility may be taken without an American \nrepresentative evaluating the validity of the request and looking out \nfor the facility's interests.\n  Fourth, there will be a technical secretariat with about 150 \ninspectors, many of whom would be American because of the size and \nsophistication of our chemical industry. If we fail to ratify this \nconvention in the next 2 months, there will be no American inspectors.\n  Finally, and most importantly in the long term, by failing to ratify \nwe would align ourselves with those rogue actors who have chosen to \ndefy the CWC. This would do irreparable harm to our global leadership \non critical arms control and non-proliferation concerns.\n  Mr. President, I would now like to address some of the benefits we \nwill derive by joining the CWC.\n\n\n                               Terrorism\n\n  One clear benefit of the CWC is that it will help protect us against \nthe threat of terrorist groups acquiring poison gas and using it \nagainst our citizens at home or our troops abroad. Imagine for a moment \nif those responsible for the Oklahoma City bombing or last year's \nattack on our troops in Saudi Arabia had used poison gas instead of \nconventional devices. How many more Americans would have been killed?\n  The CWC will make it more difficult for terrorists to get their hands \non chemicals that would allow them to blackmail us with the threat of \nkilling thousands of Americans with a single device. This convention \nwill require countries to destroy their stockpiles of chemical weapons, \neliminating the risk that these weapons could fall into the wrong \nhands. It also will control the transfer of those chemicals that can be \nused to make chemical weapons, thus restricting and improving the \nmonitoring of chemicals that terrorists need to manufacture weapons.\n  Most importantly, parties to the convention will be required to pass \nimplementing legislation to place the same prohibitions on persons \nunder their jurisdiction that states themselves accept under the \nconvention. This will mean that states will control strictly all toxic \nchemicals and their precursors. Any prohibited activity under the \nconvention will be criminalized.\n  That was not the case with the 1995 attack on the Tokyo subway in \nwhich lethal sarin gas caused thousands of casualties. At that time, \nthere was no Japanese law against the manufacture and possession of \nchemical weapons. Following that horrible incident, Japan moved swiftly \nto enact legislation to criminalize chemical weapons activities of the \nsort banned by the convention. Under the CWC, all parties must do the \nsame.\n  In conjunction with the legislation we will introduce in our Congress \nto implement the CWC, the convention will provide American law \nenforcement officers the tools they need to investigate terrorist \ngroups that are trying to acquire chemical weapons and improve the \nprospects for early detection and prosecution.\n  In short, while it cannot entirely eliminate the threat of chemical \nterrorism--and I would submit that no treaty can--the CWC will make it \nmuch harder for terrorists to obtain poison gas and to use it against \nAmericans.\n\n[[Page S1584]]\n\n                                Military\n\n  The CWC also has benefits for our Armed Forces.\n  Let me make two facts absolutely clear. First, the U.S. has foresworn \nthe use of chemical weapons once the CWC enters into force. Second, the \nDefense Department is required by law to destroy nearly all U.S. \nchemical weapons by 2004. Failure to ratify the CWC will not change \nthese two facts.\n  However, the CWC will require other nations to follow our lead and \ndestroy their chemical weapons.\n  As the gulf war demonstrated, we do not need chemical weapons to \ndeter potential adversaries like Iraq and Libya from using chemical \nweapons against our troops. The threat of overwhelming and devastating \nnonchemical retaliation will serve as a sufficient deterrent. Thus, the \nChemical Weapons Convention will enhance, not damage, the capabilities \nof the U.S. military to carry out its mission.\n  Several current and former distinguished military officers have \nspoken to the benefits of this convention.\n  Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf in his recent testimony before the Senate \nVeterans' Affairs Committee stated:\n\n       We don't need chemical weapons to fight our future \n     warfares. And frankly, by not rarifying that treaty we align \n     ourselves with nations like Libya and North Korea and I'd \n     just as soon not be associated with those thugs in this \n     particular matter.\n\n  Gen. John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has \nstated before the Foreign Relations Committee : ``From a military \nperspective, the Chemical Weapons Convention is clearly in our \ninterest.''\n  Adm. Elmo Zumwalt, former Chief of Naval Operations, wrote last month \nin the Washington Post:\n\n       This treaty is entirely about eliminating other people's \n     weapons--weapons that may some day be used against Americans. \n     For the American military, U.S. ratification is high gain and \n     low or no pain. In that light, I find it astonishing that any \n     American opposes ratification.\n\n  In addition, several prominent veterans and military groups, \nincluding the V.F.W. and the R.O.A., have endorsed the CWC. I will ask \nthat Admiral Zumwalt's op-ed and statements by these groups be printed \nin the Record.\n  The CWC does not diminish our ability and duty to provide our troops \nwith defenses against those that would contemplate the use of chemical \nweapons against us. Indeed, the administration plans to maintain a \nrobust program of upgrading defenses against chemical weapons. Should \nchemical weapons be used against us after the CWC is in force, we will \nbe ready.\n  Furthermore, the CWC will place the weight of world opinion behind us \nto take whatever action is necessary to respond to or prevent an \nadversary using chemical weapons.\n  I emphasize again that the most important aspect of the CWC from a \nmilitary perspective is that it will place most of the world in the \nsame situation we are in--not relying upon chemical weapons as a part \nof military doctrine. This can only be considered a positive \ndevelopment for our military.\n\n\n                              Verification\n\n  Another great benefit of the Chemical Weapons Convention is that it \nincreases our ability to detect production of poison gas.\n  Regardless of whether we ratify this convention, regardless of \nwhether another country has ratified this convention, our intelligence \nagencies will be monitoring the capabilities of other countries to \nproduce and deploy chemical weapons. The CWC will not change that \nresponsibility.\n  What this convention does, however, is give our intelligence agencies \nsome additional tools to carry out this task. In short, it will make \ntheir job easier.\n  In addition to on-site inspections, the CWC provides a mechanism to \ntrack the movement of sensitive chemicals around the world, increasing \nthe likelihood of detection. This mechanism consists of data \ndeclarations that require chemical companies to report production of \nthose precursor chemicals needed to produce chemical weapons. This \ninformation will make it easier for the intelligence community to \nmonitor these chemicals and to learn when a country has chemical \nweapons capability.\n  In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1994, \nR. James Woolsey, then Director of Central Intelligence, stated: ``In \nsum, what the Chemical Weapons Convention provides the intelligence \ncommunity is a new tool to add to our collection tool kit.''\n  Recently, Acting Director of Central Intelligence, George Tenet, re-\nemphasized this point before the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence. Mr. Tenet stated: ``There are tools in this treaty that \nas intelligence professionals we believe we need to monitor the \nproliferation of chemical weapons around the world. . . . I think as \nintelligence professionals we can only gain.''\n  No one has ever asserted that this convention is 100 percent \nverifiable. It simply is not possible with this or any other treaty to \ndetect every case of cheating. But I would respectfully submit that \nthis is not the standard by which we should judge the convention. \nInstead, we should recognize that the CWC will enhance our ability to \ndetect clandestine chemical weapons programs. The intelligence \ncommunity has said that we are better off with the CWC than without \nit--that is the standard by which to judge the CWC.\n  Mr. President, having discussed some of the clear benefits of joining \nthe CWC, I now would like to address some of the costs associated with \nnot joining, as well as some of the objections that have been raised to \nthe convention.\n\n\n                                Industry\n\n  Perhaps no single aspect of this debate has seen more misinformation \nthan that having to do with the affect the CWC would have on the U.S. \nchemical industry.\n  Mr. President, the chemical industry plays a larger role in the \neconomy of the State of Delaware than it does in any other State. Over \nhalf of Delaware's industrial output comes from our 47 chemical plants. \nTheir sales represent more than 10 percent of our State's economic \noutput. The chemical industry employs tens of thousands of Delawareans.\n  The people who own, manage, and work at chemical plants know they \nhave no greater friend than this Senator. If I for one moment thought \nthat the convention would harm the American chemical industry, as some \nhave alleged, I would raise this issue. But the fact of the matter is \nthat the only thing about the Chemical Weapons Convention that would \nhurt the American chemical industry would be the Senate's failure to \ngive its advice and consent.\n  In 1995, the American chemical industry exported $60 billion around \nthe world, accounting for fully 10 percent of all American exports and \nmaking it the single largest exporting industry. More than 1 million \nAmericans are employed by the U.S. chemical industry.\n  Should we fail to ratify the CWC, we will put a portion of these \nexports and these good-paying jobs at risk by leaving our chemical \nmanufacturers open to sanctions, the very sanctions that American \nnegotiators insisted should be a part of this convention as a way to \npressure rogue states. In fact, the Chemical Manufacturers Association \nestimates that failure to ratify the CWC could jeopardize $600 million \nof our chemical exports.\n  The charge that the CWC will harm American business appears all the \nmore preposterous when one considers the fact that the convention was \nnegotiated with the unprecedented input of the U.S. chemical industry.\n  Thanks to their help, the convention contains thresholds and \nexemptions that protect businesses, small and large alike, from bearing \nan undue burden. The American chemical industry helped develop the \nground rules under which inspections will occur, including provisions \nfor protecting confidential business information. Chemical company \nrepresentatives also helped design the brief, three-page form that \nrepresents the only reporting obligation for 90 percent of the \napproximately 2,000 companies that will have obligations under the CWC.\n  I will ask that a statement by Mr. Fred Webber, the president of the \nChemical Manufacturers Association, be printed in the Record.\n  To quote from another statement of Mr. Webber's:\n\n       The U.S. Chemical Industry worked hard to help Government \n     negotiators craft a CWC that provides strong protections \n     against future uses of chemical weapons, at a minimum burden \n     and intrusion on commercial chemical facilities. The \n     protection our industry achieved in the CWC can only be \n     realized if the Senate acts quickly to ratify the convention.\n\n\n[[Page S1585]]\n\n\n  U.S. chemical companies recognize that while they produce goods \nintended for peaceful uses, their products and inputs could be misused \nfor nefarious purposes. That is why they so actively have supported \nthis convention. Their involvement in the CWC has been a model of good \ncorporate citizenship.\n  Unfortunately, we will reward this responsible behavior with a slap \nin the face if we fail to ratify the CWC and subject the U.S. chemical \nindustry to international sanctions.\n\n\n                           Constitutionality\n\n  One of the issues that should not be contentious, and I hope will not \ncontinue to be a focus of attention, is whether the convention, and \nparticularly its inspection regime, is constitutional.\n  Every scholar that has published on the subject, and virtually every \nscholar that has considered the issue, has concluded that nothing in \nthe convention conflicts in any way with the fourth amendment or any \nother provision of the U.S. Constitution.\n  Indeed, to accommodate our special constitutional concerns, the \nUnited States insisted that when parties to the convention provide \naccess to international inspection teams, the Government may ``[take] \ninto account any constitutional obligations it may have with regard to \nproprietary rights or searches and seizures.''\n  In plain English, this means that inspectors enforcing the chemical \nweapons Convention must comply with our constitution when conducting \ninspections on U.S. soil.\n  It also means that the United States will not be in violation of its \ntreaty obligations if it refuses to provide inspectors access to a \nparticular site for legitimate constitutional reasons.\n  In light of this specific text, inserted at the insistence of U.S. \nnegotiators, I am hard pressed to understand how anyone can seriously \ncontend that the convention conflicts with the constitution.\n  There is nothing in the convention that would require the United \nStates to permit a warrantless search or to issue a warrant without \nprobable cause. Nor does the convention give any international body the \npower to compel the U.S. to permit an inspection or issue a warrant.\n  This is the overwhelming consensus among international law scholars \nthat have studied the convention, two of whom have written to me \nexpressing their opinion that the convention is constitutional. I ask \nunanimous consent that the letters of Harvard Law Professor Abram \nChayes and Columbia Law Professor Louis Henkin be included in the \nRecord following my statement.\n  So let me make this point absolutely clear, despite what opponents of \nthe convention have said, there will be no involuntary warrantless \nsearches of U.S. facilities by foreign inspectors under this \nconvention.\n  In light of this, I hope that the constitutionality of this \nconvention will not become an issue in this debate.\n\n\n                          American leadership\n\n  Mr. President, let me stress that the CWC will go into effect with or \nwithout us on April 29. The only way we can ensure fully effective \nAmerican leadership is to ratify this convention before that date. We \nwill needlessly pay a price if we ratify after that date.\n  Let us remember that this is not a partisan issue before us. After \nmore than 8 years of negotiation under two Republican administrations, \nPresident Bush signed the final version of the CWC in January 1993.\n  To demonstrate the bipartisan support for the CWC, I ask unanimous \nconsent to insert in the Record a statement made earlier this month by \nformer President Bush in which he re-stated his strong support for \nratification of the CWC.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to insert into the Record a recent op-ed \nby former Secretary of State James Baker.\n  Many of the strongest supporters of this convention are Republicans. \nThe distinguished senior Senator from Indiana, Senator Lugar, has led \nthe effort to ratify the CWC. All of us, Republicans and Democrats \nalike, need to recognize that this convention is a matter of our \nnational interest.\n  Mr. President, I fear that our status as the world's non-\nproliferation leader would be irreversibly compromised by our \nunwillingness to ratify the CWC.\n  Already, all of our G-7 partners have ratified the CWC.\n  What will be their reaction when we try to enlist their support for \nproliferation initiatives targeting rogue states if we cannot even take \nthe simple step of joining a regime that we led the way in creating?\n  Make no mistake. If we fail to ratify the CWC, we will forfeit the \nhigh ground on global proliferation matters. And that is not something \nto be taken lightly, for the result will be a far more dangerous world.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, the burdens of the chemical weapons \nconvention are small, but its benefits are great.\n  The American chemical industry strongly supports this convention.\n  Our military is already committed to destroying our poison gas \nstockpile, and the convention will require the same of every other CWC \nmember state.\n  The CWC will improve our ability to monitor the chemical weapons \ncapabilities of other states.\n  In short, Mr. President, the CWC will improve the security of \nAmericans.\n  The CWC may not be perfect--and no treaty is--but it is considerably \nbetter than the alternative of doing nothing. Ultimately, the question \nwe will have to ask is--are we better off with the CWC or without it? I \nhope that I have demonstrated today why we would be far better off \njoining a treaty regime that we created, rather than turning our backs \nin favor of the status quo or worse.\n  We need to disregard arguments that are superfluous to the core \nreality of what this convention will accomplish: It bans poison gas, \nperiod.\n  This convention is the best means available to ensure that there will \nbe no more victims of poison gas like the soldiers in the trenches of \nWorld War I or the innocent victims of a murderous Iraqi regime.\n  I understand that a task force of Republican Senators has been \nworking with the White House to address concerns raised by some of our \ncolleagues. I hope that this process soon will yield a resolution of \nratification that merits strong bipartisan support.\n  But I cannot emphasize enough the importance of this convention to \nour national security. We have a very real deadline hanging over our \nheads.\n  I would urge my colleagues to learn more about this convention in the \nnext few weeks so that they can make an informed decision about its \nnecessity for our national security. Please contact me or my staff if \nyou have questions about the cwc and what it will and will not do.\n  If we bring this convention to the floor and engage in a full, frank, \nand open debate on its merits, I am confident that two-thirds of the \nSenate will be convinced that the Chemical Weapons Convention is good \nfor American business, good for the American military, and good for the \nAmerican people. Mr. President, we owe it to them to have this debate \nat the earliest possible time.\n  I ask that the material to which I referred be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Jan. 6, 1997]\n\n                    A Needless Risk for U.S. Troops\n\n                         (By E.R. Zumwalt, Jr.)\n\n       It has been more than 80 years since poison gas was first \n     used in modern warfare--in April 1915 during the first year \n     of World War I. It is long past time to do something about \n     such weapons.\n       I am not a dove. As a young naval officer in 1945, I \n     supported the use of nuclear weapons against Japan. As chief \n     of naval operations two decades ago, I pressed for \n     substantially higher military spending than the nation's \n     political leadership was willing to grant. After retiring \n     from the Navy, I helped lead the opposition to the SALT II \n     treaty because I was convinced it would give the Soviet Union \n     a strategic advantage.\n       Now the Senate is considering whether to approve the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention. This is a worldwide treaty, \n     negotiated by the Reagan administration and signed by the \n     Bush administration. It bans the development, production, \n     possession, transfer and use of chemical weapons. Senate \n     opposition to ratification is led by some with whom I often \n     agree. But in this case, I believe they do a grave disservice \n     to America's men and women in uniform.\n       To a Third World leader indifferent to the health of his \n     own troops and seeking to cause large-scale pain and death \n     for its own sake, chemical weapons have a certain attraction. \n     They don't require the advanced\n\n[[Page S1586]]\n\n     technology needed to build nuclear weapons. Nor do they \n     require the educated populace needed to create a modern \n     conventional military. But they cannot give an inferior force \n     a war-winning capability. In the Persian Gulf war, the threat \n     of our uncompromising retaliation with conventional weapons \n     deterred Saddam Hussein from using his chemical arsenal \n     against us.\n       Next time, our adversary may be more berserk than Saddam, \n     and deterrence may fail. If that happens, our retaliation \n     will be decisive, devastating--and no help to the young \n     American men and women coming home dead or bearing grievous \n     chemical injuries. What will help is a treaty removing huge \n     quantities of chemical weapons that could otherwise be used \n     against us.\n       ``Militarily, this treaty will make us stronger. During the \n     Bush administration, our nation's military and political \n     leadership decided to retire our chemical weapons. This wise \n     move was not made because of treaties. Rather, it was based \n     on the fact that chemical weapons are not useful for us.\n       Politically and diplomatically, the barriers against their \n     use by a First World country are massive. Militarily, they \n     are risky and unpredictable to use, difficult and dangerous \n     to store. They serve no purpose that can't be met by our \n     overwhelming conventional forces.\n       So the United States has no deployed chemical weapons today \n     and will have none in the future. But the same is not true of \n     our potential adversaries. More than a score of nations now \n     seeks or possesses chemical weapons. Some are rogue states \n     with which we may some day clash.\n       This treaty is entirely about eliminating other people's \n     weapons--weapons that may some day be used against Americans. \n     For the American military, U.S. ratification of the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention is high gain and low or no pain. In that \n     light, I find it astonishing that any American opposes \n     ratification.\n       Opponents argue that the treaty isn't perfect: Verification \n     isn't absolute, forms must be filled out, not every nation \n     will join at first and so forth. This is unpersuasive. \n     Nothing in the real world is perfect. If the U.S. Navy had \n     refused to buy any weapon unless it worked perfectly every \n     time, we would have bought nothing and now would be disarmed. \n     The question is not how this treaty compares with perfection. \n     The question is how U.S. ratification compares with its \n     absence.\n       If we refuse to ratify, some governments will use our \n     refusal as an excuse to keep their chemical weapons. \n     Worldwide availability of chemical weapons will be higher, \n     and we will know less about other countries' chemical \n     activities. The diplomatic credibility of our threat of \n     retaliation against anyone who uses chemical weapons on our \n     troops will be undermined by our lack of ``clean hands.'' At \n     the bottom line, our failure to ratify will substantially \n     increase the risk of a chemical attack against American \n     service personnel.\n       If such an attack occurs, the news reports of its victims \n     in our military hospitals will of course produce rapid \n     ratification of the treaty and rapid replacement of senators \n     who enabled the horror by opposing ratification. But for the \n     victims, it will be too late.\n       Every man and woman who puts on a U.S. military uniform \n     faces possible injury or death in the national interest. They \n     don't complain; risk is part of their job description. But it \n     is also part of the job description of every U.S. senator to \n     see that this risk not be increased unnecessarily.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        [Chemical Weapons Convention News Alert, Feb. 20, 1997]\n\n                 Veterans, Military Groups Endorse CWC\n\n       Veterans organizations and military associations \n     representing millions of Americans who have served in this \n     nation's armed forces have endorsed the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention.\n       The Veterans of Foreign Wars Commander in Chief James E. \n     Nier said:\n       ``The treaty will reduce world stockpiles of such weapons \n     and will hopefully prevent our troops from being exposed to \n     poison gases. . . .

The \n     treaty is the brainchild of the United States. Since the \n     treaty was opened for signature in Paris, 67 nations have \n     ratified the treaty (China is poised to become the 68th \n     member of the club). The United States is not among the 67. \n     Now, with the Convention poised to become international law \n     on April 29, our nation's continuing absence from a treaty of \n     its making is fast becoming a source of international \n     embarrassment. The Senate should act quickly to rectify this \n     situation by ratifying the treaty at the earliest \n     opportunity.\n       Opposition to the Convention, led by conservative think \n     tanks, is rooted in long-standing suspicions of arms control \n     agreements. But the critics have taken to embellishing this \n     argument by also claiming the Convention will have a \n     devastating impact on American businesses, large and small.\n       The critics are simply wrong. The members of our \n     association, large and small, produce over 90 percent of the \n     nation's industrial chemicals and they strongly support the \n     Convention. Ratifying it is the right thing to do.\n       No American business makes chemical weapons. Chemical \n     companies do, however, make products which can, in the wrong \n     hands, be processed into weapons agents. Some poison gases \n     for example, can be made in part from chemicals designed to \n     treat cancer patients and prevent fires.\n       Chemical manufacturers have a responsibility to make sure \n     that their products are safely produced and properly used. \n     That's why we support the Chemical Weapons Convention. It's \n     the best way to reduce the threat of future poison gas \n     attacks.\n       Some advocacy groups, and their allies on Capitol Hill, are \n     trying to scare the business community into opposing the \n     Convention. It's time to answer the critics and set the \n     record straight.\n       Here's how the chemical industry answers three commonly-\n     heard criticisms of the treaty:\n       The treaty will impose a ``massive new regulatory burden'' \n     on more than 25,000 American businesses, most of which are \n     not chemical companies. The terms of the treaty place most of \n     the private-sector reporting requirements squarely on the \n     shoulders of chemical manufacturers. No more than 2,000 \n     facilities here in the U.S. face treaty obligations. Nearly \n     all are chemical makers, not their customers. And most \n     regulated businesses will be required to do more than fill \n     out a two-page form, once a year.\n       The treaty threatens vital industry trade secrets by \n     allowing international inspectors free access to \n     manufacturing sites. The chemical industry worked with treaty \n     negotiators for more than a decade to help devise inspection \n     procedures. We tested these procedures during trial \n     inspections held at our commercial facilities. Our top \n     priority was to protect legitimate commercial secrets. The \n     treaty does just that--it does not permit unlimited inspector \n     access to any facility.\n       The treaty tramples on the U.S. Constitution by voiding \n     Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches \n     and seizures. This argument does not pass the red-face test. \n     A simple reading of the Convention reveals that the treaty \n     respects all constitutional protections.\n       The chemical industry spent years examining this treaty. We \n     have opened our plants to trial inspections. We have put the \n     treaty to the test--over and over again. Honest businesses \n     have nothing to fear from this treaty. Its benefits far \n     outweigh the costs.\n       What the critics fail to mention is the price to pay for \n     failing to ratify the Convention. The treaty imposes trade \n     sanctions on countries which don't participate. The price of \n     U.S. non-participation will be paid by the chemical industry \n     and by American workers, for it is our products, and our \n     businesses, that will be hurt. Treaty opponents purport to \n     represent American business interests in the Convention, but \n     they aren't telling business the true story.\n       The Senate's vote on the treaty will send a powerful signal \n     to the rest of the world. A vote against the treaty will \n     surely be perceived as a vote for chemical weapons.\n       Those who oppose this treaty have yet to offer a credible \n     alternative. Chemical weapons are a serious threat to world \n     security. The Chemical Weapons Convention is a serious \n     response to that threat. The treaty's merits have been \n     debated for years. It's time\n\n[[Page S1587]]\n\n     to stop talking and take action. It's time for the U.S. to \n     ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention before it goes into \n     effect in April 1997.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           Harvard Law School,\n\n                                  Cambridge MA, September 9, 1996.\n     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Biden: You have asked me to comment on the \n     suggestion that the Chemical Weapons Convention (the \n     Convention), now before the Senate for its advice and \n     consent, conflicts with the provisions of the Fourth \n     Amendment of the Constitution prohibiting unreasonable \n     searches and seizures. In my view, the suggestion is \n     completely without merit.\n       The Convention expressly provides that:\n       ``In meeting the requirement to provide access . . . the \n     inspected State Party shall be under the obligation to allow \n     the greatest degree of access taking into account any \n     constitutional obligations it may have with regard to  \n     proprietary rights or searches and seizures.'' (Verification \n     Annex, Part X, par. 41) (emphasis supplied).\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ The Verification Annex is, of course, an integral part of \n     the convention.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       As you know, this provision of the Convention was inserted \n     at the insistence of the United States after earlier drafts, \n     which provided insufficient protection in regard to \n     unreasonable searches and seizures, had been criticized by a \n     number of U.S. scholars. The plain meaning of these words, \n     which seems too clear for argument, is that the United States \n     would have no obligation under the Convention to permit \n     access to facilities subject to its jurisdiction in violation \n     of the provisions of the Fourth Amendment. It was the clear \n     understanding of the negotiators that the purpose of the \n     provision was to obviate any possibility of conflict between \n     the obligations of the United States under the Convention and \n     the mandate of the Fourth Amendment. The Convention in its \n     final form is thus fully consistent with U.S. constitutional \n     requirements.\n       Inspections required by the Convention will be conducted \n     pursuant to implementing legislation to be adopted by \n     Congress that will define the terms, conditions and scope of \n     the inspections to be conducted in the United States by \n     the Technical Staff of the Organization for the \n     Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) established by the \n     Convention. I understand that draft implementing \n     legislation entitled the Chemical Weapons Convention \n     Implementation Act, now before the Congress, specifies the \n     procedures that will be followed in the case of both \n     routine and challenge inspections carried out pursuant to \n     the Convention. The Act requires, at a minimum, an \n     administrative search warrant before an inspection can be \n     conducted, and has elaborate provisions for notice and \n     other protections to the owner of the premises to be \n     searched. These provisions of the Act are modeled on \n     similar administrative inspection regimes already \n     authorized by Acts of Congress such as the Toxic \n     Substances Control Act and upheld by the courts. However, \n     if Congress is concerned that these provisions are \n     constitutionally insufficient, it is free under the \n     Convention to revise the Act to include more stringent \n     requirements that conform to constitutional limitations. \n     Finally, a person subject to inspection may challenge the \n     inspection in a U.S. court, which in turn will be bound to \n     invalidate any inspection that fails to comply with \n     constitutional requirements. In view of the provisions of \n     the Verification Annex quoted above, the United States \n     would not be in violation of any international obligation \n     in such an eventually.\n       For these reasons I conclude that there is no \n     constitutional objection to the Convention, and that the \n     rights of individuals under the Fourth Amendment will be \n     fully protected under the Convention and implementing \n     legislation of the character presently contemplated.\n       In addition, I have been involved in the field of arms \n     control as a scholar and practitioner for many years, going \n     back to the Limited Test Ban Treaty in 1963, in connection \n     with which I appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee as Legal Adviser of the State Department. I have \n     also closely followed the negotiations for the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention. The United States has been a prime mover \n     in the development of the Convention under both Republican \n     and Democratic administrations. I am convinced that the \n     prompt ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention is \n     overwhelmingly in the security interest of the United States \n     and should not be derailed by constitutional objections that \n     are so plainly without substance.\n           Sincerely,\n     Abram Chayes.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Columbia University,\n\n\n                                                School of Law,\n\n                                 New York, NY, September 11, 1996.\n       Dear Senator Biden: As requested, I have considered \n     whether, if the United States adhered to the Convention on \n     Chemical Weapons, the inspection provisions of the Convention \n     would raise serious issues under the United States \n     Constitution. I have concluded that those provisions would \n     not present important obstacles to U.S. adherence to the \n     Convention.\n       Like domestic laws, treaties of the United States are \n     subject to constitutional restraints. The Fourth Amendment to \n     the United States constitution provides: ``The right of the \n     people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and \n     effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall \n     not be violated . . .'' Constitutional jurisprudence has \n     established that the right to be secure applies also to \n     industrial and commercial facilities and to business records, \n     papers and effects.\n       The Constitution, however, protects the rights of private \n     persons; it does not protect governmental bodies, public \n     officials, public facilities or public papers. As to private \n     persons, the Fourth Amendment protects only against searches \n     and seizures that are ``unreasonable.'' Inspection \n     arrangements, negotiated and approved by the President and \n     consented to by the Senate, designed to give effect to a \n     treaty of major importance to the United States, carry a \n     strong presumption that they are not unreasonable.\n       The Chemical Convention itself anticipated the \n     constitutional needs of the United States. Part X of the \n     Convention, ``Challenge Inspection pursuant to Article IX,'' \n     provides:\n       ``41. In meeting the requirement to provide access as \n     specified in paragraph 38, the inspected State party shall be \n     under the obligation to allow the greatest degree of access \n     taking into account any constitutional obligation it may have \n     with regard to proprietary rights or searches and seizures.''\n       As applied to the United States, that provision is properly \n     interpreted to mean that the United States must provide \n     access required by the Convention, but if the Constitution \n     precludes some access in some circumstances, the United \n     States must provide access to the extent the Constitution \n     permits. And if, because of constitutional limitations, the \n     United States cannot provide full access required by the \n     Convention, the United States is required ``to make every \n     reasonable effort to provide alternative means to clarify the \n     possible noncompliance concern that generated the challenge \n     inspection.'' (Art. 42.)\n       The United States would be required also to adopt measures \n     to overcome any constitutional obstacles to any inspection or \n     interrogation required by the Convention. If it were \n     determined to be necessary, the United States could satisfy \n     the requirements of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments by \n     arranging for administrative search warrants, by enacting \n     statutes granting immunity from prosecution for crimes \n     revealed by compelled testimony, by providing just \n     compensation for any ``taking'' involved.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Louis Henkin,\n     University Professor Emeritus.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               Statement of Former President George Bush\n\n       President Bush. Welcome. Let me just say that we've had a \n     most enjoyable breakfast. Barbara and I are very flattered \n     that the Secretary of State, in what is obviously a busy \n     schedule, took time to come and have breakfast with us.\n       I told Secretary Albright that she would have my \n     enthusiastic support in her quest for bipartisanship and \n     foreign policy. I think Jim Baker, my esteemed friend and \n     former colleague, told her the same thing, so it's for real \n     from us and I know she feels strongly about that.\n       I told her I would strongly support her efforts to get this \n     Chemical Weapons Treaty approved. This should be beyond \n     partisanship. I have a certain fatherhood feeling about that. \n     But leaving that out, I think it is vitally important for the \n     United States to be out front, not to be dragged, kicking and \n     screaming to the finish line on that question. We don't need \n     chemical weapons, and we ought to get out front and make \n     clear that we are opposed to others having them. So that's \n     important.\n       The funding for the State Department: When I heard \n     Madeleine telling me some of the problems that she might \n     face--hopefully, she won't, but she might face--it was deja \n     vu because I remember Jim Baker coming to me, as President, \n     and saying ``We must keep adequate funding levels for \n     State.'' I couldn't agree more. There is a stupid feeling in \n     some quarters that we don't have any more concerns on foreign \n     policy, that we don't have any more threat in the world. The \n     Secretary knows so well that we do.\n       So I hope that Congress will do what's right on a \n     bipartisan basis in terms of proper levels of funding. She \n     can determine what those levels should be. But all I know is, \n     these arguments that we ought to cut back on spending for \n     foreign affairs--I think it's very shortsighted. We do that \n     at our own risk for generations to come, too.\n       We talked about several others. But, Madeleine, welcome, \n     and I'm so pleased you came to Houston.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                            Our Best Defense\n\n                         (By James A. Baker 3d)\n\n       Houston.--The Chemical Weapons Convention -- an \n     international treaty that commits member nations to destroy \n     their chemical weapons and to forswear future production, \n     acquisition or use of them--is before the Senate for \n     approval. Despite the fact that the treaty was negotiated \n     under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, a number of \n     Republicans have expressed reservations about it. I respect \n     their motives, but their concerns are misplaced.\n       For instance, some have argued that we shouldn't commit to \n     the treaty because rogue states like Libya, Iraq and North\n\n[[Page S1588]]\n\n     Korea, which have not signed it, will still be able to \n     continue their efforts to acquire chemical weapons. This is \n     obviously true. But the convention, which has been endorsed \n     by 68 countries and will go into effect in April whether or \n     not we have ratified it, will make it more difficult for \n     these states to do so by prohibiting the sale of materials to \n     nonmembers that can be used to make chemical weapons.\n       In an ideal world, rogue states and terrorist groups would \n     simply give up the use of chemical weapons. But ours is not \n     an ideal world. The Chemical Weapons Convention recognizes \n     that, and so should its opponents. It makes no sense to argue \n     that because a few pariah states refuse to join the \n     convention the United States should line up with them rather \n     than with the rest of the world.\n       Others have argued that if we ratify the treaty, we will \n     not be able to verify that all members will abide by it. No \n     international agreement, of course, is perfectly verifiable--\n     just as no domestic law is perfectly enforceable. But the \n     treaty sets up a verification system, including international \n     inspections on short notice, that will be far more effective \n     than what we possess today. Moreover, the treaty would \n     strengthen information-sharing among member states. It would \n     increase, not diminish, our understanding of chemical weapons \n     threats.\n       Some opponents of the treaty claim that it would create yet \n     another costly international bureaucracy and place an onerous \n     regulatory burden on American business. Both assertions are \n     overstated. Our share for administering the treaty would be \n     about $25 million a year, a truly modest amount in a Federal \n     budget of about $1.7 trillion. Only about 140 companies would \n     have significant reporting requirements, while some 2,000 \n     others would be asked to fill out a short form.\n       Moreover, failure to ratify the treaty would actually cost \n     the American chemical industry hundreds of millions of \n     dollars in sales by making United States exporters subject to \n     trade restrictions by convention members. Our joining the \n     convention could help American business--which is why the \n     chemical industry supports ratification.\n       Other critics assert that the treaty would somehow infringe \n     on our national sovereignty--in particular, the Fourth \n     Amendment ban on unreasonable search and seizure. In fact, it \n     explicitly permits members to abide by their constitutional \n     requirements when providing access to international \n     inspectors. Under the treaty, involuntary inspection of \n     American manufacturing and storage sites would still require \n     legally acquired search warrants. The idea that ratifying the \n     treaty would repeal part of our Bill of Rights is simply \n     wrong.\n       But by far the most important argument against the treaty \n     is that ratification would somehow undermine our national \n     security.\n       Nothing could be further from the truth. Let me be blunt: \n     The idea that Ronald Reagan and George Bush would negotiate a \n     treaty detrimental to this nation's security is grotesque.\n       The United States does not need chemical weapons as a \n     deterrent. Any nation or group contemplating a chemical \n     attack against us must reckon with our overwhelming \n     conventional force and vast nuclear arsenal. Each is more \n     than sufficient to deter a chemical attack.\n       Chemical weapons are relatively easy to develop and cheap \n     to manufacture, so it is no coincidence that the rogue \n     nations now seeking to build chemical arsenals are \n     economically impoverished and technologically backward. \n     Unlike Iraq or Libya, we don't need such weapons to project \n     our influence. In fact, we are already committed--under a law \n     signed in 1985 by President Reagan--to destroy our existing \n     chemical weapons stockpile by 2004. We will do this whether \n     or not we ratify the treaty.\n       What we need is a way to limit the risk that American \n     troops or civilians may someday face a chemical weapons \n     attack. The convention can help do precisely this by \n     controlling the flow of illicit trade materials and by making \n     it easier to marshal international support for the political, \n     diplomatic and economic isolation of countries that refuse to \n     ratify it.\n       If we fail to ratify the convention, we will not only forgo \n     any influence in the continuing effort against chemical \n     weapons, we will also risk postponing indefinitely any \n     progress on an international ban on the equally dire threat \n     of biological weapons.

Mr. President, I rise to address the Senate for the \nfirst\n\n[[Page S1589]]\n\ntime as a Member of this proud institution, and, indeed, it is an \nimportant moment in my life and that of my family.\n  Although I stand where I know preceding generations have often become \nlegends, I also stand tall because I am standing here today on the \nshoulders of genuine giants--a tailor and his seamstress wife who \nwalked from their native village in Italy for a boat to New York, a \nGerman steelworker who settled his young family in my native New \nJersey.\n  Mr. President, a journey of generations brings me to this moment. I \nunderstand that I may be bound to some Members of this Senate by little \nmore than a single common thread. Many families are more powerful, and \nmost biographies are genuinely more compelling. But Providence has \nchosen what we share this moment to help define the future of our \npeople and the Republic that they have chosen to serve them.\n  The burden of leadership may be greater on some generations, and \nperhaps it has been less on others. The only certainty for our time is \nthat it is different. The great debates of this Chamber in other times \nhave been framed by events--the threat of conflict in the time of our \nfathers, the immediate threat of economic dislocation not so many years \nago. Previous generations often read the national agenda simply by the \nhistory that was presented to them. The choices were fundamental and \nthey were very clear.\n  The principal issue of governance before us now is very different. \nThe United States is largely without large-scale military strife. The \nsuccessive defeats of fascism and communism leave the United States \nwith a relative military advantage that is unprecedented. The greatest \neconomic expansion in history has resulted in a standard of living and \na scale of economic activity that was unimaginable only a generation \nago. This is not to suggest that either providing for the national \ndefense or building the national economy are complete. The world \nremains a dangerous place in the age of terrorism, and the blessings of \nAmerica still elude too many.\n  But our time is different. We inherit no agenda and few national \ncommitments from which we are not freed by the end of the cold war. \nThis opportunity presents an enormous opening, but has also led to an \nextraordinary national anxiety. As a nation, we have consumed almost a \ndecade since the cold war has subsided without being clear about what \nwe need to achieve to succeed with the reward of peace.\n  In our domestic affairs, some view the success of civil rights, the \ncompletion of universal education for the construction of a national \ninfrastructure as ends in themselves.\n  In our family lives, many seem uncertain as to our own objectives as \npeople. The comfort of a home, the completion of an education, seem to \nbring neither the security nor the fulfillment that we once envisioned. \nIt is in short, Mr. President, a time of extraordinary anxiety in our \naffairs. Across the aisles of this Chamber, the conference tables of \nour businesses and even the living rooms of our homes, there is need \nfor an honest conversation. It is time to ask the most fundamental \nquestions about the objectives of our times and our goals as a people \nand as individuals.\n  No one element of this debate is more fundamental than our new \nnational objectives in our relations with other States around the \nglobe. The foreign policy goals of the United States in the next \ncentury can best be explained relative to the experience of our own \ntime. For although the 20th century has not yet concluded, it is \nalready possible to predict that despite all the advances of science \nand culture this time will best be remembered for our inability to \nmanage relations between nations.\n  Any discussion of our foreign policy objectives, therefore, must \nsimply begin with this simple commitment: the future must simply be \ndifferent than the past. This century evolved through the lessons of \ncollective security. A series of States with similar interests, \npolitical institutions, compatible military capabilities and goals \nfound common cause. The NATO treaty was the best example and remains \nthe foundation of our policy. But the first principal difference we are \nlikely to face in the 21st century is that American security interests \nare no longer disproportionately European. In a world of global markets \nand intercontinental weapons, there are no regions of sufficient \ndistance or size that they lack relevance. Treaties which restrict the \nglobal scope of our collective security including NATO are simply no \nlonger acceptable. Creating new arrangements tailored to individual \ncrises like the Persian Gulf are too inefficient and insufficient. \nLeadership requires the adoption of an established global structure of \ncollective security. Whether under the NATO umbrella, under different \nsponsorship or a structure that is global in scale, collective security \nfor our international security threats remains paramount.\n  The second defining difference in American foreign policy is \nrecognizing that international conflict on a scale seen in the 20th \ncentury must never be allowed to occur again because by definition such \nconflicts can never be won again. Technological change will place all \nnations within the range of secondary powers that retain weapons now \nreserved for more stable nations.\n  Collective security, therefore, must be designed not only to prevail \nin conflicts but to avoid their ever occurring by denying capability to \ncertain well-defined governments. These are States which by their \nsystems of government, record of actions or temperament of leadership, \nshould make themselves ineligible to ever possess or attempt to develop \ncertain weapons. This policy of weapons denial already encompasses \ntechnological and trade restrictions. In the future, it must also \ninclude covert or overt actions by the United States or now collective \ninternational organizations to ensure weapons denial as an assurance of \nnational security.\n  A third national consideration will involve far more introspection by \nevery American. As a decent people with deep religious traditions, it \nis time to recognize that technology presents a new moral dilemma. For \ntwo centuries Americans witnessed a world of famine and disease. Untold \nmillions suffered and died with little more than passing commentary \nwhile we remained reconciled to both our moral principles and \ninternational realities by concluding that nature was sometimes cruel \nand divine actions difficult to comprehend. In critical moments, from \nthe Marshall Plan to the Alliance for Progress, the Nation committed \nitself to confronting these tragic realities.\n  During most generations, the national boundaries served to define our \nsense of moral responsibility. That was all enough. But something has \nnow fundamentally changed. Perhaps it is because global communication \nnow no longer allows us to be shielded from harsh realities. But, \nindeed, it is even more than that. The world population group now \nestimates that 35,000 children die from starvation every day, this year \nan estimated 18 million will contract river blindness, and over 100,000 \nchildren will suffer from new cases of polio. No American can feel \ncomfort any longer in reaching conclusions about the inevitability of \nhuman suffering. There has been a cure for polio for 40 years. River \nblindness is treated by medication that costs $3. The simple truth is \nthat some disease and much human suffering is no longer a question of \ndivine providence or lack of understanding or a failure of technology. \nMost are the results of a political decision, a judgment to withhold \ntechnology, withdraw from efforts to relieve suffering because of \nshortages of funds or simply because we believe that political \nboundaries place us at sufficient distance.\n  Reconciling our beliefs and our actions is no longer a simple affair. \nSuffering in the world and judgments made by individual Americans and \ntheir governments are debate long needed on the floor of our great \ninstitutions. Within our own communities, Americans need to decide a \nnew set of national objectives as well.\n  Americans have learned a lesson from the excesses of Government. \nEvery citizen can recite a list of programs that failed or funds that \nwere wasted. Our generation has concluded that the role of Government \nneeds to be more limited. A previous generation learned from the \nlessons of child labor, the disabled, the failure to care for the \nelderly, that Government was sometimes too restricted in its role. Now \nit\n\n[[Page S1590]]\n\nis time for us to decide: Is it too limited or is it too much? It is, \nindeed, extraordinary that after two centuries of the American \nexperiment we are still debating the appropriate role and scale of the \nU.S. Government. In our time we must ask both the appropriate range and \nthe scale of Government activities that are needed for our generation.\n\n  The answer is likely to be somewhere in between. We must, obviously, \nbe shaped by our own experiences. But I think most Americans will \nrecognize that simply because Government sometimes failed, because we \nhave learned that it cannot do everything, is not a reason to conclude \nthat it can do nothing. We take enormous pride in the fact that America \nis a place with an unlimited ceiling of opportunity. But all too often \nwe are also learning that the floor of American life is too hard. \nBecause many, or most can succeed is not a reason to turn away from \npublic responsibilities, because some will fail.\n  We are also learning, for all the lessons of the past which we must \nremember, they are not instructive of the future. We are living in a \ndifferent time. Indeed, we are discovering that the economic success of \neach family, many communities, and many States are now connected in a \nmeans that we never would have imagined. We are discovering that the \noperation of our railroads, our airports, our highways, the education \nof our children all inevitably will affect the quality of life of our \nown families.\n  For two centuries our Federal Government was central to providing the \nprivate economy with certain elements that were needed for \ncompetitiveness. From inexpensive labor, through our immigration \npolicy, to access to raw materials, competitive taxes, copyright laws, \nsometimes even direct subsidies, we understood an appropriate role for \nthe U.S. Government in ensuring economic success.\n  As we now face this debate again in our own time, reaching our own \nconclusion about the role, size and scale of the Federal Government, \nperhaps at least this one thing should be recognized as different. As \ncertainly as those before us recognize immigration policy, raw \nmaterials, these other elements as central to economic success, \neducation and knowledge is now the fodder of the private economy in our \nown time. Therefore, as certainly as local governments, as \nneighborhoods at one time confronted the need for quality schools, high \nstandards and a quality education, now the Nation itself is confronted \nwith this question, because it is no longer good enough to know that \neducation meets standards in our neighborhoods or our towns or even our \nStates. Our States collectively in our Federal system will meet success \nor failure in whether or not people we don't even know in communities \nwe have never visited in States we hardly know meet those same \nstandards and are competitive.\n  Second, as a national community, redefining ourselves again, debating \nthe appropriate role of the Federal Government, we are also faced with \nthe most fundamental of issues that first confronted our Republic. It \nis the issue of providing security for our communities and our \nfamilies. It is, in short, assuring domestic order. From longer prison \nsentences to direct assistance to local police, we have in recent years \nredefined our Federal system for a larger role because it was necessary \nto assure the security of our people.\n  In the future, the Federal Government, as it redefines itself, will \nalso play a larger role in other areas. We have begun to deny parents \nthe ability to flee responsibilities to children by fleeing State \njurisdictions. We have begun, indeed, to change Federal laws in \nrelation to access to weapons. Three decades ago, in my State of New \nJersey and in many other urban communities, we began to enact gun \ncontrol laws. But recently, in the city of New York, it was discovered \nthat fully two-thirds of all the weapons now found involved in serious \nfelony crimes were not sold in New York or New Jersey or other States \nthat had gun control laws, but were imported from other States. The \nBrady bill was an important beginning to assuring that, as a community, \nwhile some States did not, fortunately, share in the plague of crime, \nthey nevertheless would begin to exercise responsibility by, through \nnew national laws, beginning to separate criminals from the guns they \nuse.\n  A third unfinished piece of business in the American social compact \nalso needs to be addressed. It began in this century with labor \nstandards and grew to include Social Security, unemployment insurance \nand Medicare. Each of those in our social compact was a generational \njudgment. Now there is a need for another, because that list which \nbegan early in the progressive era and expanded through Medicare by way \nof unemployment and Social Security now leaves us with the question of \nhealth care insurance. Before the book is closed on the 20th century, \nin this great redefining of America's social commitments, surely access \nto affordable and quality health care needs to be added to the list. It \nis not a question of the Government supplanting private health care. It \nis not a question of the loss of private options or the private \nexercise of talents within the health care field any more so than \nMedicare meant that doctors were no longer working privately or \nunemployment insurance meant that private companies no longer managed \ntheir own affairs.\n  But it is a question that what began with our grandparents and our \ngreat grandparents in assuring independence in the workplace, the right \nto bargain for your own wage, your freedom from want for the elderly \nthrough Social Security, that movement is not complete and that work is \nnot finished without addressing the reality of 40 million Americans \noutside of the private health care insurance system, or their children \nwho come of age without inoculation to disease or, indeed, often are \nborn without access to a health care system for their mothers or in \ntheir infancy.\n\n  All these are part of expanding our domestic agenda at a time when we \nredefine the role of Government. I recognize that there are many in \nthis institution, as there are across this country, who would confront \nthese issues differently. But in our time there is a new, greater \nthreat to resolve in these questions. It is on the mantle of \nbipartisanship, part of the desire to settle all disputes. We are, in \nthis institution and around the country, confusing the desire to end \nthe noise of squabbling, the needless bickering of partisanship, with a \nnew seeming desire of bipartisanship, to end all conflicts together.\n  This is, Mr. President, in my mind, a new and compelling problem. \nAmerican democracy is not served best by Democrats and Republicans, or \nliberals and conservatives, setting aside all their differences. The \npublic believes we are in some new accord in which we have no \ndifferences. Democracy is served best by people who do put petty \ninterests aside, who do not argue simply for partisan reasons, who do, \nindeed, come together in moments of great national crisis, but who, in \nhonesty, come to this floor as they come to their dinner tables and \ntheir businesses and their places of work every day in honest \ndisagreement where they have honest difference.\n  Let us, therefore, debate the question of America's new role in the \nworld with different perspectives. Because they are complex questions \nand difficult to answer. Let us begin to finally redefine the role of \nGovernment in our lives and our economy from our various perspectives, \nbecause Americans have different views, and they are difficult and \ncomplex questions. But let us not, because we want to end \ndisagreements, where we were sometimes disagreeable, make \nbipartisanship a goal in and of itself. The goal is to answer the \nquestion and to serve our people, no matter the disagreements.\n  This is, Mr. President, finally, an extraordinary time. None of the \nproblems that I have tried to outline tonight should overwhelm us. None \nconcern me because none are as big as the country we represent or as \nbold or as talented as the people who live in our generation in this \nNation.\n  This is an extraordinary time, and we are an extraordinary people. \nIndeed, I would dare to say what probably no other generation ever \nwould have said on the floor of this Senate: That there is no time and \nno place when it is better to have been alive or to be an American than \nthis moment. We have won the great conflicts in the world that \nthreatened our democracy and the peace. We are the masters of a great \nnew technology that can serve us, our interests and our families. There \nis a quality of life that awaits us if we learn to manage our affairs, \nraise the\n\n[[Page S1591]]\n\nresources, deal responsibly with our economy and invest in our future.\n  It is not to say that there will not be difficult days in our own \ntime. There will always be difficult days. But we are a people who \nmanaged to carve out a new social order through Social Security and \nlabor rights in the depths of a depression.\n  We are a people who managed through economic despair to rise to win a \ngreat world war.\n  We are a people who, in the midst of a cold war, conquered space, won \nthe fight for civil rights, even enacted Medicare and began the \ngreatest expansion of education in history.\n  We are a people who, through difficult times, mastered the moment to \nachieve great things.\n  Now, in far better times, though most certainly with some problems in \nour public and private lives, we are asked to rise again. In this, I \nhave no doubts. Let us find a new role for America in the world where \nwe simply do not respond to events, but help shape them; no longer see \nour responsibility simply to win international conflicts but to prevent \nthem by negotiating the peace where possible, by taking action to \nprevent war by military means when necessary.\n  Let us redefine the role of Government in our lives and our private \neconomy to ensure that it is no more than necessary, but everything \nthat is essential to ensure our competitiveness, our fairness in social \njustice.\n  I pledge, Mr. President, in my 6 years in this institution, to simply \nbe guided by this: The words given to me by a friend who came to me \nknowing that I would rise on this day and remembering that they were \nonce spoken by Edmund Burke in a speech to the Electors of Bristol. He \nsaid:\n\n       Your representative owes you not his industry only, but his \n     judgment.
