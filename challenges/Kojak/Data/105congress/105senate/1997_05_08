Help us to understand that You are a loving and \ncompassionate God and Your power can be felt as we understand Your \ngreat love for people.\n  I pray You will keep us from the sin of forgetting that You are the \none who sets up kingdoms and puts down kingdoms, and You cause that to \nhappen through the minds and prayers of men and women. You have \nchallenged us through Your Word that we who are ruled should pray for \nthose who rule and those who rule should always seek God's will in \ntheir decisions. For those who rule in America watch over the souls of \nall Americans, knowing that they must give account to You, O God, and \nlet them govern with joy and not grief, for that is unprofitable.\n  By Christ, therefore, let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God \ncontinually; that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to His name. \nBut to do good and to communicate, forget not, for with such sacrifices \nGod is well pleased. And even now, Heavenly Father, help these men and \nwomen to learn the art of extending grace and understanding to those of \na contrary mind, a different mindset than one's own, even as You have \nextended Your sovereign grace and compassion to each of us. I pray in \nthe name of our wonderful and holy God. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/08/senate-section/article/S4133-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I want to take this opportunity to thank Chaplain Kell \nfor his inspired prayer. And I also want to thank our Senate Chaplain \nfor working to ensure Chaplain Kell, a resident of our State of \nWashington, the opportunity to provide spiritual inspiration today to \nthe Senate.\n  From the shores of Europe to the community of Arlington, WA, Chaplain \nKell's record of service to our Nation is impressive. He served in the \nU.S. Navy during World War II from June 1943 to November 1946 as a \ngunner with the armed guard, the unit that protected merchant marine \nships from enemy attack. He received many service decorations, \nincluding medals for the European African Middle Eastern campaign and \nthe Asiatic Pacific campaign.\n  Chaplain Kell was ordained as a minister in 1965 and served as the \nnational chaplain to the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States \nfrom 1995 to 1996. Born and raised in Skagit Valley, WA, Chaplain Kell \nis now a resident of Arlington and has been a member of VFW Post 1561 \nsince 1985. Prior to becoming VFW national chaplain, he served as the \nVFW post, district, department, and western conference chaplain.\n  As a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, I am proud that \nChaplain Kell has been able to continue his dedicated service to our \nNation today as the Senate guest Chaplain. I wish to honor Chaplain \nKell's wife, Dorothy, and his daughter, Brenda, who have accompanied \nhim here to Washington, DC. And I would also like to extend my most \nheartfelt good wishes to them and to you, Chaplain Kell, as you \ncelebrate your birthday today.\n  Thank you, Lyle Kell, for all of your dedicated service to American \nveterans and to our Nation. Your work to promote our country's freedoms \nhas benefited countless individuals across this Nation and around the \nworld.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the comments of \nthe Senator from Washington.

I rise today, with my friend and colleague, Senator \nWellstone, and others to start up the conversation again about the need \nto clean up our election system and pass meaningful, bipartisan \ncampaign finance reform. I am pleased to announce that as of yesterday \nthe so-called McCain-Feingold legislation now has reached a milestone \nof having 30 cosponsors in the Senate, with the addition of the \ndistinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, Senator Robert Byrd, \nas a cosponsor.\n  The senior Senator from Minnesota, of course, was a leader on this \nissue long before I got here and continues to be, not only in our \nlegislation but on other aspects and ideas about how we can clean up \nthis system.\n  One of the things that really highlights the importance of this issue \nis the type of work that was recently done by Public Citizen in \nreleasing a report that lays out the fact that the McCain-Feingold \nbill, and I am sure other alternatives as well, really would make a \ndifference, that had we done the job last July the elections of 1996 \nwould have looked very different.\n  They have analyzed three components of the legislation. One is the \nvoluntary limits on overall spending that candidates would agree to in \norder to get the benefits of the bill. They analyzed the fact that the \nMcCain-Feingold bill would ban soft money completely, as any good \nreform proposal must do. And Public Citizen analyzed the requirement in \nthe bill that if you want the benefits of the bill, you cannot get more \nthan 20 percent of your total campaign contributions from political \naction committees.\n  Very briefly, since I want to obviously hear from the Senator from \nMinnesota, I just want to report what the figures were. Over the last \nthree election cycles, had these provisions been in the law and had all \ncandidates for the U.S. Senate in 1992 and 1994 and 1996 abided by the \nlimits, $700 million less would have been spent on these campaigns--\n$700 million. That is just for Senate races in three cycles; in other \nwords, just one whole series of Senate races for 100 seats--$700 \nmillion of less spending. It would have been $259 million in less \nspending overall by candidates because they would have agreed to an \noverall limit for their State; $50 million less in political action \ncommittee receipts and $450 million less in soft money.\n  I wish to indicate, since some get in the Chamber and say this is a \nproincumbent bill, the Public Citizen report shows it is just the \nopposite, absolutely the opposite of a proincumbent bill. This is a \nprochallenger bill. Ninety percent of the Senate incumbents over the \nlast three election cycles exceeded the limits for the McCain-Feingold \nbill--90 percent of the incumbents. Only 24 percent of the challengers \nexceeded these limits. So the challengers in most cases would have been \nthe ones who would have been more likely to get the benefits of the \nbill; 81 percent of the incumbents exceeded the 20 percent PAC limit \nand only 13 percent of the challengers exceeded the 20 percent PAC \nlimit.\n  So there are many arguments that are posed against the bill, most of \nwhich do not hold water, including the notion that the bill is \nunconstitutional. We will address that on another occasion, but today I \nthought I would just use a few minutes of this time to indicate that \nthis notion that this bill is protection for incumbents is false and \njust the opposite is the case as is indicated by Public Citizen.\n\n  At this point I would like to----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I wonder whether the Senator will yield \nfor a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I was listening to my colleague from Wisconsin, and I \nthank him for leading this reform effort, in fact I thank Senator \nMcCain and other Senators as well. I know the Presiding Officer has \ndone a lot of work and has spoken out about trying to really reduce the \nrole of big money in politics.\n  The question I ask my colleague has to do with this whole issue of \nincumbents and challengers. It has been said sometimes that the debate \nabout campaign finance reform is really less a debate between Democrats \nand Republicans and all too often is more a debate between ins and \nouts; that, if anything, part of the inertia here and the slowness to \nembrace reform and the fierce opposition has to do with the fact that \nright now the system is really wild for those people who are in office.\n  My question for my colleague is does he feel some sense of urgency \nand will he consider coming to the floor every week now with other \ncolleagues--the two of us are sort of getting started. There are a \nnumber of Senators who feel very strongly that this is a core issue, \nthe influence of money in politics, and the most important thing we \ncould ever do would be to pass a significant reform measure. Is my \ncolleague from Wisconsin beginning to feel as though it is really going \nto be important that every week from now on for Democrats and \nRepublicans who are serious about reform to be out on the floor and \nbeginning to frame the issues, especially focusing on what are going to \nbe the solutions?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I do really thank the Senator from Minnesota. In fact, \nI would very much like to join with him in coming out here each week, \nassuming we are permitted the time. This is the time to start this \neffort in the Chamber. We had great help from the President of the \nUnited States in endorsing the legislation and getting us off to the \nright start at the beginning of the year when there was a great deal of \nattention paid to this issue.\n  Obviously, there are other priorities; the whole issue of balancing \nthe budget has taken much of center stage for the last few weeks and \nobviously is now on a track, whether one likes it or not, that is \nmoving in a direction that will be resolved one way or another.\n  That is why I think this is the time, as the Senator from Minnesota \nis suggesting, to have an awful lot of the conversation here on the \nfloor between now and the day we pass campaign finance reform be about \nthis issue. We have to talk to the American people this way and in \nevery other way about what the real facts are about this issue because \nit has been often distorted.\n  For example, the point of the Senator from Minnesota about whether or \nnot this is really a Republican-Democrat issue. It is not. The Public \nCitizen report, for example, points out there is not a lot of \ndifference between the parties in terms of this issue: 54 percent of \nthe Democrats who ran for the Senate in the last three election cycles \nexceeded the limits; 59 percent of the Republicans exceeded it. It is \nnot a vast kind of difference, and the Members here really know that. \nThe problem is somehow encouraging Members, incumbents here to realize \nthat their lives and their jobs would be better and the opportunities \nfor others who want to run for office would be better if we do this. \nBut I think we do need to be out here talking about this, if not on a \ndaily basis at least on a weekly basis, to let people know this is a \nserious effort and that we do intend to succeed.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I wonder if my colleague will allow me \nto share a concern with him and get his response. Let me tell you what \nmy worry is. I do not have any doubt that people in the country know \nthat too much money is spent, that they know there is too much special \ninterest access, that they know all of us spend too much time raising \nmoney. I have no doubt that people understand that. As a matter of \nfact, I think one of the things that is making it more and more \ndifficult for people to get involved at the grassroots level is when \nthey see these huge amounts of money contributed by some folks and some \ninterests and then they get a letter: We would like you to make a $10 \ncontribution and be involved in our grassroots effort.\n\n[[Page S4135]]\n\n  They are a little cynical, and they figure: Come on, give us a break; \nwe know the people who are most involved in this process. It is not us \nand our family.\n  This is the core issue for a representative democracy. But my concern \nis that the Rules Committee starts next week, and there will be an \neffort, as I have at least looked at a preliminary list of witnesses--\nnot to talk about any particular witness--there is going to be a pretty \nstrong effort on the part of the Rules Committee, which I have called \nin the Chamber of the Senate, a merry-go-round for reform, to basically \nframe this issue and the issue will be not enough money is spent; all \nwe need is disclosure so that we can make people realize how bad it is, \nwithout doing anything to make it better. As I look at the ways in \nwhich the Rules Committee moves forward starting next week, I see the \nbeginning of the debate. I see the beginning of the debate.\n  So I say to my colleague, will he agree with me that it is going to \nbe important for those of us who are committed to reform, Democrats and \nRepublicans--and there is a pretty significant group--to start coming \nout on the floor? We will figure out the vehicles, and it is not \nnecessarily amendments, but there are always ways of speaking. Should \nwe not now every week be out here framing this issue and over and over \nagain saying what are going to be the solutions to these problems and \nare we or are we not going to take action in this Congress?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I think we have to do this on the floor, \nin part because of the witness list. We went through this last year, \nwhere the committee hearings were used for a great deal of time and you \ndid not get the feeling that the goal was to find a solution or to pass \na bill. The goal was to sort of talk it to death. The floor is a superb \nplace to do this.\n  In fact, I would say to my friend from Minnesota, I think one of the \nbest editorials that has been written on this subject, that I think we \ncan sort of elaborate on on the floor in the coming weeks, is something \nfrom the Washington Post of April 21, 1997, entitled, ``Skirting the \nReal Scandal.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this editorial be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 21, 1997]\n\n                       Skirting the Real Scandal\n\n       The subject that has been most discussed by the politicians \n     thus far this year has been not the budget, nor the state of \n     the economy, nor the various aspects of health care nor peace \n     in the Middle East. It has been campaign finance--and the \n     discussion has been almost entirely fraudulent. It is widely \n     agreed, and rightly so, that we are in the middle of a \n     campaign finance ``scandal,'' and both parties are forced by \n     convention to express their indignation at that. But they are \n     huffing and puffing about a problem that neither is willing \n     to describe accurately--for the good reason that both are \n     complicit in it and have a vested interest in perpetuating \n     precisely what they must denounce. It is like one of those \n     plays in which the characters can't or don't communicate and \n     instead spend their time talking past one another and the \n     truth. The point keeps getting missed--on purpose.\n       The basic problem is that the cost of conducting a campaign \n     for federal office has been bid up to a point that is \n     destructive of the very democratic process it is said to \n     represent. The cost at both the congressional and \n     presidential levels is obscene. One reason may be that so \n     many of the candidates, lately including those for president, \n     have had so little to say. It's not just TV that's expensive. \n     Blur is expensive. In any case, the candidates and parties \n     increasingly have responded to the cost by overriding or \n     circumventing even the relatively modest set of rules put in \n     place in the 1970s in response to the last great fund-raising \n     scandal, that of the Nixon administration.\n       The rules imposed then were meant to limit the extent to \n     which offices and office-holders can be bought, but in last \n     year's presidential race, both parties tossed them almost \n     completely out the window. Both pretended to abide by the law \n     while raising money in amounts and from sources that the law \n     forbids, and the amounts were huge. It is hard to decide \n     which was worse, the pretense or the excess. The law is \n     written in such a way that the violators could be fairly \n     confident that they would suffer no penalty; this beat has no \n     real cops.\n       That is the fundamental scandal that neither party will \n     confront. The president, safely past his last campaign, \n     claims now to want to strengthen a set of rules whose \n     weaknesses he led the way in exploiting. The claim is \n     unconvincing. He converts his own excesses into an agenda. \n     Most of the congressional Democrats don't want to talk about \n     the excess in the system either. In part, they seek to \n     protect the president, in part to protect themselves: What \n     could be so wrong, after all, with a system that elected \n     them? The Republicans have the hardest time of all, because \n     they are the stoutest defenders of the system that they \n     attack the president for having used to such advantage.\n       Because no one can quite afford to talk about Topic A, they \n     all talk about topics B, C and D: What are the ground rules \n     going to be for the various congressional investigations of \n     the subject? Should or shouldn't the attorney general seek \n     appointment of an independent counsel? The Justice Department \n     says one reason it hasn't gone to such lengths is that so \n     much of the fund-raising at the center of the dispute \n     involved so-called soft money rather than hard, meaning money \n     that went to the Democratic National Committee rather than to \n     the president's campaign organization. The law, the \n     department's career prosecutors say, doesn't apply to soft \n     money, so technically they have no violations to prosecute. \n     And technically that may be so, but of course the point is \n     that in the last campaign the distinction between hard and \n     soft money disappeared. Both parties raised much more hard \n     money than the law allows and merely called it soft to avoid \n     regulation. The Republicans could make that point; it would \n     strengthen their argument for an independent counsel. But \n     they are the last to want soft money regulated. They want a \n     counsel, but not a counsel who might insist on strict \n     enforcement of the campaign finance laws.\n       The whole question of an independent counsel, and of \n     turning what happened last year into a criminal as distinct \n     from a broader civic offense, is to some extent a red \n     herring. We don't mean to suggest that there ought not be a \n     criminal inquiry, and in fact several are going on. An \n     independent counsel continues to look into the sprawl of \n     issues called Whitewater, including whether an effort was \n     made to buy the silence of possible witness and former \n     associate attorney general Webster Hubbell. A Justice \n     Department task force and congressional committees are \n     looking into the fund-raising squalor. If people committed \n     crimes in the course of that fund-raising, they ought to pay \n     the price, whoever they are. And the truth--the full truth--\n     ought to be extracted from them, whether criminal or not.\n       But the churning about the lurid particulars of how that \n     money was raised last year ought not be allowed to take the \n     public eye off the broader questions: What do you do about \n     the solicitation system generally? How do you keep electoral \n     outcomes, and the policy outcomes to which they lead, from \n     being bought? The politicians--both parties--are conducting a \n     kind of mock debate about the lesser issues as a diversion \n     and an alternative to dealing with the central one. That's \n     the ultimate scandal, and they should not be allowed to get \n     away with it.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me just read the last paragraph of \nthis. The editorial basically talks about the way in which Members of \nCongress are very skilled about talking around the edges of this thing: \nForeign contributions are the problem, or the problem is what the White \nHouse did, or what we need is an investigation, or what we need is an \nindependent counsel, or we need investigations--all so you can talk \nabout everything but the need to actually pass reform. This is what \nthey identified, and I thought the last paragraph was effective. As it \nsays:\n\n       But the churning about the lurid particulars of how that \n     money was raised last year ought not to be allowed to take \n     the public eye off the broader questions: What do you do \n     about the solicitation system generally? How do you keep \n     electoral outcomes, and the policy outcomes to which they \n     lead, from being bought? The politicians--both parties--are \n     conducting a kind of mock debate about the lesser issues as a \n     diversion and an alternative to dealing with the central one. \n     That's the ultimate scandal, and they should not be allowed \n     to get away with it.\n\n  Mr. President, I think that is exactly what the Senator from \nMinnesota is referring to, talking around the edges, using the \ncommittee process to avoid talking about what is really going on, the \nneed to change this big money system, and to talk about it on the \nfloor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if my colleague will just yield for one \nother question, another concern, and then I will leave the floor and \nlet him conclude. I wonder whether the Senator from Wisconsin would \nagree with me that--I mean, in, oh, so many ways--what we see happening \nin the country is every election year we see cited the figures: People \nspend more and more money in the campaigns and fewer and fewer people \nparticipate. People are really losing heart.\n  I have said before that I do not see it as corruption as in the \nwrongdoing of individual officeholders. But I see systemic corruption, \nwhere these campaigns have become TV-intensive, relying on huge amounts \nof money and, therefore, you have this huge imbalance of influence and \npower where too\n\n[[Page S4136]]\n\nfew people give way too much of the money that is given, and are given \naccess and influence, and too many people are left out of the loop. \nThis becomes a real problem for a representative democracy because it \nis not true any longer that each person counts as one and only one.\n  So I ask my colleague whether he would agree that it is going to be \nimportant, not just for us to speak 20 minutes a day, but now for us to \nbegin to get together? I ask him whether, as a leader in this effort--\nand he has been a leader of this effort --whether we might really be \nreaching out to other colleagues who feel very strongly about this, who \nreally want people in our country to believe in the political process--\nall of us should want to change this--and get some people together and \ncome out on the floor of the Senate? We are going to keep framing this \nissue and we are going to keep calling for reform and we are going to \nmake it crystal clear that we are not going to let the Senate, or the \nCongress, become a politics of diversion on this.\n  It is fine to identify problems. If some people want to say we do not \nhave disclosure, fine. If some people want to say it is influence of \nforeign money, fine. If some people want to say it is just the rules \nthat have been broken and no more than that, fine. But the people in \nthe country know too much money is spent, there is too much special \naccess, there is too much time spent raising money, and we have to \nbuild the McCain-Feingold bill that is out there. We want to move that \nforward and we want to eventually have an up-or-down vote.\n  Does my colleague agree that we need to start turning up the heat?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Not only do I agree, but I ask the Senator and I make \nsure we reach out to Members of both parties in this body who are \ncosponsors, and others who I think are very interested in reform and \nhave not yet chosen to cosponsor it, to do just that.\n  There are myths about the legislation and about the effort that have \nbeen perpetuated in an effort to make the public ignore the issue, \nthinking it cannot be resolved. But the facts speak differently. There \nhave been newspaper articles indicating that we have fewer cosponsors \nthan last year. That is just false. We have 30 Members of the U.S. \nSenate as cosponsors of this bill. I guess if we do not come out here \non the floor and start to indicate these facts, it is very hard for the \naverage citizen to relate to it.\n  One of the reasons it is hard for them to relate to it is, when they \nstart hearing about $100,000, $200,000 contributions, it is pretty hard \nfor them to feel invited into the process. It is pretty hard for them \nto believe that anything will ever change. They are so used to \nbelieving that this system and this town is dominated by interests and \npowers that they cannot control, that the people of the country, when \nthey are asked in a poll, may not say that campaign finance reform is \nthe No. 1 issue. I think, if you ask them whether they think we ought \nto do the job and whether it is important, of course they would say \nyes. Many would support almost every aspect of the legislation we are \nproposing.\n\n  But, for the average citizen, if you asked them what is their No. 1 \nconcern, what are they going to say? They are going to say, ``We are \nconcerned about our kids' education, we are concerned about crime in \nour neighborhood.'' Those are the things that people should identify, \nshould feel free to identify, and they should not have to worry about a \nsystem that has gone out of control so far away in Washington. That is \nnot the stuff of the daily lives of people in this country. That is not \nwhat it takes to make ends meet.\n  But the fact is, until we clean up this system here, the ability of \nthis Government to assist those families in getting through and making \nends meet will be seriously compromised. When we reach the point that \nMembers of this body get on the floor and say that what the problem is \nis that we do not have enough money in politics, and then we do not \npass a piece of legislation, and then we have an election--we find out \nthe result. More money was spent in these last elections than in any \nother election and we had the lowest voter turnout in 72 years. That is \nnot just a fluke. It is because more and more people are feeling that \nthey are no longer part of a system that is supposedly premised on the \nnotion of one person one vote.\n  So, today begins the effort to speak here on the floor on a regular \nbasis--not just about the McCain-Feingold bill, but about the fact that \nwe are not going to allow this year to pass without an effort to bring \nthis issue back to the floor. Again, my lead author on this bill, the \nSenator from Arizona, Senator McCain--I always have to apologize for \nhis being right and my being wrong last year when he said it would \nprobably take a scandal to get this passed. I said, please, don't say \nthat. I want to get it passed this year. But he was right. It took \nsomething like the abuses of the 1996 election to get people in this \nbody, to get people across the country, to realize that this just is \nnot a quantitative change in what has been happening in elections since \n1974. What happened was a qualitative change, a major change in the way \nin which elections are conducted.\n  Basically, the current election system is falling apart through the \nuse of loopholes and abuses and how much money people are willing to \nraise through soft money and their own campaigns.\n  So our goal here is to make sure everyone knows this issue is not \n``not there.'' It will become one of the dominant issues, not just in \nthe media and the newspapers, as it has been, but it will become one of \nthe dominant issues here in the floor in the not too distant future.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator has 2 minutes 28 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield the remainder of my time and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, what is the order? How much time does \neach Senator have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under a previous order, the Senator from New \nMexico, or his designee, is recognized to speak up to 15 minutes, but \nat 10 o'clock, the order also requires that the bill be laid down.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Also required to do what?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That the pending bill will be laid down. \nTechnically, the Senator from New Mexico has approximately 11 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Domenici and Mr. Wyden pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 718 are located in today's Record under ``Statements \non Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, today I want to recognize one of \nAmerica's great labor leaders--Moe Biller, president of the American \nPostal Workers Union, AFL-CIO--on the occasion of the 60th anniversary \nof his hiring by the Postal Service.\n  On May 8, 1937, Moe Biller was hired as a postal clerk in New York \nCity by what was then called the U.S. Post Office Department, beginning \na long career of service to the American public. At the same time, Moe \nbecame a postal union member and activist--a journey that led him to \nthe presidency of his New York City local in 1959 and then to the \npresidency of the national APWU in 1980.\n  Moe's six decades of service included 2 years during World War II in \nthe Army's Adjutant General Corps from 1943 to 1945, where most of his \nservice was in Northern Ireland. We thank him for this service as well.\n  Moe's steadfast and determined struggle on behalf of all postal \nworkers led to enactment of the Postal Reform Act of 1970. By virtue of \nthat legislation, postal workers were given the right to bargain for \nwages, benefits, and working conditions under the National Labor \nRelations Act. These events also led to the merger of five separate \ncraft unions into the APWU in 1971, an historic event in postal labor \nhistory in which Moe played a leading role.\n\n[[Page S4137]]\n\n  At 81 years young and still going strong, Moe has rightfully been \ncalled the ``dean'' of the American labor movement and is held in high \nregard within the highest councils of the AFL-CIO and its affiliated \nunions. As we wish Moe congratulations on this, his 60th postal \nanniversary, we look forward to many more years of visionary leadership \non his part.\n  Congratulations, Moe Biller.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/08/senate-section/article/S4136-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place add the following:\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, the \n     language on page 39, line 12 through 18 is deemed to read, \n     ``had the Highway Trust Fund fiscal year 1994 income \n     statements not been understated prior to the revision on \n     December 24, 1996: Provided further, That the additional \n     authority shall be distributed to ensure that States shall \n     receive an additional amount of authority in fiscal year 1997 \n     and that the authority be distributed in the manner provided \n     in section 310 of Public Law 104-205 (110 Stat. 2969):''.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask the indulgence of the Senate. I have \na little hoarseness this morning, but I will do my very best.\n  Mr. President, this is an amendment offered by the Senator from \nVirginia, together with the Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham]. And we \nentitle it simply a ``fairness amendment.''\n  I hesitate to take on the wisdom of the distinguished chairman and \nthe distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, but I \ndo so out of a sense of fairness toward all 50 States.\n  Mr. President, the amendment relates to the bill's provision \naffecting the distribution of $933 million in additional--I point out, \nadditional--obligation authority in the Federal Highway Program to the \n50 States. A small part of this funding is fully justified. It provides \nto correct the mistake made by the Department of Treasury in 1994 in \nunderestimating gas tax receipts into the highway trust fund.\n  As a result of this mistake, 10 States did not receive their correct \napportionment of Federal highway dollars in 1996. And I fully agree and \ncommend the Appropriations Committee in its efforts to make whole these \nfew States, 10 in number, who received less than they should have in \n1996 dollars.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Graham and I, however, ensures that \nthese 10 States are compensated as was intended by the Appropriations \nCommittee and as they are legally entitled to be compensated, and in \nthe amount of funds that they should have received in that fiscal year.\n  The Appropriations Committee, however, then provides an additional \n$793 million for this fiscal year and directs how these funds should be \ndistributed among the several States. The distribution of these \nadditional funds--$793 million--is in direct conflict, Mr. President, \ndirect conflict, with the distribution formulas contained in the \ncurrent law that is ISTEA passed in 1991, the Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act of 1991, and amounts to nothing more than \nchanging the rules right in the middle of a very--and I emphasize, a \nvery--conscientious, bipartisan effort by the U.S. Senate to rework a \nfuture piece of legislation to succeed the 1991 ISTEA Act.\n  The amendment Senator Graham and I offer is very simple, Mr. \nPresident. Our amendment states that the $793 million in obligational \nauthority provided by the Appropriations Committee will be distributed \naccording to current law, ISTEA 1991. I just wish to repeat that. We \nhave a law carefully crafted in 1991. And all that we ask in this \namendment is that this $793 million be allocated to the States in \naccordance with existing law.\n  Mr. President, as the chairman of the Transportation Subcommittee of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee, I am leading a bipartisan \neffort--Senator Max Baucus is the distinguished ranking member of that \ncommittee--working together with all of the members on the committee to \nachieve a successor piece of legislation to ISTEA 1991.\n  We have held 10 hearings this year on various issues relating to \nISTEA. Four major bills--I repeat, four major bills--have been \nintroduced regarding the successor piece of legislation to ISTEA 1991, \nincluding one that Senator Graham and I are cosponsoring. Certainly \nestablishing fair distribution formulas that recognize the differing \nregional goals of the country will be a matter of extensive discussion. \nIt will not be an easy task to provide adequate funding to address the \nmany legitimate transportation needs that exist today.\n  I stipulate, Mr. President, there are many, an overwhelming number of \nneeds in transportation today. And it is very difficult for Senators to \nreach their determination as to how to vote on this knowing that in \nevery Senator's State there are crying needs for money today. But what \nSenator Graham and I are doing is asking that the Senate stick with its \nprocess, respect the authority given to the authorizing committees to \nwork through legislative matters in a conscientious, bipartisan way, \nwhich we are doing, to try and reach and craft a bill to succeed ISTEA \n1991.\n  A part of that consideration will be whether or not we do change the \nvery formula that I am recommending to the Senate in this amendment, \nthe very formula in ISTEA 1991. I happen to be on the side that thinks \nchanges should be made. But there is honest difference of opinion among \nthe 50 States. But let us leave it to the process that is underway--\nwith 10 hearings--in an effort to resolve those disputes.\n  Mr. President, I have been one who has been critical of ISTEA 1991's \nformula. I believe they fail to reflect the current use or demands of \nour current transportation system. There are many archaic base points \non which that formula rests. And we hope to change that. It is my hope \nthat during the reauthorization of ISTEA, the subcommittee will devise \na more fair distribution of Federal highway dollars based on needs and \nuse of our transportation system.\n  At this time however, when our States are in the last year of the \n1991 ISTEA, it is not in the best interests of the U.S. Senate to set a \nnew distribution formula. And that is precisely what the inclusion in \nthe bill does by the Appropriations Committee.\n  I know that my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee will try to \npersuade Senators that the bill's provision only attempts to ensure \nthat each State's 1997 funding level is equivalent to what each State \nreceived in 1996.\n\n[[Page S4138]]\n\nThey claim that somehow the distribution of funds in 1997 is a mistake \nthat must be corrected in this bill.\n  Mr. President, the distribution of highway funds for this fiscal year \nis no mistake. For the first time, the allocation of funds in 1997 \ncomes closer to providing States with a true 90-percent return on every \ndollar sent to the highway trust fund, a commitment made to every donor \nState when ISTEA was passed in 1991.\n  Mr. President, this is 1997. Why should funding in this bill be \ndistributed based on 1996 factors? It does not make good common sense. \nThe provision in the bill will produce a major change in the way ISTEA \n1991 distributed funds at the beginning of this fiscal year.\n  Our States already have received funds for this fiscal year based on \nthe current law, ISTEA 1991. I see no reason why we need to set new \nformulas to distribute this additional funding to our States, to change \nthe rules in the middle of the game.\n  Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to adopt the Warner-Graham \namendment. Our amendment is simply fair play. It compensates those \nStates who lost funds due to a clerical error, and more importantly \ndistributes the balance of $793 million according to the current law, \nISTEA 1991.\n  Let us save the formula debate for where it belongs, and that is in \nthe careful consideration being given in the course of deliberations of \nthe authorizing committee. And eventually our bill will come to the \nfloor.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am going to make a rather technical \nstatement here now about this amendment, and I hope Senators will \nlisten to it. I will put a chart in the Record and put that chart on \neveryone's desk.\n  Last night I served notice that we are not going to permit this \namendment to take the whole time today. We are going to finish this \nbill today. And as soon as a reasonable amount of debate has taken \nplace, I intend to move to table this amendment. If we are going to \nfinish here tonight in the time that both leaders have urged us to do--\nit is a matter of courtesy.\n  If the Senate will remember, last week at this time we finished a \nbill in time for our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to \nattend an annual meeting together. Ours starts tonight--early tomorrow \nmorning really. But we are going to finish this bill tonight.\n  This is one of the amendments that could be debated all day. We took \nover a day when we debated this matter last year. So let me just state \nthis. And I know the Senator from New Mexico wants to add to what I \nhave to say. And I shall urge him to interrupt me at any time he wants \nto do so, but without my losing my right to the floor.\n  I understand the interest of the Senator from the State of Virginia \nin offering the amendment today to the supplemental. It is a \nnonemergency transportation title to the supplemental appropriations \nbill before us. I want to make sure that he and the Senator from \nFlorida and the Senate know how this additional funding became part of \nthe supplemental appropriations bill.\n  The matter arises out of a Treasury Department error made in 1994 \nwhich was finally corrected last year in recording the gas tax receipts \nfrom the States for the fiscal year 1994. The Treasury initially \nmisallocated $1.6 billion to 1995, which should have been credited to \n1994. In turn, that created a distribution of obligation limitations to \nthe States for 1997 that was in error. We did not make that error. The \nTreasury Department made that error.\n  When that error was discovered, to the credit of the Senator from New \nMexico--the administration originally indicated that they lacked the \nstatutory authority to correct the distribution. Eventually, the \nadministration was persuaded that it did have in fact the authority to \nmake the change but only after the Senate had a very divisive vote on \nthis issue, as the Senate will recall.\n  Accordingly, the fiscal year 1998 budget request from the President \nrequests $318 million for 24 States to fulfill the erroneous \nexpectations that were generated by publishing the 1997 obligation \nlimitation allocation to the States. Again, let me say the President \nwants to fulfill the erroneous expectations based on the Treasury \nDepartment error.\n  What we did in Appropriations was provide the $318 million requested \nby the administration. Then we provided the $139 million that the \nSenator's amendment from the State of Virginia references. This is the \nadditional obligational authority that results from a correction in the \n1994 account stemming from the same Treasury error. The additional $139 \nmillion in funds go to only 10 States.\n  Finally, we provided an additional $475 million to make whole the 29 \nStates whose 1997 apportionment of obligation limitation was below the \n1996 apportionment bringing them back up to their 1996 level.\n  The chart I placed on every Member's desk from the Highway \nAdministration shows that the only winners from 1996 to 1997, were in \nfact the so-called donor States.\n  What the Senator from Virginia's amendment would do is to further \nincrease the obligation limitation for the donor States, and push the \n27 States back below their 1996 apportionment level. What the Senator's \namendment will do, in part, is validate the error made by the Treasury \nDepartment.\n\n  From 1997 to 1998 there is a $1.358 billion increase in the \nobligation limitation for highway funds. And every single penny of that \nincrease goes to the donor States. Every nondonor State is effectively \nfrozen at their 1996 level by the supplemental approach and would be \npushed below that level by the Senator's amendment.\n  Some would argue that in a growing program no State should be \nexpected to receive less than it received in the prior year. What the \namendment before us now argues, that the $1.358 billion increase for a \nminority of States is not enough, that other States' programs should \nshrink so these so-called donor State programs can grow at even faster \nrates based upon an error that is now admitted by the Treasury \nDepartment.\n  That is hard for this Senator to understand. And it is impossible for \nthis Senator individually or as chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee to support.\n  In short, we have provided an almost $1 billion increase in the \nobligation limitation. It is roughly split between donor and nondonor \nStates. It is, in my opinion, a fair and equitable approach based upon \nthe calculations by the Federal Highway Administration, and it is \nsomething that I support personally as well as support by virtue of \nbeing the chairman of the committee bringing this report before the \nSenate.\n  By comparison, the amendment before us of the Senator from Virginia \nwould have the $139 million for the 10 States paid out, and then the \nbalance of the $933 million go through the formula, an approach which \nwould leave 27 States below their 1996 obligation levels. Now, to bring \nthe 50 States up to their 1996 obligation levels through the formula, \nit takes a $2.4 billion increase in obligation limitations.\n  Now, I have to say, as a Senator that represents the largest State of \nthe Union, my heart is heavy right now about the arguments we had \nyesterday, and I intend to say more about that today. But my State is \nthe largest State in the Union, and if every State is supposed to get \nback the specific percentage of taxes, user fees and royalties paid \ninto the highway fund, my State would like to get back all of the \nFederal taxes and royalties paid by producers of oil from our State.\n  This donor-donee-State business leaves us cold. Just think where we \nwould be if every decision made by our Founding Fathers had been held \nto the test of whether their individual States received the precise \npercentage of revenue from every source that it paid into the Treasury. \nThere would have been no expansion of the United States. The debate \nover donor-donee diverts the Congress from the real issue of the \nhighway program. The Eisenhower vision was a national network of \nhighways and then a network of superhighways. People ought to read \nEisenhower's book. As a young colonel he tried to take a brigade across \nthe country, as I am sure the occupant of the chair knows, and found he \ncould not get there from here. He had to keep going up and down rivers \nto find places to go across, and the highways were\n\n[[Page S4139]]\n\nnot connected. Eisenhower's commitment, really, in running for \nPresident was to link this country together with a highway system, and \nhe succeeded.\n  Now, this vision could never have been achieved on a donor-donee \nconcept. The Federal highway system would not exist if such a concept \nhad been controlling in President Eisenhower's time. People would not \nbe driving through Texas or Virginia unless there were, in fact, \nhighways paid for by revenue collected from other States.\n  We need to get back to the idea that the highway system is to tie the \ncountry together and to provide the infrastructure that makes America \nmore competitive in international markets. It reduces congestion, it \nmakes trips on our highways more safe, and it provides the necessary \ninvestment for transportation infrastructure to foster economic growth \nin this country.\n  Mr. President, in short, the donor-donee theory has the potential to \ndestroy the promise of the national highway system. Further, the \nphilosophy that drive the donor-donee debate will lead many of us to \ncome back and tell Congress, what about the money we paid into the \nTreasury from which we received no benefit, none at all, those of us \nwho come from the States that produce the oil that provided the \nfeedstocks to make the gasoline that fuels our automobiles?\n  Now, we produce 25 percent of that in one State. Twenty-five percent \nof all the domestic production comes from Alaska. We have never said \ngive us back every dime we paid, that the oil industry pays, into the \nTreasury on that oil.\n  I say to my friend from Virginia I could not be more insistent. \nAgain, I ask the Senators to look at the chart I have provided. The \ndonor-donee theory leads to winners and losers. Our bill leads to \nequity. It corrects the error of the Treasury Department and it \nrestores the 1996 levels to all States. It does so fairly, while at the \nsame time giving the donor States what the President has requested, and \nmore, to both fulfill the erroneous decision of the Treasury Department \nand to correct the accounting error.\n\n  I want to ask my friend from New Mexico, Mr. President, if he has any \ncorrections to make to the statement I just made.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President and fellow Senators, let me ask if you \nwill let others speak, and I will return in about 15 minutes with the \ndocumentation as to how all this happened so that we can present the \nbest possible case. I will do that very, very shortly.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I say to the Senator, we made a commitment last night \nthat we would move to table this amendment sometime around 9:30. We \nwere not specific. If we are to get to the other portions of this bill, \nincluding the Senators from Texas, from Arizona, the Senator from \nNevada, if we are going to get through those long amendments that \npertain to items in the bill concerning money and legislation, we are \ngoing to have to get some time limit on amendments. I am serving notice \nas chairman that when I believe we have reached the point of having \nequitable distribution of comments on this subject, I am going to move \nto table it, and I am going to do the same thing with other amendments \ntoday until we get to the point where some of them will have to have \nup-or-down votes.\n  As far as I am concerned, this is an amendment that seeks unfairness, \nand I shall seek to table it at the appropriate time. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \namendment offered by Senators Warner and Graham.\n  I want to emphasize that the situation before us today is not a new \none. It started in 1994, when the Department of Treasury made a \nclerical error in determining the amount of money going out to the \nStates from the highway trust fund. This accounting error changed the \ndistribution of highway funds in 1996 and 1997.\n  In late July of last year, during consideration of the Department of \nTransportation Appropriations bill, Senator Baucus and I tried to fix \nthis error. Our amendment would have required that the funds be \ndistributed as if the accounting error had never happened. We thought \nthis was an honest and fair way to deal with this problem.\n  Unfortunately, this amendment was strongly opposed by some of our \ncolleagues even though it was a fair and even-handed solution to a \ntechnical accounting error. As most of my colleagues are aware, votes \non highway funds are often determined according to how each Senator \nthinks his or her individual State fares, and the vote last year was no \ndifferent.\n  Since last July, the Departments of Treasury and Transportation have \ncorrected the error. That should have been the end of the story, but, \nfor some reason, the President has requested an additional $318 million \nto compensate the 24 States that would have received additional funds \nhad the error been left in place. I think it is unfortunate that the \nadministration, which made the accounting error in the first place, has \nreopened this issue, by seeking a supplemental appropriation. This \nissue has been needlessly divisive and, in seeking to have it both \nways, the administration's decision has reopened old wounds.\n  The Appropriations Committee has included not only the \nadministration's request, but also $139 million to fully compensate \nStates that did not receive their share of 1996 funds because the error \nwas not corrected until 1997. In addition, the Committee has included \n$475 million for 31 States to bring their 1997 limitation up to 1996 \nlevels. While I disagree with the decision to include the $318 million \nrequested in the first place, I believe that the committee's inclusion \nof additional funds reflects the fairest compromise available to make \nall States whole.\n  The proponents of the amendment before us argue that the additional \nfunds included by the Appropriations Committee contradict ISTEA \nformulas, giving an unfair advantage to 29 States. When the shoe was on \nthe other foot and we argued that it was unfair for some States to \nreceive a benefit from a bureaucratic error, our argument fell on deaf \nears. Mr. President, this claim of unfairness today rings hollow.\n  The additional funds provided by the Appropriations Committee hardly \ngives an unfair advantage to 29 States. In fact, the only States that \nactually receive additional funds in 1997, when compared to 1996, are \nthe so-called donor States that are offering the amendment before us \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, this is an issue that, in my opinion, was resolved \nafter the administration initially fixed its error last December. \nUnfortunately, the administration has reopened this complicated issue. \nThe Appropriations Committee has developed a fair solution to a \ndifficult problem and they should be congratulated. I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose this amendment and support the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  While we are focused on the distribution of funds to the States I \nwould like to say a few words about the formulas in the context of \nISTEA reauthorization. I realize that some Members of this body believe \nthat the current formulas that distribute highway funds are neither \nfair nor appropriate. Many Members argue that various factors, such as \ninterstate highway mileage, State population, highway trust fund \ncontributions, and the number of deficient bridges should be given \ngreater weight or importance in the distribution formula. I think we \ncan all agree that we have a long and difficult task before us in \ndetermining the appropriate formula for the next ISTEA. I therefore \nurge my colleagues to make every effort to work with, rather than \nagainst, one another in crafting a fair distribution formula that \nbenefits the States and the national system alike. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the Warner-\nGraham amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want to assure the distinguished manager \nof the bill, it is not the intention of this Senator nor the cosponsors \nof my amendment to unduly delay the very important work that remains to \nbe done on this supplemental appropriation, but to enable Senators to \nfocus in on the narrowness of this issue. I wonder if I might ask a \nquestion or two of\n\n[[Page S4140]]\n\nmy distinguished colleague from Alaska, and then I would hope my \ncosponsor, the distinguished Senator from Florida, could have the \nopportunity to address the Senator. I will be brief in my questions.\n  First, Mr. President, I ask the distinguished manager of the bill, \nwhat was the dollar figure, in your estimate, of the needed amount of \nmoney to correct an error by the U.S. Treasury? We all acknowledge this \nexisted. It is the estimate of the Senator from Virginia that it was \n$139 million.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we provided $318 million as requested by \nthe administration. The $139 million that the Senator from Virginia \nreferences was to correct the basic error. The additional $475 million \nwas to make whole the States in 1997 whose obligation limitation was \nunder the 1996 level to bring it to what it was in 1996.\n  So there are two functions to the error. As far as the 1997 levels, \nthe $475 million, it is not involved. That is to bring up their \napportionment, bring them back up to the 1996 level. The $475 million \nmakes the 29 States whose obligation limit was below their 1996 \nappropriation--it brings them up to the 1996 level in 1997.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we have an honest difference of opinion. \nIt was clear it was a $139 million error that needed adjustment. I \ncommend the Appropriations Committee for seeking that adjustment.\n  I then asked my distinguished colleague, was there any request from \nthe administration for dollars over and above the $139 million, and was \nnot the addition of $700-odd million simply a discretionary decision \nmade by the Appropriations Committee?\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is not so. The $475 million is tied to the $318 \nmillion. If we grant the administration's requested $318 million, we \nmust put in the $475 million. The $139 million is to correct totally \nfor the original error. The $318 million asked for by the \nadministration effectively perpetuates the error unless we put in the \n$475 million to equate the $318 million. It is 2 years. We are \ncorrecting the 1996 allocation on the $139 million. We are correcting \nthe 1997 allocation based on $318 million requested by the \nadministration and by the $475 million to provide that no State receive \nless in 1997 than they did in 1996. The $475 million goes with the $318 \nmillion.\n  Mr. WARNER. I respectfully ask my distinguished chairman, can you \nshow us any documentation where the administration, in writing, came up \nwith a request over and above $139 million?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The administration only requested $318 million. It did \nnot request $139 million or $475 million. It requested $318 million. \nBut if we grant the $318 million, we must put in the $475 million, and \nas long as we do it we must correct the basic error, the $139 million \nthat came from the original error of the Treasury Department, but we \nwill perpetuate the error of the Treasury Department by providing the \n$318 million unless we provide the $475 million.\n  Mr. WARNER. There was a clear error of $139 million that had to be \ncorrected. The Appropriations Committee did it. Then they went on their \nown initiative to add a very substantial sum of money and devised an \nentirely new formula--an entirely new formula--which brings further \ninequity between the donor-donee States.\n\n  I wish to conclude that I do not suggest that this debate engulf the \nlatitude of all the arguments on donor-donee. We ought to sit down and \nprecisely focus on two points, in my judgment. There was a $139 million \nerror. It was corrected by the Appropriations Committee. All the added \ndollars were put in, presumably at the request of the chairman and \nranking member or others on the committee, and then they came up with a \nnew formula as to how to allocate the funds, and in doing that not only \ncreate a new formula, but they further exacerbated the friction that \nexists between donor and donee States. I suggest that debate between \ndonor-donee be reserved for the authorizing process which is going on \nnow in a very conscientious, bipartisan way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator asked me a question and I want to answer \nthat. The Senator from Florida is recognized. Do you permit me to \nanswer?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I yield.\n  Mr. STEVENS. As the chairman of the Public Works Committee, Senator \nChafee, points out in his statement, in July of last year they tried to \ncorrect this error from the Treasury Department.\n  The Senator from Virginia, if he looks at the chart before the \nSenate, will see that if we make the changes solely requested by the \nSenator from Virginia, all donor states would end up with all zero \ngrowth from 1996 to 1997. All those zeros in the first column show the \ninequity of not doing the $475 million. Because the inequity, if we \nprovide $318 million to one part of this package without the $475 \nmillion, would create a total inequity as far as all those States that \nhave no growth in their allocation over 1996. I am referring to all \nthose States that have zeros in the first column. If the Senator would \nlook at it, he will see why we felt compelled, if we grant the \nPresident's request of $318 million, to provide the $475 million. No \none argues about the $139 million even though it was not requested by \nthe administration. I do not think there is an argument about the $139 \nmillion. It was a result of the Treasury error. To perpetuate the error \nis to grant the $318 million the President requested without adding the \n$475 million.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would the distinguished Senator from Florida yield for a \nunanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a statement \nby the Federal Highway Administration explaining the Warner-Graham \namendment and the allocation showing that no States lose money under \nour formula be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                $139M\n                                            Appropriations  supplemental\n                  States                       Committee     and current\n                                                              law ISTEA\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlabama...................................     20,931,160     27,292,041\nAlaska....................................     16,374,848      9,068,976\nArizona...................................     12,007,562     14,358,753\nArkansas..................................      6,506,921      9,605,618\nCalifornia................................     50,711,555     70,850,325\nColorado..................................     13,192,342      8,999,536\nConnecticut...............................     23,056,356     16,072,332\nDelaware..................................      5,020,775      3,512,696\nDist. of Col..............................      3,216,819      3,665,346\nFlorida...................................     51,668,920     59,854,580\nGeorgia...................................     56,862,527     61,842,097\nHawaii....................................      7,713,831      5,514,843\nIdaho.....................................      4,176,763      4,911,625\nIllinois..................................     43,905,951     29,939,952\nIndiana...................................     11,674,082     18,528,503\nIowa......................................     13,151,501      8,933,482\nKansas....................................     13,420,087      9,287,767\nKentucky..................................     29,879,840     34,997,622\nLouisiana.................................      7,240,399     12,263,724\nMaine.....................................      6,215,750      4,134,434\nMaryland..................................     17,046,628     12,066,857\nMassachusetts.............................     55,007,226     30,790,454\nMichigan..................................     14,747,139     24,046,968\nMinnesota.................................     25,850,795     10,945,036\nMississippi...............................      5,314,543      9,493,034\nMissouri..................................      9,678,737     18,475,358\nMontana...................................     17,336,799      6,649,719\nNebraska..................................      9,062,950      6,287,862\nNevada....................................      6,986,045      4,722,196\nNew Hampshire.............................      5,593,764      3,870,801\nNew Jersey................................     31,951,953     21,707,256\nNew Mexico................................     14,156,168      7,490,446\nNew York..................................     68,567,888     47,466,766\nNorth Carolina............................     15,054,880     20,928,680\nNorth Dakota..............................      6,767,361      4,611,365\nOhio......................................      7,201,580     30,813,304\nOklahoma..................................      7,096,552     12,186,183\nOregon....................................      6,897,405      9,562,721\nPennsylvania..............................     16,916,047     32,012,823\nRhode Island..............................     10,961,636      3,626,100\nSouth Carolina............................     18,202,593     21,535,023\nSouth Dakota..............................      7,365,019      5,032,297\nTennessee.................................      9,427,283     17,712,897\nTexas.....................................     64,694,961     81,339,014\nUtah......................................      8,225,843      5,681,774\nVermont...................................      5,121,469      3,653,502\nVirginia..................................     13,986,103     18,263,736\nWashington................................     24,012,512     14,519,372\nWest Virginia.............................     10,738,625      7,159,768\nWisconsin.................................     10,167,297     18,529,708\nWyoming...................................      7,299,340      5,030,652\nPuerto Rico...............................      4,917,614      3,439,923\n                                           -----------------------------\n      Total...............................    933,172,744    933,172,744\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this has been an illuminating discussion \nto an admittedly complex question. So, without being redundant, I will \nstep back to see if we can sort out what are the issues in agreement \nand what are the issues upon which we disagree.\n  One area in which there is agreement, agreement both in the \nunderlying supplemental appropriations bill and in the amendment that \nis offered by my colleague from Virginia, myself, and others, is that \nthe $139 million, which was an admitted error of arithmetic basis in \nthe Department of the Treasury, should be corrected. There are States \nwhich received less funds than they should have received because of \nthat admitted error. I think there is virtual unanimous agreement that \nwe should correct that error. We will do so. Whichever position we take \non this amendment, $139 million will flow to those States which were \nthe object of that inadvertent omission.\n\n[[Page S4141]]\n\n  The second question upon which there is agreement is that the total \nfunds for surface transportation should be increased in this \nsupplemental appropriations bill beyond the $139 million, and there is \nbasic agreement that the amount of that increase should be \napproximately $800 million. Both the underlying bill and the amendment \nprovide for the allocation of an additional $800 million beyond the \n$139 million necessary to correct the error.\n  The issue becomes how that $800 million should be structured and what \nis the rationale for the $800 million. A portion of that $800 million, \nroughly $318 million, represents those States which had been given an \nexpectation of what they would have received--a false expectation, \nbased on that arithmetic error and acted upon that expectation. They \nthought they were going to get an additional $4 or $5 million because \nof the arithmetic error, and they calculated that into their State \nhighway fund.\n  Question: Should the Federal Government, even though it was in error, \nit was a false expectation, but it was a communicated expectation and \nit was an expectation upon which the States took action, be responsible \nfor those funds? I think that is a debatable issue.\n  The third portion of this debate has to do with the remaining $475 \nmillion. Let me say at this point--and I mean no disrespect to any \ncomments made thus far--this has absolutely nothing to do with the \nissue of the arithmetic error. I repeat that it has nothing to do with \nthe issue of the arithmetic error. I cite as my authority for that, \nfirst, the supplemental appropriations bill itself, on page 39, lines \n12 through 18, which clearly outline that the purpose of these funds \nis, notwithstanding any other provisions of law, such additional \nauthority shall be distributed to assure that no State shall receive an \namount in fiscal year 1997 that is less than the amount they received \nin 1996.\n  That doesn't have anything to do with an arithmetic error. That has \nto do with providing a hold-harmless provision in this supplemental \nappropriations bill, which was not provided in the ISTEA Act of 1991.\n  Mr. President, if we could briefly go back to that legislation, that \nlegislation contained the allocation of some $120 billion of Federal \nfunds to the States and territories for surface transportation. It was \na very contentious bill, as all of these bills tend to be. It contained \na provision for those States that had traditionally received back \nsubstantially less than they had contributed to the highway funds, that \nin the last year of the 6 years of ISTEA authorization, which is fiscal \nyear 1997, there would be inserted a 90-percent floor--that is, that no \nState, in the last year of the 6 years of ISTEA, would get back less \nthan 90 percent of what it contributed to the highway fund. That 90 \npercent standard had been the holy grail of those States that had, in \nthe past, gotten back substantially less than 90 percent.\n  We had attempted, frankly, to get that standard applied in every year \nof the 1991 ISTEA bill. But politically unable to do that, the \ncompromise was that, in the last year, that objective would be \nachieved. Since we are dealing with a zero-sum amount of money--that \nis, there is a fixed amount of money to be distributed in 1997, \nobviously some States had to get less in 1997 than they got in 1996 in \norder for other States to be brought up to this 90-percent floor. That \nwas understood, that was part of the negotiation, that was part of the \ncommon understanding of the Congress and President Bush when he signed \nthis legislation in 1991.\n  That is the issue that the $475 million goes to. It has nothing to do \nwith the arithmetic error made in the Department of the Treasury. What \nthis $475 million essentially says is that we are going to pour $475 \nmillion of additional Federal money, beyond that which had been \ncontemplated in 1991, into the ISTEA program and specifically into a \npolicy that will assure that, regardless of what the law said that we \npassed in 1991, we are going to guarantee that we are not playing with \na zero-sum game, because no State will get less in 1997 than the State \nreceived in 1996.\n  Now, that is the issue that this amendment raises. What this \namendment says is that if we are going to provide these additional \nfunds beyond that which is required to correct the arithmetic error, we \nshould be faithful to the law that we passed in 1991 and we should \ndistribute that money under the provisions of the law that is already \nthe law of the land and will govern the distribution of highway funds \nin 1991.\n  Mr. President, I believe that is an extremely important and clarion \ncall for fundamental fairness. We had this debate in 1991. We decided \non the compromise, which is the essence of the congressional process, \nthat a 90-percent floor concept would be available, but only in the \nlast year. Now, in the last hours of the life of ISTEA, we are about to \nvitiate that understanding. It is fair because those States which have \ntraditionally been substantially donor States--that is, they sent more \nmoney to Washington than they got back--this represents an \nopportunity--we are not going to say that all States are going to get \n100 percent of their money; we are going to say that no State will get \nless than 90-percent of its money.\n\n  Now, frankly, Mr. President, I do not support the principle that all \nStates should get 100 percent, because I recognize exactly what the \nSenator from Alaska is saying. We are dealing with a national surface \ntransportation system, and there are rational reasons why some States, \nsuch as the very large geographic areas, get a certain amount. The \nsmall-population State of Alaska should get back more than other States \nin order to be able to maintain an equivalent level of their \ncontribution to a National Highway System. But that was the essence of \nthe debate that we had in 1991, and we came to this resolution that we \nshould establish, in the last year of the 6-year authorization, this \nprinciple of a 90-percent floor. That principle is about to be violated \nby pouring $475 million into this program in its final weeks of \nexistence in order to assure that no State will get less than it got in \n1996.\n  So, Mr. President, for fundamental fairness to the Nation, to the \nfundamental credibility of this very important program of Federal-State \npartnership for the mobility needs of America, I urge that we adopt the \namendment that has been offered by the Senator from Virginia, that we \nfocus on the issue that this amendment raises, which is not an issue of \narithmetic perfection, it is an issue of fairness protection. We \narrived at how these funds should be allocated. We should stick with \nthe agreement that we have. We should not, in a supplemental \nappropriations bill, on May 8, attempt to change it. So, Mr. President, \nI urge adoption of the amendment offered, and I commend my colleague \nfrom Virginia for the leadership provided.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to join with my friend and \ncolleagues from Florida and Virginia, in stating my strong support for \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. President, let me state, at the outset, I wish we had an \namendment that would strike the $793 million that was added on in the \nAppropriations Committee. In my opinion, it does not belong in this so-\ncalled urgent supplemental. I have been wondering, how does this bill \ngrow from about $4.6 billion to almost $8 billion, about $793 million \nare in roads and highways. You think, if they are going to put in more \nfor roads and highways--I am not contesting the $139 million; I don't \nguess anybody is. But the additional $793 million, I am contesting. \nAgain, I think the proper motion would be to strike it, and somebody \nsays, why aren't you doing that, because we have cloture? I understand \nfrom the Parliamentarian that that motion to strike is not in order. \nMaybe I should have gotten that amendment in at an earlier time, and I \nregret that.\n  At least the amendment of the Senator from Virginia says, if we are \ngoing to have the additional $793 million, let's allocate it according \nto existing law. We have spent days on this floor fighting allocation \nformulas. A lot of us are not satisfied with those. We end up sending a \nlot more to Washington, DC, in roads and highway taxes than we get \nback. And then we look at the amendment that comes out of the \nAppropriations Committee and say, well, this makes it worse. We don't \nreally find that acceptable.\n  So I just make the comment that, really, the $793 million should be \nallocated according to the formulas we have agreed to. It should not be \nchanged to the disadvantage of many States. We are going to fight the \nallocation of the formula fight again this\n\n[[Page S4142]]\n\nyear, in this Congress, on the ISTEA bill. We will have plenty of time \nto debate it and time for the committees. The chairman of the \nTransportation Subcommittee, Senator Warner, and his committee will \nmark up that bill. We will have it on the floor. Every Senator will \nhave a chance to have their input on that. That is the way we should \nfight for the allocation process. We should not be changing it on a \nsupplemental--``urgent supplemental''--appropriations bill. It doesn't \nbelong here. I urge the conferees, since the motion to strike is not in \norder, to drop everything in conference except for the $139 million. \nThis urgent supplemental, in my opinion, is getting loaded with a lot \nof things we can't afford, and maybe we are not legislating in the \nproper way. We should not be doing this on an appropriations bill. We \nshould be doing it on the authorization bills.\n  So I urge my colleagues, at the minimum, if we are going to put in \nadditional money, let's allocate it according to existing law, as \nSenator Warner provided in his amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it isn't too often in the Senate that a \nchairman of a committee gets a chance to play Solomon and be fair. But \nSenator Stevens got a chance to do that, and that is what he did in \nthis bill. He decided--and we should all listen carefully--to be fair. \nLet me tell you the history of half of this problem. The reason I \nhappen to know about it is because I caught the error. The U.S. \nTreasury Department does calculations upon which the formula is based. \nIn 1994, they made a mistake, just literally made an error in their \ncalculations. Guess what happened? A whole series of States, including \nthe States of the Senator from California and the Senator from Texas, \nand some other States, were euphoric because they got a huge windfall \nannounced in their formula--a huge windfall. Well, when a batch of \nStates get a windfall, a batch of States get less and I happen to be \none of those. I don't get very much anyway, but I looked and said, how \ncould this be? What happened? We had a formula and the money was \ndistributed differently for some reason. Now, for a little while, \nnobody from the administration wanted to talk about it. But that didn't \nlast very long because Senator D'Amato and Senator Bingaman from New \nMexico joined with me and asked none other than the Treasurer of the \nUnited States to come to the office and bring his legal counsel.\n  We asked the transportation leader--the head man from the executive--\n``Come and bring your solicitor.'' And, before they left the room, they \nsaid, ``We will get back to you.'' And, before the day passed, they \ncalled and said, ``We made a mistake. It has nothing to do with what \npeople were entitled to. We made a mistake.'' But they said, ``Isn't it \ntough? This is an election year. And Texas just thought they were going \nto get 100 and some million dollars more than last year. What would you \nlike us to do?'' We said, ``Fix it.''\n  Now we have another batch of lawyers. ``Can you fix it?'' Imagine. \n``You unfixed it, but can you fix it?'' They concluded that it could be \nfixed. But it didn't get fixed until after the election. And fix it \nthey did.\n  Senator Stevens in this bill properly has $318 million that goes to \nthose States that thought they were going to get the higher allocation \nbut didn't because of the error, and we are giving it to them anyway. \nSpeaking of fairness, there is $318 million going to States who \nshouldn't have gotten it because this is acknowledging that we are \ngoing to pay them under an erroneous formula. We gave them back the \nmoney under an erroneous formula and said, ``Let's be fair.'' That is \nhalf of this issue.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question at \nsome point?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure, any time.\n  Mr. WARNER. How about now?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say most respectfully that we are \noperating a debate to try to confuse people. Let me see if I can put \nforward a simple fact to seek clarity.\n  There was an error. We all acknowledge it. But, Mr. President, the \nerror was not in the law. It was in the bean counts. The Senator from \nNew Mexico is the chief bean counter, as chairman of the Budget \nCommittee. It was the person running the green eyeshades, the \ncalculators, the computers, adding, subtracting, and interpreting the \nlaw. They interpreted the law wrong. The law was not in error. It was \nthe people running the calculators.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. But those States would have gotten less money had the \nlaw been applied properly. So the law was not applied properly.\n  So, which is wrong, the law, or the lack of proficiencies in its \napplication?\n  Mr. WARNER. I would say the law is correct. It was passed by the \nCongress, and once we caught the error in the calculating and counting \nthe beans, we corrected it. It is only $139 million.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the rest of this bill has to do with \nanother thing. That is why I said--and the distinguished chairman is \nplaying solidly--there is a portion of the highway bill under ISTEA, a \nprovision called 90 Percent of Payments. Everybody that had anything to \ndo with this bill, dig it up, go look at what everyone thought would \nhappen to that. Nobody thought there would be very much money under \nthis program. In fact, there are some throw sheets showing it was a \nvery small amount of money in there. But guess what happened? We \ntransferred the 2\\1/2\\-cent gasoline tax that we never expected to, and \nthat fund, never expecting that money, is now bloated, and as a result \nit is giving States additional money.\n  So our friend from Texas said, let's be fair. Let's be fair, and make \nsure that States like New Mexico--and, incidentally, 27 others--there \nare 27 winners. If you want to pay winners and losers, there are 27 \nwinners under Stevens. I hope you don't vote for it just because it is \na winner. But that happens around here every now and then, and 27 is \nmore than one-half of 50.\n  So I would assume, if you want to vote what is best for your State, \nvote for 1997. In addition, the committee has included $475 million for \n31 States to bring their 1997 limitation to 1996 levels. While I \ndisagree with the decision to include the $318 million requested in the \nfirst place, I believe the committee's inclusion of additional funds \nreflects the fairest compromise available to make to the States as a \nwhole.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, as chairman of the Transportation \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I want to briefly state my views on the \nWarner amendment.\n  Let me first make it clear that I represent a donor State. From 1992 \nto 1995, Alabama only received about 78 cents back for every dollar it \nsent to Washington in gasoline taxes. Other States, like Massachusetts \nfor example, received about $2\\1/2\\ back for every dollar paid in gas \ntaxes. The formula for distributing highway funds is not equitable in \nmy opinion. I think it would be very difficult for any Member to argue \nthat wealthier States should receive more than double in Federal \nhighway funds than they paid in, while poorer States only receive a \nfraction of their contributions. I want to work to help correct that \nformula, but that is something that will be addressed later this year \nwhen the Federal highway program is reauthorized.\n  My goal in the supplemental appropriations bill was not to try to \ntackle the donor versus donee issue. As I said before, that will be \ndone in the authorizing committee later this year. Rather, my goal was \nto simply increase Federal funding for highways to address current and \npressing needs and to ensure that all States would come out a winner. \nWe did that. Under this legislation, donor States received an increase \nin their highway funds compared to fiscal year 1996 levels. Nondonor \nStates, on the other hand, were given additional funds to ensure that \nthey would not be cut below their 1996 levels. Again, nondonor States \nreceived their 1996 level of highway funding and donor States received \nan increase from their 1996 level. All in all, this bill provides \nStates with an additional $933 million in new Federal highway money, \nand it does so in a way in which every State comes out a winner. In my \nview, that is a major victory for transportation in America, and it \nsets the stage for the authorizing committees to resolve the \ncontentious allocation issue later this year.\n  I support more money for donor States, but the Senate, the \nAppropriations Committee, and the Transportation Subcommittee are made \nup of more than donor States. I am not sure\n\n[[Page S4143]]\n\nof what the outcome will be today, but even if the Warner amendment \nfails, there is no question that the additional funds in the committee \nbill represent a major victory for donor States, and I will strongly \nsupport its passage.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in determining the distribution to the \nStates of fiscal year 1996 highway trust fund money, a miscalculation \nresulted in some States getting obligation authority that was \nsubsequently taken away or adjusted by the Treasury pursuant to ISTEA. \nThe miscalculation also prevented another category of States from \ngetting their full share according to ISTEA. These 10 States' shares \ncould not be adjusted administratively.\n  In the fiscal year 1996 supplemental appropriations bill before us, \nthere are funds for both those categories of States. The former is \nprovided $318 million and the latter $139 million.\n  However, the committee has also added an additional category, $475 \nmillion for States that feel they need to be made whole or have their \nfiscal year 1997 obligation authority kept at the same level as it was \nin fiscal year 1996. The reason that these States' fiscal year 1997 \nobligation authority level changed from fiscal year 1997 was the 90 \npercent of payments equity adjustment that is part of ISTEA. This \nequity adjustment reduced the amount available to donee States and \nincreased the amount available to donor States in fiscal year 1997.\n  The hard fought agreement that resulted in ISTEA in 1991 was an \nincremental improvement for the donor States. The 90 percent of \npayments equity adjustment was an important component of that \nguaranteed increase in our return. Now, some States want to rewrite \nISTEA through this appropriations bill, so they can be made whole, and \nperpetuate the unfairness that has existed for decades. The donor \nStates are the ones that should be made whole, rather than continuing \nto transfer over $1 billion annually to the donee States. We should \nreject this effort to overturn the last year of ISTEA.\n  The fair way to settle this matter is to support the Warner \namendment. Provide the $139 million to the States that actually lost \nobligation authority as a result of the Treasury miscalculation, and \ndistribute the remaining funds according to the existing rules for \nfiscal year 1997. Though the ISTEA formula for distributing those \ndollars is still unfair to the donor States, it is marginally better \nthan what is provided under this bill.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me clarify what is happening in \nhighway funds in this appropriations bill.\n  This bill includes $139 million to correct an honest error at the \nTreasury Department. That error in 1994 rippled through the highway \nformula and cost South Carolina $9.2 million last year. Making whole \nall the states which lost funds requires $139 million, and I commend \nthe Appropriations Committee for including these funds.\n  The bill also includes another $794 million. The administration \nrequested $318 million of these funds, and the rest were added by the \nAppropriations Committee. The administration requested the $318 million \nin what was really an erroneous attempt to correct the Treasury \nDepartment error I have mentioned.\n  The rest of the funds--$475 million--have no relationship by any \nstretch of the imagination to the error we are supposedly correcting. \nThey are simply added for some States that disagree with what current \nlaw provided them this year, and these States happen to be a majority \nin the Senate. In other words, today we are watching ``might make \nright'' in the allocation of highway funds.\n  Senators Warner and Graham have made a proposal that is sensible, \nright, and in compliance with the highway law we are living under until \na new reauthorization passes. They propose fixing the $139 million \nerror, and then allocating the rest of the funds under current law. Mr. \nPresident, that is the right thing to do.\n  The underlying issue here is a promise made in ISTEA to guarantee any \nState 90 percent of the funds it paid into the highway fund. This \nyear--for the first time in the 6 years of ISTEA--keeping that promise \nrequires us to trim the historical surplus that some States have long \nreceived in order to help a smaller number of States lose a little \nless. So the winner States are breaking the promise. They are a \nmajority, and they do not want to guarantee 90 percent.\n  Mr. President, we should debate the highway formula when \nreauthorization comes before the Senate. Until then, we should keep the \npromises made in 1991. We should also correct the error that everyone \nagrees occurred. I know where the votes are on this, but I want to set \nthe record straight.\n  Mr. DeWine. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby Senator Warner. First let me say that I believe that the \nappropriators have done an excellent job of providing much-needed \nrelief for those States who have been devestated by floods and bad \nweather, including Ohio. I plan to support this emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill. However, I do have concerns about the way the \nsupplemental Federal aid highway funds are appropriated.\n  I appreciate the fact that the Appropriations Committee has provided \nhighway obligational authority to States that had their fiscal year \n1996 or 1997 limitations reduced as a result of an error by the \nTreasury Department in recording highway trust fund receipts in fiscal \nyears 1994 and 1995. Ohio was affected by this, and I appreciate the \nfact that Ohio will be made whole by this emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill. I believe that the Committee has done the fair \nthing in this regard.\n  I also am not opposed to the $475 million in additional authority \nthat the committee has added in emergency transportation funds for this \nyear. In Ohio, transportation funding seems to be an emergency need \nevery single year. My concern is the fact that the Appropriations \nCommittee has rewritten funding formulas contained in ISTEA in \ndistributing this authority.\n  When ISTEA was debated and passed, it was decided that in fiscal year \n1997, States would receive a 90-percent return on the amount of Federal \ngas taxes paid by the State in the prior year. At the time, everyone \nknew that this would require so-called `donee' states to receive less \nFederal aid highway authority in fiscal year 1997 than they received in \nfiscal year 1996. ISTEA was approved this way for a reason. The \nappropriations process is not the time to change laws that don't suit \nour particular needs. If it were, donor States would have attempted to \ndo this for the past 5 years.\n  This year, Congress will once again debate Federal highway funding. \nThe old formulas, hopefully, will be revised to treat States more \nfairly. As we debate that reauthorization bill in the Senate, we will \nall have a chance to make changes to current law that we feel are \nunfair. We should let that debate take its course. For the time being, \nthe Senate should not circumvent current law.\n  The Warner amendment provides the best way to distribute the \nadditional authority included in this emergency supplemental--by \nformulas included under current law. It allows all States, not just \ndonee States, to receive their proper share of the additional \nauthority. It is the right thing to do, and that is why I support this \namendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I intend to move to table the amendment, \nbut I want to be fair. So, I would like to play gatekeeper and ask \nthose who want time to tell me how much time they would like on this \namendment before I make a motion to table.\n  Senator Thurmond, 4 minutes; Senator Hutchinson, 5 minutes; Senator \nWarner, 3 minutes; 5 minutes to the Senator from Florida; 5 minutes to \nSenator Lautenberg; and Senator Bingaman wants 4 minutes. I would like \n1 minute to close.\n  Do we have those written down? I will repeat it. Five minutes to \nSenator Hutchinson; 4 minutes to Senator Thurmond; 3 minutes to Senator \nWarner; 1 minute to Senator Domenici; 5 minutes to Senator Lautenberg; \n4 minutes to Senator Bingaman; 5 minutes to Senator Graham; and 1 \nminute to me as we close:\n  I ask unanimous consent that I recover the floor at the expiration of \nthe time other than my last 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Chair will observe to the Senator from Alaska that the total \namount of minutes will be 28 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have 24 minutes. I understand you have 28 minutes. It \nis 27 minutes not including my last 1\n\n[[Page S4144]]\n\nminute. So that would mean that we would vote at approximately 25 \nminutes after 11; somewhere around there.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. As the gatekeeper, the Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I want to commend Senator Stevens for his fair role as gatekeeper.\n  I want to particularly commend the Senator from Virginia, Senator \nWarner, and Senator Graham of Florida, for taking their leadership on a \nvery important issue, a true issue of equity and fairness.\n  I think it is unfortunate that, in the middle of a very delicate \nprocess of reauthorizing the ISTEA legislation, we have to be debating \nan amendment that only seeks to implement current law. That is all the \nWarner-Graham amendment does. It implements current law. We are not \nseeking anything that is unfair to any other State. We are merely \nlooking to ensure a fair allocation of these funds.\n  To me it is very frustrating that the Appropriations Committee felt \nthat it had to change current law implemented in 1991 under the ISTEA \nbill so that we could have this funding arrangement.\n  The donor-donee debate will go on. I only want to say that while I \nrecognize all of the arguments, when we talk about fairness, just \nremember the State of Arkansas where we, like so many other States, \nhave tremendous transportation needs. We are 16th in the Nation in \npublic roads and street length. We are 42d in the Nation in \ndisbursements for these highways.\n  While we need a national highway system, that kind of inequity I \ndon't believe can be justified, and it shouldn't be exacerbated by \nchanging this law to hold harmless the donee States. Arkansas has one \nof the lowest per capita incomes in the Nation. It is coming up, but it \nis very low. And we right now are paying more into the highway trust \nfund to benefit those States, most of whom have much higher per capita \nincomes and no more transportation needs than we have in the State of \nArkansas.\n  So I believe the effort to change current law in order to hold \nharmless and in effect create an entirely new funding formula is \nunfair.\n  When ISTEA was passed in 1991, the formula was specifically adjusted \nfor fiscal year 1999 so that States like Arkansas and many other States \ncould have a more equitable funding formula. That 1997 adjustment \nfinally went into the account to correct the inequality that had \nexisted for donor States for many, many years. Even then, it was not \nperfectly equitable. But it was closer than it had been.\n\n  So, when the Appropriations Committee added extra funds to the \nsupplemental appropriations bill, it seemed logical and it seemed \nreasonable that they would use the fiscal year 1997 formula to \ndistribute the funds. But logic, unfortunately, has not prevailed. They \ndecided they would use the fiscal year 1996 formula so that, in their \nwords, ``no State shall receive an amount in fiscal year 1997 that is \nless than the amount they received in fiscal year 1996.''\n  Basically the committee said that, although ISTEA was specifically \nstructured to benefit donor States, those who pay in more than they \nreceive back, the Appropriations Committee rejected that provision and \nadded extra money so that the donee States would be happy.\n  I think that is wrong. I think that is unfair. The law is the law. \nAnd, had that language not been added, the $475 million would have been \ncredited by the current 1997 ISTEA structure. Instead, many States, \nincluding Arkansas, would not be receiving any of that $475 million.\n  So let me just say that in the interest of fairness, yes, there are \nalways winners and losers. But we need not exacerbate the winner-loser \nscenario by passing this supplemental appropriations in its current \nform.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the Warner-Graham amendment in the \nname of fairness, in the name of equity for those States that have for \nso long gotten the short end of that economic stick.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \namendment offered by my able friend from Virginia, Mr. Warner.\n  As the Senator has stated, the Department of the Treasury made an \naccounting error in 1994 by under reporting $1.59 billion in gas tax \nreceipts for that fiscal year. When the error was discovered in \nDecember, fiscal year 1995, the money was credited to the highway trust \nfund. However, crediting the 1995 trust fund with 1994 money only \ncompounded the mistake because parts of the distribution formulas of \nour Federal-aid-to-highways program are based on the receipts of the 2 \nprevious years. Consequently, the 1996 and 1997 distributions were \nseverely impacted.\n  Following the adjournment of the 104th Congress, the Secretary of the \nTreasury moved the income from 1995 back to 1994. Subsequently, the \nDepartment of Transportation, which has the duty of distributing the \nmoney, adjusted its calculation of the contract authority and \nobligation authority to be distributed to the States under the program \nfor fiscal 1997. No corresponding correction was made for 1996. As a \nresult, 10 States have yet to receive the obligation authority totaling \n$140 million for fiscal year 1996.\n  The Secretary of Transportation proposed legislation purportedly to \ncorrect this problem. However, this legislation would not restore the \nmoney owed to the 10 States, but rather requests an appropriation of \n$318 million to make up the difference between what States expected to \nreceive for fiscal year 1997 and what they actually received.\n  In the bill before us, there are provisions to restore the $140 \nmillion to the 10 States, $318 million to satisfy the expectations for \n1997, and an additional $475 million so that donee States would benefit \nas well. Further, the formula for distributing this last amount of \nmoney is not the formula that would apply under the existing \nauthorization, but an entirely new formula contained in the bill \nitself. This new formula conveniently strips away the one equity \nadjustment in the ISTEA law that effectively protects donor States--\nthat is the 90 percent of payments adjustment. This provision of ISTEA \nwas enacted to ensure that no matter how badly a State fares in any \nyear under the underlying formula, it could count on the fact that the \ndistribution it receives would not be radically below the amount it \nputs in.\n  The Warner amendment simply recognizes that this is supplementary \nappropriations for fiscal year 1997 and the money should go out under \nthe ISTEA formula in the regular way.\n  This is the proper way to proceed. I commend my friend from Virginia \nfor offering this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield the floor?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the Warner amendment. \nWhile I have great respect for the author of the amendment, frankly, I \nfind this amendment to be a rather stunning proposition. If this \namendment passes, a majority of the States--yes, a majority of the \nStates--will find that their highway formula funds have been cut below \nthe 1996 levels, even though we have added $1.4 billion to the program \nover the 1996 level.\n  Mr. President, as the senior Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee \nand on the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, I have heard \nlots of my colleagues call for increased infrastructure funding--\nincreased funding for their States' highway needs to replace deficient \nbridges or to ease the choking congestion that plagues their cities. \nAnd I think when the Members ask that they know this Senator will \nsupport increases in infrastructure funding as he always has.\n  So I was pleased to work with Senators Stevens and Shelby to provide \nmore than $993 million in increased highway funding in this bill. These\n\n[[Page S4145]]\n\nfunds are sorely needed in every State of the Union. So I think it \nwould be a terrible way to proceed for us to amend this bill in a way \nto require a majority of States to endure cuts below the 1996 level.\n  Let me emphasize one basic fact. Under the underlying bill as \napproved by the Appropriations Committee, 27 States will see the exact \nsame amount of Federal funds for highways this year that they received \nin 1996. The entire $1.4 billion increase provided between the regular \nTransportation Appropriations bill and this supplemental bill will go \nto 23 States. If we adopt the Warner amendment, these 27 States will \nendure cuts below the 1996 level while the other 23 States get even \nlarger increases above the 1996 level.\n  I want to talk about the basic premise that underlies these \nrecommendations by our friend from Virginia.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, will the Senator from New Jersey yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from New Jersey yield?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Senator says there are 27 States that have zero \naddition to the transportation funds under the Warner-Graham amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. No, there are 27 States that will endure funding cuts \nbelow the 1996 level if the Warner-Graham amendment is adopted.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator name one of those?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would be happy to give the Senator a list when I am \nfinished speaking.\n  I would appreciate it if the Senator--I will provide the Senator with \na list the moment I am finished speaking.\n  This debate is very illustrative of what will be at stake later this \nyear. Senators should be aware that when we guarantee a certain \npercentage return of gas tax receipts in the law, the need to honor \nthese guarantees will come from other States. If there is one pot and \nit goes to a group of States, it means the others are left out.\n  Mr. President, this formula for distribution of highway funds in this \nsupplemental appropriations bill was not developed willy-nilly. \nFrankly, this is, I think, the preamble to what we are going to be \ntalking about later in the session. And I would say this, that my \nState, which sends down so much money that we are 49th on the list of \nreturn of the Federal dollar, will not stand by idly while we debate \nthose things that advantage some and disadvantage others. This formula \nfor the supplemental was constructed as an attempt to honor the \nobligations that these States incur as a result of the incredible \ntraffic that goes through them.\n\n  No State has more highway mileage consumed--more highway congestion--\nthan the State of New Jersey, not because all of us have cars and lots \nof room to drive--we do not--but we are a corridor State and the \nhighways that take people north and south go through our State, and a \nlot of the highways that go east and west go through our State because \nthey terminate in the New York or Northeast region.\n  Mr. President, we get 63 cents back on the Federal tax dollar now, so \nwhile I understand the posture of donor States, I am not sympathetic. \nIt would be as if I demanded that New Jersey get 90 percent of all \nagricultural funds disbursed or defense contractor funds disbursed or \nfood stamps disbursed regardless of need. That is not what a national \ngovernment is about. We are a nation, not a collection of States.\n  I would like to take a minute to explain the three components of the \nmake up the $933 million contained in this bill. First, the bill \nincludes $318 million in funding requested by the President that will \ngo solely to the donor States. This funding is not called for under \nISTEA. This funding would be granted to only those States that lost \nfunding last year when the DOT corrected an error in the calculation of \ngas tax receipts. Second, there is $139 million included in the bill \nthat was championed by Senator Shelby. This funding will go only to 10 \ndonor States. It is intended to grant these States the amount of \nfunding they would have received in 1996 had the tax receipt error been \ncorrected in that year. Finally, there is $475 million included in the \nbill--hold harmless money--for the purpose of ensuring that no State \nreceives less highway funding in fiscal year 1997 than it received in \nfiscal year 1996.\n  Mr. President, the Warner amendment strips the hold harmless funding \nin the bill and distributes it in a manner that will result in a \nmajority of States actually experiencing a cut in their highway funding \nbelow the current year's levels. In combination with earlier \nappropriations, Senator Warner would provide a $1.8 billion increase to \ndonor States in 1997. He would cut $400 million in funds from 29 \nStates--almost three/fifths of the Nation--to do it.\n  Now, Mr. President, I was dissatisfied with the distribution of \nfunding in the committee bill, but at least there was an element of \nfairness to it. In developing this bill, it was important to me that \nhighway funding increases were structured in a balanced way. But, I \nwant to make sure all Senators from the 27 donee States understand that \nwhile the funds in this bill and regular appropriations add a total of \n$1.4 billion to the highway program this year, this entire increase \ngoes to 23 States, while the 27 donee States are held harmless, so to \nspeak. We are level funded. We do not see a penny in 1997 above what we \ngot in 1996.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na table that displays how the $1.4 billion increase in the highway \nprogram would be distributed under the committee bill currently before \nthe Senate and how that increase would be distributed under the Warner \namendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     CHANGES IN OBLIGATION AUTHORITY, 1997 DOT APPROPRIATIONS PLUS SUPPLEMENTAL VS 1996 OBLIGATION AUTHORITY\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               Changes from FY\n                            States                              1996 under S.

Now Senator Warner comes along and argues that is not \nenough. He not only wants the donor States to get the $457 million \nprovided to them in this bill. He wants them to get an additional $400 \nmillion beyond that--taken away from the donee States. He wants to cut \nhighway funds for 27 States below last year's level.\n  Members might appropriately ask ``how is it that the highway program \nis growing, but my State is getting cut?'' The answer lies in a \nprovision of the Highway bill that was established 6 years ago. That \nbill included many different formula calculations, but one of them--the \nso-called 90 percent of payments calculation--requires that donor \nstates receive back at least 90 percent of the gas tax receipts they \ncontribute to the highway trust fund.\n  Mr. President, that kind of entitlement to donor States inevitably \nwill mean a decrease to other States when gas tax receipts are \nincreasing at a rapid rate. That is true because they will rise at a \nrate faster than highway spending. So, if donor States are guaranteed a \n90 percent return on the gas tax dollar, they will be taking that\n\n[[Page S4146]]\n\nmoney from the rest of us. It's a zero sum game.\n  This is exactly what has happened this year. As a result, when the \nAppropriations Committee increased the highway program roughly half a \nbillion dollars last year, the so-called donor States, not only \nabsorbed every penny of that $500 million increase, they also took a \nbillion dollars away from the other States in order to pay for it. In \nthis fiscal year, that provision had the effect of siphoning off $1.5 \nbillion in funding from 27 States and transferring it to 23 donee \nStates.\n  I hope Senators and their staff are listening to this debate, because \nI doubt very much that a majority of my colleagues--54 Senators from 27 \nStates--are fully aware of the fact that funding for the Federal \nhighway program is growing but that funding for their State are being \ncut. And I can tell all my colleagues, as a Senator who has carefully \nmonitored the highway program for more than 14 years, it is \nunprecedented for us to have a situation where States, much less a \nmajority of States, endure substantial cuts while overall highway \nspending is increasing.\n  I can also tell my colleagues, as a very active conferee on the \noriginal ISTEA legislation, that no one envisioned a situation where \nStates would take significant cuts in a given year, even while the \nappropriation increased.\n  Mr. President, it is ridiculous to suggest that ISTEA envisioned a \nscenario whereby 23 States would absorb every additional penny added to \nthis program in 1997. But it's even more outrageous to suggest, as the \nWarner amendment does, that a majority of States should have their \ntransportation funding cut to increase spending for a minority of the \nStates.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I strongly support Senator Stevens' \nforthcoming motion to table the Warner amendment and ask my colleagues \nto join us in defeating the amendment of the Senator from Virgina.\n  This debate is very illustrative of what will be at stake later this \nyear. Senators should be aware that when we guarantee a certain \npercentage return of gas tax receipts in the law, the funding needed to \nhonor those guarantees will come from the rest of the States. Mr. \nPresident, in a way, the Warner amendment is a wakeup call for the \nmajority of Senators. We should not adopt a highway bill that \nincorporates such guarantees in the law.\n  No other Federal program works that way. My State of New Jersey \nreceives the second lowest return on the Federal dollar of every other \nState but Connecticut. We get 63 cents back on the Federal tax dollar. \nSo, while I understand the posture of donee States, I am not \nparticularly sympathetic. It would be as if I demanded that New Jersey \nget 90 percent of all agricultural funds disbursed, or defense \ncontractor funds disbursed or food stamps disbursed, regardless of \nneed.\n  Mr. President, that is not what a national government is about. We \nare a nation, not a collection of States. National programs are \ndesigned to meet national goals. That's how benefits go out under \nMedicaid, housing programs, for agricultural subsidies, and the like. \nAs the second most affluent State in the country, which sends a huge \nsurplus of tax dollars to Washington, New Jersey would be blessed \nindeed if we were guaranteed a 90 percent return on the Federal dollar. \nSo, Mr. President, I can't agree with donor State Senators unless they \nare willing to step back and look at the picture across the board.\n                                \n  I hope Members will think about what it means when it is proposed we \nguarantee each State a percentage of what it contributes to a national \nprogram. I have never come to the Senate Chamber and offered amendments \nto guarantee my State taxpayers 90 percent of what they contribute \ntoward the Department of Defense. While the Department of Defense \nserves to protect us all, the Department of Defense has not chosen to \nhave a very large presence in the State of New Jersey.\n  I have not come to the floor and asked that my taxpayers in New \nJersey be guaranteed 90 percent return on their contributions to \nagricultural price supports, or 90 percent return on what they \ncontribute toward the maintenance of freshwater fisheries, or 90 \npercent return on what they contribute toward the maintenance of our \nnational parks, or 90 percent return of what they contribute toward \nmassive water projects in the West.\n  All of these programs reflect national needs. They cannot be \nsubjected to a formula based on tax contributions.\n  As a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I look \nforward to participating actively in the development of ISTEA 2, \nincluding its highway component. I know that my friend from Virginia, \nthe sponsor of this amendment, and the chairman of the Surface \nTransportation Subcommittee, will be active in developing it as well. I \nwant to work with Senator Warner to develop a bill that will meet our \nNation's transportation needs and be equitable to all States. But, I \nmust say to the Senator from Virginia that I will not be able to \nendorse an approach that dictates that a majority of States--including \nmy own--will lose highway funding, even as appropriations increase, in \norder to increase funding for a minority of States, regardless of their \nneeds.\n  I believe that will be the position of the majority of Senators, whom \nI hope have been listening to this debate and will look closely at the \ntable I have here at the podium before they cast their vote. I urge \nthem to take a look at that table and then vote to table the Warner \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude by saying that if we are going to \nstart examining formulas, we are going to revise all of the formulas \nthat disburse money or send money back to States.\n  I thank the Chair very much.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Would the Chair \nadvise the Senate, under the time agreement the distinguished Senator \nfrom Alaska reached, what Senators remain to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Under the previous agreement, \nSenator Warner from Virginia has 3 minutes; Senator Domenici, 1 minute; \nSenator Bingaman, 4 minutes; Senator Graham, 5 minutes; and concluding, \nSenator Stevens with 1 minute.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is the intention of the Senator from \nVirginia, since I am a proponent of the amendment, to seek recognition \nagain. I ask unanimous consent that my time be increased from 3 to 6 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n4 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me point out the general framework \nof this discussion as I understand it.\n  The administration, in the supplemental request that they sent to \nCongress, suggested that we needed to add $318 million in order to \nessentially continue a windfall that had been in the previous law to \nvarious States under the highway funding formula. There was 24 States. \nAnd this was what I would refer to as the 1997 fix. For fiscal year \n1997, we were saying, essentially the administration was saying, look, \nthese States expected to get more than they really should have been \ngetting, but we will give them this $318 million to divide among these \n24 States.\n  Then, in the supplemental, we first saw a proposal to add some \nadditional money for 10 other States, and that was added by the \nsubcommittee chairman in the Appropriations Committee, not for fiscal \nyear 1997 but for fiscal year 1996, and he was saying, OK, you have \nmade good to these States for this windfall that was represented to \nthem for 1997; what about for 1996? They ought to get the money they \nexpected in 1996 as well, and he added money for that.\n  Now, the Appropriations Committee has come along and said, what we \nare going to do, if all this windfall money is going out to these 24 \nStates--and, clearly, that is what is happening here, and I am not \nopposed to that, but they are saying if all that money is going out to \nthese windfall States, let us at least hold harmless the rest of the \nStates. Let us make sure they do not see an absolute cut in the level \nof funding for highways in this current year over 1996. So it is \nessentially a save harmless provision. It says that although we are \ngoing to give this money to these 24 States that expected to get the \nmoney, we are not going to have it adversely affect any of the other \nStates, and that is the provision which Senator Stevens and Senator \nByrd have reported to the full Senate here.\n\n[[Page S4147]]\n\n  The Warner amendment, of course, comes along and says, no, we do not \nwant to save harmless these other States. We, in fact, want to go ahead \nand cut some of those States' funding from what they did receive in \n1996, and, clearly, that to me is not a fair arrangement.\n  If this group of States is going to get the windfall, which the \nadministration requested and which the appropriations subcommittee has \nadded, then all other States should be held harmless, and that is what \nthe bill does at this time. The Warner amendment would eliminate that \nhold-harmless provision and would result in States like mine getting \nless money than we otherwise would.\n  So I think, clearly, the Warner amendment should be defeated. The \ncommittee proposal here is by far the fairest of the proposals, and I \nhope my colleagues will join me in defeating the Warner amendment.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, again let us sort out what we are \nconsidering here.\n  First, we have what is an admitted arithmetical error by the \nDepartment of Treasury. We are attempting to correct that error. There \nis no dispute between those who advocate the Warner-Graham amendment \nand those who are proposing the language in the underlying bill that we \nshould correct that error. What is happening now is that because of \nthat error, that mistake, we are now trying to change the fundamental \nlaw that relates to the allocation of surface transportation funds \namong the States.\n  It would be as if a person had been involved in an automobile \naccident and had suffered significant injuries and received an \ninsurance payment to make that person whole again, to repay them, \nreimburse them for the injuries, the medical bills, the lost wages and \nthe other damages that they had suffered, and then their neighbor would \nturn and say, well, we ought to get the same bill so that we can \nmaintain parity with our neighbor who has gotten this cash settlement \nfrom his or her insurance company.\n  The States that were the losers, that were adversely affected by this \narithmetic error are not getting any windfall. They are just like that \nperson involved in the accident. They are being made whole. They are \nnot getting a dime more than they were entitled to get or that they \nwould have gotten under the ISTEA legislation had it been properly \nadministered at every stage.\n  They are being made whole, for an error that was made and was beyond \nthe capacity of the States to control. That is just fundamental \nfairness. They are not getting anything that is a benefit beyond what \nthey were entitled to. That is the first $139 million.\n  Now we are looking at the second $800 million that is being \ndistributed under this proposal, which relates to how everybody else, \nthe States that were not adversely affected, are going to be treated \nunder this law. Senator Warner and I recommend a simple standard. If we \nare going to decide that additional highway money should be provided \nbeyond that which is required to rectify this error, it ought to be \ndistributed pursuant to the law. We passed a law in 1991 that set up a \nmethod of allocating funds among the 50 States and territories. That \nlaw ought to be abided by.\n  There was reference made by some of the previous speakers that by \napplying the Warner-Graham standard, some States were going to get \nzero. No State will get zero. Every State will participate in the $800 \nmillion, exactly as the law that we passed in 1991 provides they \nshould. Every State will get a significant amount of additional highway \nfunds beyond what they are presently contemplating. Every State will be \na winner.\n  The question is, are they going to be a winner under the rules that \nwe adopted through the process of this Senate--an authorization \ncommittee holding extensive hearings, reporting out a bill, that bill \nbeing debated for days and days on the Senate floor, finally going to a \nconference committee and a product that the President of the United \nStates signed into law? Are we going to respect that process and use \nthat as the means of distributing this additional $800 million? Or, are \nwe, at the last gasp of the 1991 legislation, to say, ``No, we don't \nwant to do that; we want to use a different formula, and that formula \nis going to say that we are going to hold a set of States harmless by \npouring additional money into those States,'' in effect undoing the \nunderlying law that was passed through the congressional process of \nthis Senate and House of Representatives with the concurrence of the \nPresident?\n  There is an issue of fundamental fairness here. A number of States \nfor many years have been contributing substantially more to the \nNational Highway System than they were receiving back. As I said \nearlier, there are rationales for that that I can accept, recognizing \nthat all States do not have the same capacity, they do not have the \nsame geography, the same population, in order to support a National \nHighway System. The States that are the donor States are not asking to \nget back 100 percent, but they are saying, in the last year, in the 6th \nyear of a 6-year highway bill, we ought to at least get back 90 \npercent.\n  That is what we agreed to. That is the deal that was made. That is \nwhat I think should be honored. That is what fundamental fairness calls \nfor. That is what we achieve by the adoption of the Warner-Graham \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to try to summarize this for the \nSenate. It is a difficult issue. I was, and I continue to be, stunned \nhearing some of the representations that have been made by my \ndistinguished colleagues and friends in opposition to this amendment, \nparticularly the statement made by my distinguished chairman here, the \nsenior Senator from Alaska, when he said we needed to change the law \nbecause the law was wrong.\n  Mr. President, I am sorry. I have the statement the Senator made. Mr. \nPresident, this is not a question of changing the law. The Senator from \nAlaska put in the statement by the distinguished chairman of the full \ncommittee on which I served, Senator Chafee. And he, Senator Chafee, \nacknowledged that this is a clerical error committed by the Department \nof Treasury.\n  Senator Chafee: ``I want to emphasize the situation before us today \nis not a new one. It started in '94 when the Department of Treasury \nmade a clerical error.''\n  Going on, he says, ``Since last July, the Departments of Treasury and \nTransportation have corrected the error.''\n  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, following \nmy statement, the Treasury Department, Comptroller General of the \nUnited States decision, dated December 5, 1996.\n  First sentence, ``Because of a clerical error, the Financial \nManagement Service, Department of Treasury, failed to credit. . . .''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. This is a clerical error that had to be corrected. The \nAppropriations Committee corrected it as related to the $139 billion. \nBut the distinguished Senator from Alaska said, we had to take and \nchange the law so that the balance of the money--money not requested by \nthe administration or anyone else--could be distributed accurately and \nfairly.\n  So we really have law No. 1, which is the 1991 law, and which we have \nbeen acting under for these several years, 5 years, under the ISTEA, \n1991. We now have a proposed new law by the Appropriations Committee, a \nlaw arrived at without any participation in the normal process of \ndrawing up an important statute like this--no hearings on it, simply \ncobbled together by the appropriators, hastily, not in consultation \nwith the authorizers. And then we have a third law which, not in \nexistence, is to be devised by this body after careful deliberation on \na bill that will be forthcoming from the full Committee on the \nEnvironment and Public Works. That debate, which you have seen parts of \ntoday, will be extensive, as it should be. It will be thorough. And all \nSenators will have the opportunity equally to shape the third law, \nwhich will control the distribution for the next 5 years.\n\n[[Page S4148]]\n\n  Mr. President, my amendment simply says to the U.S. Senate: Let us \nfollow the existing law in 1991, not accept a hastily put together law \nby the Appropriations Committee without participation by the full \nSenate. That is a compounding of the inequities of this whole issue on \ndonor/donee.\n  So, as Senators go to their desks, please, first, do not accept the \nfact that some States get zero. I do not know where that sheet came \nfrom. I have put on the desk the Department of the Treasury allocation \nunder the Warner formula, which is simply--the Warner formula is \nnothing more than the existing law. So I plead with the Senate not to \nhastily rewrite the existing law in a debate which, although thorough, \nhad been but an hour and a half, and not all Senators have had the \nopportunity to participate. Please, I urge the Senate, do not change \nthe law. Let the 1991 bill finish its intended purpose to 1997, and let \nthat law distribute the additional funds brought forth under this \nsupplemental by the Appropriations Committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n           Comptroller General of the United States--Decision\n\n     Matter of: Corrections to the Federal Highway Trust Fund.\n     Date: December 5, 1996.\n\n\n                                 digest\n\n       Because of a clerical error, the Financial Management \n     Service, Department of the Treasury, failed to credit actual \n     excise tax receipts to the Highway Trust Fund for the \n     quarters ending June 30, September 30, and December 31, 1993, \n     as required by law. 26 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 9601, 9503. The \n     Secretary of the Treasury has the authority to correct the \n     clerical accounting and reporting errors by restating the \n     fiscal year 1994 and 1995 income statements for the Highway \n     Trust Fund provided to the Department of Transportation. The \n     Secretary of Transportation has no authority to \n     administratively adjust, modify, or correct Highway Trust \n     Fund income data provided by the Department of the Treasury \n     and is bound to make apportionments to the States based on \n     the data reported by the Treasury.\n\n\n                                decision\n\n       The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the \n     Department of Transportation (Transportation) ask whether \n     they are authorized to correct certain clerical accounting \n     and reporting errors relating to appropriations in the \n     Highway Trust Fund (HT Fund). Treasury believes that it has \n     the authority to, and should, correct errors made in \n     recording collections and resulting appropriations \n     attributable to the HT Fund by restating the fiscal years \n     (FY) 1994 and 1995 income statements for the HT Fund provided \n     Transportation. Transportation believes that it must \n     apportion HT funds to the states based on the income \n     statements provided by the Treasury. For the reasons \n     explained below, we agree that Treasury may adjust the FY \n     1994 and 1995 HT Fund income statements and that \n     Transportation must base its apportionment on the corrected \n     income statements.\n\n                               Background\n\n                      Federal Aid Highway Program\n\n       The Federal Aid Highway Program distributes billions of \n     dollars of federal funding annually to the 50 states, the \n     District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico for highway \n     construction, repair, and related activities. To finance the \n     highway program, Congress established the HT Fund as a trust \n     fund account in the Treasury of the United States, 26 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 9503(a) (1994), designating the Secretary of \n     the Treasury as trustee, 26 U.S.C. Sec. 9602(a). Congress \n     has provided the HT Fund with a permanent indefinite \n     appropriation of amounts received in the Treasury from \n     certain gasoline, diesel fuel, and other excise taxes paid \n     by highway users. 26 U.S.C. Sec. 9503(b).\n\n        Statutory responsibilities of Secretary of the Treasury\n\n       The Secretary of the Treasury (Secretary), as trustee of \n     the HT Fund, must fulfill certain accounting and \n     administrative functions.\\1\\ Specifically, the Secretary is \n     required to transfer at least monthly from the general fund \n     of the Treasury amounts appropriated to the HT Fund based on \n     Treasury estimates of the specified excise taxes for the \n     month. 26 U.S.C. Sec. 9601. The Secretary is further directed \n     to make ``proper adjustments . . . in the amounts \n     subsequently transferred to the extent prior estimates were \n     in excess of or less than the amount required to be \n     transferred.'' Id.\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n       To discharge its duties as trustee, Treasury uses estimates \n     provided by the Treasury's Office of Tax Analysis (OTA). Each \n     month OTA submits to the Treasury's Financial Management \n     Service (FMS) an estimate of the specified excise taxes that \n     will be covered into the general fund for the upcoming month. \n     Upon receipt of the monthly OTA estimate, FMS records the \n     amount of the estimate and on the 8th business day of the \n     month transfers from the general fund 50 percent of the \n     estimated amount to the HT Fund and the remaining 50 percent \n     of the estimated amount to the Fund on the 18th business day \n     of the month.\n       The statutory scheme recognizes that the actual amount of \n     highway taxes covered into the general fund may be greater or \n     less than the amounts previously estimated and transferred to \n     the Fund. Pursuant to 26 U.S.C. Sec. 9601, the Secretary is \n     directed to adjust any differences between the transferred \n     estimated amounts and the actual amounts collected. FMS makes \n     these adjustments based on an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) \n     quarterly certification of the actual amounts of taxes \n     collected (IRS actuals). FMS receives the IRS actuals \n     approximately 6 to 9 months after the end of each quarter and \n     records the necessary upward or downward adjustment to the HT \n     Fund income statement in the fiscal year in which it receives \n     the IRS actuals. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) \n     uses the HT Fund income statements as the base figures for \n     apportioning federal aid-highway ``contract authority'' to \n     each state.\\2\\\n\n              FMS clerical accounting and reporting errors\n\n       The HT Fund consists of a Highway Account and a Mass \n     Transit Account. 26 U.S.C. Sec. 9503(a) and (e). According to \n     Treasury, prior to the receipt of the IRS actuals for the \n     quarter ended June 30, 1993, the form which IRS used to \n     report actuals to FMS combined in a single column the \n     accounts attributable to both the Highway Account and the \n     Mass Transit Account. Starting with the IRS actuals for the \n     quarter ended June 30, 1993, IRS separated the amounts \n     attributable to the Highway and Mass Transit Accounts into \n     separate columns. IRS apparently did not notify FMS of the \n     change in format nor did FMS notice the change. Consequently, \n     when calculating its adjustments to the OTA estimates, FMS \n     used the amounts listed in the Highway Account column, \n     instead of using the sum of the Highway Account and the Mass \n     Transit columns. Because of FMS failure to properly \n     transcribe the IRS actuals in FY 1994 when the data was \n     received,\\3\\ the FMS adjustments made in FY 1994 for the \n     quarters ended June 30 ($529,683,300), September 30 \n     ($547,256,400), and December 31, 1993 ($513,533,200), \n     understated the HT Fund income in the aggregate by \n     approximately $1.59 billion.\n       In November 1994, when the FMS forwarded to the FHWA the \n     year-end FY 1994 HT Fund income statement, the FHWA \n     discovered the FMS error. On November 30, 1994, the FHWA \n     advised FMS of the error. The FHWA asked FMS to reflect the \n     correction in the HT Fund income statement for FY 1994. \n     Instead, on December 21, 1994, FMS adjusted upward the HT \n     Fund account by $1.59 billion, reporting the adjustment as \n     income in FY 1995, the fiscal year in which FHWA advised FMS \n     of the mistake. In contrast to Treasury's standard procedure, \n     this had the effect of understating the FY 1994 HT Fund \n     income by $1.59 billion and overstating the FY 1995 HT Fund \n     income by the same amount.\n       As previously noted, FMS has implemented the statutory \n     scheme by crediting the HT Fund in the fiscal year in which \n     they received the IRS actuals. The FMS' failure to follow \n     their standard practice in this instance significantly \n     affects the FHWA's allocations of HT Fund contract \n     authority.\\4\\ Treasury and Transportation have informed us \n     that due to the interactions between the 90 percent payment \n     apportionments \\5\\ and the obligational limitation imposed by \n     Congress for FY 1997,\\6\\ the FMS reporting error will result \n     in approximately 24 states receiving lower distributions of \n     obligational authority in FY 1997, with some of the \n     adjustments ranging up to $50 million.\\7\\\n       The Treasury has concluded that it should adjust the fiscal \n     year 1994 income statements by crediting the HT Fund with the \n     $1.59 billion in the year in which IRS reported the actuals \n     to FMS. If Treasury corrects the error by adjusting the FY \n     1994 and FY 1995 Fund income statements to credit the IRS \n     actuals to the fiscal year in which they were originally \n     reported to FMS, Transportation would ask the Office of \n     Management and Budget for a reapportionment of FY 1996 \n     contract authority. This would mean, according to FHWA, a \n     redistribution of approximately $300 million in contract \n     authority among the States for FY 1996.\n       Transportation has concluded that it cannot \n     administratively correct or modify HT Fund Treasury income \n     statement by substituting data other than that reported by \n     Treasury on the HT Fund income statement. Memorandum from \n     Chief Counsel, FHWA, to General Counsel, Transportation, \n     October 4, 1996. Transportation determined that in \n     furtherance of its duty to administer the Federal Aid Highway \n     Program, it must apportion funds authorized to be apportioned \n     to the states under 23 U.S.C. Sec. 104 and section 1015 of \n     the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 \n     (ISTEA) (23 U.S.C. Sec. 104, note) on the basis of the data \n     reported by Treasury. Based on its legal analysis of the \n     Secretary's statutory responsibilities, Treasury has \n     concluded, and Transportation agrees, that it has the \n     authority to make the correction in FY 1994. We agree.\n\n                                Analysis\n\n                Authority of Treasury to correct errors\n\n       Consistent with the statutory scheme and his duties as \n     trustee of the HT Fund, the Secretary of the Treasury credits \n     on a monthly basis estimated amounts of specified excise \n     taxes to the HT Fund and subsequently adjusts the estimated \n     amounts to reflect the amount of the specified excise taxes \n     actually collected. For three quarters in calendar year 1993, \n     FMS misread the IRS form\n\n[[Page S4149]]\n\n     reporting the actual amount of excise taxes collected. As a \n     result, FMS credited the HT Fund with $1.59 billion less in \n     income in FY 1994 than it otherwise would have had they \n     properly read the IRS form. When notified of the mistake, FMS \n     ``corrected'' the error by recording the $1.59 billion as \n     income to the HT Fund in FY 1995, apparently based on the \n     view that they should make the correction effective when they \n     learned of the error, as opposed to when they were initially \n     advised of the amount of taxes collected. The issue is \n     whether Treasury may credit the $1.59 billion to FY 1994, the \n     fiscal year that would have been credited had FMS not misread \n     the IRS form. We think that the answer is clearly yes.\n       Our decisions in this area over the years stand for the \n     proposition that an act of Congress is not required to \n     correct clerical or administrative errors. 41 Comp. Gen. 16, \n     19 (1961). In B-251287, September 29, 1993, we concluded that \n     when Treasury is presented with convincing evidence that a \n     reporting error affecting the balance of an appropriation \n     account has occurred as a result of an obvious clerical \n     error, it may adjust the account balance to correct the \n     mistake. In that particular case, had Treasury not been able \n     to adjust the appropriation account balance to correct the \n     mistake, the erroneously reported amount would have been \n     treated as canceled in accordance with the applicable account \n     closing procedures contained in the National Defense \n     Authorization Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-510, 104 Stat. \n     1674 (1990). Id. Similarly, Treasury may adjust its \n     accounting records to credit an appropriation account with \n     the amount improperly credited to the general fund of the \n     Treasury. 45 Comp. Gen. 724, 730 (1966); see also B-126738, \n     April 11, 1956. Where the evidence of the error is unreliable \n     or inconclusive, B-236940, October 17, 1989, we have objected \n     to an administrative adjustment. In this case this limitation \n     does not apply.\n       As explained above, had FMS officials properly understood \n     the IRS form reporting the actual amount of excise taxes \n     collected for the three quarters in question, they would have \n     recorded the appropriate amounts in the FY 1994 HT Fund \n     income statements. The fact that FMS officials recorded the \n     amount, the $1.59 billion, in the FY 1995 HT Fund income \n     statement when FHWA advised them of their oversight is as \n     much a deviation from their established practice of recording \n     amounts collected in the fiscal year current when IRS reports \n     the actual amounts collected as was the failure to properly \n     read the IRS form in the first place. To now adjust the FY \n     1994 and FY 1995 income statements to reflect what FMS \n     officials should have done had they followed their \n     established procedures, consistently and regularly applied, \n     does no more than restore the accounts to where they should \n     have been. Apart from whatever responsibilities the Secretary \n     may have to accurately state the accounts of the United \n     States, the Secretary in his capacity as trustee of the HT \n     Fund has the duty to accurately account for the amounts in \n     the Fund consistent with the terms of the appropriation made \n     thereto and the applicable administrative procedures adopted \n     to effectuate his statutory responsibilities.\\8\\\n       The statutory scheme for apportioning contract authority \n     among the states for the Federal Aid Highway Program makes it \n     essential that the Secretary maintain an accounting of the HT \n     Fund in the most accurate manner possible. The interplay \n     between the HT Fund and the statutes providing federal aid to \n     the states for highways reflects a complex congressional plan \n     to equitably distribute the HT Fund proceeds for the various \n     highway programs among the states. This entire statutory \n     scheme is dependent upon the Treasury accurately performing \n     the ministerial duty of collecting, accounting for and \n     reporting the revenues. For example, the 90 percent payment \n     adjustment provided by section 1015(b) of ISTEA directs \n     Transportation to base its computation on ``the estimated tax \n     payments attributable to highway users in the State paid into \n     the Highway Trust Fund * * * in the latest fiscal year in \n     which data is available.'' The failure to properly account \n     for funds in the correct year can dramatically affect the \n     amount of funds each state is entitled to receive from the HT \n     Fund.\n       Thus, Treasury's accounting for the funds in the correct \n     year is critical. Although section 9601 does not contain a \n     specific time limit in which the Secretary must make the \n     proper adjustments to reflect the actual amounts of the \n     applicable excise taxes received in the Treasury. Treasury \n     has implemented section 9601 by making the adjustment to the \n     HT Fund income statement for the fiscal year current at the \n     time of receipt of the IRS report on the actual amount \n     collected. We understand that, with the exception of the \n     adjustments at issue here, this has been the consistent \n     practice of Treasury. Although this may not be the only \n     way to implement this statutory scheme, it is entitled to \n     deference unless clearly wrong. Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. \n     Natural Resources Defense Counsel Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 844 \n     (1984). As noted above, Treasury has advised us that it \n     received all IRS actuals in fiscal year 1994. Accordingly, \n     we have no objection to Treasury adjusting the FY 1994 and \n     FY 1995 HT Fund income statements to conform to their \n     established practice of accounting for these amounts.\n\n       Authority of transportation to adjust HT fund income data\n\n       As mentioned above, Transportation has concluded that it \n     cannot administratively correct erroneous HT Fund Treasury \n     income statements.\\9\\ We agree. Transportation is statutorily \n     charged with administering the Federal Aid Highway program \n     and it may only apportion funds authorized to be appropriated \n     to the states under 23 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 101, et seq. As \n     discussed above, as trustee of the HT Fund, Treasury is \n     solely responsible for making transfers and adjustments to \n     the HT Fund under 26 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 9601 and 9602. \n     Transportation has no role in administratively adjusting, \n     modifying, or correcting Highway Trust Fund income statements \n     provided by the Department of the Treasury. Thus, \n     Transportation is bound to make apportionments to the States \n     based on the data reported by Treasury.\\10\\\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       Treasury may adjust the FY 1994 and 1995 HT Fund income \n     statements to credit the HT Fund with the excise taxes \n     originally not included in the HT Fund income statements' \n     just as if Treasury had credited such amounts upon receipt of \n     the reports from the IRS. Transportation has advised us that \n     upon the adjustment of the FY 1994 and FY 1995 HT Fund income \n     statements to reflect the actual receipt of revenue \n     consistent with their standard practice, Transportation will \n     seek a reapportionment of contract authority from the Office \n     of Management and Budget for FY 1996. Once Treasury has \n     issued its HT Fund income statement, Transportation's duty is \n     to effectuate the statutory apportionment formula, including \n     the 90 percent payment apportionment, based on the data \n     provided by Treasury.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ The Secretary is responsible for maintaining an effective \n     and coordinated system of accounting and financial reporting, \n     31 U.S.C.

Sec. 9601 and 9602.\n     \\2\\ The Federal Aid Highway Program is essentially a \n     ``reimbursable'' program, that is, the federal government \n     reimburses states for costs actually incurred in building or \n     repairing its highways. Congress, primarily in the highway \n     authorization acts, authorizes Transportation through the \n     FHWA and its other agencies, to incur obligations (using \n     contract authority) on behalf of the federal government. The \n     FHWA apportions authorized amounts of contract authority to \n     the states, in effect establishing lines of credit upon which \n     the states may draw for a particular project. See Financing \n     Federal Aid Highways. FHWA Publication No. FHWA-92-016 \n     (1992).\n     \\3\\ Treasury has advised that FMS received the IRS actuals as \n     follows: for the quarter ended June 30, 1993, the FMS \n     received the IRS actuals on May 26, 1994; for the quarter \n     ended September 30, 1993, the FMS received the IRS actuals on \n     July 5, 1994; for the quarter ended December 31, 1993, the \n     FMS received the IRS actuals on September 16, 1994.\n     \\4\\ Treasury officials have informally advised us that they \n     could not recall any cases in which a clerical error was made \n     that required corrective action.\n     \\5\\ The 90 percent payments apportionment is one of a number \n     of provisions Congress has built into the Federal Aid Highway \n     Program to: (1) insure funding equity among the states, (2) \n     address the concerns of states that contribute more highway \n     user taxes than they would receive in federal aid highway \n     funds, and (3) provide each state with the same relative \n     share of overall funding that it had received in the past. \n     Specifically, the 90 percent payments apportionment ensures \n     that each qualifying state will receive an allocation in an \n     amount that ensures its apportionments for the fiscal year \n     and allocations for the previous fiscal year will be at least \n     90 percent of its contributions to the Highway Account of the \n     HT Fund. Financing Federal Aid Highways, FHWA Publication No. \n     FHWA-92-016 (1992).\n     \\6\\ The obligation limitation for FY 1997 is $18 billion. \n     Pub. L. No. 104-205, 110 Stat. 2958 (1996).\n     \\7\\ The law requires that Transportation base the 90 percent \n     payment apportionments on the latest fiscal year in which \n     data is available. Pub. L. No. 102-240, Sec. 1015(b), 105 \n     Stat. 1944 (1991). Generally, the latest fiscal year for \n     which data is available lags by two years. For example, for \n     fiscal year 1996, Transportation based the 90 percent payment \n     apportionments of contract authority on data from the fiscal \n     year 1994 HT Fund income statements. Similarly, \n     Transportation will base the 90 percent payment \n     apportionments of contract authority for FY 1997 on data from \n     the FY 1995 HT Fund income statements. Thus, Treasury's \n     correction of the FYs 1994 and 1995 HT Fund income statements \n     will affect the allocations for FYs 1996 and 1997.\n     \\8\\ Certainly, section 9601 contemplates that the Secretary \n     will faithfully carry out his responsibilities as trustee of \n     the HT Fund to credit the Fund with the amounts collected as \n     reported by the IRS. Literally read, section 9601 only \n     authorizes the Secretary to make ``proper adjustments'' \n     necessary to reflect any differences between the estimated \n     amounts provided by the OTA each month, and the amounts \n     reported by the IRS several months later as actually \n     collected. In our opinion, the Secretary's authority to \n     correct the FMS clerical accounting and reporting errors in \n     this case is not dependent on the authority in section 9601 \n     to make ``proper adjustments.''\n     \\9\\ Earlier this year, Senator Baucus introduced an amendment \n     to the Transportation appropriation for FY 1997 requiring \n     Transportation to make appropriate adjustments to federal aid \n     highway apportionments to correct Treasury's error. 142 Cong. \n     Rec. S9266-9275 (daily ed. July 31, 1996). The amendment was \n     agreed to by the Senate. 142 Cong. Rec. S9278 (daily ed. July \n     31, 1996).

Gen. 16 (1961), holding that \n     when an apportionment under the federal highway program \n     results in some states receiving funds in excess of the \n     amount they were entitled to receive and others receiving \n     less than their entitlement, the failure to apportion \n     properly must be regarded as an act in excess of statutory \n     authority and the incorrect apportionments need to be \n     appropriately adjusted.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, Senator Domenici, I am informed, does not \nwish this time. I yield it back for him.\n  I close by saying we make no change in the basic law. The allocations \nunder this bill are under the 1996 formula. Without unfairness, as is \npointed out in the statement from the chairman of the Public Works \nCommittee, and I read this because it is very strange that this--it \ndoes not normally happen.\n  Mr. WARNER. If the Senator will yield for a question, I simply say if \nhe states he is making no changes in the ISTEA 1991 law, then I \nwithdraw the amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Our formula is the 1996 formula. The 1996 formula is the \none that has been used by Senator Warner, and we are using the same \nformula. We are not changing the 1996 formula. We are looking for a \nstatement the Senator made.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are dealing with 1997----\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator from Alaska yield for a question?\n  Mr. STEVENS.

The Senator from Virginia asked unanimous \nconsent he be extended 3 additional minutes, the same as the Senator \nfrom Alaska. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. There is no objection.\n  Mr. WARNER. I make the proffer here, I judge my distinguished \ncolleague from Florida will join me, if the Senator from Alaska will \nstate that it is the intention of this bill not to change the 1991 \nISTEA law, as it applies to fiscal year 1997, I will withdraw the \namendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator from Virginia wanted to \nchange the law. The President wanted to change the law with the $318 \nmillion. If the Senator wants to delete the $318 million, the $475 \nmillion would come out. But the $139 million that the President did not \nrequest is the one that is to correct the error. The moneys we have \nadded to what the President requests is to make it fair and to correct \nthe impact of the underlying Treasury error.\n  I say again, we have used the 1996 formula. The President's request \nwould be an $318 million addition for a few States based primarily on \none category of the 1996 formula. We equalize that with what we have \ndone. I do not say we have changed the thrust of the law. We have \nchanged in terms of the formula.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I claim my time. The Senator is on his time with the \nreply.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has his time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Do I have any time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, the Senator from Alaska has 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think, in fairness to the Senate, we might consider a \nquorum call, during which time I am perfectly willing to say to the \ndistinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, if he will let \nthe 1991 ISTEA law control the distribution of 1997 funds, which are \nthe funds in this appropriation, I am perfectly willing to withdraw the \namendment, because it is clear to me that this bill, as written, \nrewrites the 1991 law. And that is not the intention, in my judgment, \nof the U.S. Senate, to do that hastily in a debate of 1 hour and a \nhalf.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator from Virginia yield for a question?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Am I correct the amendment that he has offered would, in \nfact, provide that the $318 million, plus the $475 million, all be \ndistributed pursuant to the 1991 ISTEA act?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. So we----\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator from Virginia simply says that all moneys \nabove the $139 million--that is a clerical error, not a law error--be \ntreated under the ISTEA 1991 law, which is the law of the land today. \nWe should not, as the U.S. Senate, endeavor in this brief period to \nrewrite that ISTEA 1991 distribution formula. That should await the \nnext piece of legislation which is coming through in the orderly, \nbipartisan process, through the authorization committee.\n  I make the proffer right now to withdraw the amendment if the Senator \nwill revise the bill before the Senate, such that it reflects that in \n1991, the ISTEA law governs the distribution of those funds over and \nabove $139 million in this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I reject that suggestion. As the Senator \nknows, the change is required for the $139 million that he is \nproposing. We are working from a 1996 base, and that is what we are \nequalizing.\n  This is a growing program. Why should some States be less than they \nwere in 1996, while other States grow at such a rate they are far in \nexcess of 1996?\n  Again, I have been trying to read what the Senator from Rhode Island, \nthe chairman of the Public Works Committee, said in the statements \nbefore the Senate.\n\n       The additional funds provided by the Appropriations \n     Committee hardly give an unfair advantage to 29 States. In \n     fact, the only States that actually receive additional funds \n     in 1997, when compared to 1996, are the so-called donor \n     States that are offering the amendment that is before us \n     today. Mr. President, this is an issue that, in my opinion \n     was resolved after the administration initially fixed its \n     error last December. Unfortunately, the administration has \n     reopened this complicated issue. The Appropriations Committee \n     has developed a fair solution to a difficult problem, and \n     they should be congratulated. I urge my colleagues to oppose \n     this amendment and support the chairman of the Appropriations \n     Committee.\n\n  I yield the remainder of my time. I yield the remainder my time. I \nmove to table the amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is a simple question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table amendment No. 66 to S. 672. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 54, nays 46, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 60 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--54\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Gorton\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n\n[[Page S4151]]\n\n\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Sarbanes\n     Smith (NH)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--46\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bumpers\n     Cleland\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     DeWine\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kempthorne\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Levin\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Nickles\n     Robb\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (OR)\n     Specter\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 66) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If we could have order, I would like to tell Senators \nwhat will happen now.\n  Let me make a parliamentary inquiry.\n  How much time is left under cloture, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We will have to compute that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thought I had an answer. The answer I received is not \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No. We are computing it right now. It will \nhave to be recomputed.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I urge the Parliamentarian to compute it before I finish \nhere because I think Senators ought to know.\n  We, I hope, will finish this bill under the original cloture period.\n  Senator Byrd, from West Virginia, will be recognized under the \nagreement we entered into last evening to complete the statements on \nhis amendment to delete the CR provision in the bill.\n  After that, Senator Reid's amendment is the pending business. It is \nour intention to go to Senator Reid's amendment. There is an agreement \non that.\n  Following that amendment, Senator Gramm, who has a series of \namendments, has asked to bring up one of his amendments. And it is my \nhope that the Chair will recognize him after that.\n  I urge Senators to come forward now and tell us what they are going \nto bring up. If I am correct, the time under cloture expires before 6 \np.m. tonight. It is my feeling we should finish in that original \nperiod. That will mean that we will have to shorten the time on every \namendment that comes up and seek an opportunity to vote, if there is \ngoing to be a vote, within a reasonable period of time.\n  So, Mr. President, I want to announce, as chairman, once an amendment \nis called up and a statement is made in support of it, I will seek the \nfloor to table that amendment. But I hope to seek from each Member a \nreasonable period of time for any Member who wants to speak on the \npending amendment. I urge Senators to limit their time so we can finish \nby 6 o'clock.\n  Has the Parliamentarian come close to an estimate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are still computing.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Could I say to the distinguished chairman, the manager of \nthe bill, on the Reid amendment we have an agreement, and we can move \nrather quickly on that, if you want to get one more thing taken care \nof.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, that is precisely what we have agreed to \ndo. As soon as Senator Byrd, who has the amendment that is pending, \nbecause of an agreement that was entered into before--the Reid \namendment was set aside--we shall finish Senator Byrd's amendment, and \nonce that is finished we will go back to regular business, which is the \nReid amendment, as soon as the Byrd amendment is voted upon. Then we \nwould proceed, by agreement, I hope, to raise every amendment that a \nSenator wishes to raise within the time limit that is left under the \ncloture period.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Is there any suggestion how long the Byrd amendment might \ntake?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is our hope that after the Senator has \ncompleted his statement that he did not make last night that we will be \nable to reach an agreement as to time in very short order. But he has \nnot completed his statement yet, so I cannot answer that question yet.\n  Again, this is a consistent pattern. I hope the Senate will realize \nthe person who offers an amendment will be allowed to make the \nstatement that he or she wishes to make, and after that time we will \nseek to limit the time for any further comment on the amendment before \nI make a motion to table.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could ask the manager of the bill, we \nunderstand there is no specific time, but I wonder, for those of us \ninvolved in the next amendment, can you give us a ballpark? Would it be \nlike 2:30, something like that?\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is my hope the Senator will agree--and I have \ndiscussed with the Senator from West Virginia--that sometime around the \n2 o'clock time we can vote on the amendment because we do have some \npeople who have already notified us that they are going to leave, and I \nthink that they are on the Senator's side. So we would like to \naccommodate people who will leave. But we have not any agreement.\n  The question was asked to you, I say to the Senator. You may want to \nrespond now. If you do not, we will wait.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am in no position to respond at this moment. But I do \nhave at least 9 or 10 speakers on this side other than myself, and they \nwill want somewhere from 5 to 10 minutes each probably.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Again, when the Senator is finished with his statement, \nI intend to seek a limitation--before I make a motion to table his \namendment--on any of those who wish to speak. So I do hope that we will \nbe able to get that. When the Senator is finished with his statement, \nwe will get to this and decide what the time will be.\n  I yield to Senator Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, at what time did cloture occur?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Cloture was invoked yesterday at 10:28 a.m.\n  Mr. BYRD. What time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 10:28 a.m.\n  Mr. BYRD. At 10:28 a.m. So the 30 hours for debate could well not \noccur today, not take place today.\n  Mr. President, am I recognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 59\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may yield to \nthe distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts for not to exceed \n10 minutes without losing my right to the floor. He has to go to \nanother appointment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from West \nVirginia for yielding the time. Once again I commend him for bringing \nhis amendment to the floor of the Senate. And for the reasons that I \nwill outline, I hope that his position will be overwhelmingly accepted.\n  Mr. President, this automatic budget proposal is a Trojan Horse, and \nthe Senate should reject it. It would freeze the level of last year's \nspending on any appropriations bill where Congress and the President \nfailed to agree. By creating the certainty of a particular result in \nthe event of a deadlock, it creates the certainty of a deadlock. There \nwill always be those who favor a freeze. They obstruct the process. \nThis provision guarantees that they will get their way.\n  Mr. President, by creating the certainty of a particular result in \nthe event of a deadlock, it creates the certainty of a deadlock. There \nwill always be those who desire a freeze. If they obstruct the process, \nthis provision guarantees they will get their way. They will have many \nopportunities to obstruct.\n  Already, continuing resolutions are a regular part of the \ncongressional procedure. A forthcoming article by Professor Meyers of \nthe University of Maryland calculates that since 1974, when the \nCongressional Budget Act set the October 1 deadline for enacting \nappropriations, more than two-thirds of appropriation bills have been \nenacted\n\n[[Page S4152]]\n\nafter that date. With this automatic budget provision tilting the \noutcome, it will be a rare case, indeed, when it is not used by our \nRepublican friends to achieve their ideological goals.\n  Our Republican friends seek to sell this Trojan horse as a way to \nprevent shutting down the Government. We all know the real target. This \nproposal would simply guarantee cutting back on funds for education, \nfor health, safety, and the environment.\n  This year, a freeze at last year's level would be $27 billion below \nPresident Clinton's request for total discretionary spending for 1998. \nIt would yield a devastating cut in education, in health, and safety. \nWe all remember the long and difficult struggle and battle that was \nheld here on the floor of the U.S. Senate in making sure that those \npriorities, which are the priorities of the American people, were going \nto be achieved. It was only in the final days of the consideration in \nthe Congress that we were able to do so.\n  It would cost $330 million from Head Start, depriving 35,000 children \nof the chance they would have to participate in Head Start under the \nPresident's plan.\n  It would slash $1.7 billion from Pell grants, denying crucial aid to \n350,000 needy college students.\n  It would cut $300 million from the education for disadvantaged \nchildren, denying 483,000 children the extra help they need to survive \nin school.\n  It would cut $5 million from programs like Meals on Wheels, resulting \nin $2.8 million fewer home-delivered meals for senior citizens.\n  It would cut $23 million from the President's budget for occupational \nsafety and health, resulting in thousands of fewer health and safety \ninspections.\n  It would cut $300 million from the President's budget for the \nNational Institutes of Health, slashing the number of new research \ngrants and contracts, dramatically jeopardizing the research on cancer, \nAIDS, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and many other diseases.\n  These are unacceptable results. This is unacceptable budget policy. \nIt is a GOP Government shutdown on the installment plan.\n  If we give the obstructionists and do-nothings this raw power, they \nwill have carte blanche to do it every year. The cuts will grow like \ncompound interest. Five years of a freeze would lead to cuts of $165 \nbillion. The 2002 level for appropriated spending would be 9 percent \nbelow the President's budget.\n  If you take inflation into account, the cuts would total $287 billion \nbelow the levels needed to maintain current services. The 2002 level \nwould be 16 percent below the level needed to maintain current \nservices.\n  Appropriated spending is now its smallest share of the economy since \n1938--7 percent, roughly half of its high of 13.6 percent in 1968. We \nare reducing spending, and we are doing it the right way, not the \nright-wing way.\n  Under the President's budget and the budget agreement, spending will \nalready decline further in inflation-adjusted terms. From this already \nshrinking pie, Congress has to fund education, health research, and \nother needed investments to keep our economy strong and growing.\n  This proposal is extreme. Make no mistake about it. The Nation cannot \nafford a robot procedure that robs future generations and weakens the \neconomy. Congress should not put the budget on an automatic shrinking \npilot. We can work together, Republicans and Democrats, we can write a \nbetter budget than this provision will allow--and still meet any \nreasonable goals for restraining spending.\n  I urge all Senators to support the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom West Virginia.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a table showing the \ncalculation results in the cuts I described be printed in the Record at \nthis point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     LOSSES FROM THE AUTOMATIC BUDGET COMPARED TO THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET \\1\\\n                      [Billions of dollars in budget authority for discretionary spending]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                         Over 5\n                                                   1998       1999       2000       2001       2002      years\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPresident's budget \\1\\........................      537.1      535.5      542.3      549.2      560.4    2,724.5\n100 percent of prior year.....................      511.8      511.8      511.9      511.9      511.9    2,559.3\nLoss in funding...............................       25.3       23.7       30.4       37.3       48.5      165.2\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ As estimated by the Congressional Budget Office.\n\n\n          LOSSES FROM THE AUTOMATIC BUDGET COMPARED TO SPENDING NEEDED TO MAINTAIN CURRENT SERVICES \\1\\\n                      [Billions of dollars in budget authority for discretionary spending]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                         Over 5\n                                                   1998       1999       2000       2001       2002      years\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCurrent services \\1\\..........................      532.9      550.8      569.0      587.4      606.3    2,846.4\n100 percent of prior year.....................      511.8      511.8      511.9      511.9      511.9    2,559.3\nLoss in funding...............................       21.1         39       57.1       75.5       94.4      287.1\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ As estimated by the Congressional Budget Office.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if you look at the cuts, for example, in \nthe area of education, and you take the cuts plus what is happening in \nterms of inflation in education alone, it would be a 16-percent \nreduction in the real purchasing power of education programs--in all \neducation programs. Those are the student loan programs which are such \na lifeline for children, young people that are looking forward to \nfunding their education with the help and assistance of the Pell \ngrants. It would cut back on the title I programs that reach out to \nchildren and help to provide programs to advance math, science, and \nliteracy in schools across the country. It would cut back on the Head \nStart Programs which provide the early kind of intervention in terms of \ndeveloping self-confidence and character building among the children in \nthis country. These are programs with proven results, Mr. President.\n  The reality is that it is generally this appropriation, the HEW or \nHHS appropriation, which is the last one that comes through here. It is \namazing to me, Mr. President, that after we have an agreement on the \nPresident's budget, bipartisan agreement on the President's budget, \nthat there are still those in the Senate that want to continue to \nsupport this proposal. We are supposed to have an agreement on the \nPresident's budget, but nonetheless they want to insist on this \ncontinuing proposal. So we have to look at why they might want to \ncontinue with this proposal. You have to reach the conclusion that, \ngiven their record in the areas of education, in the areas of health, \nin the areas of Head Start Programs, Meals on Wheels, fuel assistance \nprogram, substance abuse programs to help young people free themselves \nfrom addiction, you can reach no other conclusion than they want \nfurther cutbacks than agreed to under the President's budget, or why \nwould they insist on it?\n  Are we going to see the day when, sure, we have a budget deal, a tall \nsign, people are prepared to deal with it, and then we come back to the \nappropriations process, and it just so happens that appropriations in \nthe areas of education, training programs, or other programs affecting \nour senior citizens like Meals on Wheels conform to what was agreed on, \nbut there are perhaps a handful of Senators who say, ``We will not \nconsider that appropriations bill. We are not going to bring it up.''\n  All right, if we do not, we are back to running on the agreement that \nwas in this particular supplemental bill. What is that going to mean? \nIt will mean a\n\n[[Page S4153]]\n\nvery small and tiny minority can effectively renege on what has been \nagreed to by Republicans. If that is not their position, then there \nwill be an overwhelming majority that will support the Senator from \nWest Virginia, an overwhelming majority. It is a pretty clear \nindication of what the real intentions of Members of this body are with \nregard to that particular agreement.\n  I think for all of these reasons, Mr. President, whether the \nagreement that was made last week between Republicans is really a true \nagreement, or whether there will be those who say, OK, we agreed on \nthat particular day, but we will wait until the ink dries on this \nparticular agreement, and next year, the year after or the following \nyear, we will go ahead and put, in effect, a freeze that will mean \nlower kinds of support for funding, education, and health programs--\nprograms that are a lifeline for our senior citizens, our children, \nthose that too often have been left out and left behind. We will see \nthose programs further threatened.\n  Mr. President, I commend the Senator from West Virginia. He really, I \nthink, in many respects, has by far the most important amendment that \nis going to affect the quality of life of millions of our fellow \ncitizens. We have seen dramatic reduction in what has been termed the \n``domestic investment programs for the future,'' a term that has been \nagreed to by GAO and by CBO, and talks about education, a training \ninfrastructure and domestic research and development. That percent, \nwhich is so essential in terms of our Nation's future, has gone down \nand is on the slippery, slidy slope of going down further, and we \nendanger it more so if we do not accept the amendment of the Senator \nfrom West Virginia.\n\n  I commend him for offering this amendment. I thank him for bringing \nthis amendment to the attention of all the Members. This really is, I \nthink, the heart and soul of this whole proposal.\n  I join with those that regret, as we are trying to deal with the \nproblems of those fellow citizens in North and South Dakota, and other \nflood State victims across this country, that we are having to face \nthis particular issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). I announce that the pending \nquestion is amendment No. 59, offered by the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  I now recognize the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely, gladly.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I had a discussion with the Senator from West Virginia, \nand I wonder if he would be agreeable, after the completion of his \nremarks, to enter into a unanimous consent agreement that would allow \nan hour and a half on his side and an hour on this side before the \nvote. Would the Senator from West Virginia find that proposal \nagreeable?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in response to the question, I may very well \nfind it agreeable at that point. In the meantime, I will ask staff to \nattempt to identify those Senators who wish to speak in support of my \namendment, at which time I will be in a better position to discuss a \ntime limitation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] for his very illuminating remarks. He is \nthe chairman of the committee in the Senate which would feel the brunt \nof the cuts that would ensue. He has stated them very eloquently. I \nhope that Senators will have been paying attention.\n  Mr. President, my amendment would strike Title VII from the bill. \nThis title contains what the proponents call the ``Government Shutdown \nPrevention Act.'' It might better be termed the ``Congressional \nResponsibility Prevention Act'' because, if its provisions were in \neffect for all of Fiscal Year 1998 for the thirteen regular \nappropriation bills, funding for all discretionary spending in Fiscal \nYear 1998 would be on automatic pilot.\n  I offered this same amendment to strike Title VII of the bill in the \ncommittee markup of the bill, and it failed on a party-line vote of 13 \nyeas to 15 nays. As reported, Title VII would continue funding for any \nof the thirteen regular appropriation bills not enacted into law by \nOctober 1, 1997, at a rate of 98 percent of the 1997 levels for every \nprogram, project, and activity. That amounted to a cut in budget \nauthority of some $35 billion below President Clinton's 1998 \ndiscretionary budget requests. Of that $35 billion cut, $10 billion \nresulted from the 2 percent reduction below 1997 levels. The remaining \n$25 billion in cuts would result from the fact the President's budget \nfor Fiscal Year 1998 is $25 billion higher in budget authority than \nwould be required under a freeze at the 1997 levels.\n  During the debate on this issue last evening, after my remarks in \nrelation to the provisions in Title VII as reported by the committee, \nSenators McCain and Hutchison urged me not to object to an amendment to \nwhich I ultimately agreed to which changed the percentage contained on \npage 81 of the bill from 98 percent to 100 percent. This means that \nTitle VII as it now stands in the bill would provide an automatic CR \nfor Fiscal Year 1998 for any of the thirteen appropriation bills not \nenacted into law by October 1, of this year, at a rate of 100 percent \nof 1997 levels. In other words, all programs, projects, and activities \nfor the discretionary portion of the budget in Fiscal Year 1998 would \nbe continued at a freeze level.\n  In explaining their purpose for making this change last evening, the \nSenator from Arizona and the Senator from Texas expressed their view \nthat this would pretty much alleviate the funding problems with the \nprevious language. But, Mr. President, this is certainly not the case.\n  Even at a freeze level, if put into effect for all of fiscal year \n1998 for all 13 regular appropriations bills, title VII would result in \ncuts totaling more than $25 billion in budget authority below President \nClinton's requests. So the devastation that would have occurred and \nabout which I spoke at some length last evening, would still occur to a \nlarge extent, devastation to the programs and activities in the area of \nlaw enforcement, education, transportation and transportation safety, \nhealth and human services programs, such as WIC, LIHEAP, Head Start, \nand so forth. In total, cuts to these and other programs throughout the \nFederal Government would, as I have said, equal more than $25 billion \nif title VII were in effect for the full year for all 13 appropriations \nbills.\n  Now, it never ceases to amaze me that so much time and effort are put \ninto proposals such as this, trying to find ways to get around the \nresponsibilities of the executive and legislative branches for making \ncertain that the power of the purse--the power of the purse--is used \nvery carefully and thoughtfully in every respect for every dollar of \nspending that we provide each year. If we focused the energy that we \nspend on issues such as this toward redoubling our efforts in passing \nbudget resolutions and reconciliation bills on time, thereby enabling \nthe 13 appropriations bills to proceed on time, we would not have as \nmuch difficulty in enacting appropriations bills, and, in so doing, we \nwould greatly lessen the possibility of a Government shutdown.\n  No one in this body supports Government shutdowns. But what this \nproposal would do is ensure that when the going gets tough and the \nissues involved in deciding the funding levels for every activity of \nthe Government get too tough, Congress is likely to just yield to the \nmindless, automatic mechanism provided in title VII and thereby simply \ncontinue all programs, all projects, all activities--whether justified \nor not--at some arbitrary, fixed level. Even though its proponents call \nit a ``failsafe mechanism,'' it is really foolhardy.\n  Furthermore, it should be obvious to everyone that this is some type \nof political ploy, else the attempt would not be made to attach it to a \nbill that the President, naturally, would find very difficult to veto.\n  In fact, if one can believe what one reads in the press--and I don't \nbelieve everything I read in the press--the reasons for this proposal \nare set out rather starkly in an article which appeared in the April \n18, 1997, issue of a publication called Inside the New Congress. That \npublication discusses this so-called ``automatic CR'' provision under a \nheading entitled ``Automatic PR''--not automatic CR, but automatic PR. \nThat article states the following about this proposal:\n\n       The automatic CR proposal, crafted by Senators Kay Bailey \n     Hutchison and John McCain, with the blessing of GOP leaders, \n     would fund discretionary programs at 98 percent FY 1997 \n     levels in the event that a budget deal isn't agreed upon by \n     September 30.\n\n[[Page S4154]]\n\n      More simply stated, the McCain-Hutchison bill would force \n     Clinton to either compromise with Hill Republicans on a \n     fiscal year 1998 budget or stomach mandatory cuts of 2 \n     percent.\n\n  I am still quoting from the article:\n\n       ``This is 100 percent politics,'' says the Senate GOP aide \n     close to the issue. ``It's payback to the Democrats for the \n     public relations war'' [in 1995 and 1996 over the Government \n     Shutdown].\n       Anticipating certain opposition from Clinton and \n     Congressional Democrats, Gingrich and Lott apparently have \n     convinced appropriators to tuck the automatic CR bill inside \n     the popular $4 billion emergency spending package for \n     disaster relief and the troops in Bosnia. By doing so, [the \n     article goes on] Republicans will force Clinton and Hill \n     Democrats to jeopardize much-needed funds for ``the troops \n     and for poor flood victims'' to kill a ``simple measure that \n     protects citizens from a Government shutdown,'' says the \n     House leadership advisor.\n       And according to McCain [still reading from the article] \n     the GOP will dare Daschle and Democrats to filibuster the \n     legislation by attaching the automatic CR as a floor \n     amendment, even though Lott is uncertain if he has 60 votes \n     to limit debate. ``I'd love to debate them on this,'' McCain \n     said with an insidious smile, [still reading from the \n     article] ``We will win the PR war this time.''\n\n  So there you have it, Mr. President. According to this article, we \nhave in this bill a proposal that is ``100 percent politics,'' \naccording to a Senate GOP aide. ``It's payback to the Democrats for the \npublic relations war in 1995 and 1996 over the Government shutdown.''\n  Why, Mr. President, have its authors chosen this particular bill to \ninclude this political payback proposal? Because, as intimated in the \narticle I have just quoted, this is a very difficult bill to hold up. \nIt contains billions of dollars that are desperately needed across the \nNation to aid hundreds of communities and hundreds of thousands of our \ncitizens who have been devastated by natural disasters. It contains \nalmost $2 billion to support our men and women overseas in Bosnia and \nelsewhere, who are there doing their duty. They didn't ask to go. They \nare there doing their duty for our country.\n\n  So it becomes very difficult to try to fend off proposals such as \nthis which sound good and which make good PR, but which are, in \nreality, fatally flawed, cynical exercises. This particular proposal \ndoes not deserve to be enacted into law. It calls for a mindless \nexercise in setting spending levels for 1998. No further action will be \nrequired on the budget resolution. There will be no need to hold any \nmore hearings on the 1998 budget. We will not have to spend the time of \nthe Appropriations Committees in going over the justifications for each \nof the thousands of programs, projects, or activities for which funds \nare requested for 1998.\n  In fact, once this measure becomes law, we will not need the \nAppropriations Committees at all. We can simply set each year's \nspending at a percentage of the 1997 rate for the entire Federal \nGovernment and let it go at that. There will be no hearings and there \nneed be no hearings, may I say to my friend from Mississippi, who is on \nthe Appropriations Committee. There would need to be no markups and no \ntime spent by the Senate debating spending levels on the 13 regular \nappropriations bills. It could work that way. Is that where we want to \ngo?\n  Never mind the fact that some programs should be eliminated. Just \nkeep them going at last year's level anyway. And what about programs \nwhich must have increases in 1998 for reasons beyond anyone's control--\nsuch as veterans' medical care? If we fund that program on automatic \npilot at the 1997 level, we will have to drop medical care to 140,000 \neligible veterans in 1998. Is that what we ought to do?\n  I am sure the authors of the proposal will tell us that they have no \ndesire to cut veterans' medical care. They simply want to avoid \nshutting down the Government if Congress reaches an impasse on the VA-\nHUD bill for 1998. But, Mr. President, what they will not recognize is \nhow difficult it is to enact bills such as the VA-HUD bill, even \nwithout the disincentive to do so provided by this proposal. If this \nlanguage is in place, when the going gets tough, there will be less \ndesire to successfully negotiate very difficult issues between the \nHouses of Congress and with the administration. I am convinced that, \nnotwithstanding the best efforts of all parties, negotiations are much \nmore likely to fail because of this so-called ``failsafe'' proposal. \nThen, when we do, in fact, fail to enact the VA-HUD bill, the veterans' \nmedical care cut I described earlier will happen. Furthermore, this \nsame result will occur over and over again throughout the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Having said that, I do not necessarily believe that Congress will \nfail to enact the 1998 Department of Defense appropriations bill. That \nbill will make it. It is probably more likely that the DOD bill will be \nenacted without cuts. Perhaps one or two other bills will be enacted--\npossibly the legislative branch will get through so Congress itself \nwill not have to take a 2 percent cut, and maybe the District of \nColumbia bill, and perhaps the military construction bill.\n  But I believe it would be highly likely that, if this proposal is \nenacted, we will never complete action on the bills where the President \nhas asked for major increases. In other words, if we enact this \nproposal, we will have abdicated our responsibility to thoroughly \nreview and justify the taxpayers' money that we are spending each \nfiscal year.\n\n  I say to my colleagues that this is the wrong time and the wrong \nplace for such a device. There is no need to put a continuing \nresolution of this sort in place before we have even written one line \nof one appropriations bill and before we have even passed a budget \nresolution. We could consider this measure on its own at a later time. \nThat is what we ought to do, although I would certainly oppose it then. \nBut we could do that without so drastically encumbering an emergency \ndisaster bill.\n  Are we not just making absolutely sure that this important funding \nwill be delayed? Certainly, that will be the result of our actions here \ntoday, unless we strike this language from the bill. The President has \ntold me personally, by telephone, that he will indeed veto this \nsupplemental bill if it contains this automatic CR language.\n  Hundreds of thousands of Americans are suffering and are in need of \nthis assistance. They do not deserve to have their needs shackled to a \nrather obvious attempt to rig the budget and appropriations process for \nfiscal year 1998 in favor of those in this body who would like to see \nacross-the-board budget cuts to pay for very large tax breaks for the \nprivileged few in our society.\n  But, Mr. President, without disparaging the good intentions of the \nauthors of the language, this is, at best, a cynical measure and, at \nworst, it is playing games with the lives of real people who are in \ntrouble and who are entitled to expeditious assistance in their hour of \nneed.\n  Not only does this proposal show a callous disregard for the \nappropriations process and for the Appropriations Committees, but it \nalso demonstrates an insensitive, indifferent, and unsympathetic \nattitude toward the suffering of the people of 33 States that stand in \nneed of water and sewer facilities and roads and other infrastructure \nthat have been destroyed by the raging waters of great rivers. This is \nplaying politics on a bill that will help people who have lost their \nhomes, their cars, their trucks, their farm machinery, their livestock, \ntheir furniture--everything that they have worked and skimped and saved \nfor, in many instances, throughout a lifetime. It is politics at its \nworst and everyone knows that it is politics at its worst. The people \nin these 33 States need help. They need it as soon as they can get it. \nThey need it now. They needed it yesterday. They needed it a week ago. \nAnd it is grossly unfair to them to use this instrument of disaster \nrelief as a vehicle for political gain. It is cynical, and it is cruel.\n\n  I am not an advocate of the Presidential veto. I am certainly not an \nadvocate of the line-item veto. I am not an advocate, in many cases, of \na constitutional veto that the President has had for these 208 years. \nBut I believe that, in this instance, the President would be derelict \nin his duty if he did not use that constitutional weapon. And I so said \nto the President when I discussed this matter with him. I said that I \nfelt that he would be derelict in his duty if he did not strike down \nthis bill if it reaches his desk carrying this ill-conceived, ill-\nbegotten, and ill-advised proposal. I can well say with Macduff: \n``Confusion now hath made his masterpiece.''\n  This is politics run amuck.\n  So I have an amendment that is now before the Senate which will \nstrike\n\n[[Page S4155]]\n\nfrom the bill the provisions which I have discussed.\n  Before I yield the floor, I shall read a letter, or portions of a \nletter, that I received today from the Executive Office of the \nPresident, the Office of Management and Budget.\n  I will read it into the Record.\n\n       Dear Senator Byrd:\n       As the Senate continues consideration of S. 672, a bill \n     making emergency supplemental appropriations for recovery \n     from natural disasters, and for overseas peacekeeping \n     efforts, we ask that you consider the administration's views \n     on the pending amendment concerning the automatic continuing \n     resolution.\n       Prior to markup of the bill by the Senate Appropriations \n     Committee the President indicated that he would veto the bill \n     if it were presented to him with the automatic continuing \n     resolution language contained in S. 547. His reasons follow:\n       First and foremost, this bill contains $5.6 billion in \n     urgently needed disaster assistance funds for hundreds of \n     thousands of victims of recent natural disasters in 33 \n     States, and this assistance should not be delayed while the \n     Congress and the President consider a budget process issue.\n       Secondly, the McCain-Hutchinson automatic continuing \n     resolution would not provide requested funding for essential \n     investments in education, the environment, for research and \n     technology, and for fighting crime. It would also reduce \n     funding below the request for critical core Government \n     services resulting in reduced hiring of air traffic \n     controllers, Border Patrol agents, and Social Security \n     disability claims processing personnel. It would also result \n     in reductions in the numbers of women and infants served by \n     the WIC program, the number of veterans receiving medical \n     care services, and the number of kids in the Head Start \n     program. The Federal Crop Insurance Program would be \n     terminated.\n       Finally, such a continuing resolution is premature, and \n     prejudices the outcome of the bipartisan budget agreement.\n       Our recent agreement calls for the regular order, \n     implementing the agreement through reconciliation, tax and \n     appropriations measures. By enacting a continuing resolution \n     at levels significantly below the level in the agreement it \n     would allow one House--or, in the case of the Senate, a \n     minority in one House--to essentially veto an appropriations \n     bill by inaction.\n       The amendment adopted last night to provide for an \n     automatic continuing resolution at 100 percent of the FY '97 \n     enactment level does nothing to respond to these concerns. \n     Even with the amendment adopted last night, the automatic \n     continuing resolution provides resources over $20 billion \n     below the President's request, and significantly below the \n     level contained in the bipartisan budget agreement.\n       If the bill were presented to the President containing the \n     automatic continuing resolution now pending in the Senate, \n     the President would veto the bill.\n       We urge the Senate to strike the provision from the bill, \n     and as the bill moves through the process we urge the \n     Congress to remove other extraneous provisions from the bill \n     so that the President can sign the legislation making \n     available essential relief to the victims of the recent \n     disaster, and providing resources for our overseas \n     peacekeeping efforts:\n       Franklin D. Raines, Director.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from West Virginia \nat this time would be ready to enter into a time agreement of an hour \nand a half on his side and an hour on this side.\n  Mr. BYRD. I beg the Senator's pardon.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I wonder if the Senator from West Virginia would be \nprepared to consider a proposal that I mentioned to him a short time \nago, that we could enter into a time agreement on this amendment of an \nhour and a half on his side in support of the Byrd amendment and an \nhour on this side in opposition to the Byrd amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the Senator would allow me.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield for purposes of a response.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. If the distinguished Senator would be willing to include in \nhis request that I have 20 minutes additionally, I would be very glad \nto agree with the request.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I understand that would be an hour and a \nhalf for the Senator's side plus 20 minutes for Senator Byrd to speak \nhimself.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And an hour on this side.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I believe the Senator from Alaska would have to be \nconsulted. But I yield to the Senator from Mississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I would simply like to state that I think \nthe Senator from Alaska ought to be consulted. He is due to return to \nthe floor very soon. I hope the Senator would withhold seeking the \nunanimous consent request until he returns.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would be glad to. I say to the Senator from \nMississippi, I had discussed my original proposal with the Senator from \nAlaska before he left, and that is why I made the proposal. Obviously, \nwith the additional request for time on the part of the Senator from \nWest Virginia, we will wait until the Senator from Alaska returns.\n  Mr. President, I see the Senator from California on the floor who is \neager to speak. I will make my remarks relatively short.\n  I think it is important that we make a few facts clear on this issue. \nThe Senator from Massachusetts, who was on the floor before, and \nothers, will allege that there is somehow some motivation to sabotage \nthe budget agreement. Mr. President, the Senator from Indiana and I \nproposed this amendment last year. I know of no one who believes that \nthe budget was even discussed last year; not this year. It is a matter \nof record. We wanted a vote on it, and were dissuaded from doing so at \nthat time.\n  My motivation on this issue is simple. It is clear, and I can be very \nconcise about it; that is that I saw thousands of residents of my State \nwhose lives were disrupted, and in many cases destroyed, because of the \ninability of the Congress of the United States and the President of the \nUnited States to come to an agreement on appropriations bills--not a \nbudget. Let's get one thing clear. We have had a budget agreement. In \n1990, we had a budget agreement, too, I might add, which was quickly \ndestroyed and dismantled in a very short period of time. The \nappropriations process still has to be gone through.\n  We all know from previous years that many times there are riders on \nan appropriations bill, even if there is an overall spending agreement \nwhich causes the President of the United States to veto a bill.\n  As I say, my motivation is very simple. I saw the lives of hundreds \nand even thousands of people in my State, and millions all over the \ncountry, destroyed for reasons of political gain. I will freely admit \nto the Senator from West Virginia, who quoted me, that, yes, I intend \nto win this debate.\n  I will also admit to the Senator from West Virginia with rhetoric \nthat was used the last time the Government was shut down that his side \nof the aisle won the debate. The President of the United States during \nthe last debate said what they really want is to end the role of the \nFederal Government in our lives * * * which they have, after all, been \nvery open about * * * the President said. A lot of them--referring to \nRepublicans; these are the comments of the President of the United \nStates back when the Government was shut down--A lot of them will be \nhappy about this because they don't think we ought to have a Government \nup here anyway.\n  Mr. President, I found those remarks insulting. I have never said \nthat about the President of the United States. I have never said that \nabout the proponents of the Byrd amendment. I was offended. The \nrhetoric went on and on during that period.\n  While we are talking about rhetoric, ``Democrats contended that Mr. \nGingrich was being overrun by a minority of children and inexperienced \nlawmakers, and should defer to more experienced Members. It is about \ntime that adults with adult minds and adult experiences get together as \nDemocrats and Republicans and at least agree to a 3-day continuing \nresolution to get the Government working again,'' said Senator James \nExon, calling the GOP freshmen ``The Magnificent 70.''\n  Mr. President, there was a lot of rhetoric thrown around the last \ntime, and there will be on this floor. I know what the Senator from \nCalifornia and others who will speak here will say. They will allege \nthat this amendment somehow will prevent the assistance being given to \ntheir States and to their areas that are devastated.\n\n[[Page S4156]]\n\n  Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  We have agreed to a time agreement. We have been urging a time \nagreement. We have been urging quick passage of this bill.\n  If the President of the United States chooses to veto it, then that \nis his privilege and his constitutional right to do so.\n  It is also my obligation--and those Members of this Senate and the \nCongress--to make sure that what happened never happens again.\n  There are natural disasters which need to be addressed. By the way, \nas the Senator from Texas pointed out yesterday, they are being \naddressed. The money is flowing. There is no holdup in the money. \nDisaster assistance is being rendered as we speak.\n  But there are also manmade disasters. My State went through one, and \nthe Nation went through a manmade disaster. And it is equally our \nobligation to see that a manmade disaster does not happen again. And it \nwas a disaster.\n  I understand some mayors of some of the towns that are affected by \nthis latest natural disaster are here. I could bring mayors of cities \nfrom Arizona and from all over America, also who have had the lives of \ntheir citizens disrupted and destroyed because of a manmade disaster.\n  Those of us on this side of the aisle who support the prevention of a \nGovernment shutdown have the deepest and most profound sympathy, and \nare willing to do anything within the Government's power to alleviate \ntheir incredible problems that they are suffering under.\n  We also should be committed to seeing that we don't inflict on \nAmerican citizens what we did last time.\n  Later on, Mr. President, I will go through the statistics of the \nterrible tragedy that was inflicted when the Government was shut down. \nI will go through that. It has nothing to do with rhetoric. It has \nnothing to do with debate, nor political leverage. It has to do with \nharming the lives of American citizens which we did because we didn't \ncarry out our obligations to them. When we don't carry out our \nobligations, it seems to me that some of us should join in an effort to \nsee that it doesn't happen again. That is what this is all about.\n  There will be an allegation that this is premature, that we shouldn't \ndo this at this time. If we wait, as we did last year, the reason we \nwere dissuaded from passing this amendment last year was we were too \nfar down the road in the appropriations process, and it would disrupt \nthe process then.\n  So we are doing this early. We are doing it now. And we think it is \nimportant.\n  Let me point out one other thing, Mr. President, because I have heard \na lot of very interesting rhetoric already, questioning of motives, \nabout not caring, about insensitivity, and all of that.\n  I urge my colleagues to elevate it a little bit here. OK. All right. \nI don't question the motives of anybody on that side of the aisle. I \nresent it when our motives, those of us who are acting in good faith, \nare questioned.\n  The second point I want to make, finally, is, look, we have asked the \nWhite House to negotiate with us on this issue. They say, as do my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, ``We want to prevent a \nGovernment shutdown too.''\n  I again will quote later all of the lamentations and criticism of a \nGovernment shutdown that were uttered by the President of the United \nStates, and all of the Cabinet, and all of those on the other side of \nthe aisle. If we share the same goal, why can't we sit down and work \nout an agreement, an agreement that will prevent the shutdown of the \nGovernment from taking place? It seems that we should be able to do \nthat.\n  So, I, obviously, will be discussing this issue at more length. But, \nagain, I urge my colleagues. Let's not let this debate degenerate into \nname calling and questioning of motivation, which I already heard from \nthe Senator from Massachusetts.\n  By the way, I have not heard that from the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Do not accuse us of a lack of compassion; otherwise this debate will \ndegenerate into name calling and questioning motivation, which I do not \nthink will be illuminating nor in the best interests of the Senate. But \nif necessary, if necessary, obviously, we will respond, which I do not \nchoose to do.\n  Mr. President, I note the Senator from Alaska is on the floor. We \nhave been searching for a unanimous-consent agreement on this issue, so \nI will yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I do seek that we get some understanding \nabout a time limit now. I understand the Senator from California wishes \nto speak. I do not know how many others wish to speak. May I inquire of \nthe Senator from West Virginia if he understands how many on his side \nmight be willing to speak?\n  Mr. BYRD. If the distinguished Senator will yield, I understand, Mr. \nPresident, that we have seven or eight speakers on my side other than \nmyself.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We have on our side, to my knowledge.\n  Mr. McCAIN. We will need not more than an hour.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. One hour on our side will be sufficient.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Could we have an understanding how much would be used in \ntotal on that side of the aisle, I ask the Senator?\n  Mr. BYRD. If the Senator will yield, I had responded earlier to the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona indicating that I would be in a \nposition to agree to a request for 1\\1/2\\ hours on this side, plus 20 \nminutes under my control, as against 1 hour on the other side.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator and I have deep respect for the Senator from \nWest Virginia, but I understand some people are leaving at 2 o'clock, \nright after 2, and we would very much like to have the vote sometime \nsoon after 2 so they might leave; otherwise we are not going to have a \nvote on this amendment today. I urge the Senator to find some way to \nget an agreement that we can limit--even if we limit each side to 45 \nminutes now. There has been almost 2 hours spent on it so far. I think \nthat would be quite fair.\n  Is it possible we could get such an agreement to limit each side to \n45 minutes and allocate the time on each side, you being in control of \none side and I be in controlling on this side?\n  We will give the Senator an hour and take 30 minutes over here on \nthis side, so that would be 1\\1/2\\ hours from now. You have an hour and \nwe have a half-hour?\n  Mr. BYRD. Let me think about that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. You have seven speakers, I believe, plus yourself.\n  Mr. BYRD. Let me run that by my colleagues. I am sorry that Senators \nare leaving at 2 o'clock on a Thursday afternoon. We have a most \nimportant problem, a most important amendment that will be offered on \nthis bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I think there is a problem, but they will be back \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. BYRD. I will be here tomorrow.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will, too.\n  Mr. President, may I inquire of the Senator from California--I know \nshe seeks the floor--would she be willing to start the process of \nlimitation and tell us how long she will take on the bill?\n  Mrs. BOXER. If the Senator will yield, I would be delighted to keep \nmy remarks to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. May I then ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nCalifornia be recognized for 10 minutes and I recover the floor at that \ntime? Would the Senator mind that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Chair. I thank all Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, today the Senate is considering the Emergency \nSupplemental Appropriations and Rescissions Act for 1997. I am a member \nof the Appropriations Committee, which wrote this bill, and, despite my \nstrong reservations about several provisions, I voted to send the bill \nto the full Senate.\n  I voted to bring this measure to the floor because it will provide \nmuch needed assistance to my State of California, which suffered \nmassive loss and damage from the terrible winter floods a few months \nago, and is still paying for cleanup and repair of damage from 15 other \nnatural disasters in the past few years.\n\n[[Page S4157]]\n\n  Before I talk about the specifics of this bill, I would like to offer \nmy deepest appreciation to the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Stevens, and the committee's ranking member, Senator \nByrd. They and their staff have been so helpful to me and my staff in \nmaking sure this bill addresses the needs of California. I am sincerely \ngrateful for their assistance.\n  California suffered enormous losses from the winter floods this year. \nThe scope of the floods is unprecedented in modern times: Over 300 \nsquare miles of land flooded; 48 of California's 58 counties declared \nnatural disaster areas by the President; 120,000 people forced to leave \ntheir homes--the largest emergency evacuation in the State's history; 9 \nlives lost; estimated $1.8 billion in damages to property; and \nunprecedented structural damage to one of the most popular natural \nsites in the world, Yosemite National Park.\n  Californians are also still coping with losses and trying to rebuild \nafter 15 earlier natural disasters, from the Loma Prieta earthquake in \nOctober 1989, to the severe fires in southern California last October.\n  This fiscal year 1997 emergency supplemental bill will help \nCalifornia in many important ways:\n  First, emergency aid to people who need help coping with the \nimmediate impact of the floods;\n  Second, help for local governments and the State to repair or rebuild \npublic works projects, including levees, dams, roads, bridges, and \nother infrastructure;\n  Third, assistance to farmers and ranchers who have sustained damage \nand loss of land, crops, orchards, and livestock, to help them \nreestablish their businesses;\n  Fourth, funds to repair and rebuild at Yosemite Park, in order to \nmeet the needs of the more than 1\\1/2\\ million visitors it receives \neach year.\n  I ask unanimous consent to include in the Congressional Record at \nthis point a detailed list of how California will benefit from the \nbill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Disaster Assistance in S. 672 for California\n\n       1. Emergency Conservation Program, a cost-sharing \n     assistance program to farmers and ranchers whose land was \n     damaged by flooding. Funds used to clean up debris, mend \n     fences, etc. California farmers and ranchers will receive up \n     to $12 million.\n       2. Tree Assistance Program, a costsharing program to help \n     small orchard owners remove dead trees and replant. The bill \n     will provide California orchardists with approximately $9 \n     million.\n       3. Livestock indemnity program for losses of cattle, swine, \n     and other livestock, to be authorized by the Secretary of \n     Agriculture. California ranchers need to replace 11,500 head. \n     Applicants would get about 28 percent of value of each \n     animal. California ranchers could get about $1 million.\n       4. Private levee repairs and reconstruction. The bill \n     provides funds for emergency grants from the Economic \n     Development Administration, and the report allows use of some \n     of these funds for infrastructure grants, including levee \n     work. California could get $2.4 million.\n       5. Corps of Engineers repairs on dams, reservoirs, flood \n     control facilities, and other Corps projects that are under \n     direct federal control. California share is $29.9 million.\n       6. Corps of Engineers repairs of eligible federal and non-\n     federal levees damaged by floods, and also other emergency \n     operations related to the floods. California share is \n     approximately $275 million.\n       7. Bureau of Reclamation repairs of damage to certain \n     facilities during winter flooding. California will get \n     approximately $7 million.\n       8. Construction in National Parks, including Yosemite and \n     others in California. Yosemite National Park will get $176 \n     million, $9 million will go to Redwoods National Park, and \n     about a million will go to all the other parks in California, \n     for a total for California parks of about $186 million.\n       9. Emergency Relief Program, which provides money to repair \n     damage to federal aid highways from the floods. California \n     requested $331 million. The bill will provide a minimum of \n     $220 million plus another $80 million or so from previously \n     unallocated funds.\n       10. Natural Resources Conservation Service hazard \n     mitigation assistance to watersheds damaged by recent and \n     prior year disasters. California will receive some funds from \n     this program.\n       11. FEMA disaster assistance for family and individual \n     emergency assistance following disasters, and for public \n     works repairs and reconstruction following damage from \n     disasters. California will receive from the bill about $1.6 \n     billion and will receive from existing FEMA reserves another \n     $1 billion.\n       12. Devil's Slide tunnel in San Mateo County. Language in \n     the bill recognizes that the project is eligible for \n     additional FY 97 federal aid highway funds included in the \n     bill.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Unfortunately, Mr. President, this legislation contains \nseveral controversial provisions which I strongly oppose, including: \nFirst, substantive and significant changes to the Endangered Species \nAct; second, a prohibition on enforcing a new policy protecting Federal \nwilderness areas, parks and wildlife refuges from road construction; \nthird, a prohibition on implementing the most effective and least \ncostly method of taking an accurate census in 2000; and fourth, the \nautomatic continuing resolution for fiscal year 1998.\n  In addition, I believe the bill as currently written fails to provide \nenough additional funds in fiscal year 1997 for the Women, Infants, and \nChildren Nutrition Program. The President requested $100 million to \ncover shortfalls in projected caseload maintenance requirements for the \nbalance of the fiscal year. However, the bill reported by the committee \nprovides only $58 million.\n  I hope that these flaws will be corrected later in the legislative \nprocess, before the bill becomes law.\n  Regarding the automatic continuing resolution, which is title VII of \nthe bill as reported, I am extremely disappointed that this provision \nis still in the bill. I had understood that as part of the bipartisan \nbudget agreement, announced last week by the President and \ncongressional leaders, the automatic continuing would be taken out of \nthe supplemental bill and voted on separately later. I am sorry that \ndid not happen.\n  I want to start off where the Senator from Arizona left off, so \nbefore he leaves the floor let me assure him and the Senator from \nTexas--and the Senator from Texas and I did get into quite a discussion \nin the Chamber. People said to me, well, do you get along with the \nSenator? I said I really like the Senator from Texas. We just disagree \non this. I absolutely do not question anyone's motives in any way, \nshape or form. What I do question is what outcome we would have to live \nwith if the Senator's amendment were to pass.\n  So I just wanted to assure the Senators who have offered this \namendment in the committee, I do not question their motivation at all. \nWhat I question is the outcome. And as I look at the outcome, if this \nGovernment goes on automatic pilot, Californians get hurt.\n  What is interesting about that is here is a wonderful bill that is \ngoing to ease the pain of the victims of the flood, is going to ease \nthe pain of victims from disasters that occurred years ago where we are \nstill rebuilding in California, and yet there is this amendment tucked \ninto the bill, which has nothing to do with this bill, nothing to do \nwith natural disasters. Californians who have suffered mightily in the \nfloods and lost their homes and their businesses. This automatic CR \nwhich is tucked into this emergency supplemental appropriations bill \nwill cause cuts in education and a whole host of other important \nthings. So here we have a very important bill--indeed, Mr. President, a \ncrucial bill. I want to say to my colleagues from both sides of the \naisle on the Appropriations Committee, of which I am a new member, how \nmuch I appreciate the help we received from both the Republican side \nand the Democratic side in putting together this bill. It really \nanswers the call of help from North Dakota, from California, and the \nother 20 States that were hit by terrible natural disasters. The help \nwe will get to Yosemite, to our farmers, to our people for our roads \nand our highways, that help is very much appreciated.\n  What disturbed me is that added to this important bill are these \nriders that have nothing to do with the issues at hand. You had an \namendment tucked in there on the census, on the Endangered Species Act, \non allowing the States to pave over very precious parts of our national \nparks and wilderness areas, all this is tucked into this bill, \nincluding this automatic continuing resolution.\n  Now, I know, because I have been around Congress for a while, that we \ndo use these bills on occasion to add other issues, but I have never \nseen so many controversial issues added to a bill like this. We usually \ncan come together on consensus issues and add them.\n\n[[Page S4158]]\n\n  I want to address the issue that was raised by the Senator from \nArizona, and before him the Senator from Texas, who wrote this \nautomatic CR, that this is very appropriate to be attached to this \nbill, and I see my colleague is here. Her contention is that the \nGovernment shutdown was a man-made disaster, and therefore having this \nautomatic CR, if we cannot agree on appropriations bills, is very \nappropriate for this bill.\n  Now, the last time when the Senator from Texas and I got into a \nlittle debate in the Chamber the point I was making was that never in \nour history until last year did we ever have an extended shutdown of \nthe Government. We never had it under other Republican leadership and \nother Democratic leadership. We worked out our differences. We did our \njob. And I want to say very clearly for the record and for my people \nfrom California, the largest State in the Union, that I did not come \nhere to shut down this Government. I also did not come here to put this \nGovernment on automatic pilot. And to present those two choices to the \nAmerican people as the only choices that we have is presenting a false \nchoice.\n  This Constitution is very clear on the responsibilities of \nthe Congress. The rules of the Congress are very clear on how we are to \ndo our jobs: get a budget resolution to the floor in April, and after \nthat budget resolution is passed, allow the appropriators to do their \njob.\n\n  Is it an easy job? No, it is not. Does it require compromise? Yes, it \ndoes. Does it require tough debate? Yes, it does. But that is what we \nare here for. That is what we get paid to do.\n  I say to you that I am very tempted, but I did not do it, to offer an \namendment that would say if we do not pass a budget--no automatic CR, \nno easy way out--if we do not pass our appropriations bills and we come \nto another stalemate--and I know; I offered this up the last time; it \nmade me a most unpopular person--we should not get paid, just like the \nFederal employees did not get paid. But I did not choose to do that. I \nhope my colleagues would rethink this whole thing. We know what we have \nto do to avoid a Government shutdown--simply do the job we were sent \nhere to do.\n  I said before that my people would be hurt in California if this \nautomatic CR went into effect. Even though the Senators changed their \nresolution to 100 percent of fiscal year 1997 levels, we would still \nhave a reduction of about $25 billion from the President's funding \nlevels. Clearly, this is a great problem for us.\n  What it would mean to my State is very clear. College aid would be \ncut by approximately $1.26 billion nationwide, and about $126 million \nof that would be a loss for my State. My California students would \nsuffer under this automatic CR. Nationally, about 280,000 students \nwould lose their Pell grants. Those Pell grants are crucial so that our \nchildren can get an education. Under that scenario, approximately \n28,000 California students would lose their Pell grants. Aid to \napproximately 1,400 school districts would be cut; about 6.5 percent of \nthe school districts are in California.\n  Cleanup of approximately 630 Superfund sites would be delayed. Those \nSuperfund sites must be cleaned up. Approximately 80 of those sites are \nlocated in California. We would not be able to clean up 80 Superfund \nsites that are poisoning the water because the pollutants are sinking \ndown into the water supply. The CR would prevent the hiring of about \n380 new FBI agents; around 2.5 percent of those are slated for work in \nCalifornia.\n  If you ask the average person what is the enemy that we face today \nnow that the cold war is over, they will tell you cancer, they will \ntell you Alzheimer's, they will tell you heart disease. Under this \nautomatic CR, $414 million would be cut from the National Institutes of \nHealth, and that is an area where we want to increase funding. As a \nmatter of fact, I am a cosponsor of Senator Mack's bill to double the \namount that we spend on the NIH, and here we would have a cut in the \nNational Institutes of Health.\n  The American people have already told us that they want us to invest \nin education, the environment, health care, and crime prevention.\n  So, Mr. President, I do not in any way demean the reasons why my \ncolleagues from Texas and Arizona have placed this automatic CR into \nthe emergency bill. If they believe in their hearts it is good for \nAmerica, I respect their view. But I have to say I did agree with my \nchairman, Senator Stevens, in the early part of the CR, or the \nemergency supplemental bill, when he said he would prefer this to be \noffered freestanding, and then he was convinced, no, it belonged on it. \nI think he was right originally. I think we should keep controversial \namendments off this bill.\n  It is true; immediately we are not going to see a problem in the \nStates, but I want to say to my friend from Texas and to my friend from \nArizona, who have offered this, people understand that this is a delay. \nYou can stand up there all day and tell them, not a problem, but when \nthis bill is sent to the White House and the President looks, he will \nsay, I am not going to hurt education; I am not going to hurt health \nresearch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for 30 seconds to complete my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The President will look at this and say, I am not going \nto hurt the American people. We have just signed a budget deal. It \nallows us to do some wonderful things. It seems to him, I am sure, that \nit is not in very good faith to have this automatic CR when we have \njust had a budget agreement.\n  Mr. President, I hope we can take this issue off this bill, keep it \nclean, move forward, and help the people in this country. Then bring it \nback another day and give it all the debate it deserves.\n  I thank my leader, Senator Byrd, for his brilliant remarks, and I \ncertainly associate myself with his remarks as well. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Byrd amendment \nand in support of the shutdown prevention provision, the automatic CR \nin this bill.\n  The purpose of this provision is simple: To prevent another \ngovernment shutdown, in case all 13 appropriations do not become law by \nOctober 1.\n  Democrat or Republican Congresses, divided or one-party government, \nthe record has been consistent: The 13 regular appropriations bills are \nalmost never all enacted by October 1.\n  The shutdown prevention CR would take millions of innocent bystanders \nout of the line of fire if Congress and the President take longer than \nexpected to finish the budget details this fall.\n  It would protect Federal employees, small businesses supplying \nGovernment needs, patients in veterans hospitals, their families, and \nothers.\n  If the President vetoes this bill over the shutdown prevention \nprovision:\n  He is saying his power to shut down the government in October is more \nimportant to him than replenishing funds in emergency programs today.\n  He is willing to delay putting money back into FEMA and DOD and other \nessential projects in this bill.\n  He is saying he is not concerned whether disaster relief or \noperations in Bosnia or other functions are threatened by a shutdown \nthis fall.\n  Is he already planning to threaten us with a shutdown to get his way \non the budget details, as they are negotiated this summer and fall?\n  There is only one reason for opposing this provision: To keep alive \nthe threat of shutting down the Government.\n  Some Senators oppose this provision because they are afraid it might \nbe used to prevent spending increases in some programs. But, whether \nthey realize it or not, implicit in that argument is the willingness to \nuse the threat of a shutdown to get those increases.\n  The shutdown prevention provision does not undermine the budget \nagreement, it enforces it.\n  It gives the President fallback leverage in case the Congress tries \nto pass spending cuts or new policy provisions he wants to veto.\n  It gives the Congress fallback leverage in case the President demands \nunrealistic spending increases or policy changes.\n  Which would do more damage to the spirit of the budget agreement: \nTemporary, 100 percent continued funding, or a shutdown?\n  The shutdown prevention CR will not become a substitute for \nimplementing the budget agreement.\n\n[[Page S4159]]\n\n  The automatic CR is not an end result, but a safety net.\n  There are still plenty of details, priorities, cuts and increases \nthat all parties in the appropriations process will be motivated to \nwork out.\n  There very well may be some disagreements that drag out the process \nof agreeing on and implementing all the details of the budget \nagreement.\n  This provision simply ensures there will be time to work out all \nthose details, without a government shutdown looming over the \nnegotiations--and over the American people.\n  There is no spending cut here. It is incredible: We keep hearing how \nmany dollars will be slashed, how many jobs will not be filled, if we \nenact the automatic CR provision. How is it that continuing a function \nat 100 percent of current levels can be called a cut?\n  Why must this provision be passed now?\n  No matter when this provision is offered, opponents will use some \nkind of timing or procedural excuse to oppose it.\n  Now they say it's too early. This fall they would say it's too late. \nNow is the best time to enact this provision, because now it is still \nan objective, neutral safety net, and because this provision will start \nthe appropriations process with all parties on a level playing field.\n  The best time to agree on the fair rules of the game is before the \ngame starts.\n  There is no way to write a CR provision that would automatically \ncomply with the spending levels in the budget agreement, as the \nadministration suggests.\n  There are still thousands of details to be worked out over the coming \nmonths, in the normal legislative process, to implement that agreement.\n  We do not know today, for a certainty, all the programs that will go \nup and which will go down in spending in the end.\n  But this provision holds all current services and employees harmless \nuntil all those details in next year's budget are worked out.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, does the Senator seek time on this \nmatter?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I do.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We are trying to sort of reduce that time so we can get \nto the motion to table.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague, I only planned on taking an \nhour or so--5 minutes?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is trying to make me smile. Very few people \ncan do that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Wellstone be \nrecognized for 5 minutes and I retain the floor after that time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. May I make a parliamentary inquiry? Is the time now \nrunning on the time of the Senator from California and the Senator from \nMinnesota? The time, is it running against an agreement?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would say to the Senator from Texas, it \nis only running on a chart that is up here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is running against the cloture, now.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am keeping track of it, I say to the Senator from \nTexas, but I do urge I be allowed to yield 5 minutes to the Senator.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. As long as it is counting.\n  Mr. STEVENS. There is nothing for it to count against. We have not \ngot that agreement. But we will keep it in mind when we have that \nagreement.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I then ask, if the Senator will yield, if the other \nside of the equation will be able to speak as well? If there is no time \nagreement, at some point we would like to answer.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Texas next, \nbut I ask I be permitted to do this now by unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That was a unanimous-consent agreement that I have up \nto an hour to speak?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Minus 55 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, in the 5 minutes--and I thank my \ncolleague from Alaska.\n  Mr. President, I have spoken about the budget agreement on the floor \nof the Senate several times. I have said I very honestly and truthfully \nbelieve it is an agreement without a soul. I have compared the tax cuts \nover the next 10 and 20 years as we project to the future, and who is \nlikely to benefit--those at the very top--alongside the failure to \ninvest in rotting schools, invest in early childhood development; \nalongside some of the cuts in programs that affect the most vulnerable \ncitizens. And I do not see the standard of fairness. I do not see the \nsoul to this budget. I think we can do much better. I have challenged \nmy colleagues to please avoid symbolic politics and, if we are going to \ntalk about children and opportunities for children, let us make the \ninvestment.\n  Now, we have in this continuing resolution, which I am sure has been \noffered in good faith, a couple of problems. First of all, many of us--\nall of us from the States that have been affected by this flooding with \npeople who have just felt the devastation--have made the plea, please \ndo not attach extraneous amendments. If we have to deal with the \nproblem of Government shutdown--and there is not one person in the U.S. \nSenate or House of Representatives who is going to let that happen. I \nthink people learned their lesson--we can deal with that in the fall, \nif it ever should be a problem that is staring us in the face. I do not \nthink that will ever happen. But why such an amendment would be put on \na disaster relief bill where what we are trying to do is get the \nassistance to people as soon as possible so they can rebuild their \nlives, rebuild their homes, rebuild their businesses--I don't \nunderstand this. I think it is a profound mistake, and I do not believe \nthis amendment should be on this bill at all.\n  In addition, when I look at the budget agreement--and I do not think \nwe have done it nearly as well as we should for people --and now I see \nadditional, I won't even go through the statistics, additional cuts \nfrom what the budget agreement calls for in Head Start, in research at \nthe National Institutes of Health, over and over again I am faced with \nthe painful choice, and other colleagues are as well, of meeting with \npeople struggling with Alzheimer's or struggling with Parkinson's or \nstruggling with breast cancer or struggling with diabetes, and we do \nnot want one group of people who are struggling with an illness pitted \nagainst another, or struggling with mental illness --what in the world \nare we doing with a resolution that is going to cut funding for the \nNational Institutes of Health?\n  Mr. President, Meals on Wheels, a senior nutrition program --cut? \nSubstance abuse and mental health services--cut? The Centers for \nDisease Control--cut? Pell Grant Program--cut, when we know the whole \nquestion of affordable higher education is an issue that cuts across a \nbroad section of the population?\n\n  So, in the 5 minutes I have, I make two points. One, please vote \nagainst this, I say to my colleagues, because it is extraneous to what \nthe mission is, which is to get the assistance to people in Minnesota, \nthe Dakotas, and across the land who have been faced with a real \ndisaster in their lives. And, second, do not vote for this amendment \nbecause we are talking about real cuts in programs that are vitally \nimportant to families' lives in this country. And people in the country \ndo not favor these priorities. People do not want to see reductions in \nHead Start, in Pell grants, in the National Institutes of Health \nresearch on disease. People are not in favor of that.\n  This is, in a way, a back-door approach to trying to effect cuts in \nprograms that command widespread support in this country. So, I rise to \nspeak against it. I hope we will have a strong vote against this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Senator from Texas seek time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am willing to wait until we have a \ntime agreement, until the time starts running, if you would prefer. I \njust do not want to loose our ability. If I have free time, I am going \nto take it. If I do not, then I will withhold.\n\n[[Page S4160]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there is no such time agreement. Does the \nSenator from North Dakota seek time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would like, if I could, to speak for 5 minutes?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will be happy to enter into the same agreement with \nthe Senator from North Dakota, 5 minutes and I retain the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair and thank my colleague from Texas.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the Byrd amendment to strike the \nautomatic continuing resolution language in this bill. No State has \nbeen as devastated as mine by this remarkable series of weather events. \nI represent North Dakota. My State has had the greatest snowfall in its \nhistory--10 feet of snow. We were then hit in the first week of April \nwith the most powerful winter storm in 50 years, including an ice storm \nthat took down the electrical grid for 80,000 people. We were then hit \nby what we are now told is a 1,000-year flood. And to cap it off, we \nhad fires rage through downtown Grand Forks, ND, and burn up most of \nthree city blocks. A city of 50,000 people has been almost entirely \nevacuated and still, today, there are more than 25,000 homeless.\n  I do not think there has been another disaster of this type in our \ncountry's history. I do not know of another circumstance in which a \ncity of 50,000 has been mass evacuated and 3 weeks later more than half \nthe population has still not been able to return. We have just had the \nmayor of Grand Forks, ND, and the mayor of East Grant Forks, MN, here, \ntalking to our colleagues about the needs of these communities. This is \na critical moment.\n  On Monday night, these communities are going to have to make a \ndecision about their future and about what parts of the community will \nbe able to be rebuilt, and those areas that will have to be turned into \na floodway so we can prevent something like this ever happening again. \nThey need to know now what resources are going to be available and we \nhave already been told by the White House, if this provision is \nincluded, the President will veto the bill. There is no question about \nthat.\n  Frankly, he should veto the bill if this is included because it has \nnothing to do with natural disasters. Some of the sponsors of this \nlegislation have indicated they are trying to deal with a manmade \ndisaster. The manmade disaster was last year. We are addressing \nsomething that happened last year. For this year, there is a budget \nagreement. So, if they feel strongly about this measure--and I \nunderstand that they do--they have every right to advance their \nproposal. But it is not an urgent matter now. It is not an urgent \nmatter now. The manmade disaster they are talking about happened last \nyear. This year there has been a budget agreement negotiated between \nthe White House and the Congress. There is no urgency to this provision \nnow. It does not need to be on this supplemental appropriation bill \nthat is designed to deal with natural disasters. I can tell you there \nis an urgency to that bill now. These people need help.\n  We have people who have been living on cots in shelters for 3 weeks. \nWe have nearly 1,000 people who are still in that circumstance, in \nshelters, on cots, wondering what is going to happen to them.\n  I just ask our colleagues to not push amendments that are not \nnecessary to this legislation. I can just say when the shoe was on the \nother foot and they suffered disasters, we did not offer amendments \nthat were not related to disasters. We never did that. I tell you, I \nhad lots of amendments that I would have liked to have had considered \nthat were on things that mattered a lot to me, but I have always \nunderstood, and always responded to the request that disaster bills be \nclean.\n  Every single time we have had a disaster bill, I have responded to \nthat call and I just ask our colleagues to extend the same courtesy to \nthose of us who represent areas that have been devastated by disaster \nnow. Our people need help. The last thing they need is to have the \nlegislation that can help them be made some kind of political football. \nThat is not a service to those people who are hurting and need \nassistance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Senator from Texas now seek time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yes, Mr. President. I would just say, unless the \nother Senator from North Dakota was seeking time right after his \ncolleague, I will yield. Otherwise I will take 2 or 3 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Senator from North Dakota seek time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will wait until the Senator is finished.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I request 5 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I renew my request that following the Senator from \nTexas, I be permitted to gain the floor after 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to thank both the distinguished \nleader of this effort, Senator Stevens, and Senator Byrd, for working \nwith us to try to get this bill through because it is very important. \nAnd that has been mentioned this morning. We want to make sure that we \nget the disaster relief fund replenished. But I think there are a \ncouple of points that need to be made.\n  I want to respond to my colleague from California, to say we are, \nindeed, friends and we do work on many issues together. I think it is \nvery important that we be able to have debates between friends and know \nthat we disagree on principle and that is exactly what we should do, is \ndisagree on principle without being disagreeable. I think that is very \nimportant for all of us to remember.\n  I want to refute a few points that have been made. First, my \ncolleague from North Dakota talks about the people needing help, and he \nis absolutely right. It is very important that everyone understand that \nthe people are getting help. They are getting all of the disaster \nrelief to which they are entitled under the law right now. In fact, \nthey are getting more than other disaster victims in our country have \nreceived because we have seen the terrible pictures. The President made \na commitment that they would get 100 percent relief, and they are \ngetting that right now.\n\n  You see, Mr. President, this bill is not about helping the people who \nare in need right now; they are being helped. This bill is to replenish \nthe coffers for future disasters, and that is what we are talking \nabout. So there is no money being held up at this point, or in a week. \nWhat we are talking about is replenishing the coffers for future \ndisasters that have not yet occurred.\n  But when we talk about the difference between a natural disaster, \nwhich has occurred in North Dakota, and a manmade disaster, which \noccurred in 1995 and which we are now trying to avoid, they are both \ndeeply moving disasters that need to be addressed, because people who \ncannot go to work or people who have planned for a family vacation that \nthey can no longer take, or people who are worried about getting their \nveterans' benefits because the Government is shut down are in just as \nmuch distress as someone who has been a victim of a natural disaster. \nSo I do not think it is in any way fair not to equate the impact on \npeople's lives if they do not think they are going to be paid or if \nthey do not think they are going to get their veterans' benefits.\n  Second, I think it is important when we talk about cuts--and I heard \ndiscussion this morning about cuts that we would provide in this \ncontinuing resolution. There are no cuts. There has not been a budget \nagreement that has gone through this Congress. We have not talked about \nthe specific appropriations that would go for Meals on Wheels or Pell \ngrants. This Congress has not acted at all on any appropriations for \nthe 1998 year, so there are no cuts.\n  There are no cuts to Meals on Wheels; there are no cuts to Pell \ngrants. In fact, what we are saying is that we are setting the \nprocess--and that is why it is so important that we do this now rather \nthan later--we are setting the process for how we will appropriate. \nThis is the first appropriations bill that has come out of the \ncommittee in the process and on to the floor. So we are trying to set \nthe process that says how we will respond if all\n\n[[Page S4161]]\n\nof the appropriations bills are not finished by September 30, which is \nthe end of the fiscal year.\n  What we are saying is that funding will go forward just as it has for \nall of this year. There is not one dime of a cut. It will go forward at \nthe present spending levels. Then, as Congress decides the priorities, \nalong with the President in an agreement, which is exactly how we do \nthings around here, then that appropriations bill will go into effect. \nBut if there is not an agreement between Congress and the President, \nthen we will keep Government functioning just as it has been this year \nuntil the priorities are set by Congress and the President.\n  No one will have a hammer over anyone's head. The appropriators will \nhave their full rights, Members of Congress will have their full \nrights, the President will have his full rights, and everyone will be \nable to go forward in an orderly process from which they can plan. That \nis why we are doing this now.\n  Why would we wait until an appropriations bill that might come \nforward in June or July? Why would we wait? Why would we not plan for \nthe future? All of us admit that the shutting down of Government does \nnot work; it disrupts people's lives. We are trying to prevent that \nnow, while keeping the prerogatives of Congress and keeping the \nprerogatives of the President to negotiate in good faith on principle \nabout what the priorities in spending will be.\n  Yes, there is a budget resolution that will come to Congress that \nwill set the general guidelines, but even after that is set, we do not \nknow what the priorities are yet. We do not know how much money will be \nspent on Pell grants. We do not know how much money will be spent for \nMeals on Wheels because Congress has not spoken.\n  So what we are trying to do is have an orderly transfer from the end \nof the fiscal year to the beginning of the next fiscal year without \ndisruption, without people worrying about whether they are going to be \npaid or whether they are going to receive their veterans' benefits.\n  But make no mistake--there are two very important points --people \nneeding help in North Dakota are getting help; the people who are on \ncots are there because the help is there and they are going to get the \nhelp in rebuilding their homes and businesses, just as the law allows. \nMake no mistake that that is the case. And if you believe Government \nshould not shut down, then you should vote against the amendment put \nforward by the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I inquire of the Senator from North \nDakota now if he wishes to speak.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will be delighted to yield to the Senator. Can we make \nit 5 minutes in the normal process here? Does the Senator seek more \nthan 5 minutes?\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I had sought 10 minutes, but I will try to \nshorten it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is fine. I will be happy to accommodate the \nSenator's request. I ask unanimous consent for the same procedure then, \nthat I yield to the Senator from North Dakota 10 minutes and recover \nthe floor when he is finished.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague from North Dakota, Senator \nConrad, spoke a few moments ago about what is in this supplemental bill \nto provide appropriations for the disaster that has occurred in our \nregion of the country.\n  I rise today to support the amendment offered by the Senator from \nWest Virginia, Senator Byrd. He is trying to strike a provision in this \ndisaster relief bill that has been included that has no relationship to \nthe need for this bill to provide some help to folks around the country \nwho need help. I really believe that we need to move without delay to \nget this bill enacted and get the help to those who need it in our \ncountry.\n  I am not critical of anyone else's efforts on the floor of the \nSenate. I only am here to urge that we not include this provision, \nwhich does not belong in this bill. It is included in this bill in a \nway that delays the bill and, quite likely, will provoke a Presidential \nveto. I implore those who feel strongly about this proposal to bring it \nup another time, bring it another day, bring it next week on another \nbill, but do not delay this piece of legislation.\n  I have a lot of people who have come to me, as they have, I am sure, \nto my colleague from North Dakota, and they said, ``Did you see the \nmovie `Fargo'?'' Especially around the Academy Award time, ``Did you \nsee the movie `Fargo'?'' A lot of people apparently saw the movie \n``Fargo.'' It was a Hollywood caricature of our region of the country, \nset with some drama on the movie screen.\n  But a real-life drama has occurred in North Dakota, Minnesota, and \nSouth Dakota that is the most significant tragedy, in my judgment, that \nhas occurred in our State. Short of massive loss of life, it is the \nmost significant tragedy that has occurred in the history of our State. \nIt is a drama full of tragedy, heartbreak, broken dreams and, at the \nsame time, full of strength, courage, and hope.\n  What has occurred? My colleague from North Dakota described it: 3 \nyears worth of snow dropped in 3 months on our State, the last storm \nbringing nearly 2 feet of snow in about 36 hours, with 50-mile-an-hour \nwinds. When the combination of all that snowfall, 3 years worth of \nsnow, began to melt in the Red River Valley, it flooded the valley, and \nthe Red River exceeded its banks quickly and dramatically and was \nhigher than at any other time in history.\n  The city of Grand Forks, ND, for example, was 95 percent evacuated, a \ncity of 50,000 people that was virtually a ghost town and under water. \nIn the city of East Grand Forks across the river, 9,000 people are out \nof their homes. The entire city was evacuated.\n  And if you could go to Grand Forks and East Grand Forks today, what \nyou would find at Grand Forks is 25,000 people still homeless. In East \nGrand Forks, not one of the 9,000 people is back in town, according to \nthe mayor. You have a city empty and a city across the river that is \nhalf empty.\n  Where are those 25,000 people? They woke up in a bed or cot that was \nnot in their homes. They are displaced. Many of them have lost their \nhomes. Hundreds of them will never go back to their homes because their \nhomes are destroyed.\n  We are told, well, we want to help, and I very much appreciate the \nhelp that has been offered in the Senate. Our colleagues, Senator \nStevens, Senator Byrd and so many others have said, Let us help. I have \nbeen willing to do that on every occasion I have been in Congress, to \nextend a helping hand to offer hope to people who have suffered through \nfloods, fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, and more. Now the \nrest of this country through this Congress is extending a helping hand \nto the folks in our region, to give them cause for hope, to allow them \nto believe they can rebuild their dreams.\n\n  Is it urgent we get this done soon? Yes, it is. As I said, 25,000 \npeople in Grand Forks alone woke up this morning not in their own \nhomes, but someplace else--a shelter, a cot, a friend's home, a \ndifferent city.\n  Is it urgent that we finish this bill? Is it urgent that the badly \nneeded appropriations in this bill can be used to offer hope to those \nfolks, to help rebuild, to recover? It is urgent that this be done and \nbe done now.\n  Adding controversial amendments to this bill delays the bill. Adding \ncontroversial amendments, as was done in the committee, especially with \nrespect to the provision that is now the subject of the motion to \nstrike, delays this bill. For the sake of those thousands of North \nDakotans, Minnesotans, and South Dakotans who have suffered this \nterrible tragedy, and for the sake of many others in this country for \nwhom disaster relief appropriations are in this bill to meet their \nneeds, for their sake we should not seek to further delay this bill.\n  Let us support the motion to strike. Let us take this provision out \nof this legislation, pass the legislation, have the President sign the \nlegislation and deliver this message of hope, and deliver these \nappropriations that offer real hope, to the people of a region who so \ndesperately need it.\n  There are some who say, Well, we are doing the right thing. I would \nsay to\n\n[[Page S4162]]\n\nthem that they need to understand that it is not urgent that this \nprovision be done now; it can be done later, we can add it to something \nelse. As for the disaster relief aid in this bill, it is urgent that it \nbe done now. Having controversial amendments in this bill, amendments \nthat will provoke a veto, will delay this urgently needed help.\n  Let me end as I began. I do not come here to be critical of others. I \ngreatly respect every Member of this body. I thank so much the chairman \nand the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee and all of the \nothers with whom I have worked to address these real human needs. Now I \nsimply ask that the Senate decide, as it has so often in the past, that \non an appropriations bill that is designed to reach out and help \nvictims of disaster, that we should not do anything to impede or delay \nthat help.\n  So, for that reason, I am happy to rise today to support the motion \nto strike offered by Senator Byrd.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I do retain the floor, Mr. President. Does the Senator \nfrom New Jersey seek time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom New Jersey be given 10 minutes and that I retain the floor at that \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee for making sure we have a chance at a full \ndebate on this issue.\n  I am strongly opposed to this so-called automatic CR, and, if I may \nsay, barring none others from competing, when it comes to understanding \nthe rules and understanding the process, there is no better informed \nSenator than the senior Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, who \nis the ranking member of this Appropriations Committee, and his \nleadership tells us that we better look out, that we better know what \nwe are talking about.\n  I am deeply dismayed that we are debating this provision just a few \ndays after we reached an agreement on the outlines of a 5-year balanced \nbudget. Mr. President, I am the senior Democrat on the Budget Committee \nand, as such, have been relegated a relatively awesome task of trying \nto find a consensus that would enable us to get the Government going, \nto keep us from getting into these disputes year after year, but have \nan honest debate and a review, a determination of the importance of the \nissues.\n\n  We worked very hard over the last few months to try and get the \noutlines of a balanced budget. We are not there yet, but I think we \nhave all of the ingredients to finally say yes. We did agree last \nFriday that we have the makings of a budget resolution for the next 5 \nyears. It would bring us to a zero deficit balance and take care of the \nprograms, as best we could, that we care about.\n  The automatic CR, on the other hand, could force deep cuts in \neducation, environment, health, research, and crime fighting and \ncontradict the agreement that we just arrived at.\n  Mr. President, I consider it an abandonment of our constitutional \nresponsibility. It is so nice to take your fingerprints off the deal \nthat you may not like. It is so nice to back away and say, we are going \nto do it automatically. That is not why people sent us here, not to do \nit automatically but to put our reputations on the line, to put our \nthoughts on the line, and let us work out what we think is the proper \ndirection for the funding in our Government.\n  I worked with distinguished counterparts in this budget decision--\nSenator Domenici, the chairman of the Budget Committee; Congressman \nKasich, the chairman of the House Budget Committee; Congressman Spratt, \nthe ranking Democrat in the Budget Committee; and the administration \nofficials at length to negotiate a budget agreement.\n  We had lots of policy differences. But we worked through them in good \nfaith. And we worked through them without producing such a hostile \nenvironment that we could not talk to one another, because it was \ncarefully thought out. It was balanced with everybody's views and \nconcerns. But part of this agreement includes a level of discretionary \nspending for fiscal year 1998, and for the following 4 years.\n  It is not easy to reach agreement on these matters, but we did \ndespite all of the hard work to reach a compromise on discretionary \nspending. This automatic CR could change these levels only days after \nwe made the agreement. With this type of development, I am afraid we \nwill never finish implementing this agreement, this budget agreement.\n  It is not surprising that the President said that he will veto this \nbill if the Republican leadership insists on retaining this amendment \nto the bill. We ought to strip out this amendment immediately and pass \nthe supplemental appropriations bill. Just look at the critical funding \nthat we are providing in this supplemental.\n  We heard the distinguished Senator from North Dakota describe the \nconditions that people are forced to exist under. And it touched all of \nour hearts when we saw the pictures, when we understood what it must be \nlike to lose a home, to lose your roots, to lose your pictures, to lose \nthe memorabilia, to lose all the history that a family goes through, \nthings that are so precious. And where do you go in the next phase? \nPeople do not know.\n  They are saying to us, ``Help us out, America. We are an integral \npart. We're there when you need us. We're there to pay our bills. And \nwe're there to fight for the country. And let us have the resource to \nrebuild our lives a little bit.'' We all want to do it. So why do we \nget entangled with this extraneous matter at this point?\n  We are also talking about more support for our troops in Bosnia. That \nis a tough job. Who here wants to walk away from that responsibility? \nWho here wants to say, ``Well, we have our troops there, but we're not \ngoing to give them their resources they need''? I doubt if anyone \nreally wants to say that.\n  If the Republican majority insists on pushing this legislation, we \nought to consider it as a stand-alone bill. Let us debate it. Let us \nreview what is in there, and not hold this supplemental appropriations \nbill hostage.\n  Mr. President, if the automatic CR became law, the American people \ncould pay a steep price. Compared to the President's budget, the budget \nax could fall on many critical programs. Under the automatic CR, cuts \nare possible in the following programs:\n  Do we want to risk programs like Pell grants, sending kids to college \nwho otherwise cannot afford to go?\n  Do we want to risk cutting NIH funding where research is so precious, \nso essential?\n  Ryan White AIDS services. We are beginning to see some diminishment \nof the immediate death from AIDS. We are beginning to see life \nextended.\n  Do we want to stop those programs?\n  Who wants to put your family on an airplane if we have to cut back on \nFAA safety and security programs? Who wants to run that risk?\n  We have EPA operations. They are able to respond to emergencies, oil \nspills, things of that nature. Do we want to run the risk of cutting \nback when we may need that kind of emergency assistance?\n  Mr. President, the automatic CR is also, in my view, an abandonment \nof our constitutional responsibility. Our constituents sent us here to \nmake decisions about our Nation's priorities. They expect us to \nconsider and review carefully appropriations bills, spending bills, \ndebate them, amend them and pass them in a way that meets the full \nblush of sunlight and meets their health, education, and other needs. \nThis automatic CR would take a mindless meat ax--could take a mindless \nmeat ax to 13 appropriations bills. It is not a very good way to decide \nour country's priorities.\n\n  Mr. President, my Republican colleagues--and I respect them, but \nchallenge their judgment on this one--argue if we do not pass the \nautomatic CR we will have another Government shutdown. This is not the \ncase. If we do our work we can pass most appropriations bills by \nOctober 1. And if we cannot pass them by that date we can pass a short-\nterm continuing resolution that will allow us to finish all 13 bills. \nThat is not the best way to do it. The\n\n[[Page S4163]]\n\nbest way to do it is get it done. We have done this numerous times in \nthe past and have avoided any disruption of Government services.\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge the Republican leadership to remove \nthis onerous provision. This threatens the foundation of the entire 5-\nyear budget agreement. If the majority does not budge soon on this \nissue, the whole budget deal could collapse, and we may never have a \nbalanced budget, a children's health initiative, or any of the tax cuts \nthat are also agreed upon though in some cases reluctantly. But it is a \nconsensus. Is that where we want to go? I do not think so, Mr. \nPresident. I hope that my colleagues will stand up, analyze the \nsituation carefully, and support Senator Byrd in his effort to strike \nthis from the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is my understanding that the Senator from California \nwishes some time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time would the Senator like or would settle \nfor?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Is it possible to have between 5 and 10 minutes?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will be happy to yield to the Senator 5 minutes-plus. \nWe will try to run it if we can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. As usual, I request that I retain the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank you, Mr. President.\n  And I thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee.\n  I rise to support the Byrd position. I believe that to take an \nautomatic cut of an additional $25 billion in real terms with the \nconstraints of this budget would be extraordinarily difficult.\n  Mr. President, I have just in the last few days participated in \nseveral initiatives with respect to cancer, and appeared before Senator \nSpecter's subcommittee on cancer and heard members on both sides of the \naisle speak to the goal of doubling cancer research over the next 5 \nyears. I think if this CR remains, any additional dollars for critical \nhealth research is really condemned.\n  Additionally, many of us believe that the bipartisan White House-\nCongress concordat bringing to this body a bipartisan plan to balance \nthe budget was to be without the CR attached. So just a week ago both \nsides were cheering about this budget deal. Given the optimism \nsurrounding the announcement, I think it is somewhat disingenuous to \ninclude the automatic CR in this legislation.\n  I think all of us want to avoid another Government shutdown and are \nwilling to do almost anything to prevent a repeat of 2 years ago. But \nthe way to do that is simple. Do what is necessary to pass an \nappropriations bill on time. And that means compromise. No one wants a \nGovernment shutdown. And the fact that a year-long CR was eventually \npassed following the last shutdown shows that reasonable minds are \ncapable of reaching compromise when there is a will.\n  The automatic CR essentially means that we do not have to pass \nanother appropriations bill this year. Conceivably we could all pack up \nand go home. However, the budget deal struck is going to require some \nvery tough decisions, difficult negotiations, some forced compromises. \nNot everyone is going to get what they want, but I think we all \nrecognize that in the interest of getting the job done we are prepared \nto sublimate some of our priorities.\n  The President said he would veto this bill if the automatic CR \nprovision is included when it hits his desk. I cannot think of any \nclearer reason to drop this then from the bill. The emergency funding \ncarried in this bill is simply too important.\n  This is a big bill. About $3.4 billion of it goes to California. \nAdditionally, it goes really to people who are just destitute. And we \nhave about 9,000 miles of delta levees, and we have had almost 100 \nlevee breaks, 62 of them substantial. You had areas, 15 square miles, \nflooded, homes up to their rooftops, orchards of 14,000, 15,000, 16,000 \ntrees at a crack just lost, people losing their homes and their \nlivelihoods.\n\n  I really earnestly implore this body not to complicate this bill by \nattaching the CR.\n  If the CR is added, there are other things that happen as well.\n  We have a proposal for 500 additional border guards in 1998. That is \non hold; 544 FBI agents delayed; the FAA unable to hire 500 air traffic \ncontrollers and 173 security personnel; Pell grants cut by $1.2 \nbillion; funding of Goals 2000 cut by $97 million; Title 1 education, \nwhich goes to educate the poorest of youngsters at a time when \neverybody believes education is a top priority, cut by $320 million; \nand NIH, cancer research or death-inducing disease research could be \ncut by $414 million.\n  So, from the California perspective--I know my colleague and friend, \nSenator Boxer spoke to this earlier: 48 out of our 58 counties were \ndeclared disaster areas--this money is important. It should go. So I am \nhopeful that the majority will remove the request for the CR.\n  I am happy to rise to support the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding the Senator from South Dakota \nseeks time.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. That is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I beg your pardon. I am in error.\n  Mr. President, let me apologize to the Senator from South Dakota. I \ndid commit to the Senator from Minnesota that I would yield to him 6 \nminutes at this time. And I yield the floor for 6 minutes so he might \nhave the floor for 6 minutes, with the same understanding that I retain \nthe floor at the end of that time.\n  At this time let me have an understanding with the Senator from South \nDakota that he would automatically be recognized before I be recognized \nagain.\n  How much time does the Senator from South Dakota seek?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Two minutes for now.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is very conservative. It is nice to see one \non the floor.\n  Two minutes for the Senator from South Dakota, and then I retain the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 6 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I would like to make a few brief comments about the \nGovernment shutdown prevention plan contained within the supplemental \nappropriations that would protect flood victims and every American \nwhose paycheck depends upon the Federal Government by preventing future \nshutdowns of the Federal Government.\n  In the 104th Congress, as a result of disagreements between Congress \nand the President during the budget process, we witnessed the longest \nshutdown of the Federal Government in history. The shutdown created \nenormous financial damage, emotional distress, and just plain \ninconvenience for millions of Americans. Hundreds of thousands of \nAmericans could not receive their social services, such as Medicare \nbenefits, or travel overseas, or visit national parks and museums. \nSmall business owners and local communities lost millions of dollars. \nFederal employees were furloughed with the fear of not getting paid. \nEven our troops stationed overseas were affected by the shutdown.\n  But the most serious damage caused by the 27-day shutdown was that it \nshook the American people's confidence in their Government and elected \nofficials. We have not yet undone that damage, but we have the \nopportunity to do that today. We need to restore the public's faith in \nits leaders by demonstrating that we have, indeed, learned from our \nmistakes.\n\n  Now, we can all point fingers at who was the cause of this shutdown. \nBut the inclusion of the Government shutdown prevention plan will send \na clear message to the American people that we will no longer allow \nthem to be held hostage in future budget disputes between Congress and \nthe White House.\n  I am surprised by the opposition to this plan, and one has to ask the \nquestion, why would they oppose it? Each of us have differences in \nphilosophy on policy and budget priorities. Often we\n\n[[Page S4164]]\n\ndo not necessarily agree on these priorities, but there are essential \nfunctions of the Federal Government that provide critical services to \nthe American people, and those services must continue, regardless of \nour budget differences.\n  Now, consider the devastation caused by the flooding in Minnesota and \nthe Dakotas in recent days. I have heard some declare that the \nsupplemental appropriation that is before us today will be the answer \nto all of our problems. That could not be further from the truth.\n  What would happen if a budget shutdown in Washington forced a \nGovernment shutdown just as it did 2 years ago? Minnesotans who have \nstruggled against the floods could find themselves victimized a second \ntime if their rebuilding efforts were stopped. This natural disaster \nhas already been an exhausting nightmare for Minnesotans, and we cannot \ntolerate a manmade disaster on top of it.\n  Mr. President, I will work not to allow the citizens of Minnesota to \nbe used as chips in some sort of high-stakes budget contest. Therefore, \nI support the critical provision within the disaster relief bill that \nwill prevent a future Government shutdown. I believe this is the only \nway to stop the politics, to ensure that Congress and the President are \ncommitted to keeping the Government open, and protect our flood victims \nfrom any gamesmanship in Washington.\n  Now, last Friday, a budget agreement was reached between the White \nHouse and negotiators in Congress, and as a result some of my \ncolleagues have argued there is no longer any need for this language. \nWell, if they did not intend to use the threat of a shutdown as a tool \nto extract more of what they want in budget talks, why would they \noppose it?\n  I think a provision like this is kind of like insurance. We always \nhope we never need it, but it would be there if we did.\n  Last week's agreement does much to take the political pressure away \nfrom the current debate, which would allow us to focus more on the \nmerits and the necessity of the shutdown prevention language and \nwhether it is sound policy to have such a plan in place to prevent \nfuture shutdowns. More often than not, the lack of a Government \nshutdown prevention plan has yielded a ``money grab'' at the end of \neach fiscal year, as Members take advantage of the last-minute rush to \npass a budget and avoid a shutdown by loading it up with pork projects. \nThe merits of the spending are not debated at all, and programs are \nfunded based not on merits but, many times, on political leverage. As a \nresult, billions of hard-earned taxpayers dollars are wasted in the \nprocess.\n  Mr. President, the American people should not be held hostage to the \nefforts of those who want to keep alive the threat of future Government \nshutdowns for their own political purposes. We cannot allow for the \npossibility of a Government shutdown in the future that would prevent \nus from addressing the longer term needs of those Minnesotans who are \ntrying to rebuild their lives in the wake of the flood. We must ensure \nwe have a plan in place that will keep the Government up and running in \nthe event the budget agreement is not reached.\n  Again, Mr. President, the Government shutdown prevention plan is \nsound policy. It is wise policy. It is also responsible policy. It is \nthe right priority. And, by the way, it cuts nothing, and it allows the \nGovernment to do its job.\n\n  I urge all my colleagues to vote against the Byrd amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the motion to \nstrike by the Senator from West Virginia, and I thank, as well, the \nwork and support from the Senator from Alaska on this matter.\n  Mr. President, there is a tremendous amount of pain and suffering \nacross many States of the Union. In my State of South Dakota, where \nthousands of people have been evacuated, many are still not back in \ntheir homes, contamination of flood water is present, hundreds of \nthousands of livestock have been lost, businesses have been shut down, \nroads are still under water, there has been incredible damage to \nculverts and bridges, and public schools have suffered.\n  This is no time to use the suffering of these people as a point of \nleverage to compel this Congress and the President of the United States \nto accept an extraneous budget amendment. As a member of the Budget \nCommittee, I welcome an opportunity to debate those who believe there \nought to be a reduction in aid to schools, kids nutrition programs, law \nenforcement, environmental protection, or cancer research, among other \nitems, that ought to be reduced. I welcome that debate. That is what \nthis institution is for.\n  But South Dakotans wonder, as I think Americans wonder, why can't \nthis Congress handle one issue at a time rather than tying extraneous \nissues onto bills of incredible urgency? Let us deal with this disaster \nin a constructive, positive and bipartisan way, and then take up the \nbudget issues that have been raised by the CR issue in a separate \ncontext, and have a full-blown debate on the real consequence of these \nbudget priorities. Some, no doubt, will win, and some may lose, but let \nthem be debated separately and not try to tie the President's hand, not \ntry to use the suffering of thousands of people in this country as a \npoint of leverage for an agenda that he cannot accept and which will \nonly in the end delay the urgent assistance so badly needed in my State \nof South Dakota and in some 30 other States, as well, as a result of \nthe natural disasters that we have faced over these last several \nmonths.\n  I think this is simply a matter of equity and of fairness. We seem to \nbe in the process of reaching a bipartisan budget agreement. That is a \nhelpful step. We should take each process, one at a time, in its \nrightful order, and deal with this disaster now, and then deal in a \ntimely fashion with the rest of the budget priority issues in their \norder.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the Senator \nfrom South Dakota. I did not mean to limit his time. He asked for 2 \nminutes, and he got 2 minutes. Would the Senator like more time?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. That was fine.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I notice the leader is here, and I know \nhe has leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I appreciate very much the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska, and I will use my leader time.\n  I want to talk to the amendment, as well. But I first want to express \nprofound appreciation to the two managers of the bill. Senator Stevens \nand Senator Byrd have done an incredible job in dealing with the array \nof needs that the country has demonstrated and that we have brought to \ntheir attention. They have been remarkably responsive in addressing \nthese needs, to the extent that our resources allow. I want to publicly \npraise both our leaders in this regard and thank them for their \nextraordinary response thus far.\n  I also want to thank the staff director of the Committee on \nAppropriations, Mr. Steve Cortese, for his helpfulness and his \nwillingness to consider the needs of States like mine that have been \ndevastated by disasters. He has performed admirably in his new role, \nand we look forward to working with him in the future. I would also \nlike to thank the Democratic staff director, Mr. Jim English, for his \nfine work in putting this package together.\n  We can finish this bill easily this afternoon. I expect we can come \nto a conclusion with the remaining amendments. I only hope somehow even \nbefore we vote on final passage, we can come to some conclusion about \nthis extraneous provision.\n  I cannot agree more heartily with the Senator from South Dakota, my \ndistinguished junior colleague, in his remarks about the repercussions \nthat this amendment could have and the extraordinary divisiveness in \nwhat otherwise has been a remarkably bipartisan effort, with Senators \non both sides of the aisle responding to a natural disaster in so many \nparts of the country, that has to be addressed by this legislation. \nThis is not the place for this. There is a way with which all of us can \nassure that there will never be another Government shutdown.\n  Those of us on this side of the aisle warned about Government \nshutdowns\n\n[[Page S4165]]\n\nlong ago and did as much as possible to prevent them when they \noccurred. We can commit our determination, we can commit our \nwillingness in every way, legislatively and otherwise, to assure that \nthere will not be a Government shutdown. We will do everything in our \npower to prevent another one.\n  To hold this bill hostage to finding a mechanism to prevent one, to \nhold this bill hostage and tell all the people who are waiting, as we \nspeak, for assistance, that that cannot happen until we resolve this \nparticular problem, in my view, is a travesty. It sends exactly the \nwrong message about how cognizant we are of the urgency of this \nlegislation.\n  I am troubled not only by the fact that it is on this bill, but by \nthe proposal itself as it is now structured. I am troubled for three \nreasons. First of all, the level set, the 100-percent level of last \nyear's appropriated amount, is substantially below the amount that we \nhave just agreed in bipartisan budget negotiations would be the \ninvestments we make in education and in health care, in safe streets, \nin agriculture, in transportation, and in the array of investments that \nwe spent so much time negotiating over the course of the last month.\n  What does this say to those who have committed, now, as this Senator \nhas, to that agreement? That we did not mean it? That, indeed, we are \nwilling now to settle for investments substantially below those that we \nagreed to just last week? That is what we are saying with this \nparticular level of commitment in a continuing resolution, that it does \nnot matter what we agreed to, because now we are going to submit to a \nmuch lower level.\n  That means 285,000 students lose Pell grants, 37,000 kids are cut \nfrom Head Start, 20,000 workers are dislocated from job training, 1,400 \nschool districts lose aid, 640 Superfund sites do not get any help, 960 \nNIH research projects will be killed, public safety and crime \nprevention will be affected, 350 fewer air traffic controllers would be \nhired, and 390 fewer FBI agents would be hired.\n  Mr. President, we understood the need for a commitment in all of \nthose and many other areas. For us now to negate that is very \ntroubling. That is point one.\n  Point two: There will be needs that we must address in the future \nthat we do not yet know about. We just had a discussion this morning by \nRepublicans and Democratic Senators representing States most directly \naffected by this disaster. We all recognize that we do not know what it \nis we are going to be doing in the coming months with regard to this \ndisaster because we do not know yet what the circumstances will bring. \nBut we do know this: Because we cannot predict it all, we know we will \nhave to go back again. We will have to talk to the distinguished \nSenator from Alaska, we will have to talk and consult with the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, we are going to be back again \nwith corrections, with a need for additional commitments that we cannot \ncontemplate now. To lock in a continuing resolution, to say we are not \ngoing to be cognizant, we are not going to be responsive to those \nparticular needs this fall does a real disservice to the bill itself.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this is an exercise in futility. That is what \nis most disconcerting. The President said he will be compelled for the \nreasons I just stated to veto this bill. I have a letter, signed by 38 \nU.S. Senators, who will commit to sustaining that veto.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in the Record at \nthis time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 6, 1997.\n     The President,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: As you know, the Senate Committee on \n     Appropriations attached an automatic continuing resolution to \n     S. 672, the emergency supplemental appropriations bill. \n     Congress should not hold disaster assistance to 33 states \n     hostage to any political agenda. We applaud you for \n     expressing your intention to veto the bill unless the \n     Republican majority drops this extraneous provision.\n       There is no justification for holding up the disaster \n     relief bill over an automatic plan to cut spending now that \n     we have reached a bipartisan agreement for a five-year budget \n     plan which includes fiscal year 1998 discretionary budget \n     levels. It is inappropriate and premature to use the \n     disaster-relief bill as a vehicle to lock-in next year's \n     budget before Congress has even begun consideration of a \n     budget resolution for FY 1998.\n       While we opposed the 1995-96 government shutdowns and will \n     oppose all future efforts to shut down the federal \n     government, passage of a new budget gimmick is not the \n     answer. This provision would place the entire discretionary \n     budget on automatic pilot. Far from making the government \n     more accountable, this approach would actually make it easier \n     for Congress to abdicate its responsibility. Instead of \n     making the difficult choices needed to pass an appropriations \n     bill, Congress could make no decisions and watch passively as \n     funding for everything in the bill is automatically and \n     indiscriminately reduced. The reductions would amount to 2 \n     percent from this year's funding level and an average of 7 \n     percent reduction from your request.\n       Congress has never resorted to such desperate measures in \n     the 220-year life of this Nation, and we shouldn't resort to \n     them now. This is no way to run the federal government.\n       Not only would such a provision abrogate Congress' \n     constitutional responsibility to enact spending bills, but it \n     would decimate programs that are vital to our nation's \n     economy, and to working families. It could gut funding for \n     education, the environment, health care, agriculture, \n     transportation, veterans, crime prevention and other urgent \n     needs of the American people.\n       Last year, the Republican majority held government workers \n     and their families hostage to their demands for cuts in \n     education, the environment, health care and crime prevention. \n     This year, they may try to hold the victims of disaster \n     hostage to a budget scheme that would install cuts in those \n     programs automatically.\n       If you veto this bill over an automatic continuing \n     resolution, we would vote to sustain the veto.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tom Daschle,\n     Robert C. Byrd,\n       And 36 other Democratic Senators.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this veto ought not be necessary. This \nveto ought not even be necessary to consider today. This veto \nrepresents a determination by the President that this Congress do the \njob for which we were all sworn to do. We can do it right. We can \ncomplete the appropriations bills on time. We can be responsive to the \nneeds that we anticipate this fall. We can recognize that the budget \nagreement we have agreed to is one that we will toil through and that \nthe agreement is better than what we imply with this amendment, that \nour word is our bond and that we are going to commit to that level of \ninvestment this year, next year, and for the next 5 years. That is why \nthis legislation, this amendment, is so ill-advised. It breaks the \nagreement. It discounts the need to come back, and it will be vetoed.\n  Mr. President, I urge we reject the automatic CR by supporting the \namendment of the distinguished Senator from West Virginia if we cannot \nfind a way with which to resolve it through compromise. I stand ready \nto continue to find ways with which to make compromise possible, and I \nhope we could do it prior to the time we find the need to vote on final \npassage. Short of that, Mr. President, I hope Senators will realize the \nextraordinary repercussions that this provision will have for this \nbill. I urge support for the amendment to strike the automatic CR.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I see the Senator from Nevada is here. Does the Senator \nseek time on this amendment?\n  Mr. REID. To the Senator from Alaska, I was one of the Senators that \nSenator Byrd had listed as speaking. If the Senator would grant me the \ntime, I can go forward at this time, leaving, I think on this side, \nonly Senator Byrd.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I understand the Senator wishes 5 minutes; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. REID. I have asked for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask that the Senator be recognized for \n10 minutes and I will retain the floor at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Chair advise the Senator when I have used 9 \nminutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I will do so.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last New Year's Day, the people of northern \nNevada suffered from flood waters that were untoward. We had never \nexperienced anything like the floods that occurred in five northern \ncounties. The State of Nevada, as large as it is, has\n\n[[Page S4166]]\n\nthe seventh largest area, State-wise, including Alaska. It has 17 \ncounties, very large counties, and five of those counties were severely \ndamaged as a result of the flood--Washoe, Story, Douglas, Carson City \nand Lyon. I traveled over the area by car and helicopter. The picture \nthat I saw is something I will never forget. The Carson, Walker, and \nTruckee Rivers, small as they are, when the floods came, were \ndevastating.\n  Now, Mr. President, the flooding that we suffered in Nevada was \nsignificant. But the flooding and the disaster that hit Nevada was \nrelatively small, as bad as it was, compared to the magnitude of \ndisaster that we have seen in the Dakotas. To say that the community of \nGrand Forks, ND, is changed forever is an understatement. I had the \nopportunity the other evening of meeting the mayor of Grand Forks, ND, \nPat Owens, and I had heard from the Senators from North Dakota, \nSenators Conrad and Dorgan, and I have seen in the papers, watched on \ntelevision, as we all have, the devastation that hit the Dakotas--lives \nlost, tens of thousands of people dislocated, many of whom will never \nget back in their homes, 156,000 cattle died; some of them died \nstanding, frozen stiff. Almost 2 million acres of cropland were under \nwater. North Dakota had more snow in a matter of weeks than it had in \nthe previous 3 years. Total damages are still being added up, but it \nwill be nearly $2 billion in that State, which has a little over \n500,000 people in it. Neighborhoods were destroyed by fire.\n  Mr. President, we have had significant damage all over these United \nStates this past year. That is what this bill is about--the damage \ncaused by the floods in northern Nevada, by the floods caused by the \nRed River, which I understand runs normally at about 50 yards wide and \nnow, in areas, is as much as 40 miles wide. That is what this bill is \nall about. It should not be about extraneous matters. That is the \nreason I am so committed to the amendment that has been offered and is \npending.\n  We know that the Government was shut down. We know that those of us \non this side of the aisle had nothing to do with shutting down the \nGovernment. We know the American people rose up against the shutting \ndown of this Government. I think it is commendable that people are \nconcerned about never shutting down the Government again, and I agree \nwith that concept. I hope we never shut the Government down again. But \nthis legislation is not the vehicle to do that. We need to go on with \nthis legislation, this disaster relief, this emergency legislation. \nThere are important matters in this.\n  In Hawaii, at the Lualualei Naval Station, there was flooding and \nmudslides, and tremendous winds have ripped this naval station to \npieces. We need these moneys to go there, as have been committed. There \nis $45 million which will go to emergency infrastructure grants to \nrepair water and sewer lines. These are fundamental to any community \nstruck by these devastating floods. Only $4 million--a relatively small \namount, as large as this bill is--will go for rural housing assistance \nprograms to help the elderly with emergency repair of the housing. That \nis a priority. We should be doing that and not having continuing \nresolutions and other such matters in this legislation.\n  The principal nonemergency item is the one that we are now here \nhaving struck. We know the Government was shut down for a lot of \nreasons. One of the reasons was spread across all the newspapers and \ntelevision shows that could carry it last year when the Speaker of the \nHouse was offended because he was asked to go out of the wrong door of \nAir Force One. This took a personal vendetta to a whole new level, but \nit should not have led to a shutdown of the Government.\n\n  Again, it is important that we don't have the Government shutdown at \nany time in the future. But this isn't the legislation that should do \nthat. Last week, Friday, there was a celebration by the Democrats and \nRepublicans that we had done something on a bipartisan basis; we had \njoined hands to come up with a bipartisan budget agreement, or \ncompromise. Why don't we go ahead and see what bills we can get passed \nin the right way, the ordinary way--that is, we have 13 appropriations \nbills; why don't we pass those 13 appropriations bills. That would \nreally send a message to the American public that we are doing things \nthe right way around here.\n  We have been told the President will veto this legislation. We have \nbeen told by the minority leader that there are enough votes to sustain \nthe veto. What are the things that will be affected by this amendment? \nWe know that the stockpile stewardship program will be affected. We \nknow that privatization projects to clean up nuclear waste will be \naffected--97 of them, to be exact. We know that the Appalachian \nRegional Commission, serving some of the poorest counties in the \nNation, will be affected with this amendment.\n  The agreement that was reached by the President and leadership of \nboth Houses of Congress is an important step in the right direction, so \nthat we can go about Government in a normal fashion. This substituted \namendment still cuts about $25 billion below what was agreed upon. All \nof us here can live with this McCain-Hutchison amendment. We can live \nwith this. Everybody knows that. But let's live up to the agreement \nthat we have, also, and that is, let's fund at levels that will get us \nto a balanced budget by the year 2002, or even earlier.\n  Is there something here that I don't understand that is going to say \nthat we are going to agree to a budget but we are not going to really \nlive up to it, and that is why we are not going to have to pass any of \nour appropriations bills and we are going to have to rely on a \ncontinuing resolution? I hope that we can move on beyond where we are \nhere, that we don't have to have a veto of this legislation, and that \nwe can go ahead and get the emergency relief to the five counties in \nNevada that so desperately need it and the 21 other States in our Union \nthat have had disasters that also need the relief. We should not be \nlegislating on an appropriations bill, and that certainly is what this \ndoes.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have heard the debate and I think \nthe debate has really been good today. I think that everyone has made \ntheir points, and I think everyone has stood on the principle that they \nbelieve is the correct one, and I think the lines are very clear.\n  I think it is very important that people understand exactly what we \nare doing. What we are doing in the first appropriations bill that has \ncome to the floor in this session of Congress is we are setting the \nprocess by which we will move appropriations bills before September 30 \nof this year. And in stating what the process is, we are saying, right \nnow, for all planning purposes, that if there is not an agreement by \nSeptember 30, at the beginning of the fiscal year, we will make sure \nthat we have a way to continue to fund the Government, a seamless \ntransition into the next fiscal year so that there will be no \ndisruption--no disruption in people's lives who work for the Federal \nGovernment, no disruption in people's lives who depend on the Federal \nGovernment for their veterans' payments, no disruption in people's \nlives who might have saved for family vacations. There will not be a \ndisruption because we are going to continue Government, as we are \nsaying right now, in a responsible way, which is what the people \nexpect. So we are laying the framework for how we are going to \nappropriate this year, and we are going to have an orderly process that \nassures the people of this country that there is not going to be a stop \nin Government. We are going to fund at present levels all the way \nthrough, even if we don't have an agreement on an appropriations bill.\n\n  Of course, we are going to try to come to an agreement. But we \nbelieve the best way to do that is in the light of day, no hammers over \nanyone's head, no hammers over Congress, no hammers over the President. \nEverybody will be able to talk about the priorities and determine how \nmuch we will spend in Pell grants, how much we will spend for Meals on \nWheels, and how much we will spend for education priorities. You see, I \nhave heard talk on the floor about cutting Pell grants. Well, we are \nnot cutting anything. We haven't passed one appropriations bill yet. So \nnothing has been set for the 1998 year.\n\n[[Page S4167]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I was called off of the floor. I have been seeking to \nensure that there will be some limitations on Senators speaking on this \namendment. How long does the Senator intend to speak?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Just 5 minutes, or less if the Senator would like.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I renew my request that I regain the \nfloor at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I have spoken approximately 2 minutes. So I will \nfinish in approximately 3 minutes.\n  Let me just say that the President doesn't have to veto this bill. \nThis is the President's bill. It is a supplemental appropriation. It is \ngoing to renew the coffers of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. \nLet's make no mistake, the money is going into North Dakota right now. \nThe victims are getting all of the money to which they are entitled \nunder Federal law right now. There is no delay. We are talking about \nrefilling the coffers for future disasters that have not yet occurred. \nSo there is no emergency here. The money is going out and we want to \nrefill it. It is the same for the people serving in Bosnia. The money \nis going in there. They are having all the equipment and they are \nhaving all of their needs being met. But the fact is, we need to \nreplenish the Department of Defense. So that is what we are talking \nabout today.\n  The President has asked for more money for Bosnia. The President has \nasked for more money for FEMA, and we are going to give it to him. Now, \nhe has a choice to sign the bill or to veto it on a process issue. I \ndon't know why, if the President says he doesn't want to shut down the \nGovernment, he would even consider vetoing this bill. Why would the \nPresident veto the bill? It is his choice, his bill. We are giving him \neverything he has asked for in this supplemental bill. So why would he \nveto it, especially when he says he doesn't want to shut down \nGovernment?\n  So when we hear people say the President is going to veto this bill \nand it is going to hold up aid, that is not the case. First, the \nPresident has a choice. He can sign the bill, which is giving him \neverything he asked for, or the President can choose to veto the bill \non the process. But that is his choice. If he wants to delay putting \nthe money back into the Federal Emergency Management Agency, if he \nwants to delay putting money back into the Department of Defense, then \nthat is his choice. I think it is the wrong choice. I hope the \nPresident will sign the bill because we have, in good faith, given him \nall of the money that he has asked for, and we want to do that.\n  Why should he worry about our setting the process so that we will \nknow how we are going to deal with appropriations bills as we go \nthrough the end of the year?\n  Mr. President, I think it is very clear that we are doing the \nresponsible Government operation here. We are going to make sure that \nthe people in North Dakota get the help they need. We are going to make \nsure that our troops in Bosnia get the help they need. We are going to \nmake sure that the Department of Defense can put the money back into \nbuying spare parts for airplanes and retraining the people who are \ncoming out of Bosnia. All of those needs will be met.\n  The question is, will the President really veto the bill because he \ndoesn't want to assure that we will not shut down Government? That is \nthe only issue here. I can't imagine that the President would veto a \nbill because we are providing for an orderly transition into the next \nfiscal year. In case we have disagreement, we will be able to negotiate \nthose agreements without a hammer over the President's head or \nCongress' head.\n  Mr. President, the issue is responsible Government. I hope we can \ndefeat the amendment by Mr. Byrd and stay with our program to keep the \nprerogatives of Congress for a more orderly transition into the next \nfiscal year.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have again the floor now. There are to \nmy knowledge two remaining speakers, the Senator from Arizona and the \nSenator from West Virginia, [Mr. Byrd]. The two of them started this \nprocess last night. They did so well I do not want to try to interfere \nand put limits.\n  So I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I intend to be brief.\n  I thank the Senator from Alaska. This has taken up a great deal of \ntime. We are completing this legislation soon. I appreciate his \npatience and his appreciation on this very difficult issue.\n  I also want to thank the Senator from West Virginia for his usual \ncourteous, informative, and compelling debate in which we have engaged \nfor many years.\n  Mr. President, as I said, I will try to be brief. Let's try to be \nclear about what we are talking about here. There isn't an either/or \nchoice here. The money is going to the disaster areas. It will continue \nto flow. The President doesn't have to in any way veto a provision that \nwould prevent what he so loudly decried for a period of about 2 months \nin December and January--December 1995 to January 1996--when the \nGovernment was shut down.\n  I am, frankly, astonished that during this debate people somehow \nthink that because we will include a provision that prevents the \nshutdown of the Government that it would jeopardize anything else.\n  Let me also point out that, although the agreement on a budget is a \nlaudable situation, we all know that the heavy lifting is in the \nappropriations process.\n  Mr. President, I still remember this much heralded budget agreement \nof 1990. It fell apart in a period of weeks. We got lots of tax \nincreases. I remember a budget agreement in 1982 when it raised taxes \nto balance the budget. That was back in 1982. I know the Senator from \nWest Virginia remembers it well.\n  Let's be clear. A budget is a framework upon which to work, and the \nappropriations is the heavy lifting. Whether it is right or wrong, fair \nor unfair, the Congress sometimes puts provisions on appropriations \nbills which the President of the United States does not like and, \ntherefore, as is his right and responsibility, vetoes those bills.\n  What I am trying to prevent here is a situation where, even if it \nwere within the agreed upon budget framework, there would not be a \nshutdown of the Government, which is patently and outrageously unfair \nto the American people. That is all we are trying to do here. To \nsomehow convey the impression that that impairs either the budget \nprocess or the appropriations process simply is not accurate.\n  Let me point out the problems that we face just very quickly, because \nwe have to remember what happened last time. We can't allow it to \nhappen again.\n  Mr. President, according to a Greater Washington Consumer Survey in a \npoll taken, 4 out of 10 Federal employees fear losing their jobs \nbecause of budget reductions; 4 out of 5 Federal employees believe \ntheir agency will be hit by cutbacks; one-third of private sector \nemployees believe their firms would be hurt by Federal budget \nreductions; and one-fifth of private sector employees believe their own \njobs may be in jeopardy as a result of Federal budget reductions \nassociated with the impact of a Federal shutdown.\n  Mr. President, I know my colleagues remember when the Government was \nshut down. Let me remind you of the impact during that 23-day period.\n  New patients were not accepted into clinical research at the NIH; the \nCenters for Disease Control ceased disease surveillance; hotline calls \nto NIH concerning diseases were not answered; toxic waste cleanup work \nat 609 sites was stopped; 2,400 Superfund workers were sent home; \n10,000 new Medicare applications, 212,000 Social Security card \nrequests, 360,000 individual office visits, and 800,000 toll-free calls \nfor information and assistance were turned away each day--each day; \n10,000 new Medicare applications were denied every day; 13 million \nrecipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children, 273,000 foster \ncare children, over 100,000 children receiving adoption assistance\n\n[[Page S4168]]\n\nservices, and over 100,000 Head Start children experienced delays.\n\n  Mr. President, is that fair? Is that a decent way to treat the \nAmerican people because we have a disagreement over an appropriations \nbill here in Washington, DC?\n  Ten thousand home purchase loans and refinancing applications \ntotaling 800 million dollars' worth of mortgage loans for moderate- and \nlow-income working families nationwide were delayed; 11 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia temporarily suspended unemployment assistance for \nlack of Federal funds.\n  Mr. President, I ask again: Was that fair to the American people? \nShouldn't we take whatever steps necessary not to have these innocent \npeople suffer again? This is what it is all about.\n  The disaster relief is about the suffering of American citizens \nbecause of a natural disaster. We are taking steps to cure that, and \nprovide them with the relief assistance that is the obligation of \nGovernment to its people. I argue, Mr. President, that we have an \nobligation to provide relief, comfort and, care, and Federal programs \nand assistance that innocent Americans deserve, and not shut down the \nGovernment.\n  I don't know how we justify 13 million recipients of aid to families \nwith dependent children not receiving their funds, and 273,000 foster \ncare children and over 100,000 children not receiving adoption \nassistance services. I don't know how we justify that. I think it is \none of the blackest chapters in the history of the Federal Government. \nAll we are doing is trying to see that that doesn't happen again.\n  There was suspension of investigative activities by the IRS. I am not \nsure that was all bad, Mr. President. So I will pass over that one.\n  Delays in processing alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and explosive \napplications by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The \nDepartment of Justice suspended work on more than 3,500 bankruptcy \ncases. OPM canceled recruitment and testing of Federal officials, \nincluding hiring 400 border control agents. On delinquent child support \ncases, the deadbeat dads program was suspended; closure of 368 National \nPark Service sites; loss of 7 million visitors; the Grand Canyon \nNational Park closed for the first time in its 76-year history; local \ncommunities near national parks, losses estimated at $14.2 million per \nday in tourism revenue; and the closure of national museums and \nmonuments for a loss of 2 million visitors; 20,000 to 30,000 \napplications by foreigners for visas for coming into this country went \nunprocessed each day; 200,000 U.S. applications for passports went \nunprocessed; U.S. tourist industries and airlines sustained millions of \ndollars in losses because of visa and passport curtailment.\n  It had a terrible effect on Native Americans and American Indians. \nThe American veterans sustained major curtailment in services as a \nresult of the Federal shutdown, ranging from health and welfare to \nfinance and travel.\n  The impact of Federal contracting on the local and national economy \nis best shown by the fact that in 1994 the Federal Government purchased \n196.4 billion dollars' worth of goods nationwide, and $18 billion in \nthe Washington region. The billions of dollars received from Federal \ncontracting is a boon to local economies. Over 500,000 small companies \nnationwide faced delays in Federal payments, and several companies with \nmillions of dollars of exports couldn't get off the docks because there \nwere no Federal inspectors to clear their cargo.\n  Mr. President, I could go on and on as to the terrible and \ndevastating effects not brought about by a natural disaster but brought \nabout by a manmade disaster.\n  I would argue that the facts are clear. The American people--who, by \nthe way, don't think a great deal of us, if you believe the polls--\ndeserve better. And, if we are concerned about the esteem or lack of \nesteem in which we are held by the American people, we should assure \nthem that we would never do this to them again.\n  So I hope we will vote on this issue.\n  And let me finally say, in conclusion, Mr. President, as I have said \non numerous occasions, I am eager--not willing but eager--to sit down \nwith the White House and with my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle and frame a proposal and an agreement that will prevent the \nshutdown of the Government.\n  If this isn't appropriate, if the President of the United States \nfeels that this is not the right way to go, then we are open for \nbusiness. We would like to talk, if we share the same goal. I know that \nthe Senator from West Virginia shares the same goal to prevent the \nshutdown of the Government.\n\n  Again, it seems to me that reasonable men can reason together in a \nreasonable fashion.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as we close the debate on my amendment, I \npause first to thank the distinguished Senator from Alaska for his \ngenerosity, for his courtesy, which he has accorded us on this side of \nthe aisle and on this side of the question. He could very well have \nmade a motion to table at any point and, therefore, shut off debate on \nthe amendment. He probably has the votes, if we look at the \nAppropriations Committee vote a few days ago when we saw a straight \nparty-line response to my efforts to strike out the language during the \nmarkup. He probably has the votes.\n  So he could very well have moved to table, and could have tabled my \namendment. So I thank him for his consideration in that respect. I \nthink it is good for the Senate to have the debate on this matter. I \nfound him to be, many years ago, not only a fine Senator but a \ngentleman.\n  Mr. President, I also wish to express my respect to Mr. McCain, who \nis a genuine American hero. I respect him as one who has suffered not \nhours nor days nor weeks nor months but years. I take my hat off to him \nin that regard.\n  What I say about the amendment and my motion to strike language is \nnot said in derogation of the Senator, nor any particular Senator, for \nthat matter. I am addressing my remarks in the main to my amendment and \nto the language that my amendment seeks to strike from the bill.\n  We have heard much said, Mr. President, about this being an effort to \navoid a manmade disaster. It has been said that the bill addresses a \nnatural disaster. But that the language, which is supported by the \nother side in the main, and particularly by Senators McCain and \nHutchison, is to avert a manmade disaster.\n  Mr. President, let us reflect a little with respect to that so-called \nmanmade disaster. Who caused that? I am against shutdowns in the \nGovernment. I had no part in bringing about that shutdown of late 1995 \nwhich continued into early 1996.\n\n  I say to my friends, I have only to point to the words of a \ndistinguished Member of the other body. I do not know whether Senators \nare all aware of the fact that we are not supposed to refer to a Member \nof the other body by name, and so I will not do that. I have heard that \ndone. It should not have been done. And I have noted in the past that \nthe House leadership has been very circumspect about calling to the \nattention of House Members the rule against their making mention of a \nSenator by name in floor debate. So I do not make mention of a House \nMember by name, but I call attention to some statements that were made \nby a very prominent House Member and one which was repeated in the \nWashington Post on September 22, 1995. This is what that very prominent \nHouse Member had to say with respect to manmade disasters, shutting \ndown the Government, and I quote:\n\n       I don't care what the price is. I don't care if we have no \n     executive offices and no bonds for 30 days--not this time.\n\n  So that is what a very well-known Member of the other body had to say \nabout manmade disasters. He did not care.\n  And then I refer to a quotation from the same prominent, very \ndistinguished Member of the other body, a quotation that appeared in \nTime magazine of June 5, 1995, when that same Member, in referring to \n``manmade disasters,'' said:\n\n       He can run the parts--\n\n  He, meaning the President--\n\n       He can run the parts of the Government that are left [after \n     the Republican budget cuts] or he can run no Government. . . \n     . Which of the two of us do you think worries more about \n     Government not showing up?\n\n\n[[Page S4169]]\n\n\n  Now, I could quote from the same individual additional instances, but \nso much for manmade disasters. This was a collective mistake that was \nmade by the other party in 1995 and 1996. It was a collective mistake, \nand the so-called manmade disaster was the result of that collective \nmistake, which was a very definite strategy. That was the strategy. \nThat was the Damocles sword that would be held over the Congress and \nover the President's head. And so the joint leadership of the \nRepublican party sought to carry out those threats, and they got their \nfingers burned. They made the threats. They carried out the threats. \nAnd as a result there was the so-called manmade disaster. They got \ntheir fingers burned. Now they dread the fire.\n  It was not the President's strategy. That was the strategy of the \nRepublican leadership of the Congress. Perhaps that is now conveniently \nforgotten, but it does not take a slip of the memory as long as Rip van \nWinkle's slip of memory to remind oneself of how that so-called manmade \ndisaster was strategized and implemented by the Republican Party in \nCongress.\n  Rip van Winkle, as we all remember from our early studies--and as far \nas I myself am concerned, I read about it in Irving's ``Sketch Book'' \nback in a two-room schoolhouse in southern West Virginia--was a very \namiable, idle, bibulous Dutch settler who had a termagant wife and who, \nwhile hunting in the Catskill Mountains, met up with the spirits of \nHendrick Hudson and some of his companions who were playing ninepins \nand drinking schnapps. After taking a few drinks of that liquor with \nHudson and his companions, our friend Rip van Winkle went to sleep and \nslept for 20 years. And when he awakened, he thought he had just taken \na short nap. He went home. His wife had been dead, himself forgotten, \nhis friends had died or were scattered, and the colonies had become the \nUnited States of America.\n  Well, it seems to me that some of our friends have been asleep less \nthan 20 years and perhaps no more than 1 or 1\\1/2\\ years, but they seem \nto have forgotten whose strategy it was that brought on the manmade \ndisaster which they now deplore. It was not mine. It was theirs. They \ngot their fingers burned.\n  Now, under the cloak of hoping to avoid another manmade disaster, \nthey come with this language in the bill I am seeking to strike.\n  Mr. President, I shall sum up the arguments that I make against the \nlanguage. But before I do, there has been a good bit said with respect \nto the continuing ``flow of funds,'' to use their words, that will go \nto the people who are suffering as a result of the natural disasters, \nand it is said that delaying this appropriations bill will not delay \nsuccor and comfort and relief to those poor people who have gone \nthrough this travail in the instances to which we refer.\n  I have here a memorandum from the Office of Management and Budget \nwhich says that ``the resulting delay from the automatic continuing \nresolution will impede the disaster response effort.'' And I read \nextracts from that memorandum.\n\n       While several Federal agencies that provide immediate \n     relief to disaster victims (FEMA, SBA, and the Corps of \n     Engineers) have resources available and are providing \n     immediate assistance to disaster victims, many long-term \n     recovery and reconstruction efforts cannot proceed until the \n     Disaster Supplemental is signed into law. In addition, some \n     immediate assistance will be jeopardized by delay.\n       Unlike other Federal agencies such as FEMA, HUD does not \n     currently have funds available to dedicate to the disaster \n     recovery efforts. Any delay--\n\n  I repeat, ``any delay--\n\n     in enacting the disaster supplemental would impede HUD's \n     efforts to provide disaster recovery assistance. The delay \n     would increase the uncertainty over the amount of assistance \n     that will ultimately be provided and thus compound the \n     difficulty in planning for disaster recovery. Affected \n     communities would experience a comparable delay in receiving \n     funding.\n\n  With respect to the Department of Agriculture and the emergency \nconservation program, I quote from the memorandum.\n\n       No funds remain in the program to restore farmlands to \n     production after natural disasters. A list of eligible \n     recipients is being developed, but no one is receiving \n     assistance. The delay in funding means that farmland remains \n     vulnerable to future floods (spring thaw) and less ready to \n     be planted to cropland this year. Cropland will not be \n     leveled, debris will not be removed from fields, pasture \n     remains unfenced, and conservation structures remain in \n     disrepair. As a result, the damages to farmers increase, as \n     the planting delay reduces their farm income (later planning \n     results in lower yields per acre).\n\n  Now, as to watershed and flood prevention, I quote again from the \nmemorandum by the Office of Management and Budget.\n\n       No funds remain for new projects.\n\n  I am talking about watershed and flood prevention.\n\n       No funds remain for new projects, all funding has been \n     committed to addressing earlier natural disasters. USDA \n     offices are accepting applications from local sponsors, \n     assessing damages, and making determinations. A list is being \n     developed, but no one--\n\n  No one--\n\n     is receiving assistance. The effect of the delay is to \n     increase the likelihood of increased damages from flooding \n     later this year as areas are left vulnerable: streams can \n     overflow because they remain constricted from debris that has \n     not been removed, threatening roads and bridges with wash-\n     out. Other infrastructure and property can end up destroyed \n     by the failure to repair damaged levees. Also, the \n     opportunity for non-structural measures, like the purchase of \n     floodplain easements from willing sellers, decreases with the \n     delay in supplemental funding because landowners need to \n     decide now whether to crop this year or wait for the \n     possibility of an easement buyout.\n\n  As to emergency loans under the Farm Service Agency, here is what the \nmemorandum says.\n\n       Existing appropriations for these loans will be depleted by \n     mid- to late May. Any delay in the supplemental beyond this \n     time frame will cause farmers to wait emergency loan \n     assistance to offset economic losses from natural disasters. \n     This loss of credit will reduce their ability to repair farm \n     structures and purchase inputs for spring crop planting.\n\n  And so, Mr. President, here is a memo which I quote for the Record \nwhich clearly indicates that delay in action on this bill will spell \ndelay for the people who are seeking relief from those terrible \ndisasters. This bill will have some impact on West Virginia. West \nVirginia suffered during this time from floods. And for 40 years, Mr. \nPresident, 40 years I have been in Congress working to support the \nbuilding of flood prevention structures, working in support of \nappropriations to provide relief in the wake of floods.\n  It was 40 years ago this year, while I was in the House of \nRepresentatives, that I introduced legislation to provide for the \nconstruction of a reservoir to give future protection from floods along \nthe Guyandotte River, which had just flooded in that instance, in 1957, \nthe cities of Logan and Stollings and other communities along the \nriver.\n  So, I have seen the Guyandotte, I have seen the Cheat, I have seen \nthe Greenbrier, I have seen the Tug Fork, and these other mighty rivers \nin West Virginia flood and take lives, destroy property, and cause \nhundreds and thousands of people to flee from their homes. Yet, because \nof their love for their roots, their love for their home State, they \nhave gone right back in after the floods and they have hosed out the \nmud and the muck and sought to continue life again, as it were.\n  So I know something about the suffering and losses of people and, as \nI say, the loss of life that comes from disasters of this kind. We had \nthe Buffalo Creek flood disaster. West Virginia has had more of its \nshare of disasters. So my heart goes out to the people of North Dakota \nand South Dakota and Minnesota and the other States, as well as my own \nState, but not to the degree that those States have suffered in this \nparticular instance. My heart goes out to them. I think we ought to \nenact this measure. I hope we will strike from the bill this language, \nand I am sorry that my hopes at this moment are probably not well \nfounded.\n  But, in any event, we have it clear from the President that he will \nveto this bill if it comes to his desk with the language in it that I \nsought to strike during the markup at the Appropriations Committee and \nwhich still remains in the bill, though slightly changed from 98 to 100 \npercent, which is a freeze. But it would still amount to reductions of \n$20 billion to $25 billion, or possibly even more if this language goes \ninto effect. So, while there may be a slackening, from the standpoint \nof raising the figure from 98 percent to 100 percent, which makes it a \nfreeze, which would continue it as a freeze, the President's requests \nthat were included in his budget are in jeopardy.\n  Mr. President, I hope Senators will support my motion to strike. Does \nthe\n\n[[Page S4170]]\n\nSenator plan to move to table my motion?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator could withhold for \njust 1 minute on that, if I might speak on this?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I do seek the floor, but I will be happy \nto yield to the Senator from Vermont for 1 minute.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Sometimes we little tiny States----\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I call attention to the fact that I have not \nyielded the floor yet.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I presumed, Mr. President. When I get the floor, I will \nbe happy to yield for a minute.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield to the Senator with the understanding that the \nChair protects my right to the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator from West Virginia, and I will be very \nbrief, as I advised the senior Senator from Alaska also.\n  I hope Senators will support the Senator from West Virginia on this \nissue. I have been here for 22 years. Twenty of those years I have \nserved on the Appropriations Committee and proudly so. I know how hard \nwe work to get our 13 appropriations bills through. Sometimes we have \nnot. We have gotten most of them, and the rest have had to be done by a \ncontinuing resolution; but usually for just a few weeks, while we \nfinish them up.\n  If this went through, this automatic continuing resolution, I do not \ncare if it is at 125 percent of funding or at 30 percent of funding, it \nis poor policy. Basically it says to the Appropriations Committee--\nactually it says to the House and Senate--go home. We do not need you. \nWe are on automatic pilot.\n  That is not what we are elected to do. We are elected to make the \ntough choices, vote for or against them, and do it on time.\n  So I support, and gladly and proudly support, the Senator from West \nVirginia on this. Whether we have a Republican President or Democratic \nPresident, Republican or Democratic Senate, I would vote exactly the \nsame way. I do not want automatic continuing resolutions because we \nwill not, then, have our feet put to the fire and have to actually cast \nthe tough votes and make the policy decisions the people of America \nexpect us to do.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator. May I \nassure the distinguished manager that I will not detain the Senate very \nmuch longer.\n  Let me, in summation, state that the language that is in the bill, \nauthored by Mr. McCain and Senator Hutchison and others, means in a \npractical sense that if we fail to pass an appropriation bill, all of \nthe programs contained in that bill will receive a cut, because they \nwill remain at a freeze; in other words, no increase over inflation. \nBut it will be a hard freeze. This means education programs, law \nenforcement programs, immigration programs, transportation programs, \nagriculture programs and so on.\n  Second, we will have lost most all of our negotiating strength with \nregard to fiscal year 1998 appropriations issues because all that the \nother side has to do is just pass the bills they want to pass and find \nsome reason not to pass others, like the labor and health \nappropriations bill, and they will automatically keep those programs on \na freeze level. I feel reasonably sure, also, that domestic \ndiscretionary programs are the ones that will end up feeling the \nautomatic budget axe.\n  Moreover, any leverage that the White House thinks they may have in \nthe budget talks will turn to quicksilver, because when the rubber hits \nthe road in these appropriations bills, any hard-won victories by the \nadministration can easily vanish just by the tactic of bogging down \ncertain bills.\n  Fourthly, if we go down this road once we can be sure that we will go \ndown it again next year. Slowly, slowly, we may be reducing the \nbaseline for these programs by continuing on a freeze level and perhaps \nit could go below a freeze the next time around. So, we are talking \nabout a real loss of buying power. If inflation should rise, we would \nbe in a real hole.\n  Fifthly, we will be funding programs that may need serious cutting \nand should not be kept on the level of a freeze. If Congress exercises \nits oversight--and oversight is really exercised for the main part in \nconnection with appropriations bills, appropriations hearings and so \non--we will be continuing programs that perhaps ought to be reduced. \nSome ought to be eliminated. But under this language that I am seeking \nto strike, there would not be any reduction, and they would continue at \na freeze level. Furthermore, because we are already so late with the \nbudget resolution, appropriators are now behind the eight ball in \ngetting started with our bills this year. So it is particularly easy \nfor the other side to make sure that several appropriations bills bog \ndown and then we get this automatic CR in place for bills which they \nmay not like.\n  So, Mr. President, in short, this new gimmick would quite likely \nchange the dynamic of the way we traditionally fund programs, this year \nand in the coming years. I hope it will not be successful. It is \nclearly a futile effort in the face of the President's threat to veto \nthe bill if the language remains in it. And, to that extent, it \nconstitutes a delay in the delivery of relief to the people who need \nthat relief.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record at \nthis point the memorandum by the Office of Management and Budget to \nwhich I have referred and from which I have already quoted excerpts.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Office of Management and Budget]\n\n      Automatic Continuing Resolution Does Not Belong on Disaster \n                              Supplemental\n\n\n          resulting delay will impede disaster response effort\n\n       While several Federal agencies that provide immediate \n     relief to disaster victims (FEMA, SBA, and the Corps of \n     Engineers) have resources available and are providing \n     immediate assistance to disaster victims, many long term \n     recovery and reconstruction efforts can not proceed until the \n     Disaster Supplemental is signed into law. In addition, some \n     immediate assistance (see USDA discussion below) will be \n     jeopardized by delay.\n       A budget process issue such as the automatic continuing \n     resolution contained in S. 672 does not belong in emergency \n     disaster relief legislation. The Senate should drop Title VII \n     of S. 672 so that disaster relief is not delayed. Examples of \n     Federal response efforts that would be delayed by the \n     inclusion of this provision follow:\n\n                 HUD: Community Development Block Grant\n\n       Unlike other Federal agencies such as FEMA, HUD does not \n     currently have funds available to dedicate to the disaster \n     recovery efforts. Any delay in enacting the disaster \n     supplemental would impede HUD's efforts to provide disaster \n     recovery assistance. The delay would increase the uncertainty \n     over the amount of assistance that will ultimately be \n     provided and thus compound the difficulty in planning for \n     disaster recovery. Affected communities would experience a \n     comparable delay in receiving funding.\n       This delay would impact activities not funded through other \n     Federal disaster assistance programs, in particular \n     activities to address the needs of lower-income individuals. \n     The proposed $100 million in Community Development Block \n     Grant (CDBG) funds would be used to buy out properties as \n     part of a relocation effort; and to provide grants or loans \n     to businesses and families who lack the income, savings, or \n     credit history to qualify for an SBA loan.\n\n                       Department of Agriculture\n\n                     Emergency Conservation Program\n\n       No funds remain in the program to restore farmlands to \n     production after natural disasters. A list of eligible \n     recipients is being developed, but no one is receiving \n     assistance. The delay in funding means that farmland remains \n     vulnerable to future floods (spring thaw) and less ready to \n     be planted to cropland this year. Cropland will not be \n     leveled, debris will not be removed from fields, pasture \n     remains unfenced, and conservation structures remain in \n     disrepair. As a result, the damages to farmers increase, as \n     the planting delay reduces their farm income (later planting \n     results in lower yields per acre).\n\n                     Watershed and Flood Prevention\n\n       No funds remain for new projects, all funding has been \n     committed to addressing earlier natural disasters. USDA \n     offices are accepting applications from local sponsors, \n     assessing damages, and making determinations. A list is being \n     developed, but no one is receiving assistance. The effect of \n     the delay is to increase the likelihood of increased \n     damages from flooding later this year as areas are left \n     vulnerable: streams can overflow because they remain \n     constricted from debris that has not been removed, \n     threatening roads and bridges with wash-out. Other \n     infrastructure and property can end up destroyed by the \n     failure to repair damaged levees. Also, the opportunity \n     for non-structural measures, like the purchase of \n     floodplain easements from willing sellers, decreases with \n     the delay in supplemental funding because landowners need \n     to decide now whether to crop this year\n\n[[Page S4171]]\n\n     or wait for the possibility of an easement buyout.\n\n     CCC Disaster Reserve Assistance Program (livestock indemnity)\n\n       No payments can be made until the supplemental is enacted \n     (the program does not exist under current law). As a result, \n     producers will likely not be able to replace livestock killed \n     by the natural disasters, reducing farm income. (See note \n     below)\n\n                        Tree Assistance Program\n\n       No payments can be made until the supplemental is enacted \n     (program doesn't exist under current law). As a result, \n     orchardists and foresters will likely not be able to replace \n     trees destroyed by natural disasters, reducing farm income. \n     (See note below)\n       (NOTE: these two disaster payment programs do not have \n     regulations in place, so while applications may be taken, \n     payments will not be able to go out ``the next day'' after \n     the supplemental is enacted, but will have to wait for regs--\n     which will be expedited nevertheless.)\n\n            Emergency Loans (under the Farm Service Agency)\n\n       Existing appropriations for these loans will be depleted by \n     mid to late May. Any delay in the supplemental beyond this \n     time frame will cause farmers to wait for emergency loan \n     assistance to offset economic losses from natural disasters. \n     This loss of credit will reduce their ability to repair farm \n     structures and purchase inputs for spring crop planting.\n\n                       Department of the Interior\n\n       Delays in supplemental funding would have significant \n     impacts on DOI park and refuge restoration work, particularly \n     on Yosemite National Park in California. Interior has \n     proceeded with the most urgent repairs to roads and \n     infrastructure (using existing authority to transfer balances \n     and presumably a similar DOT authority), but these are \n     partial and interim solutions. The supplemental will be too \n     late to help this summer season (it will be a mess), but the \n     biggest effect from delay will be in the 1998 summer season. \n     Contracts need to be awarded now to get as much work as \n     possible started on widening roads, permanent utility \n     repairs, replacing housing and lodging buildings before next \n     winter, when this sort of work will not be possible. The \n     public will not be as patient next summer and will rightly \n     expect this to be fixed.\n\n              Department of Commerce/Economic Development\n\n       Delay in funding post-disaster economic recovery planning \n     grants will mean that disaster-impacted local communities \n     will not have the immediate institutional capacity to focus \n     on long term recovery planning issues. These issues are both \n     critical to reviving the local economy in the short term and \n     restructuring the economy in the long term.\n       Post disaster technical assistance grants to States for \n     marketing/promotion to help revive the tourism industry will \n     not be available to salvage the Summer tourism season and \n     bookings for the convention business.\n       The delay in implementing the EDA Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) \n     program will slow down business recovery. For example, \n     business segments not eligible for SBA funding will not be \n     addressed, i.e., landscaping and nursery industries.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I again thank Mr. McCain, Mr. Stevens, \nSenator Hutchison, and all other Senators, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Government Shutdown Prevention Act is \nthe right thing for us to do, and this is the right time for us to do \nit.\n  If there's one thing we should be able to promise the American \npeople, knowing we can keep that promise, it's that there will not be \nanother Government shutdown, as there was in 1995.\n  We all know what happened back then. President Clinton vetoed \nappropriation bills because the Congress would not give him all the \nmoney he wanted to spend.\n  No matter what gloss my friends on the other side of the aisle want \nto put on that situation, that was the bottom line: He wanted more tax \ndollars than we wanted to spend, and he was willing to see much of the \nFederal Government close its doors rather than make do with less cash.\n  But the President did a masterful job at handling the PR of the \nsituation. In fact, he ran rings around us, so much so that, to this \nday, most Americans probably believe that it was the Republican \nCongress that shut down their Government.\n  There's nothing we can do about that now. We have to leave all that \nto the judgment of the historians. But we should not leave the future \nto chance.\n  We have the chance today to guarantee the American people that the \ndepartments and agencies and bureaus of their Government will remain \nopen this year, even if the Congress and the President cannot agree on \nspending issues.\n  We have a chance to redeem the reputation of Congress by placing the \ndaily operations of Government--from our national parks to the FBI--\nabove politics and beyond political squabbles.\n  All we are asking is that, if a department's appropriation bill is \nnot completed by the start of the new fiscal year on October 1, 1997, \nthat department can continue all its programs and services, spending at \nthe rate of 100 percent of its current budget.\n  Just so no one misunderstands, let me restate that. All we want to do \nis ensure that, if any part of the Government does not have its annual \nappropriation in place by October 1, it can continue all its operations \nat 100 percent of their current level.\n  That is a reasonable, modest, prudent measure to safeguard the public \ninterest. And yet, it seems to have provoked a considerable amount of \nopposition from both the administration and Senate Democrats.\n  I can understand why, and the reason has nothing whatsoever to do \nwith some of the procedural arguments that have been advanced against \nthis legislation.\n  No, the Government Shutdown Prevention Act does not abdicate \nCongress' responsibility to produce individual appropriation bills.\n  The appropriations process will go forward, and I hope to be able to \ncall up--and pass--every one of those 13 bills. But what if that \nprocess fails? What if its failure imperils the operations of the \nDepartment of Justice? Or the Department of Health and Human Services? \nOr the Defense Department?\n  No, the Government Shutdown Prevention Act is not out of place on the \nsupplemental appropriation bill. The indignation that has been \nexpressed on this point in some quarters ignores the fact that it is \nnot at all unusual for Congress to accomplish other important business \nin the context of a supplemental appropriation.\n  No, the Government Shutdown Prevention Act is not imperiling or \ndelaying emergency assistance to the victims of floods in several hard-\nhit States. The aid they need will be forthcoming, and it will come on \ntime.\n  The people of my own State of Mississippi have known, all too \nfrequently, the force of natural disasters. Neither they nor I would \ntolerate efforts to play political games with the aid our neighbors \nneed.\n  So let's set that canard to rest. The only way emergency aid will be \nheld up to the Dakotas, to California, and to other hard-hit States is \nif a large number of Senators deliberately freeze the legislative \nprocess.\n  Under our Senate rules, a small minority can bring this place to its \nknees, can paralyze our most important activities. But I don't believe \nthat's going to happen, not on this critical bill.\n  There is, however, one procedural argument against this bill that is \nright on target.\n  Enactment of the Government Shutdown Prevention Act will \nsubstantially reduce the ability of individual Senators, or a small \ngroup of Senators, to hold hostage the Nation's money bills.\n  I admit it. With this legislation in place, no one in this Chamber--\nand no one on any committee--will be able to threaten to shut down one \nor another part of Government unless he gets his own way with an \namendment or a project.\n  It is hard to give up power. It is hard to give up even a little bit \nof power. But I think that's what the American people want us to do \nthis time. They don't want any of us to have the power to play chicken \nwith Government shutdowns. And I don't blame them.\n  So on this count, I plead guilty. I am, indeed, asking my colleagues \nto give up their ability to create a Government crisis by thwarting the \nappropriations process.\n  I am asking them today to enter into a formal agreement with the \nAmerican people--a legal enactment of our promise that there will be:\n  No more legislated layoffs. No more concocted crises. No more \nadministrative Armageddons. In short, once and for all, no more \nGovernment shutdowns.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I announce that after this vote is \ncompleted, we will announce the schedule for the remainder of the \nafternoon to the extent we have some agreements already. We do have \nsome very good agreements for the Senate to consider.\n\n[[Page S4172]]\n\n Following this amendment, it will be my intention to move to the \npending amendment, which is the Reid amendment. There will be a process \nto take that to a very rapid conclusion. We are pleased to announce \nthere is an agreement on the endangered species amendment.\n  Mr. President, my one comment at this time would be that Members \nshould keep in mind that we are finishing today, but the House has not \nacted yet. There will be a procedure so that when the House sends over \nits bill, we will automatically substitute our bill for that bill and \ngo to conference with the House as soon as possible. But I do want to \nthank Senators for what they have done so far. We are, I think, moving \non schedule. We do have agreements on at least five amendments that are \nready to be considered by the Senate, as far as timeframes, for the \nbalance of the amendments. And there is one left to be determined how \nlong that will take.\n  At this time I move to table the Byrd amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, is it in order to ask unanimous consent \nat this time? I ask unanimous consent a fellow in my office, Bob Simon, \nbe allowed the privilege of the floor during the pendency of S. 672.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Senator care to have his colloquy at this \npoint?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would prefer to make a short statement \nafter this bill and then do the colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is now on the motion to table the \nByrd amendment to the McCain amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I seek to clarify that. The Byrd \namendment is to delete a portion of the bill before the Senate. The \nMcCain amendment was incorporated in that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is correct.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 55, nays 45, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 61 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--55\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--45\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 59) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We are proceeding now to get a consent agreement. To my \nknowledge, I report to the Senate we have agreements on all but two \namendments I know of that will come up.\n  Let me state that we will proceed with the ESA amendment, the Reid \namendment, now. There is an agreement to dispose of that. Then we will \ngo to the amendment of Senator Gramm of Texas, No. 118. And after that \nwe have several small amendments, about 10 minutes to a side.\n  I would predict we will have a vote in about an hour and 10 to 20 \nminutes. And that will be on the amendment of the Senator from Texas \n[Mr. Gramm].\n  I now ask unanimous consent that when the Senate now takes up the \npending business, which is the Reid amendment--that is correct, is it \nnot?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I do ask unanimous consent that the Reid amendment come \nbefore the Senate.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, what is your unanimous \nconsent?\n  Mr. STEVENS. By regular order, I am bringing back the Reid amendment. \nIt was set aside temporarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to demand the regular \norder.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for a 15-minute \ntime limit equally divided between the Senator from Nevada and the \nSenator from Idaho [Mr. Kempthorne].\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator will have 5 minutes of that time, I might \nadd.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. You have 15 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We talked about the fact the Senator had 5 minutes; the \nSenator from Idaho, 5 minutes; and the Senator from Nevada, 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Senator wish any time in addition to that?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Who wants to speak on this amendment?\n  One, two, three, four, five.\n  I ask unanimous consent each one of these five Senators have 5 \nminutes on the amendment, that Senator Reid, Senator Baucus, Senator \nCraig, Senator Kempthorne, Senator Chafee each have 5 minutes on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Before that starts, Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent on the amendment of the Senator from Texas, amendment No. 118--\nfollowing that time that these Senators will use and the disposal of \nthe ESA amendment--that there be 1 hour equally divided, that the \nSenator from Texas may have his 1 hour equally divided on amendment No. \n118.\n  Mr. GRAMM. That will be fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Senator wish a rollcall vote?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I do.\n  Mr. STEVENS. There will not be a rollcall vote on the ESA.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to ask for the yeas and \nnays at this time on amendment No. 118 to be offered by Senator Gramm \nfrom Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on that \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Following that amendment, for the information of the \nSenate, we will have an amendment to discuss that involves Senator \nHutchison's amendment. Then there is an amendment from Senators Conrad \nand Dorgan. We have a colloquy with Senator Bingaman, and two other \namendments we do not have agreement on. It is still my hope, Mr. \nPresident, we would finish this bill before 6 p.m.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could get the attention of the manager \nof the bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. The Cloakroom just informed me of another Democratic \nSenator who wants 5 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I believe that would make it even. I am happy to add the \nSenator.\n  Who is it?\n  Mr. REID. Senator Feinstein.\n\n[[Page S4173]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add 5 minutes \nfor Senator Feinstein or that the 5 minutes be designated by Senator \nReid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 171\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that the Reid amendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 171) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 139\n\n       (Purpose: To allow emergency repairs of flood control \n     projects, structures and facilities)\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 139 which is at the \ndesk.\n  That is an amendment that is offered by Senators Kempthorne, Reid, \nChafee, Baucus, and Craig.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Kempthorne, for \n     himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Craig, and Mr. Baucus, \n     proposes amendment numbered 139.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       ``(a) Consultation or Conferencing.--Consultation or \n     conferencing under Section 7(a)(2) or Section 7(a)(4) of the \n     Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1536(a)) for any \n     action authorized, funded, or carried out by any federal \n     agency to repair a Federal or non-Federal flood control \n     project, facility or structure, may be deferred until after \n     the completion of the action if the Federal agency \n     authorizing, funding or carrying out the action determines \n     that the repair is needed to address an imminent threat to \n     public health or safety that has resulted, or that may \n     result, from a catastrophic natural event in 1996 or 1997. \n     For purposes of this section, the term repair shall include \n     preventive measures to anticipate the impact of a \n     catastrophic event and remedial measures to restore the \n     project, facility or structure to a condition that will \n     prevent an imminent threat to public health or safety.\n       ``(b) Mitigation.--Any reasonable and prudent measures \n     proposed under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act to \n     mitigate the impact of an action taken under this section on \n     an endangered species, or a threatened species to which the \n     incidental take prohibition of Section 9 has been applied by \n     regulation, shall be related both in nature and in extent to \n     the effect of the action taken to repair the flood control \n     project, facility or structure.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 139), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 50, line 15, strike all through page 51 \n     and insert the following:\n       ``(a) Consultation and Conferencing.--As provided by \n     regulations issued under the Endangered Species Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) for emergency situations, formal \n     consultation or conferencing under section 7(a)(2) or section \n     7(a)(4) of the Act for any action authorized, funded or \n     carried out by any Federal agency to repair a Federal or non-\n     Federal flood control project, facility or structure may be \n     deferred by the Federal agency authorizing, funding or \n     carrying out the action, if the agency determines that the \n     repair is needed to respond to an emergency causing an \n     imminent threat to human lives and property in 1996 or 1997. \n     Formal consultation or conferencing shall be deferred until \n     the imminent threat to human lives and property has been \n     abated.

Mr. President, this place we now find ourselves in is one \nthat is a perfect example of legislation. It is the art of compromise \nor the art of consensus building. It has been very difficult. It has \ntaken several days. I initially want to extend my appreciation to the \nchairman of the full committee, Senator Chafee, the ranking member of \nthe full committee, Senator Baucus, and also the two Senators from \nIdaho for their cooperation in this matter.\n  It has taken a long time. Our staffs have worked very hard. I think, \nthough, we have made something that will answer the questions that are \nnow before us in this emergency supplemental appropriations bill \ndealing with disasters.\n  Over the past days we worked hard to resolve the issue. I think we \nhave worked something out that is a compromise. There are things that \nwe do not all agree on, but it is something that I think will do the \njob.\n  I also state for the record that the administration has also agreed \nto this amendment and a modification. I understand that the \nadministration has also agreed to work with the Senators from Idaho on \nthe St. Maries issue involving a problem in the State of Idaho that was \na result of the floods that took place early this year. I have \nauthority on behalf of the administration to extend that offer and that \ncooperation to my friends from Idaho.\n  I hope that there are no large conclusions drawn from this debate \nthat has taken place behind the scenes the last few days. I hope that, \nhowever, this will allow us to go forward in the months to come with a \nreauthorization of the Endangered Species Act. It is important that we \ndo that. It is important that we all recognize that the Endangered \nSpecies Act is important, but we do need to do some things with it to \nmake it more practicable, and one that the States accept more than they \ndo now.\n  The application of this amendment on the pending legislation is \nsomething that is debatable as to whether it should have been done. \nSome of us feel that the work done by the administration and the Fish \nand Wildlife Service over the past several months, especially in the \nState of California where they issued a regulation that dealt with the \n47 counties there, was sufficient.\n  This is not the time to debate that issue. It is a time to declare \nthat the legislative process has worked and that we are now able to \nmove on past the issue that we now have before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, we have all read the stories lately \nabout the floods in North Dakota, along the Mississippi River, in \nCalifornia, and last year in Idaho and the Pacific Northwest. What we \ndidn't read much about though was the unnecessary loss of life and \nproperty that was the result of preventive measures that weren't taken \nand repairs that weren't made. In some cases, those repairs weren't \nmade because the local communities were told that the repairs might \nadversely affect an endangered species and that therefore consultation \nwith the Fish and Wildlife Service would be required under the \nEndangered Species Act. Public safety, human lives, and property were \nput at risk because of a procedural, bureaucratic requirement. And \nthat's just wrong.\n  Let me tell you about a community in Benewah County, ID, which has \njust been through this consultation process. Last year, that community, \nSt. Maries was devastated by floods. We were lucky that no lives were \nlost, but people lost their homes, their businesses, and their \nproperty. The floods also caused significant damage to levees on the \nSt. Joe River. The County began work with the Army Corps of Engineers \nand the Economic Development Agency to repair the levees last year, but \nthe work stopped in February of this year when they were informed by \nthe Fish and Wildlife Service that consultation under the ESA would be \nrequired on the repair work because there might be American Bald Eagles \nin the area. No work has been done to repair the levees since February, \nwhile the Federal agencies have engaged in consultation.\n  The problem is that St. Maries and Benewah County are facing more \nflooding again this year. Snow pack in north Idaho is at 150 percent \nabove normal levels. When that snow melts, communities like St. Maries \nthat were devastated by last year's floods may\n\n[[Page S4174]]\n\nagain be destroyed and people killed if the levees aren't repaired. And \nin the case of St. Maries, it isn't even really a question of \nprotecting an endangered species. The Fish and Wildlife Service has \nacknowledged that the levy repair work would not adversely affect the \nAmerican Bald Eagle.\n  We are dealing with a true emergency situation. And it's not just an \nemergency in St. Maries, ID. There are emergency situations in North \nDakota, California, and other States too. That's why I am offering this \namendment, along with Senator Chafee and my colleague from Idaho, \nSenator Craig.\n  Our amendment would accomplish three things.\n  First, the amendment will allow critical flood repair work and \npreventive maintenance to go forward, protecting human lives and \nproperty in an emergency situation. It gives Federal action agencies--\nthose responsible for authorizing, funding, and carrying out flood \ncontrol activities--the authority to defer the consultation process \nuntil after the threat to human lives or property is gone. For St. \nMaries, that would have meant that the repair work could have \ncontinued, and the risk to that community may have been avoided.\n  Second, the amendment will ensure that endangered species and their \nhabitat are protected. it recognizes that in certain situations, some \nadditional measures might be appropriate after the fact to mitigate the \nimpacts of flood repair activities. Mitigation measures, however, \nshould not ever delay flood repairs or preventive measures where human \nlives are at stake. And they must be resonably related in nature and \nscope to the actual impact on the endangered species. St. Maries, which \nis surrounded by millions of acres of State and National Forests, was \ntold that, among other things, it would have to take out of farm \nproduction 35 acres and dedicate it to habitat for the Bald Eagle if it \nwanted to proceed with its levy repair, even though there is no \nevidence that Eagles would ever use the habitat. The total additional \ncost of the complete package for the mitigation that the Fish and \nWildlife Service wanted was almost $1 million. That has to change.\n  And finally, our amendment will require the Federal Government to \nshare in the costs of mitigation to the extent that it is involved in \nfunding or carrying out a flood repair activity. It is only reasonable \nthat the Government, which both conducts activities that impact \nendangered species and also requires mitigation for that impact, to pay \nits fair share of the costs of species protection. Communities like St. \nMaries should not have to bear the burden of mitigation costs when one \nFederal agency directed the activity that another thought would impact \nthe species and a third Federal agency funded the activity.\n  I strongly support this amendment and I urge my colleagues to do so \nas well, because an emergency can happen at any time and in any \ncommunity. And when it does, your communities also will want to have \nthe protection that is offered by this amendment.\n  But I want to emphasize at the same time that this is a narrow, \ntargeted amendment to address a true emergency situation. There are \nmany other problems in the current Endangered Species Act that also \nneed to be addressed, but this is not the appropriate vehicle to \naddress those broader, more fundamental problems. What we need is an \nESA bill that provides meaningful reform, while improving protection of \nour rare and unique fish and wildlife species, and we need that \nlegislation now. Indeed, the very fact that we face amendments to the \nESA on appropriations bills every year--last year, the ESA moratorium \nand others this year--clearly demonstrate that there is a need for ESA \nreform and a need to act now.\n  Many of you know that I have been working with Senator Chafee on a \ncomprehensive bill to reform and improve the ESA. We have drafted a \nbill that will significantly improve the way the ESA works, benefiting \nboth people and species. It will work to actually save species from \nextinction. It will treat property owners fairly. It will minimize the \nsocial and economic impacts on the lives of citizens. And it will \nprovide incentives to conserve rare and unique species. These are \nimportant goals and ones which we should all be able to support.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Chafee, my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, and the administration to pass \nlegislation that will finally bring much needed reform to the ESA. And \nthe time for that legislation is now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to join Senators Kempthorne, \nChafee, Craig, and Reid in offering this amendment. I would like to \nbriefly explain why Senator Reid and I strongly oppose section 311 of \nS. 672 and then summarize the alternative we worked out with Senators \nKempthorne, Chafee, and Craig.\n  We all sympathize with the victims of the recent floods in North \nDakota and Minnesota, and also with the victims of flooding earlier \nthis year in central California and along the Ohio River. These people \nhave suffered terribly.\n  This debate is not about whether they should receive assistance from \nthe Federal Government. Of course they should. And the assistance \nshould not be delayed.\n  But that is precisely the consequence of the language that the \ncommittee included in section 311 of the bill. The President has \nindicated that he would veto the bill if it includes section 311. So, \nif section 311 remains unchanged, we would, at the very least, delay \nthe delivery of urgently needed assistance.\n  Another point. Section 311 doesn't belong in this bill. It is not a \nlimitation on the use of funds, which is within the jurisdiction of the \nAppropriations Committee. Rather, it amends the authorizing statute, \nthe Endangered Species Act, which is within the jurisdiction of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee.\n  As our colleagues know, Senator Reid and I have been working closely \nwith Senators Chafee and Kempthorne for a number of months to write a \nbipartisan bill to reauthorize and reform the Endangered Species Act. \nit is complicated work, because we are trying to improve the \nconservation of species at the same time we make it easier for \nlandowners to comply with the law.\n  So far, it has been a bipartisan effort, including the \nadministration.\n  However, section 311 threatens our progress. If we start down the \npath of piecemeal changes, such as section 311, it may undermine the \nspirit and intent of those negotiations.\n  Finally, section 311 would open up a large loophole in the Endangered \nSpecies Act.\n  Let me put this argument in perspective.\n  The heart of the Endangered Species Act is section 7, which provides \nthat Federal agencies must consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service \nto ensure that their actions are not likely to jeopardize the continued \nexistence of an endangered or threatened species or destroy the \ncritical habitat of such a species. It's a sensible requirement that's \ncentral to our efforts to conserve species.\n  But let's face it. There may be times when it's just not possible to \ncomply with the ordinary consultation process. There's an emergency. A \nflood or a forest fire. Lives and property are threatened with imminent \ndestruction. Federal agencies must react quickly. They may not have \ntime to carefully consult to assure that their actions won't jeopardize \na species.\n  As things now stand, this is taken into account. A provision of the \ncurrent regulations allows Federal agencies to dispense with the \nordinary consultation process in emergencies. The regulation says:\n\n       Where emergency circumstances mandate the need to consult \n     in an expedited manner, consultation may be conducted \n     informally through alternative procedures that the Director \n     determines to be consistent with the requirements of sections \n     7(a)-(d) of the Act. This provision applies to situations \n     involving acts of God, disasters, casualties, national \n     defense or security emergencies, etc.\n\n  To put it another way, when there's an emergency, the Forest Service, \nthe Corps of Engineers, or any other action agency can initiate the \nemergency procedure, by calling the Fish and Wildlife Service and \nexplaining the situation. Fish and Wildlife will then step out of the \nway, so that the action agency can concentrate on addressing the \nemergency. Later, after the danger has subsided, Fish and Wildlife will \nbegin formal consultation to determine whether\n\n[[Page S4175]]\n\nadditional measures are needed to minimize the impact on the species.\n  This provision has already been successfully invoked many times. It \nhas been used to provide emergency assistance to victims of hurricanes, \nforest fires, and more recently, flooding in 46 counties in California.\n  In fact, in February of this year, the administration issued a policy \nstatement applying the emergency provisions, for the remainder of this \nyear's flood season, to the 46 counties in California that had been \ndeclared Federal disaster areas.\n  As a result, the Corps of Engineers can move quickly to repair or \nreplace flood control facilities in those counties, without being \nimpeded by the ESA.\n  In short, we don't have to choose between flood protection and \nspecies conservation. Using common sense and existing procedures, we \ncan ensure that agencies like the Corps of Engineers can do what needs \nto be done, quickly, to save human lives and protect property.\n  Section 311 of the bill, however, would go much further. It provides \na permanent exemption, from sections 7 and 9 of the Endangered Species \nAct, for operating, maintaining, repairing, or reconstructing flood \ncontrol projects to the extent necessary to address public health or \nsafety, in several different circumstances.\n  The language is confusing. What's more, the language creates a \nloophole, by creating a permanent exemption for any flood control \nmeasures undertaken ``to comply with a Federal, State, or local public \nhealth or safety requirement that was in effect during 1996 or 1997.''\n  What does this mean? The phrase ``public health or safety \nrequirement'' is very broad. Conceivably, it could be stretched to \ninclude almost any State or local law that conflicts with the \nEndangered Species Act. This could have major consequences for the \noperation of the act. At the very least, these consequences should be \nconsidered carefully, in the context of the overall reauthorization of \nthe Endangered Species Act, and not jammed into a supplemental \nappropriations bill.\n  Because of the grave nature of the flooding this year, Senator Reid \nand I recognize the need for an immediate and effective emergency \nresponse. In doing so, we reserve judgment about whether any provisions \nof this amendment should be applied more generally. That question must \nbe considered independently, in the contest of our negotiations on an \nESA reauthorization bill.\n  Drawing on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's emergency regulations \nand their February 19, 1997 policy, the Kempthorne-Chafee-Craig-Baucus-\nReid amendment would assure that people threatened by flooding could \nrespond quickly to an imminent threat to lives and property.\n  Specifically, our amendment would do two things. First, it would \nallow a Federal agency to defer formal consultation on repairs to flood \ncontrol projects that the agency determines are needed to respond to an \nimminent threat to human lives and property in 1996 or 1997. Unlike \nsection 311 of the bill, however, it would not exempt the agency from \nthe requirements of section 7 of the ESA. It would simply defer formal \nconsultation until the imminent threat to human lives and property had \nbeen abated.\n  Second, our amendment would require that any reasonable and prudent \nmeasures to minimize the impact of emergency repairs under this section \nmust be related in nature and extent to the effect of the action taken \nto repair the project.\n  Mr. President, the Kempthorne-Chafee-Craig-Baucus-Reid amendment was \nagreed to only after several days of difficult negotiations. Although \nthe amendment represents a compromise, I believe it addresses the needs \nof Federal agencies to respond to flood emergencies without undermining \nimportant protections for threatened and endangered species. Without \ndoubt, it is a significant improvement over section 311 of the bill.\n  Like Senator Reid, I strongly opposed the endangered species \nprovision that was included in the committee bill, and I will tell you \nthe four reasons.\n  First, the provision in the bill simply does not belong in the bill \nbecause it amends the Endangered Species Act. This is an appropriations \nbill, not a legislative bill.\n  Second, the provision is unnecessary. Why? Because existing \nregulations and policies already allow agencies to respond to floods \nand other emergencies without getting tied up in red tape under the \nact.\n  Third, the provision would undermine our efforts to provide badly \nneeded disaster relief, because the President has indicated that he \nwould veto the bill if the provision was included.\n  Fourth, and most significantly, the provision would open a loophole \nto the Endangered Species Act. The amendment we are offering today, in \ncontrast, is a compromise, that is the result of several days of hard \nnegotiations.\n  In contrast to the provision in the bill, this amendment by Senator \nReid would not exempt agencies from the requirements of the Endangered \nSpecies Act. Instead, it simply provides that, in certain emergency \nsituations in which it is necessary to make flood control repairs, an \nagency can defer formal consultation until the imminent threat to human \nlives and property has been abated.\n  By doing so, the amendment confirms that Federal agencies can respond \nto flood emergencies, but does not undermine protections for threatened \nand endangered species. It is a substantial improvement over the \nprovision in the committee bill. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to report after much debate \nand negotiation, my distinguished colleagues--Senator Kempthorne, \nSenator Reid, Senator Baucus, Senator Craig--and I have reached an \nagreement on language relating to the Endangered Species Act \nrequirements for emergency flood control activities. I want to also say \nthat the administration was a big help in this agreement. They were in \non our negotiations.\n  Our amendment will ensure that the requirements of the Endangered \nSpecies Act will not impede actions to address emergency situations. It \nremoves any uncertainty that the emergency procedures in the Endangered \nSpecies Act and its implementing regulations shall apply in those \nsituations, and it resolves several ambiguities and procedures. It is a \nsignificant resolution that will not only expedite the passage of the \nSupplemental Appropriations and Rescissions Act--the main bill we are \non here--but it also represents a promising step in our ongoing efforts \nto reauthorize the Endangered Species Act itself.\n  Briefly, I will touch on that. This, in my judgment, represents a \nsignificant step forward on the reauthorization of the Endangered \nSpecies Act which we are now working on in the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, and especially in the subcommittee headed by Senator \nKempthorne, with Senator Reid being the ranking member.\n  I thank my colleagues for their hard work on this issue. We took a \nlot of time. I especially want to thank Senator Kempthorne and Senator \nReid because of the hard work that they applied in bridging the \ndifferences between the original Craig amendment and the Reid \namendment. I also want to thank the senior Senator from Idaho, Senator \nCraig, who was very, very helpful in reaching this final accord. \nEverybody gave a little bit of something. That is why we are here \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, the floods that have devastated much of the Midwestern \nand Western United States have been a tragedy of immeasurable \ndimensions, both financially and emotionally for all of the affected \ncommunities. The Supplemental Appropriations and Rescissions Act will \nprovide desperately needed funds to continue the rebuilding process in \nthose communities. It should be passed without any controversial riders \nthat will slow its progress and threaten a veto.\n  No one can disagree with the absolute need to ensure that flood \ndamage is minimized and that emergency flood response measures can go \nforward without unnecessary impediments. Nothing should compromise our \nefforts to save lives and homes in times of emergencies, catastrophic \nevents and other disasters. These efforts must include measures to \nresponse adequately\n\n[[Page S4176]]\n\nto threats to health and safety as well measures to repair damaged \nflood control projects quickly and efficiently.\n  At the same time, there is a belief that the requirements of the \nEndangered Species Act do not allow for such exigencies, and that the \nact is inflexible and unworkable. This is a mistaken belief. The ESA \nitself and its implementing regulations explicitly allow for emergency \nactions to proceed without delay. Only after the emergency would the \nFish and Wildlife Service or National Marine Fisheries Service formally \nreview the action to determine its effects on endangered or threatened \nspecies, and whether such action requires any mitigation.\n  The FWS recently issued a policy for emergency flood control actions \nthat expounds on these emergency provisions and gives them specific \napplication to parts of California. The FWS has not only agreed to \nemergency procedures upon request by the Federal action agency, but it \nhas invited action agencies to use the emergency provisions of the law.\n  Mr. President, let me set the record straight: The Administration--\nboth the Army Corps of Engineers and the Fish and Wildlife Service--\nbelieve that these policies and procedures have addressed the needs of \nthe emergencies adequately. These provisions indicated that the ESA \nitself has the flexibility to address emergency situations, so that a \nfull exemption from the ESA is not required. To argue otherwise is just \nnot accurate. Upon careful review of the anecdotes that abound, it has \nnot been demonstrated that the ESA has impeded emergency response \nefforts.\n  But just as emergency flood control activities are to be carried out \nwithout impediments, it is equally important to recognize that such \nactivities can have long-term impacts on the environment, including \nfish and wildlife and their habitat. Merely because an action must be \ntaken to address an emergency does not mean that it has no effects on \nwildlife, or that those effects need not be considered subsequent to \nthe emergency. When necessary and appropriate, the impacts of these \nactivities on our natural resources should be mitigated. Indeed, \nCongress has explicitly required such mitigation in the Army Corps of \nEngineer's own authorities, such as the Water Resources Development \nAct.\n  The ESA, in turn, contains its own requirements with respect to \nendangered and threatened wildlife. Specifically, section 7(a)(2) \nrequires that each Federal agency ensure that its actions are not \nlikely to jeopardize listed species, and section 7(b)(4) requires that \nFWS or NMFS specify reasonable and prudent measures to minimize the \nimpacts of any taking of such species.\n  The fact that mitigation is required both in the corps' statutory \nauthority and in the ESA underscores the dual purpose of mitigation: \nNot only is it important for protection of wildlife, it is also \nimportant for effective management of the flood plain. Effective flood \nplain management requires adoption of measures to reduce flood damage, \nas well as measures to reduce future susceptibility to floods. These \nmeasures go hand in hand with protection of the flood plain resources \nthemselves. Mitigation is thus an important component of flood control \nthat cannot be ignored.\n  Yesterday, the House of Representatives debated and defeated the \noriginal version of H.R. 478, a bill that provided a sweeping exemption \nof all operations, maintenance, repair, and restoration of flood \ncontrol facilities. While this exemption ostensibly was intended to \naddress emergency situations, one does not have to read between the \nlines to see that H.R. 478 would have exempted all actions relating to \nflood control facilities from the ESA, even without any emergency \nsituation. That bill was nothing more than a transparent attempt to use \nthe ESA as a scapegoat for natural disasters and thus exempt a broad \ncategory of activities from the law, in perpetuity, under the guise of \nan emergency. I strongly oppose the terms of that bill, as well as \nsimilar bills or amendments in either the House or Senate.\n  By contrast, my distinguished colleagues--Senators Kempthorne, Craig, \nBaucus, and Reid--and I have negotiated an amendment to S. 672, with \ninvolvement by the administration, that is narrowly tailored to remove \nany uncertainty that the emergency procedures under the ESA shall apply \nin emergency situations. Let me repeat: The emergency procedures of the \nESA shall apply in emergency situations. This would not require either \nan exemption nor an amendment to the current law. Our amendment does \nnot contain language that could be misconstrued to create emergencies \nwhen none exist. Our amendment considers emergency situations to be \nthose natural events that cause an imminent threat to human lives and \nproperty. Our amendment applies to emergencies that occurred in 1996 or \nat any time during 1997. We are including 1996 to ensure that flood \ncontrol facilities damaged in last year's floods can be repaired \nexpeditiously, to address emergencies that might arise this year. There \nis no sunset provision in our amendment, because of this inherent \ntemporal limitation to emergencies only in 1996 and 1997.\n  Our amendment effectively codifies the current practice of the \nadministration to defer formal consultation until after the emergency \nis over. This practice provides that the Federal agency taking the \nemergency action will consult informally with either FWS or NMFS at any \ntime prior to or during the emergency. This informal consultation can \nbe nothing more than a phone call between the agencies.\n  More importantly, our amendment resolves several ambiguities as to \napplication of the existing emergency provisions. First, it makes clear \nthat it is the Federal action agency that will have the discretion to \ndetermine whether an emergency exists.\n  Second, it clarifies that the actions to which this provision applies \nare repairs as needed to respond to an emergency causing an imminent \nthreat to human lives and property, until that threat has been abated. \nThis is consistent with the description of emergency actions in the \nstatute and regulations of the Army Corps of Engineers. The corps \nconsiders emergency activities to include flood emergency preparation, \nflood fighting and rescue operations, postflood response, and emergency \nrepair and restoration of flood control works. These measures are \ndesigned to meet an imminent flood threat, while permanent \nrehabilitation of flood control works are considered separately. Our \namendment includes those emergency measures, and does not include \nroutine maintenance and operations that would otherwise require ESA \nconsultation.\n  Third, it makes clear that repairs can include both preventive and \nremedial measures to restore the project to a condition to remove an \nimminent threat to human lives and property.\n  Lastly, the amendment would require that reasonable and prudent \nmeasures be related both in nature and extent to the effect of the \naction. The current law requires that reasonable and prudent measures \nmust not alter the basic design, location, scope, duration, or timing \nof the action and may involve only minor changes. This requirement \nmakes sense for proposed actions that have yet to be taken. However, it \ndoes not apply well to actions already taken, such as those necessary \nto address emergencies. There have been instances where FWS has \nspecified measures that the action agency feels go too far, but about \nwhich the agency can do nothing because its action has already been \ncompleted. Our amendment would ensure that reasonable and prudent \nmeasures specified for an action already taken or currently in progress \nwill be similar in scope to measures that may be required for proposed \nactions.\n  It is important to note that the measures must be related to the \neffects of the action on listed species, not to the cost or nature of \nthe action itself. Furthermore, by including this requirement, we do \nnot prohibit any particular type of reasonable and prudent measure, \nsuch as offsite mitigation.\n  Mr. President, Senator Kempthorne and I have been working diligently \ntogether to reauthorize the ESA. We issued a discussion draft for \nreauthorization in late January 1997, and we have since been \nnegotiating with the minority members of the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works and the administration. My strong preference is to \navoid any amendments relating to the ESA in this, or any other, \nappropriations bill. The proper context in which to discuss whether the \nESA needs to address emergency situations better, and how the ESA \nshould define\n\n[[Page S4177]]\n\nreasonable and prudent measures, is our reauthorization process, not \nhere. My other goal is to avoid a contentious debate on the ESA when we \nare trying to pass an appropriations bill expeditiously, and when we \nare trying also to reauthorize the ESA itself expeditiously. I believe \nthat our amendment accomplishes both of those goals.\n  In sum, our amendment will ensure that the requirements of the \nEndangered Species Act will not impede actions to address emergency \nsituations. It removes any uncertainty that the emergency procedures in \nthe ESA and its implementing regulations shall apply in those \nsituations, and it further resolves several ambiguities in those \nprocedures. It is a significant resolution that will not only expedite \npassage of the Supplemental Appropriations and Rescissions Act, but \nalso represents a promising step in our ongoing efforts to reauthorize \nthe ESA itself. For these reasons, I encourage my colleagues to support \nthis amendment.\n  I thank my colleagues for their hard work in this issue, especially \nSenator Kempthorne, who worked tirelessly with me to bridge the \ndifferences between the original Craig amendment and the Reid \namendment. The amendment on which we agree today is based on an \namendment filed by Senator Kempthorne.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Reid amendment \nand really on the subject in general, particularly from a California \nperspective.\n  California has over 6,000 miles of flood control levees. In the last \ndecade, we have had three 100-year storms, in 1986, 1995, and 1997.\n  In 1986, four levees failed, three in the delta, one in Yuba County.\n  In 1995, 25 levees failed.\n  In 1997, there were 62 significant levee breaks, according to the \nCorps of Engineers. Of these, 40 were federally maintained levees, and \nthe rest were non-Federal.\n  On January 2, the Feather River broke through the levee at Star Bend, \nflooding 15 square miles of farmland and the community of Olivehurst. \nThe breach was 1,500 feet long.\n  This flood damage is relevant to the amount of money that is going to \nCalifornia in emergency assistance right now--$3.3 billion.\n  On January 4, a Sutter bypass levee failed at Meridian, flooding a \n35,000 acre basin with more than 60 homes and businesses. The breach at \nMeridian was 1,100 feet long.\n  On January 4, the San Joaquin River plunged through levees in 14 \nplaces near the town of Mendota, flooding about 10,000 acres of \nfarmland on both sides of the river in Madera and Fresno Counties. The \nbiggest levee break, at Firebaugh, was 2,500 feet long.\n  On January 5, more levees broke along the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and \nSan Joaquin Rivers, causing flooding near Modesto. Now, the levees are \na critical part of California's infrastructure and, in my view, they \nare the most troubled part of our infrastructure. In an earthquake, in \na flood, when these levees go, two things happen. One, the water in \nthese rivers is the drinking water for 20 million people. The soil \nbehind the levees is peat. As the levees break, and the peat land is \nflooded and then drains, the peat soil drains back into the river. When \nthis water is treated with chlorine for drinking water, it throws off \ncarcinogens. So that has necessitated a change in the water treatment. \nAdditionally, salt water intrusion also contaminates the drinking water \nsupply.\n  So, not only do the levees protect farm land, the levees also protect \nour major source of drinking water.\n  Now, the problem here is maintenance of these levees. I spent 3 days \ntalking to farmers. What farmers tell me increasingly is they are not \ngoing to maintain the levees because the bureaucratic hassle is so \ngreat. To pull out a bush on a levy, they have to go and get a permit. \nThey have to mitigate. They do not have the money to mitigate. \nTherefore, more and more of the levees are not maintained. If the \nlevees are not maintained and the levees break, the amount of Federal \nmoney that goes to California is just going to increase.\n  In addition, damage is done to cattle, to dairy cows, to farms, to \norchards; homes are under water; and people's businesses are being \nwiped out. Why? Because in places, levees are not properly maintained \nbecause of the Endangered Species Act. I am not saying that these levee \nbreaks are related to the Endangered Species Act, because I do not \nknow. However, I do know from firsthand testimony to me that there are \npeople that are not maintaining the levees because of the bureaucratic \nhassle they have to go through.\n  For example, the slopes of the levees along the Feather River in \nSutter County have become overgrown in recent years with trees and \nvegetation, including elderberry shrubs. This vegetation hides rodent \nholes and beaver dams which undermine the integrity of the levees. \nThese shrubs on the Feather River levees are habitat for the Valley \nElderberry Longhorn Beetle which is listed as a threatened species \nunder the Federal Endangered Species Act and the State act. U.S. Fish \nand Wildlife has indicated that if Sutter County tries to eliminate \nthis habitat and maintain the levees, they would require mitigation. \nElderberry bushes could only be removed from levees if replacement \nbushes were planted elsewhere. Sutter County cannot pay for this \nmitigation and take farmland out of production for habitat.\n  The Central Delta Water Agency says the prohibition of dredging and \nplacement of fill for levee maintenance and the creation of shaded \nriverside aquatic or marsh habitat in areas designated as critical \nhabitat for Delta smelt has been a problem. The agency has been \nrequired to spend money on habitat assessments, consultations, \ninspection, mitigation, and emergency removal--money which the agency \nbelieves would be better spent on reducing the flood risks.\n  Now, this is the point I want to make and it is important. In 1996, \nwhen Yuba County tried to move forward with a Corps of Engineers \nproject to upgrade levees south of Marysville, the Fish and Wildlife \nService would not let them proceed with the repair work after October 1 \nbecause the garter snake was dormant. If they repaired the levees after \nOctober 1, they might disturb a sleeping garter snake. They had to do \ncostly mitigation before they could make these repairs. So the work was \nnot done, and on January 2, a levee broke at Olivehurst, killing three \npeople and flooding 500 homes.\n  I am delighted, Mr. President, that the Senator from Idaho, Mr. \nKempthorne, is in the chair and he is hearing these comments because, \nfor this Senator, the Endangered Species Act--when it comes to the \nprotection of life and property--really needs a second look. I heard \nthis over and over and over again when I went to Yuba County. As a \nmatter of fact, one family was standing there sobbing and had no place \nfor their children. Their children were taken from them, when their \nproperty was flooded, and put in foster homes. When it comes to a \ngarter snake versus somebody's home and property and life and limb, I \nreally think we need to get our priorities straight. That is why I \nbelieve these levees should not be included in the ESA, that \nmaintenance should be ongoing, and that repair and rebuilding should be \npermitted without a major bureaucratic hassle. I thank the Senator for \nhis indulgence.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I don't think the Senator from California \nknows how much I appreciate her speaking boldly and frankly this \nafternoon about a very real, human problem, which is the inability to \ndo reasonable and responsible maintenance on structures built over the \nlast hundred years in our country to protect life and property. We are \nnot allowed to do it, in many instances, because of the current \nEndangered Species Act. And I know, as most Senators know, that that \nwas never the intent of the Endangered Species Act.\n  Another reason we are here this afternoon is because my colleague, \nwho is now Presiding Officer, Senator Kempthorne of Idaho, has acted \nboldly over the last 2 years to try to bring about responsible \nreauthorization of the Endangered Species Act. It just hasn't gotten \ndone. The reason is because too many people behind him want to act \ntimidly. It was because of that, because of the effort that the\n\n[[Page S4178]]\n\nSenator from Idaho had taken because of a crisis situation that existed \nin the small north Idaho logging community of Saint Maries, where a \nflood had occurred, a town had been under water, dikes had been \ndestroyed, and now we were in the rebuilding process this last late \nfall and winter, at a time of unprecedented snowfall in Idaho, with a \nperched watershed of nearly 200 percent of normal sitting above this \ncommunity, and in steps the Fish and Wildlife Service and halts the \nconstruction of the dikes, as my colleague from Idaho has expressed, \nand basically said, ``We want you to spend a million dollars \nmitigating.'' Those in the community said, ``My goodness, can't you see \nwe are at risk here? Can't you see we have just replaced our homes? \nCan't you see we have just repaired our livelihoods and we have an \nimpending flood and crisis in the making?'' The U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService said, in essence, we don't care, because the Endangered Species \nAct requires--thank goodness, the chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee and Senator Reid and Senator Kempthorne and I \nwere able to sit down, after I placed this amendment in the \nsupplemental bill, to crank their tail and get some attention, that it \nwas time we acted just a little boldly to solve a problem.\n\n  I must say that my colleagues did come together and they have acted a \nlittle boldly--I appreciate that--to amend the Endangered Species Act. \nI hope we can get that done in the comprehensive legislation that \nSenator Kempthorne, Senator Chafee, and Senator Reid are working on. It \nmust be done. We want to protect species of plants and animals and \ninsects; but doggone it, we have to protect human life. The hundreds of \nmillions of dollars worth of investment in the California Delta is at \nrisk today, as the Senator from California has so clearly said, and now \nit will cost hundreds of millions to replace it, when it would have \ncost hundreds of thousands just to maintain it. That is what we need in \nIdaho; that's what we need in the Red River Valley in the Dakotas, in \nCalifornia, in Oregon, and in Washington, and any other place in the \nNation where flooding can and does occur, where dikes and levees have \nbeen built. We need the legislation that is now before us. I am glad we \nhave come to an agreement where that can be resolved.\n  Will mitigation occur after the fact? Of course, it will. We want \nthat to happen. Now, I am disappointed that we could not recognize the \nfinancing tool that is necessary and very critical to the Senator from \nCalifornia and important to Idaho. But I am also pleased that my \ncolleague from Nevada would recognize our need in north Idaho and agree \nto help us mitigate the situation in Saint Maries. So what we have now \nis an amendment to this supplemental appropriations bill for 1996 and \n1997 that eliminates this lengthy, unnecessary delay, that makes \neligible flood projects respond to mitigation and activities to go \nforward. Eligible flood control projects are only allowed to perform \npreventive and remedial measures directly related to the natural \ndisaster and for imminent safety threats. This is the compromise. It is \nan important one. It resolves the problem for 2 years--last year and \nthis year. And then if we have not been able to effectively address the \nEndangered Species Act, as we should--and I know my colleague, the \nSenator from Idaho, wants to accomplish and is working to accomplish \nthis--my guess is that the Senator from California and I will be back.\n  We have to solve our problems in Idaho, we have to solve the problems \nin California, and we have to solve this problem nationwide that man, \npersons, humans and his or her property come first when an imminent \ncrisis is at hand, where their lives can be destroyed and their \nproperty swept away. They deserve the right to be first. Then we will \nworry about, as we should, any loss of habitat or species that might \noccur as a result of this natural disaster.\n  So I thank all of the parties for coming together to work with us to \nresolve this problem. Mr. President, it is my understanding that no one \nelse wishes to address this. I believe we may be now ready for a vote.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have 2 minutes left and I will use that.\n  Mr. President, we have agreed to a narrowly tailored provision to \naddress a specific issue caused by this year's historic flooding. I \nread from testimony given by John Garamendi, who is from California, \nthe Deputy Secretary of the Department of the Interior, who said.\n\n       . . . we are aware of no case where it can be shown that \n     implementation of the Endangered Species Act caused any flood \n     control structures to fail. Nor has the presence of any \n     listed species prevented the proper operation and maintenance \n     of flood control facilities prior to recent floods.\n\n  That was just given to a committee of this Congress.\n  I say that protecting lives or property are not mutually exclusive. \nAlso, Mr. President, the Endangered Species Act didn't cause the floods \nor the damages. I believe that this narrowly tailored amendment is \nhelpful. It certainly makes the duties of the administrative agencies \nmore clear, even though the Endangered Species Act had language that \nwould cover emergency provisions. I move the amendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a group of \nletters on this issue from many of our citizens in Idaho and different \ngroups be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       National Endangered Species\n\n\n                                         Act Reform Coalition,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 2, 1997.\n     Hon. Larry E. Craig,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Craig: During the week of May 5, you will be \n     given an opportunity to support communities as they endeavor \n     to protect themselves from, and clean up after, some of the \n     most damaging floods in decades. An amendment to the FY 1997 \n     Supplemental Appropriations bill, offered by Senator Larry \n     Craig (R-ID) and adopted by the Senate Appropriations \n     Committee on April 30, would allow the proper maintenance of \n     flood control facilities in areas operating under \n     restrictions associated with the federal Endangered Species \n     Act (ESA) to continue undisturbed by ESA-related regulations. \n     On behalf of the millions of Americans represented by the \n     National Endangered Species Act Reform Coalition, we urge you \n     to vote against any attempts to remove this language from the \n     FY 1997 Supplemental Appropriations bill.\n       While there is still debate over how much ESA-related \n     regulations contributed to the severity of the flooding in \n     California and elsewhere earlier this year, there is little \n     debate over the fact that these same regulations have \n     hampered efforts to save human life and restore structures \n     damaged in the flooding. The Department of the Interior \n     admitted as much when it suspended the ESA in California so \n     that desperately needed repairs could be made to damaged \n     levees.\n       Senator Craig's amendment eliminates the lengthy, \n     unnecessary delays to flood control efforts that have \n     threatened human life and property. Contrary to what some of \n     the amendment's detractors have said, this is a narrowly \n     focussed initiative which would not provide for the \n     suspension of the ESA to build new flood control facilities \n     or dams.\n       Please vote against any attempts to strip the Craig \n     amendment out of the FY 1997 Supplemental Appropriations bill \n     and help Congress relieve some of the unnecessary burdens \n     that are associated with the current ESA.\n       If you have any questions, or would like additional \n     information on NESARC, please feel free to contact the \n     Coalition's Executive Director, Nancy Macan McNally, at (202) \n     333-7481.\n           Sincerely,\n     James A. McClure,\n       Chairman.\n     Glenn English,\n       Vice Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                Endangered Species\n\n\n                                         Coordinating Council,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 2, 1997.\n     Hon. Larry Craig,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Craig: On behalf of the attached list of \n     members of the Endangered Species Coordinating Council \n     (ESCC), a coalition of over 200 companies, associations, \n     individuals and labor unions involved in ranching, mining, \n     forestry, wildlife management, manufacturing, construction, \n     fishing, and agriculture, we would like to thank you and \n     offer our support for your language in the FY 97 Supplemental \n     Appropriations bill (H.R. 1469) which targets emergency, time \n     specific flood control measures for relief from certain \n     Endangered Species Act requirements. It is our understanding \n     that Senate floor consideration of H.R. 1469 is scheduled to \n     begin on Monday, May 5.\n       In recent weeks, Americans have been horrified by the pain \n     and suffering caused those who have been caught in the \n     flooding across the Midwest and California. We have\n\n[[Page S4179]]\n\n     watched as homes, businesses, entire communities have been \n     washed off the map. It is a heartbreaking situation.\n       Your language would allow preventative maintenance and \n     repair of flood control structures, activities that now are \n     almost impossible due to the strictures imposed by the \n     Endangered Species Act (ESA). In order to undertake levee \n     maintenance or repairs under the current law, flood control \n     officials must adhere to rigid regulatory requirements that \n     are extremely difficult to satisfy and that exact a \n     tremendous cost at the local level.\n       Protection of endangered species is a goal we all share, \n     but it must be balanced with some common sense. Consequently, \n     we have urged every member of the Senate to support your \n     language in the FY 97 Supplemental Appropriations bill to \n     allow the relaxation of the regulatory strictures that are \n     making it impossible for families and business owners to be \n     protected against the kind of devastation we have witnessed \n     these past few weeks.\n       We also consider your legislative language as a step in the \n     process to modernize the Endangered Species Act. This law \n     badly needs updating so that we can return some reason to the \n     process of protecting threatened and endangered species. \n     Passage of H.R. 1469 with your flood control language is a \n     good step in the right direction to designing a better law \n     that will work for listed species, as well as the human \n     species.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   John M.

Larry Craig,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graig: We are writing to support the Craig \n     language to the Supplemental Appropriations bill. The \n     language will enhance disaster prevention at it allows local \n     levee districts and local governments the ability to repair \n     and maintain flood control devices without falling under the \n     strict confines of the Endangered Species Act. Under current \n     regulations, these governments and agencies find it difficult \n     and expensive, if not impossible, to take the necessary \n     measures to ensure levees and dikes work to stop flooding it \n     there is a possible endangered species conflict.\n       The land involved in this exemption is less than one-one \n     hundredth of one percent of the land mass of the United \n     States. We feel strongly that human life and health concerns \n     should be outweigh concerns about removing such a small \n     amount of land from possible species protection. Please \n     support any effort to keep this language in the Senate \n     version of the supplemental appropriations bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Dean R. Kleckner,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Edison Electric Institute,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 2, 1997.\n     Hon. Larry E. Craig,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC,\n       Dear Larry: Very shortly, the Senate will debate the urgent \n     supplemental (S. 672), which contains a provision authored by \n     Senate Craig to ensure that actions can be taken in a timely \n     fashion to maintain the structural integrity and operational \n     soundness of projects that serve a flood control mission. In \n     relieving certain activities associated with flood and \n     control projects from consultation requirements and \n     ``incidental take'' liability under the Endangered Species \n     Act, Section 311 seeks to ensure that the well-known \n     regulatory burdens associated with the law do not interfere \n     with public safety.\n       For almost 100 years dams, reservoirs dikes and levees have \n     provided effective protection to many Americans against loss \n     of life and catastrophic destruction of homes and \n     livelihoods. The systems's effectiveness, however, depends on \n     careful inspection, maintenance, and repair of the flood and \n     control facilities. Failure to maintain these facilities in \n     good condition can result in catastrophic consequences even \n     in the most normal of conditions, not to mention the unusual \n     and unpredicted natural events like those that have occupied \n     news headlines this spring.\n       The Edison Electric Institute and its member companies, \n     which serve 79 percent of all electricity customers in the \n     United States, regularly confront the demands of ensuring the \n     availability and reliability of that public service while \n     negotiating the hurdles associated with many regulatory \n     requirements. We are committed to environmental protection, \n     including fish and wildlife beyond those that are listed as \n     threatened and endangered. We know from experience, however, \n     the difficulties and risks associated with carrying out \n     emergency repairs under the liabilities of the Endangered \n     Species Act, as well as the problems that arise from the time \n     consuming and resource intensive consultation requirements of \n     the law.\n       Edison Electric Institute believes that Congress would be \n     acting wisely to ensure that public safety needs and the \n     species protection requirements of the Endangered Species Act \n     do not work at cross purposes, either in preventing needed \n     maintenance and emergency repairs or in imposing costs that \n     do not provide a direct benefit to fish and wildlife at the \n     expense of investments to protect public safety. Relief \n     should be provided without the time limitations presently \n     contained in Section 311 of S. 672.\n           Sincerely,\n     Thomas R. Kuhn.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Idaho Association of Counties,\n\n                                           Boise, ID, May 6, 1997.\n     Hon. Larry Craig,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     RE: Flood Control Amendment to the ESA.\n\n       Dear Senator Craig: On behalf of all of Idaho's counties \n     affected by recent flood disasters, the Idaho Association of \n     Counties strongly supports your amendment to the Endangered \n     Species Act to reduce the regulatory burden on flood control \n     projects.\n       It is critical to Idaho's citizens and their counties that \n     immediate action be taken to eliminate lengthy and totally \n     unnecessary delays to flood control efforts that have \n     threatened human life and property. To do otherwise ignores \n     the toll these floods have taken on the physical and economic \n     well-being of Idaho's citizens and their property.\n       The limited scope of your amendment will allow Idaho's \n     local governments to respond as necessary to perform \n     necessary reconstruction, repair, maintenance of operation \n     measures directly related to the floods or imminent safety \n     threat as a result of the floods of 1996 and 1997.\n       Again, the Idaho Association of Counties strongly supports \n     your amendment and encourages your colleagues to do the same.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Daniel G. Chadwick,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           County of Boundary,\n\n                                   Bonners Ferry, ID, May 5, 1997.\n     Senator Larry Craig,\n     Coeur d'Alene, ID.\n       Dear Senator Craig: The Boundary County Commissioners \n     support the amendment to the 1973 Endangered Species act to \n     reduce the regulatory burden on individuals and local, State \n     and federal agencies in complying with that in connection \n     with flood control projects.\n       At this time, Boundary County has no projects that could be \n     enhanced by this amendment. However, we can see that this \n     common sense approach to problems associated to the \n     devastating flooding can speed the work required to protect \n     the health and safety of the people in other parts of Idaho \n     and across this great nation.\n       The Boundary County Commissioners whole-heartedly support \n     this amendment and request that the United States Senate do \n     as well.\n           Sincerely,\n     Merle E. Dinning,\n                                                         Chairman.\n     Murreleen Skeen,\n                                                     Commissioner.\n     Kevin Lederhos,\n     Commissioner.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 Benewah County Civil Defense,\n\n                                      St. Maries, ID, May 6, 1997.\n     Senator Larry Craig,\n     Coeur d'Alene, ID.\n       Dear Senator Craig: Your efforts to amend the Endangered \n     Species Act of 1973, as regarding regulations that have \n     hamstrung local efforts to rebuild floods damaged levees, are \n     appreciated. The suggested suspension or lessening of \n     portions of the regulations, if accomplished in a timely \n     manner, could have a positive effect on our efforts to \n     recover from last year's flood.\n       Local agencies have been hindered to the point of impotence \n     in fulfilling their role in protecting life and property. \n     Drainage district commissioners, county commissioners and \n     transportation officials have labored futilely to wend \n     through the labyrinth constructed by federal interpretation \n     of this Act.\n       Much of its stands without common sense. Much of it is \n     arbitrary. None of it is provided with a speedy appeal or \n     consultation process.\n       Last year, our flood waters were in excess of ten feet \n     above flood stage. Levees were overtopped and required \n     rebuilding to even withstand normal spring run off levels. \n     Unfortunately, normal levels are not in our Spring, 1997 \n     forecasts. The levees now stand, leaking and not \n     reconstructed as planned.\n       You have no idea of the exasperation that I feel as \n     emergency manager for Benewah\n\n[[Page S4180]]\n\n     County that with weakened levees, we are entering into what \n     might well be a more treacherous experience then the 1996 \n     flood. For what reason? The ESA is necessary legislation, but \n     public health or safety requires equal representation with \n     the endangered species.\n                                                George M. Currier,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to congratulate those Members who \nhave spent a good part of the last 2 days in search of a compromise on \nthis question of how we make sure that these emergency efforts are not \nunreasonably hindered by compliance with the Endangered Species Act.\n  I have serious reservations about this compromise. This amendment \nincludes a provision that seeks to clarify the phrase ``reasonable and \nprudent measures'' in the context of the Endangered Species Act. \nReasonable and prudent measures are those things that the Fish and \nWildlife Service or NMFS may require in order to protect fish and \nwildlife from the adverse effects of, in this case, a specific repair \nor reconstruction project.\n  The language directs that these measures be scaled to the scope and \neffect of the specific repair or reconstruction project. We are told by \nthe amendment sponsors that their intent is to simply re-state existing \nlaw.\n  This raises two important procedural questions:\n  First, if the intent is simply to express a concept that is already \nin the law, then I see no reason to include it here.\n  Second, the question of how we define the scope of section 7 \nconsultations under the ESA is a major issue in our work to reauthorize \nthe Act. It strikes me as imprudent for the Senate to go on record on \nthis question in this disaster supplemental, when at the same time the \nsame issue is under intense negotiation in the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee.\n  Having said that, there are several basic reasons to oppose the \nbill's existing provision allowing a broad exemption of all facilities \nwith flood control functions from the requirements of the Endangered \nSpecies Act.\n  First, the financial resources that this legislation brings to bear \non the extensive damages caused by this year's disastrous flooding are \nimmediately threatened and unreasonably delayed by using the bill as a \nvehicle to broadly amend the Endangered Species Act. It seems clear to \nthis Senator that the bill would be vetoed and we would be back to the \ndrawing board in trying to direct Federal resources toward the people \nwho have faced awesome difficulties in dealing with this year's flood \nwaters.\n  Second, I firmly believe there is precious little support on either \nside of this issue for continuing to seek slam dunk, back door riders \nas a method of changing basic environmental laws. Reauthorization of \nthe Endangered Species Act is already a complex and difficult chore, \nand we should set about that business within the regular committee \nprocess.\n  And third, I am convinced that this provision is a case of Washington \ntrying to fix a problem that simply does not exist. Let me talk more \nabout this third concern.\n  We have shown in Oregon--which has no shortage of endangered species \nissues--that we can get the dredges and cranes going quickly in \nresponse to the widespread damage we suffered in this extraordinary \nflood year. And we did it without sweeping aside the law.\n  We went down an almost identical road here in Congress in responding \nto last year's flooding. We provided emergency funding to address major \nproblems, and that effort, I'm pleased to report, was successful. Since \nOregon's 1996 floods, literally thousands of actions have been taken to \nrepair flood damage and restore natural resources. These include more \nthan 400 emergency projects of the Natural Resources Conservation \nService, more than 150 projects of the BLM, and more than 350 Forest \nService projects on the Mt. Hood National Forest alone. None of these \nhas been stopped or significantly delayed by the Endangered Species Act \nor other environmental laws.\n  Oregon's experience once again is a model for the rest of the Nation. \nIn fact, I'm told that it was Oregon's experience that has led to the \nmuch more efficient response to the floods in Idaho this year.\n  The record in my State is clear: when we need an emergency response \nto flood damage, we can do it efficiently under current statutory \nauthority.\n  I want to talk for a moment about one example of our innovation--the \ncooperation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that ensured that \nthese 1996 reconstruction projects went forward in a way that protects \nfisheries and aquatic resources. Early coordination with the Service \nled to the preparation of a manual that guided early project design \nwork. We got the Service some extra money last year to put staff \ndirectly on the reconstruction projects. These efforts allowed the \nvarious agencies to essentially pre-approve various flood projects that \nmay be funded by this year's supplemental flood response request.\n  The bottom line is, of course, that the process enabled the highest \ncare to be taken in protection of fish and wildlife, but without delay \nto the projects.\n  Idaho has now benefitted from the Oregon experience. Already this \nyear, I'm told that the Natural Resources Conservation Service in Idaho \nhas processed three times the volume of flood repair projects as were \ndone in all of last year in that State.\n  Finally, I believe the interests of the American people are advanced \nbest when we address major issues in their proper forum and context. \nAll of us support an appropriate streamlining of the Endangered Species \nAct to ensure the efficient reconstruction and maintenance of critical \nriver facilities damaged by this extraordinary flooding.\n  This is not the time to begin a major overhaul of the Endangered \nSpecies Act. This bill would waive Endangered Species Act compliance in \na broad range of nonemergency situations, including the routine \noperation and maintenance of Federal flood control facilities--flood \ncontrol being one of the many benefits provided by virtually every dam, \nlevee, and dike along our rivers.\n  I cannot imagine that we now want to take a sledgehammer to the \nrequirements that Federal river facilities comply with the act and \noperate in a manner that is as protective as possible of the various \nsalmon species that are in real trouble in our region.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All debate having expired, the question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 139, as modified, offered by Senators \nKempthorne, Reid, Chafee, Craig, and Baucus.\n  The amendment (No. 139) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 118\n\n(Purpose: To ensure full funding of disaster assistance without adding \n                          to the Federal debt)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nturn to amendment No. 118, offered by the Senator from Texas. One hour \nof debate equally divided has been agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield before he starts?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We have an hour equally divided. So that will mean the \nrollcall vote will start at 4:55.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 118.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act or \n     any other law, each amount of budget authority provided in a \n     nonexempt discretionary spending nondefense account for \n     fiscal year 1997 for a program, project, or activity is \n     reduced by the uniform percentage necessary to offset \n     nondefense budget authority provided in this Act. The \n     reductions required by this subsection shall be implemented \n     generally in accordance with section 251 of the Balanced \n     Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act or any \n     other provision of law, only\n\n[[Page S4181]]\n\n     that portion of nondefense budget authority provided in this \n     Act that is obligated during fiscal year 1997 shall be \n     designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to section \n     251(b)(2)(D)(i) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985. All remaining nondefense budget \n     authority provided in this Act shall not be available for \n     obligation until October 1, 1997.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am afraid that my amendment is a lot more \ncontroversial than the amendment that we have just had. My amendment \nhas to do with paying for disaster relief. I think every Member of the \nSenate wants to help people who have been affected by floods and \nearthquakes. It has always been our way to have national programs to \nhelp parts of the country which have been ravaged by natural disasters. \nBut ultimately, in this kind of bill, you come down to the question, \nare you going to pay for it or are you simply going to add the cost to \nthe deficit?\n  Interestingly enough, in the supplemental appropriations bill before \nus, we have a section for defense--basically money for Bosnia--and we \nhave a section for the disaster, and then we have a lot of other \nspending programs in addition to the disaster. But every penny of new \nspending on defense is paid for by cutting defense programs. But, \nunfortunately, the nondefense spending in the bill that is before us \nproviding this disaster relief, which none of us opposes, is going to \nraise the budget deficit by $699 million in fiscal year 1997--that is, \nbetween now and October 1 of this year--and it is going to raise the \nbudget deficit, over the next 5 years, by a whopping $6.6 billion. In \nfact, it raises the deficit this year by $699 million. Then it raises \nthe deficit next year by $1.67 billion, and the next year it raises the \ndeficit by $1.56 billion. In the year 2000, we are still spending money \nout for this emergency appropriation--over $1 billion in that year.\n  Now, what my amendment does is very, very simple. It is a complicated \nprocess that we employ in the budget, and I apologize for that as \npeople try to understand it. What we are doing is very simple. For the \n$699 million we are spending this year to help people deal with a \nnatural disaster, we are going to require an across-the-board cut in \nall other programs of 1.9 percent, roughly, to pay for this program. So \nwe are going to provide disaster assistance. The Gramm amendment does \nnot stop $1 from going anywhere to provide assistance to anybody. But \nwhat the Gramm amendment says is, in the remaining 5 months of this \nfiscal year, we are going to ask each other program in the Government \nto throw in a little bit less than 2 cents of their annual \nappropriation, and only $699 million of their actual spending, so that \nwe can pay for this emergency appropriation without raising the budget \ndeficit.\n  Second, for all this money that is going to spend out over the next 5 \nyears, all we are saying is that, with the new budget coming into \neffect, these outlay figures, this money we are going to spend next \nyear and for the next 5 years, that spending will count as part of the \nspending caps that we set for each of these years.\n  So, for example, the $1.67 billion that we will spend next year as a \nresult of this appropriations bill will simply count toward the \nspending for next year, and since the new budget will set a limit on \nthe amount of spending, we will have to offset that next year against \nsome other program.\n  What is the argument for doing this? It is kind of strange that in \n1997 in America you have to give a strong argument for paying your \nbills. But this is Washington, DC. That argument is required. The \nargument is that spending is a problem. The argument is that, if we \nsimply add another $6.6 billion to the deficit today, that $6.6 billion \nthe Government is going to have to go out and borrow. And that $6.6 \nbillion is not going to go to build new homes, new farms, new \nfactories, nor to generate new economic growth, because the Government \nis going to borrow that money and it is not going to be available to \nthe private sector to undertake those activities which the people would \nhave put the money towards had the Government not seized it.\n  This amendment simply, for the remainder of this year, asks every \nprogram to throw in 2 cents on the annual appropriations to help pay \nfor this emergency funding this year, and then for the next 5 years it \nsimply says, in looking at the amount of money we are spending in each \nof those next 5 years, count the money we are spending as a result of \nthis bill.\n  Let me explain why that is so important. We are on the verge of \nadopting a budget compromise that will increase discretionary spending \nby the Federal Government over the next 5 years by $193 billion, \ncompared to the budget we adopted last year. But yet, at the very \nmoment that we are moving toward adopting that budget which has such \nmassive increases in spending, we are today considering an \nappropriations bill that will spend $6.6 billion more outside that \nbudget. So, in a very real sense, if we do not adopt the amendment that \nI am presenting today before we even adopt the new budget, which the \nPresident says has the most rapid increase in social spending since the \n1960's, before we even adopt that budget today, we will be busting the \nbudget with $6.6 billion in additional spending that won't even count \nunder the new budget even though that money will spend out over the \nnext 5 years.\n  So, this is a good-government amendment. Let me also say, look, I am \nnot saying that it is going to be easy to go back and have every \nprogram, project, or activity kick in 2 cents to pay for this program. \nI don't underestimate for the moment the argument that I am sure will \nbe made by the chairman of the Appropriations Committee that we have \nonly 4 or 5 months left in the fiscal year and that coming up with that \n2 percent savings will be very difficult for the Government.\n  But I want to remind my colleagues that the Government is not the \nonly institution in America that has emergencies. American families \nhave emergencies all the time. They have to make decisions about how to \ndeal with their emergencies. When Johnny falls down and breaks his arm, \nno matter at what point it is during the year, the family has to come \nup with money to have the arm set and provide the medical care. If they \nwere the Federal Government, they could argue, Look, we have already \nwritten our budget. We are already well into the year. We have planned \nto go on vacation. We planned to buy a new refrigerator, and we can't \ndo those things and have Johnny's arm set. So they would like to have \nthis emergency appropriations that would simply allow them to spend \nmoney they don't have. But families don't have the ability to do that. \nFamilies have to make hard choices.\n  So, what they do, as we all know since we are members of families, is \ngo back, and they don't go on vacation that year, or they don't buy a \nnew refrigerator. They have to set priorities. The Federal Government \nalmost never sets priorities.\n  Quite frankly, I offer this amendment, Mr. President, because I am \nworried that by creating this image that somehow we are dealing with \nthe deficit in this new budget that we are opening the floodgates to \nnew spending. What better example could there be than the supplemental \nappropriations before us which raises the deficit by $6.6 billion over \nthe next 5 years?\n\n  I am not going to go through the list of all the programs. But as we \nall know, as we are all painfully aware, many of these programs have \nnothing to do with hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, or other natural \ndisasters. Many of the programs in here represent ongoing spending. But \nby putting them in this emergency appropriations, unless we pay for it, \nwe are going to be adding $6.6 billion to the deficit.\n  I know there will be debate: Are we really adding money to the \ndeficit?\n  I have a memo from the Congressional Budget Office which does the \nofficial scoring for Congress. Let me read:\n\n       CBO estimates that the nondefense programs in this bill \n     would increase Federal outlays and the deficit by $699 \n     million in fiscal year 1997. Total nondefense outlays for \n     fiscal years 1997 through 2005 are estimated at $6.667 \n     billion dollars.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      May 7, 1997.\n     To: Rohit Kumar, Office of Senator Phil Gramm.\n     From: Priscilla Aycock, Congressional Budget Office \n         Scorekeeping Unit.\n     Subject: CBO Estimate of the Budgetary Impact of Non-Defense \n         Supplementals in S. 672.\n\n[[Page S4182]]\n\n       This memorandum is in response to your request for CBO's \n     estimate of the budgetary impact of non-defense supplementals \n     and rescissions in S. 672, a bill providing emergency \n     supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 1997.\n       CBO estimates that the non-defense programs in this bill \n     would increase Federal outlays and the deficit by $699 \n     million in fiscal year 1997. Total non-defense outlays for \n     fiscal years 1997 through 2005 are estimated to be $6.667 \n     billion. However, the actual change in outlays and the \n     deficit in 1998 and later years would depend on future \n     appropriations action.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am not going to spend a lot of time \ndebating whether or not this adds to the deficit. Our official \naccountant says it does. I think people know in fact that it does. I \nthink we really ought to debate the merits of this amendment.\n  The merits of this amendment boil down to simple facts. Because we \nhave natural disasters--we have had them every year. In fact, since \nPresident Clinton has been in office we have averaged $7 billion of \nexpenditures on natural disasters, and we have not put money in the \nbudget to pay for it. We have just simply added it to the deficit every \nsingle year.\n  My view is that in the midst of a new budget that has historic levels \nof increases in discretionary spending, even before that budget goes \ninto effect, we ought not to be adding another $6.6 billion to the \ndeficit.\n  So I hope my colleagues will vote for this amendment. I realize this \nis a difficult amendment. This is the kind of real-world decision that \npeople face outside Washington, DC, where bad things happen to them and \nthey have to deal with it but they have to pay for it. My amendment \ndoes not deny one penny of aid to anybody. Nothing in this program \nwould change as a result of having to pay for it other than we would \nhave to go back in light of these natural disasters and come up with \nother programs that we now say we will have to do without because we \nare going to pay for this money, that we are going to provide for areas \nof the country that have been ravaged by natural disasters.\n  Let's not turn this natural disaster for a handful of States in our \ncountry into a fiscal disaster for every State in the country and for \nevery family and every person. Let's pay our bills. We can do it \nthrough this amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, may I inquire of the Senator from Texas, \nare there additional people who are going to speak on behalf of the \nSenator's amendment?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me say that I have been asked by several people to \nreserve them time. I assume they are on their way over.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will the Senator mind if I use some of \nthe time available to me for some routine matters here?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Certainly.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator's amendment be temporarily set aside and that amendment No. 100 \nbe called up for immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 100\n\n           (Purpose: To direct highway funding in the bill.)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I send an amendment to the desk\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Ms. Moseley-\n     Braun, proposes an amendment numbered 100.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 40, line 21, after the word ``County'', insert the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That $400,000 of the \n     additional allocation for the State of Illinois shall be \n     provided for costs associated with the replacement of \n     Gaumer's Bridge in Vermilion County, Illinois''\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, our amendment sets aside $400,000 \nfor costs associated with the replacement of Gaumer Bridge in Vermilion \nCounty, IL.\n  The town of Alvin, IL is bisected by a heavily-traveled railroad \nline. There used to be three ways of getting from the East side of \nAlvin, where the fire station and other emergency facilities are \nlocated, to the West side. Cars could drive over either of two railroad \ncrossings, or over Gaumer Bridge. Unfortunately, Gaumer Bridge was \ndamaged by a flood in 1994 and removed by local officials in 1995. The \nbridge has not been replaced.\n  Today, the only way to get from one side of Alvin to the other is by \ncrossing over one of the two railroad crossings, which are not far \napart. If a train stalls or breaks down, it could easily block both \nintersections at once, cutting off 165 Alvin residents from the rest of \nthe town and from emergency services.\n  According to Alvin residents, trains have blocked both intersections \ntwice since the bridge was removed. One time, a train shut down for \nmore than 4 hours in the middle of the night. According to news \naccounts, one resident had to climb under the train to get home, and \nanother resident was almost fired from his job because he could not get \nout to get to work. Residents and local officials are concerned it is \nonly a matter of time before a real tragedy occurs, when emergency \nvehicles will be unable to get to residents on the West side of Alvin.\n  This amendment will provide the funds necessary to replace Gaumer \nBridge, so that Alvin residents who live west of the train tracks will \nno longer face the possibility of isolation.\n  I want to thank the managers of this bill for agreeing to include \nthis provision in the bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is an amendment from the senior \nSenator from Illinois relating to a bridge in Vermilion County.\n  This amendment has been cleared on both sides. It is acceptable. I \nurge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 100) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to, and I move to lay that motion on the \ntable.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 134\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Murray, I send an \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mrs. Murray and \n     Mr. Gorton, proposes an amendment numbered 134.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n STATE OPTION TO ISSUE FOOD STAMP BENEFITS TO CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS MADE \n                      INELIGIBLE BY WELFARE REFORM\n\n       Sec.  . Section 7 of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. \n     2016) is amended by--\n       (a) inserting in subsection (a) after ``necessary, and'', \n     ``except as provided in subsection (j),'' and\n       (b) inserting a new subsection (j) as follows--\n       ``(j)(1) A State agency may, with the concurrence of the \n     Secretary, issue coupons to individuals who are ineligible to \n     participate in the food stamp program solely because of the \n     provisions of section 6(o)(2) of this Act or sections 402 and \n     403 of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act \n     of 1996. A State agency that issues coupons under this \n     subsection shall pay the Secretary the face value of the \n     coupons issued under this subsection and the cost of \n     printing, shipping, and redeeming the coupons, as well as any \n     other Federal costs involved, as determined by the Secretary. \n     A State agency shall pay the Secretary for coupons issued \n     under this subsection and for the associated Federal costs \n     issued under this subsection no later than the time the State \n     agency issues such coupons to recipients.

Mr. President, I rise today to bring attention to a \npressing problem for legal immigrants in Washington State, that may \nalso soon affect other States around the Nation. I urge you to support \npassage of amendment No. 134 to S. 672, the 1997 Supplemental \nAppropriations Act.\n  This amendment simply gives the USDA authority to sell food stamps to \nStates, provided that all Federal costs are fully reimbursed.\n  Under last year's welfare law, certain legal immigrants will soon be \nexcluded from eligibility for the Federal Food Stamp Program. However, \nCongress granted States the flexibility to provide some assistance to \nlegal immigrants with their own State funds.\n  At the end of last month, Republicans and Democrats in the Washington \nState Legislature appropriated $66 million to grant food aid to nearly \n40,000 legal immigrants, many of them children, who are not covered by \nFederal programs. By doing so, they issued a mandate for Gov. Gary \nLocke's administration to provide food assistance to these immigrants.\n  To carry out this mandate, the State wants to purchase food stamps \nfrom USDA. The State will pay all costs for administration, printing, \nshipping, and redeeming of the food stamps. This is State money--they \nare looking to buy food stamps from the Federal Government, because \nthat program is already in place, and will maximize the use of this \nState money.\n  Since October, Washington State has been trying to make arrangements \nwith USDA to buy food stamps. Officials at USDA have expressed a \nwillingness to cooperate, but believe technical barriers exist.\n  USDA is concerned that State payments may end up in the general \ntreasury instead of coming back to the Food Stamp Program.\n  USDA is also concerned that it may be violating the Anti-Deficiency \nAct, at least briefly. This is because USDA would be furnishing food \nstamps for a non-Federal purpose, although only until the State \nreimbursement arrives.\n  The State of Washington has made various offers to USDA to provide \nadvance payment for the food stamps. To date, however, USDA has not \ngranted a waiver allowing the State of Washington to purchase food \nstamps.\n  Time is running short, since these immigrants lose their Federal \nbenefits at the end of August.\n  If USDA does not sell Washington State food stamps, a State scrip \nprogram will have to be set up. This will be costly and duplicative. \nAccording to estimates by the Washington State Department of Social and \nHealth Services, this would cost a minimum of $1.5 million--due to the \ncosts associated with printing and distributing the scrip. In addition, \nthe State would have to establish new relationships with all food stamp \nvenders in the State.\n  This has the potential to create many more problems than are \nnecessary--two separate systems for Washington State customers, \nconfusion for small businesses in border towns in Oregon or Idaho, and \nthe added cost for everyone of learning an entirely new system.\n  Of course, this issue is not specific to the Pacific Northwest or to \nWashington State. Other States may be seeking to buy food stamps in \nthis manner in the future. Massachusetts has already made strides \ntoward this approach, and the California Legislature is looking at \nsimilar questions.\n  I urge unanimous support for this amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support Senator Murray's \namendment to give the Department of Agriculture the authority to sell \nfood stamps to States, with all Federal costs fully reimbursed.\n  The so-called welfare reform law enacted last year disqualifies large \nnumbers of legal immigrants from the Federal Food Stamp program. This \nimposes represents a serious new cost on the States, if they decide to \nmeet the food needs of these immigrants on their own. Many States, \nincluding Massachusetts, are now actively exploring ways to provide \nfood aid using State and local funds. This amendment allows States to \nprovide food aid to legal immigrants by buying-in to the Federal Food \nStamp Program.\n  Allowing States to do so will avoid the need for them to needlessly \nduplicate the Federal Food Stamp Program with State and local funds. It \nwill save the States time and money, while enabling them to continue \ngiving food aid to needy legal immigrants.\n  In addition, it will have no cost to the Federal Government, because \nall Federal food stamp funds paid out will be fully reimbursed by the \nStates. Recently, I sent a letter to Secretary Glickman, urging him to \nsupport the food stamp buy-in option for States. I ask unanimous \nconsent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  This is an important amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support \nits passage.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 3, 1997.\n     Hon. Dan Glickman,\n     Secretary, Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Glickman: The welfare law enacted last year \n     disqualifies most legal immigrants from the federal food \n     stamp program. This action represents a potentially serious \n     new cost burden for the states, if they decide to meet the \n     food needs of these immigrants on their own. Many states are \n     now actively exploring ways to continue food assistance to \n     needy legal immigrants using state and local funds.\n       The purpose of this letter is to urge you to give states \n     the option of buying into the federal food stamp program in \n     order to provide this valuable aid to immigrants. In fact, \n     the Massachusetts Senate voted today unanimously to pursue \n     this option. Without this possibility, many states are facing \n     the unwelcome prospect of creating separate state-run food \n     programs for immigrants, while other citizens continue to be \n     assisted by the federal food stamp program. Our hope is that \n     we can find a way to avoid this needless duplication.\n       Section 15(a) of the Food Stamp Act (7 U.S.C. 2024(a)) \n     authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to issue food stamp \n     coupons ``to such person or persons, and at such times and in \n     such manner, as the Secretary deems necessary or appropriate \n     to protect the interests of the United States.'' We feel that \n     granting states the flexibility to help poor legal immigrants \n     in this way is permissible under this standard.\n       We understand that this proposal may raise an anti-\n     deficiency issue under federal budget laws. If states buy \n     into the food stamp program to help immigrants, the state \n     reimbursement goes into the general federal treasury and not \n     into the food stamp account. This leaves the food stamp \n     program with an illegal deficit. One way in which this issue \n     might be addressed is for states and the Department to agree \n     to subtract the value of the food stamps the state is \n     purchasing from the reimbursements for administrative \n     expenses that are otherwise due to the states under the food \n     stamp program.\n       This option would offer states a broader range of choices \n     as they seek to minimize the harm to their legal immigrant \n     constituencies under the new welfare law. With legislatures \n     in most states currently considering their budgets for the \n     next fiscal year, we would be grateful if you could give this \n     proposal your prompt attention.\n       Many thanks for your consideration, and we look forward to \n     hearing from you.\n           Sincerely,\n     John F. Kerry.\n     Edward M. Kennedy.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the current\n\n[[Page S4184]]\n\noccupant of the chair, Senator Gorton, be added as an original \ncosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The amendment has been cleared on both sides. It \npertains to giving States the option to issue food stamp benefits to \ncertain individuals currently ineligible because of welfare reform.\n  It has been cleared on both sides.\n  I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Cochran, I send an \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Cochran, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 236.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 13, line 4, strike ``$161,000,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$171,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is a technical correction to the \nbill called to our attention by the Senator from Mississippi.\n  I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 236) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to, and I move to lay that motion on the \ntable.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 118\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Arizona, \nSenator Kyl, 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Texas for \nyielding and for presenting his amendment.\n  I fully support the Gramm amendment. I hope that shortly our \ncolleagues will support it as well.\n  Let me say at the outset that I think we all support the disaster \nrelief that is provided in the underlying legislation, whether we agree \nwith the specific level or not. Certainly my heart goes out to the \nfamilies that have lost their homes and their businesses and their \nschools and who have suffered because of these recent floods and snows. \nWe have all seen the devastation on the television and read about it in \nthe newspapers. I think all of us support what we can do about that.\n  I also think that we owe it to the rest of the people in the United \nStates not only to put the full resources of Government into the States \nin which these disasters occur but also to ensure that the taxpayers of \nthe United States, in effect, don't have to pay twice. We should ensure \nthat the money that is spent in the States where these disasters have \noccurred is counted fully in our budget process.\n  It is, I think, interesting that in the very week that the budget \nagreement was announced, we have before us a piece of legislation that \nwould add to the budget deficit in violation of that agreement.\n  I think we owe it to the American people to make sure that in solving \none serious problem, the disaster problem, we don't make another \nproblem worse. We can and we should find some way to meet our \nobligations without just adding to the budget deficit.\n  As I said, it was just 6 days ago that the White House announced the \nbudget agreement that would result in a balanced budget by the year \n2002. The ink is not even dry on that agreement--in fact, parts of it \nhave not even been written--yet the very first piece of legislation to \ncome to the Senate floor after the agreement was announced is a bill to \nadd $6.6 billion to the Federal budget deficit over the next few years.\n  It seems to me, if people are going to have any confidence in the \nbudget agreement that was struck with the White House, and we expect \nthem to believe what we say about balancing the budget, that we cannot \ncontinue this kind of business as usual. We have to begin exercising \nsome discipline. That means that this is a good time to start by saying \nthat what we spend will be counted in our budget in order to know \nwhether we are in balance. It would be one thing if there were no other \nway to get the aid to the flood victims except to borrow. But it is \nquite another thing when we ignore other options in order to keep \nspending on other programs.\n\n  What would it take to pay for this emergency spending bill? Well, it \ntakes only two things. In the first year, it is less than 2 cents on \nevery dollar in spending reductions in other programs to ensure that \nthe money that needs to flow immediately in the remainder of this \nfiscal year can flow. And for the remainder of the money to be spent, \nit would merely have to count in our budget so that we can know whether \nwe are in balance. That may mean growth in some other areas might have \nto be restrained.\n  We know that these kinds of disasters have always occurred and will \ncontinue to occur because they are natural disasters, and yet we do not \nplan for them. We spend every nickel that we have, knowing that if \nthere is an emergency, we can appropriate additional funds. And if the \npast is any guide, we will simply add that onto the deficit rather than \ninclude it in the budget that has to be balanced.\n  The Appropriations Committee acknowledged in its own report that the \nnumber of major disaster declarations in the 1992 to 1996 period has \nincreased 54 percent. In other words, we had ample warning that \nsomething would occur somewhere. Had we prepared for the need for \ndisaster assistance last fall instead of using every extra dollar to \nmeet President Clinton's demands for new spending, we would already \nhave been able to respond to the emergency in the Midwest and elsewhere \naround the country. We would not need to be here today debating a bill \nto spend additional money. But by ignoring potential disasters last \nfall, we merely paved the way for adding to the deficit now when the \nneed for relief takes precedence over budget concerns.\n  I know some will say that this bill is already offset by reductions \nin budget authority. Frankly, that is Washington speak. The \nCongressional Budget Office tells us this measure is going to add \nnearly $1 billion to the deficit this year and about $6.6 billion over \nthe next several years. It is true that budget authority may be offset \nbut outlays are not. And outlays are what count.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 5 minutes yielded to the Senator have \nexpired.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I yield the Senator 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Let me explain to those who may be watching and do not \nappreciate the difference between budget outlays and budget authority \nwhat we are talking about here.\n  Congress frequently passes laws granting authority to spend amounts \nof money on Government programs, but until that authority is backed up \nby appropriations, it does not mean anything.\n  Granted, you have to have the authority, but you also have to have \nthe money. When we say that we are going to offset this disaster relief \nby rescinding certain budget authority, that authority may never be \nfunded. It frequently is not funded, and as a result it is not really \noffsetting actual expenditures or money that is going to be spent. It \nis merely offsetting authority that may or may not ever be funded and \nmoney that may or may not ever be spent.\n  Senator Gramm has done a good job of analogizing the two things that \nare necessary to writing a check. You need a check or a checkbook of \nchecks and you also need some money in the bank. The budget authority \nis like your checkbook, but unless you have the money in the bank, the \ncheckbook does\n\n[[Page S4185]]\n\nnot do you a whole lot of good. So you tear up a bunch of checks and \nthrow them in the wastebasket and say we have offset the spending. You \nhave not really done that. All you have done is removed that check, not \nthe money in the bank. We need to offset the spending in this disaster \nrelief bill, which we support, with actual money so that we do not end \nup spending both and thereby break the budget deal.\n  I will conclude at this point. Again, we just agreed to a budget deal \nthat allegedly will result in a balanced budget in 5 years. Unless the \nGramm amendment passes, that budget deal will be broken before it is \never signed, before we even vote on it. It will be broken this week \nwhen we pass this supplemental appropriations without offsetting future \nspending in the next 5 years. I support the Gramm amendment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman, \nSenator Stevens. And I say to my friend from Texas, I am very hopeful \nthat one of these days on something real important that will come \nalong, the Senator and I will be on the same side. I just happen, on \nthis one, not to agree with the Senator, and I would like to take my \nfew moments to explain to the Senate why.\n  Actually, Mr. President, when we drafted the budget law of the United \nStates, we put a provision in it that said you prepare the budgets so \nthat whatever it is Congress decides it wants to spend money for, you \nbudget it, allocate it, put it in place, and then in the event that a \ndisaster occurs, and the disaster is serious enough for Congress to say \nit is an emergency, and as a further safety valve it is serious enough \nfor the President to say it is a disaster and an emergency, then \nCongress in its wisdom said that spending does not become part of the \nordinary budget. It is on top of the budget.\n  Now, frankly, there is good reason to suggest that perhaps, perhaps \nin the interest of frugality, we ought to not declare this $5.6 billion \ncovering disasters in 33 States of America, as emergency disaster \nspending. There may be some reason to say it is not a disaster. I do \nnot believe that is the case. In addition, I do not think it is the \ncase from the standpoint of rational, reasonable fiscal policy.\n  Now, our Government is big. Our budgets are big. We are already \nhalfway through the year that we have for which we have budgeted money \nfor all of the things the American people expect to get from their \nNational Government. I would be the first to say that I will join with \nanyone who would like to spend 2 years going through the programs of \nour Government and see how many we could throw away. We have not done \nthat, and incidentally, the Gramm amendment will not do that. The Gramm \namendment takes all programs as they are and says that after you have \nappropriated for them, and they are operating on a 12-month cycle and \nyou are well past a half year before you ever start taking any of this \nmoney away, then you just come along and take it away from the programs \nthat are already funded.\n  It is interesting to me, and I do not ask this question of my friend \nfrom Texas, but I merely put this before the Senate, how big would a \ndisaster have to be for it to make absolutely no sense to take the cost \nof the disaster aid out of the ongoing programs of our Government? I \nbelieve $5.6 billion is big enough. If one is interested in making \nGovernment smaller, I say to the Senator from West Virginia, then maybe \nthere ought to be three or four disasters in a row, maybe three or four \nat $6 billion each, and then one could say, let us not declare them an \nemergency. Let us just take them out of Government programs which we \nhave already appropriated.\n  I am not suggesting, the Senator from New Mexico is not suggesting, \nthat anybody is thinking of that. I am merely suggesting that it is not \nvery good fiscal policy, it is not very good Government policy to \nshrink Government by not paying for disasters as emergencies but, \nrather, by cutting Government to pay for them.\n  Now, there may be an overwhelming number of Senators here tonight who \nwant to shrink Government by paying for disasters from the ordinary \noperations of Government. I would think of innumerable ways of \nshrinking Government that are better than doing it that way. I rise \nhere tonight to say there is nothing about which to be embarrassed. The \nlaw of the land says if a disaster is an emergency that is serious and \ncostly--and I would assume comes late in the year when you cannot \nbudget for it--you ought not take it out of ongoing Government \noperations.\n\n  Will the Senator yield me one additional minute?\n  Frankly, I submit we ought to do something a little different, and \nthen my friend, Senator Gramm, will not have to be here and maybe he \nshould not have to be here. I believe we ought to start putting in the \nregular appropriations bills a sufficient amount of money, literally, \nthat is appropriated for the purpose of responding to disasters. Then \none need not come down here and say, let us pay for the disaster out of \nthe ongoing Government programs because we have provided for it, and in \nthe process decided that Government needed less money someplace else, \nbut we did it in an orderly manner.\n  So tonight I compliment the chairman of the Appropriations Committee \non his first major bill in the Chamber. I want to tell him that I think \nhe's done a wonderful job. He has showed a lot of leadership. Hundreds \nof amendments seem to flow to the floor on this kind of bill, and we \nconsidered them in short order, and yet people got their say and many \nwon and many lost. We are going to decide within the next couple of \nweeks to keep the business of Government going. I thank him for \nyielding to me, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me pick up the point that our dear \ncolleague from New Mexico made. If we do not want to disrupt Government \nby having to pay our bills when disasters occur, we ought to \nappropriate the money in advance for disasters. But what has happened, \nand the reason I have offered this amendment, is that we have not done \nthat. At one time we did, but I just would like my colleagues to \nrecognize we are paying for disasters but there is nothing unexpected \nabout it. Every year in America there are hurricanes, there are floods, \nthere are earthquakes. In fact, in 1993, we spent $5.4 billion on \ndisasters; in 1994, $9 billion on disasters; in 1995, $10.1 billion on \ndisasters; in 1996, $4.6 billion on disasters, and in 1997, we have \nalready spent $5.4 billion.\n  My point is, there is nothing unexpected about disasters. It is \nunexpected if you have a flood in your State, but it is not unexpected \nthat America is going to have disasters. But what produces the \nfinancial disaster is we do not provide money in advance and, as a \nresult, every year we add to the deficit by saying, well, look, we have \nto spend this money; we do not want to have to pay for it because it \nmeans disrupting ongoing Government. But I commend to my colleagues, \ngoing back to my example in a family, when Johnny falls down and breaks \nhis arm, it does not do the family any good to say, well, now, wait a \nminute; we had planned that we were going on a vacation, or we had \nplanned that we were going to buy a new refrigerator. They do not have \nthat luxury. They have to disrupt what they are doing.\n  I think the Senator from New Mexico, in talking about good \nGovernment, is right; I hope in this new budget we are getting ready to \nwrite with all the money we will have, it would be a good idea to just \nset aside about--we have averaged $7 billion a year of disasters during \nthe Clinton years. Why not set aside $7 billion next year, and then if \nwe do not have disasters, we can spend it. But the point is, year after \nyear after year we do not do it, and I do not know any way to make us \ndo it other than to make us begin to pay our bills. That is what the \namendment is about.\n  I yield.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator from Texas withhold just a second, \nplease, and let me inquire how much time we have remaining?\n\n[[Page S4186]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has 7 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from Alaska has 20 minutes, 25 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Does the Senator want to use----\n  Mr. STEVENS. I said to the Senator from Texas I will yield to him. I \nwill yield now 10 minutes and reserve the remaining 10 minutes for our \ntime.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the Senator will not mind, after the next spokesman, \nI would like to yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Surely.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If it is proper.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Three minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. May I yield to him, then. The Senator can use the \nremainder of the time.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Sure.\n  Mr. STEVENS. And then Senator Byrd and I will close.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska for yielding me 3 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to stress the importance of passing this \nbill so that vital disaster relief assistance is made available to the \nhundreds of communities impacted by weather-related disasters. In \nNevada, this flooding took place in early January, and the situation \nfacing Nevada's farming and ranching communities gets more critical \nwith each day that passes.\n  The damage that occurred when the Truckee, Carson, and Walker Rivers \noverflowed their banks devastated urban and rural areas alike in six \ncounties in Nevada. Thousands of homes in Nevada were flooded, forcing \nfamilies to move into emergency relief centers to wait for the \nfloodwaters to recede. In the cities of Reno and Sparks, water flowed \n10 feet above the banks of the Truckee River in the business district. \nHundreds of businesses were forced to shut down, putting 20,000 people \nout of work.\n  Much of this initial damage was addressed by the swift and able \nFederal emergency relief efforts. I was extremely pleased with the \nassistance provided by Federal and local workers, who put forth an \nincredible effort. As the emergency funds that supported these initial \nlife-saving efforts have dried up, however, Nevada's rural communities \nin particular have been unable to begin repairs to riverbanks, levees, \nand flood control structures that are essential to their livelihoods.\n  The damage to these areas was severe; after surveying flood damage \nfrom a helicopter with FEMA director James Lee Witt, I was struck by \nhow much the normally rolling green hills of Mason Valley looked like a \ngiant rice paddy in Southeast Asia. Dams were destroyed, rivers carved \nnew paths through fields and pastures, and roads were washed out by the \nrecord flows on Nevada's rivers.\n  The irrigation structures that divert water to ranches and farms in \nNorthern Nevada were severely damaged or wiped out completely, leaving \nthe farms near the riverbanks under water, while those farther away \nfrom the river were cut off completely. These families lost crops, \nlivestock, all of the hay that normally would carry their cattle \nthrough the winter, and miles of fencing around their property. Some of \nthose cut off from the rivers dug new ditches to bring water to their \nlivestock at their own expense, while others have simply resigned \nthemselves to the fact that they will not be able to survive this \nseason, and may go out of business. You see, Mr. President, most of the \nfarms and ranches that I am talking about are family-owned and managed, \nand are hard pressed to keep going without some immediate help.\n  Mr. President, the circumstances in my own State and some other 30 \nStates compel that we act immediately. It is for that reason I express \nmy profound regret that some have found necessary to add political \nriders to this bill, riders that are totally unrelated and irrelevant \nto the issue at hand.\n  I urge immediate action on this bill. Nevada's families deserve no \nless.\n  I yield my time and thank the distinguished Senator from Texas for \naccommodating me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me make it clear--and I do not believe \nthe Senator's comments were aimed at this particular amendment--but let \nme make it clear that under this amendment we do not hold back a dollar \nof disaster assistance. We provide the assistance. We provide it as \nfast as it can be provided. We simply pay for it. So I wanted to make \nthat clear.\n  Let me now recognize the Senator from Kansas, Senator Brownback.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. For how much time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. For 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for \nbringing this important amendment forward. I state at the outset that I \nsupport disaster relief. I think it is important to help those places \nin our country that are experiencing great difficulty because of a \nnatural disaster that is occurring. We ought to step in. It is \nimportant that we do it. But I also think we ought to stop creating and \ncontinuing the manmade disaster that we have done here, the $5.4 \ntrillion in debt that is stealing from our children, that is driving \ninterest rates up, that is taking jobs, that is hurting our Nation.\n  It seems that in and of itself is almost a definition of a disaster, \nand we create it. I think this is an important debate because the point \nhere is not whether we support disaster relief, because we do. We \nsupport disaster relief. The question is, do we pay for it and should \nwe be doing that in this overall debate? I do not think we have really \nlooked at this before, even though we have been talking about balancing \nthe budget, now, for a number of years. It seems now we are finally on \na track to discuss really balancing the budget. For a lot of years it \nwas just kind of: That is good politics to talk about balancing the \nbudget, but we really cannot do it. Now we are going to do it. Now we \nare really going to balance the budget. We are actually going to \nbalance the budget by the year 2002, if not before. With this strong \neconomy we could do it by the year 2000.\n  This is for real now. It seems to me, then, as we enter into these \ndebates now about emergency supplementals, helping people out, that we \ndo things for real. One thing that is real to families is that, if you \nhave a disaster personally, you are going to have to figure out some \nway to pay for it. The same should be true for us. If we have a \ndisaster, we need to figure out how we can pay for it.\n  This is a minimal act. I hope people have focused on what we are \ntalking about. We are talking about 1.9 percent offset against \ndiscretionary spending the rest of this year, and then just requiring \nthat the money go against the caps in future years. That is all we are \ntalking about. That is it. It is not talking about cutting disaster \nrelief. It is not talking about: We are going to steal this money out \nof here and take it out of there; 1.9 percent, 2 percent, and then in \nthe future it is just about being under the budget caps.\n  As we move forward to balance the budget for real we need to move \nforward and take care of our emergencies for real. This is for real. \nThis makes it real. This allows us to actually do what is real in \nbalancing the budget, so we do not keep driving up this manmade \ndisaster of the $5.4 trillion in debt that we have.\n  I think this is an important debate and I hope Members really search \nthrough and think about it. If they really do support balancing the \nbudget, they would really do what is for real here and vote for this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Pennsylvania, \nSenator Santorum, 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for his \nleadership on this issue and his continuing leadership on this issue.\n  To paraphrase a colloquial that is used often, ``Been there, done \nthat.'' We have been here and we have done this many, many times \nbefore. A disaster bill comes, a supplemental comes to the Senate \nfloor--to the House floor when I was in the House--with these pictures. \nI guess these are on the Senators' desks. These are very compelling \npictures of horrible disasters. And I understand the pictures.\n\n  Let me give you some credibility here before I go on about what is \ngoing\n\n[[Page S4187]]\n\non in the Dakotas and in the upper Midwest. I was here last year on \nanother emergency supplemental bill for Pennsylvania disaster funding, \n$1.2 billion. Most of that money was going to Pennsylvania. I stood \nhere with Senator Gramm, supporting his amendment to do the same thing \nwhen the money was directed at my State. Because it is not right to \nuse--I hate to put it in these strong terms but this is what is going \non--to use the calamity of others to run up the deficit. That is \nexactly what is going on.\n  I know that sounds harsh. We have a FEMA. Even the committee report \nsays that FEMA acknowledges that the escalation in costs is due not \nonly to the increase in large-scale disasters, but also because the \nscope of Federal disaster assistance is expanded, the Federal role in \nresponse is expanded considerably, and State and local governments are \nincreasingly turning to Federal Government for assistance. Not only are \nwe not budgeting enough money to FEMA in the annual budget--Why? Let us \nask that question first. Why are we not budgeting enough money to FEMA? \nWe know these disasters come. They come every year. This is not a \nsurprise. Why don't we do it? Because we want to spend it somewhere \nelse and we know we can bring these pictures to the Senate and get \nborrowed money to do it later. So we do not have to live within our \nbudget. We can underfund FEMA, knowing that no one is going to deny \nthese people who are facing this horrible disaster. And, if you do, you \nleft your heart at the door and how dare you come in and say you are \ncompassionate?\n  I mean, that is just a shell game. I want to state for the record, as \nI did last year, I am for disaster relief. But I am for doing what we \nshould do with every aspect of our budget, which is set priorities. If \nthe priority of this Senate, if the priority of this Congress, the \npriority of the President is to make sure that these people get the \ndisaster relief they deserve--fine. Count me in. But when the \nrefrigerator breaks you cancel the vacation. And that means that you \nhave to come up with some other area of the budget and fund it.\n  Some will say, if this is a disaster in the family, if the \nrefrigerator breaks, I may have to borrow money. That is true. But if \nyour refrigerator keeps breaking, then at some point you have to \nrealize you are not budgeting right here. There is something wrong and \nyou have to fix the problem. What we have is a broken refrigerator in \nFEMA and the way we fund FEMA, and a broken refrigerator in the way \nthey are more and more taking a bigger and bigger share of disaster \nrelief costs. That is a very serious problem and it is blowing big-time \nholes in the deficit of this country.\n  So, I know it is not popular to stand up here--and Senator Gramm and \nI maybe make somewhat of a career on taking unpopular stances. But this \nis not right. It is not right to, on the backs of those suffering, \nreally pursue your other agenda. Because we all know that money is \ngoing to North Dakota and South Dakota. We all are for that. It is not \nthat money that is really being debated here. It is the other money \nthat is stuck in there that should have been going to FEMA in the first \nplace. That is the money they are really protecting here. That is the \nmoney they are hiding. That is what they do not want to cut.\n  What Senator Gramm has put forward is a very reasonable proposal. It \nsays cut 1.9 percent across the board. We would like to do it in a \ntargeted way, but you cannot do that kind of thing. We have rules \nagainst that. So he has to do it across-the-board. And it says in the \nfuture, as we spend money for this disaster, it just has to stay under \nthe caps. In other words, it cannot increase the deficit.\n  It is a reasonable proposal that says live within your means. \nResponsibly budget for disasters. Do not use these very gut-wrenching, \nheart-wrenching, heartfelt, compassionate stories to fund your little \nprojects off here to the side and to fund all those other things that \ncould not stand the light of day if, in fact, they were compared to \nfunding these or those.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes and 10 seconds left.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles, 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to compliment my colleague from \nPennsylvania for his statement as well as Senator Gramm, for this \namendment.\n  I find this amendment to be very important and one I certainly hope \nwill pass. The Senator from Pennsylvania said we want to provide \neconomic assistance for the victims of this most recent flood. I agree \nwith that. Senator Gramm says we ought to pay for it. I agree with \nthat. We should pay for it. If we do not, if we pass this bill as it is \nright now, we are going to be increasing the national debt by $6.5 \nbillion--not this year but over several years.\n  Senator Gramm's amendment says let us do it in two ways. Let us have \nan across-the-board reduction of about 1.8 or 1.9 percent this year to \nfund the outlays for this year. For the second part of that, for the \noutlays that will be strung out over the next 5 years, let us reduce \nthe outlays in those years. We are going to be spending about $1.6, \n$1.7, $1.8, $1.9, $2 trillion dollars in those successive years. Surely \nwe can afford the couple of billion dollars in outlays in those years. \nWe can have offsets. We can pay for it. We can reduce outlays in those \nfuture years by an amount to pay for this disaster relief.\n  We ought to pay for it. We ought to say yes, we want to help the \npeople with the floods, but we want to pay for it. We should be \nresponsible. Let us not increase the national debt by $6.5 billion. If \nwe do not pass this amendment that is exactly what we are going to do. \nSo I urge my colleagues, this proposal--and I have the greatest of \nsympathy for the victims of this flood but the President requested $4.6 \nbillion in discretionary spending and the committee proposes $7.7 \nbillion in discretionary spending. If you include the mandatory \nspending the President requested, $6.2 billion, and in this bill that \nis $9.5. If you include discretionary and mandatory, it is about $3, \n$3.1 billion over what the President originally requested. I do not \nwant to pass that much money. I am bothered. We had a vote earlier on \nthe highway bill. We had several hundred million dollars, $773 million, \nI believe, in highway funding that was not requested that was added to \nthis bill. The funding formula was changed. We get into a funding \nfight. People voted for what was best for their States. But, frankly, \nthat did not belong in this bill and we find there are hundreds of \nmillions of other dollars that do not belong in this bill.\n  I hope when this bill goes to conference it comes back a lot leaner, \nthat it really is constrained to disaster relief.\n  Then, likewise, I hope that we will pay for it. I heard a lot of \npeople say we should pay for it. Frankly, as the bill is written right \nnow, this bill increases national debt over this 5-year, 6-year period \nof time $6.5 billion. Let's pay for it. Let's pay for it this year by a \nsmall, less than 2 percent reduction for the next few months. That is \ncertainly manageable. Then for the future years, let's reduce spending \nenough to pay for it.\n  I think it is a responsible amendment. I think it is fiscally \nresponsible. I think it is the right thing to do, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table comparing the \nbudget request to the committee recommendation and the differences be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S4188]]\n\n\n\n                                FISCAL YEAR 1997 SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                               Committee\n                                                            Request         recommendation    Compared w/request\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                              ..................\n               BUDGET AUTHORITY (NET)\n \nTitle I--Department of Defense......................      2,098,214,000       1,805,480,000        (292,734,000)\nTitle II--Natural Disasters and emergencies:\n    Agriculture.....................................        123,100,000         276,250,000         153,150,000\n    Commerce........................................         22,800,000          65,500,000          42,700,000\n    Energy and Water................................        325,700,000         554,355,000         228,655,000\n    Interior........................................        276,879,000         382,642,000         105,763,000\n    Transportation..................................        311,200,000         688,100,000         376,900,000\n    Labor-HHS.......................................                  0          15,000,000          15,000,000\n    VA, HUD.........................................      1,079,000,000       3,600,000,000       2,521,000,000\n    Treasury and General Government.................        200,000,000                   0        (200,000,000)\n                                                     -----------------------------------------------------------\n      Subtotal......................................      2,338,679,000       5,581,847,000       3,243,168,000\n                                                     ===========================================================\nTitle III--Other supplementals:\n    Agriculture.....................................        106,000,000          70,600,000         (35,400,000)\n    Commerce, State Justice.........................        921,000,000         100,000,000        (821,000,000)\n    DC..............................................                  0          31,150,000          31,150,000\n    Interior........................................         10,000,000          10,000,000                   0\n    Legislative Branch..............................                  0                   0                   0\n    Transportation--(COLA and contract authority)...        322,277,000         959,836,000         637,559,000\n    Treasury, Postal, General Government............          7,092,000           7,333,000             241,000\n    VA, HUD--(COLA mandatory).......................        753,000,000         753,000,000                   0\n    Labor-HHS.......................................                  0         325,000,000         325,000,000\n    General Provisions..............................                  0         (92,500,000)        (92,500,000)\n                                                     -----------------------------------------------------------\n      Subtotal, including mandatory.................      2,119,369,000       2,164,419,000          45,050,000\n      Subtotal, discretionary.......................        123,092,000         273,576,000         150,484,000\n                                                     ===========================================================\n \n                     RECISSIONS\n \nTitle IV--Defense Offsets:\n    Unspecified Recissions..........................

Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think I have 3 minutes left. I know \nSenator Byrd and I know our distinguished committee chairman wishes to \nspeak. I do not know how the Chair wishes to handle it, but I would \nlike to try to reserve about 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will state that the time is divided \nequally. There are 3 minutes, 4 seconds left for the Senator from \nTexas; 7 minutes for the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. GRAMM. The Senator from Alaska has 7 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 7 minutes left.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I regret to say I shall move to table \nthis amendment, and I want to point out the problem we have.\n  If we cut 1.9 percent off the original 1997 nondefense appropriations \nat this time, it will be a 5-percent reduction on the amount that is \navailable for the rest of the year. For agencies such as the Veterans \nAdministration, Department of Education, the Coast Guard and many \nothers, that would be devastating in this final period of this year, \nthe final one-third of this year.\n  I do share the concern--I think I have demonstrated that --of \nbalancing the budget. On the other hand, I remember too well one of the \ngreatest earthquakes that has occurred since we started recording \nearthquakes, the second largest, apparently, in the history of the \nUnited States, in my State. We also had a flood that was so large it \nengulfed almost the whole interior of Alaska, around Fairbanks, for \nmiles. I know what these people are going through.\n  Much of the mismatch in this situation comes from the scoring process \nunder the budget; not from how money is spent, but how it is scored. \nFor instance, I have managed the defense bill substantially now over \nthe past years. When we originally get budget authority for defense, it \nhas 100-percent outlays. If we rescind that now, with a quarter of the \nyear left--it will be effective for the last quarter of the year--we \nget a 25-percent outlay cut. The authority is for a year. If we start \nspending it the 1st of October, there would be 100 percent. If we can \nrescind it the 1st of October, and this is what the Senator from New \nMexico was saying, if we can rescind it in the budget authority at the \nbeginning of the year and not spend through the whole year, we get 100-\npercent credit. When we rescind it now and it becomes effective in the \nlast quarter of the year, we get 25 percent.\n  This is really a great way to shrink Government. All you have to do \nis pray for the largest disaster in history and you cut the Government \nin half. There is no sense being proposed, from the point of view of \nthe disaster victims. It may make theoretical sense. We have cancelled \nenough budget authority--we deal with budget authority, and the scoring \nsays you only get 25 percent, because if you start spending this money \nin the beginning, you spend 100 percent; if you have not spent it so \nfar and if you start spending it now, you only get 25 percent. The \nSenator goes further, though. He carries it into the next year and \nsucceeding years.\n  We have done our best to try and mitigate the budgetary impact. For \nthe first time, I cannot remember a disaster bill where we tried our \nbest to mitigate by offsets, but we have. We have offset budget \nauthority. It is not possible at this time of the year to offset enough \nso that we can get it all accounted for this year. The Senator from \nTexas says, ``Well, then go into next year.'' We are already fighting--\nas a matter of fact, the fight is going on in this very building--over \nwhat the budget agreement means in terms of\n\n[[Page S4189]]\n\nnext year and succeeding years in terms of outlays and budget \nauthority.\n  I tell the Senate very simply, until we work out a better way to deal \nwith disaster relief--incidentally, I concur with the Senator from New \nMexico who said we have done this in this bill. We have money here that \nanticipates there are going to be more disasters during the balance of \nthis year, and we have put it up and we have offset that money.\n  There will be disasters, Mr. President, unfortunately, in the balance \nof this year. I mentioned the earthquake that we had. The earthquake \nthat started somewhere down in the Tennessee area and came up the \nvalley, came up the fault, was so great in the 1850's that when that \nearthquake occurred, the bells rang in churches in Boston. If that \nfault goes at this time in our lifetime, Mr. President, the cost will \nbe so staggering that you cannot imagine the cost, or the cost of a San \nFrancisco earthquake.\n  That is what the Senator from New Mexico asked: How large does a \ndisaster have to be before it is an emergency? We will do our best to \nprepare for emergencies, and if we can work out a different approach on \nthe scoring so it makes more sense from the point of view of the \nbudget, I am perfectly willing to work with anybody to do it.\n  We did not appropriate any money unless we thought it was absolutely \nnecessary and justified. We had a bipartisan review. We had everyone \ncritique these bills. We had many amendments suggested, a few on this \nfloor this week, but we have not heard many money arguments.\n\n  The Senator from Texas is raising a money argument. We have not had \ndebates about the money because people know the money in this bill has \nbeen gone over and over and over, and it is justified. I say we have \ndone our best. We set a new precedent. We set the precedent that even \ndisaster money will be offset to the extent it is possible to find \nbudget authority to do so, and the outlay scoring is a secondary \nquestion. That is all we ask for the emergency part that is authorized \nunder the Budget Act. We are authorized to ask for a total emergency \nwaiver of the Budget Act. All we have asked for is a waiver of the \nscoring impact of outlays, and that will give us the money that we need \nto proceed to meet these disasters.\n  Mr. President, I do believe it is an absolutely essential bill. \nAgain, I point out, though, my last comment, I hope we are not accused, \nagain, of somehow or another delaying the money. There is over $2 \nbillion down there in the executive branch right now that is being \nobligated. I am told if they obligate everything they can, they will \nnot obligate all that in the balance of the year. There may be a \ndeficit of about $250 million if they do everything they can possibly \ndo between now and the end of September. It will be about $2 billion.\n  The Senator is right to think about when the money is going to be \nspent. It is going to be spent over the years to come. But that is the \nway you recover from disasters: You put the money up, obligate it, and \nit, in fact, will be spent over a period of years. Hopefully, those \nareas will be strong again and they will recover, as our State has \nrecovered from the great earthquake that happened in 1964.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, we are told by the Congressional Budget \nOffice that this amendment would require cuts in all nondefense \ndiscretionary appropriations for fiscal year 1997 throughout the \nFederal Government of approximately 5 percent of remaining unobligated \nbalances. Apparently the purpose of the Senator's amendment is to fully \noffset not only the budget authority, which the committee itself did, \nbut the outlays that will result from these emergency disaster \nassistance appropriations as well.\n  As I stated in my initial remarks when the Senate took up this \nmeasure, I do not agree on principle that emergency assistance to \nprovide relief to those affected by natural disasters should have to be \noffset in any way. It was for this reason that at the budget summit in \n1990, I strongly recommended, and that Act included, a section \nspecifically exempting emergencies from the need for offsets. That \nsection of the Act has worked very well and has not been abused, in my \njudgment, since its enactment.\n  The suffering of hundreds of thousands of people in hundreds of \ncommunities throughout the Nation are awaiting the financial resources \nthat will be made available to them upon the enactment of this \nlegislation. We should provide that relief to them pursuant to the \nemergency section of the Budget Enforcement Act and thereby not require \noffsets of this emergency spending. Even though in this instance the \ncommittee has recommended full budget authority offsets for these \nemergency appropriations, that should not be a requirement for making \ndisaster assistance appropriations. We cannot determine the time of \nyear, the severity, or the number of natural disasters or their \nresulting costs, so we should not tie ourselves to any requirement that \noffsets should be provided for emergency disaster assistance \nappropriations.\n  The effect of the pending amendment would be to indiscriminately cut \nevery program throughout the nondefense discretionary portion of the \nbudget, regardless of the ability of any particular program to absorb \nthe anticipated 5 percent reduction required by the amendment--for \nexample, the FBI, the Justice Department, the Judiciary, all other law \nenforcement agencies, the border patrol, the INS, the administrative \ncosts of programs such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid will be \naffected. It is clear that many agencies could not absorb these cuts \nthis late in the fiscal year without severely impacting their ability \nto carry out the essential services that they provide to the Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time allocated to the Senator from Alaska \nhas expired.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska for \nyielding me 10 minutes of his time.\n  Let me address the issue of how big does a disaster have to be. We \nspend $1.6 trillion a year here in Washington, DC, on the Federal \nbudget. The bill before us is going to spend $699 million this year \nover budget in new deficits. So what I am asking is simply that less \nthan $1 out of every $1,600 we spend be dedicated to pay for this \nemergency appropriation.\n  The second point I would like to make is this is not the first time I \nhave offered this amendment. In fact, nearly every time we do one of \nthese add-on spending bills, I offer an amendment to require that we \npay for it. Some of our colleagues say, wouldn't it be better if we \npaid for it in advance? It would be better. We ought to do it, but the \npoint is we are not doing it. In 1993, we added $5.4 billion to the \ndeficit in the name of a disaster; $9 billion in 1994; $10 billion in \n1995; $6.4 billion in 1996. We have already added $5.4 billion in 1997.\n  The point is, when do we start paying our bills? I think the answer \nought to be today.\n  We are getting ready to write a brand new budget with record spending \nin it. We ought to be setting aside $7 billion a year for disasters, \nsomething we have not done in the last 5 years, but we are not going to \ndo that unless we adopt this amendment today so that we see we are \ngoing to have to begin to pay these bills.\n  So the question ultimately boils down to deficits. Do we want to pay \nfor helping people, or do we want to pass the burden on to our children \nand our grandchildren? Do we want to, year after year after year, spend \nmoney we don't have?\n  Finally, we are in the process today of busting a budget which is not \neven in effect yet. We are spending $6.6 billion today that will not \neven count as that budget even though we will spend it over the next 5 \nyears. So we are writing a budget with record spending, and we are \nbusting the budget before it even becomes the law of the land. That is \nhow serious we are about spending.\n  I am not saying it is easy to pay our bills, but I am saying that \nevery family in America has to pay its bills. Every day families have \nto deal with emergencies, and they do not have the ability to just \ndeclare it a dire emergency and go on about their business. They have \nto go back and take things they wanted, things they planned for, things \nthey needed, and they have to deny themselves those things to pay their \nbills.\n  What is wisdom in every household in America cannot be folly in the \ngovernance of a great nation. If you really are concerned about \ndeficits, if you are really concerned about the Government paying its \nbills, if you want more jobs, more growth, more opportunity,\n\n[[Page S4190]]\n\nif you really want to balance the budget, today we have an opportunity \nto take $6.6 billion, with a ``B,'' off the deficit in the next 5 \nyears.\n  I urge my colleagues, if you are for fiscal responsibility, show it \ntoday, show it today, not in some abstract speech somewhere back in \nyour State, but show it today by voting to pay for this bill and, in \nthe process, to eliminate $6.6 billion of deficits.\n  I thank the Chair for his tolerance. I yield back the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to table the Senator's amendment \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I believe it is important we review the \nvote conducted earlier today regarding the Warner amendment to \ndistribute supplemental highway funds by the ISTEA formulas rather than \nby the new arbitrary standard delineated in the supplemental \nappropriations bill, and its meaning for the overall issue of ISTEA \nreauthorization. What we have just witnessed has happened time and time \nagain since ISTEA was passed in 1991--the majority of donee States join \nforces and take gas tax money from the remaining minority of donor \nStates. This happened when the original ISTEA formulas were developed, \nit has happened when hitches have disrupted the flow of donor State \nmoney to donee States, and today it has happened when the very formulas \nestablished to protect at least a portion of the donor States' money \nwere found inconvenient by the donee States and, were therefore set-\naside.\n  The equity adjustment programs, designed in the original ISTEA \nlegislation to guarantee donor States would at least get a portion of \nthe gas tax revenues raised in their State back for highway \nmaintenance, have a real and necessary purpose. Without these minimal \nprograms, States such as Michigan would be forced to give up vast \nportions of their gas taxes to States whose highway needs may not be as \nimmediate and pressing as they are in Michigan. In this fiscal year, \ntwo of the programs, the 90 percent minimum allocation and the 90 \npercent of payments programs, kicked-in for the first time, resulting \nin a significantly increased return of gas taxes for the donor States. \nYes, this resulted in the donee States Federal highway funds being \nreduced, but what must be pointed out is that not one donee State would \nhave become a donor State because of these equity programs. They still \nwould receive more money from the Federal Government than they \ncontributed, and the donor States like Michigan would continue to \ncontribute more than they received.\n  But this was not enough, and what appears to have happened now is \nthat the donee States cannot accept that the donor equity programs may \nactually work. So this supplemental appropriation took nearly a half of \na billion dollars, and distributed it not by the ISTEA formulas so \ncarefully crafted by the Congress in 1991, but by their determination \nthat donee States should never lose money.\n  Mr. President, I am incredulous. It is bad enough that the ISTEA \nformulas discriminate against States like Michigan and force us to send \nour gas tax money to highways that do not contribute in any way to our \neconomy or transportation infrastructure. But if the law can be so \nblithely set aside in order to meet the latest needs of the donee \nStates, why should we believe that any follow-on to ISTEA will be \nhonored. Why won't it be similarly set-aside whenever a simply majority \nof the Senators, motivated neither by ideology nor philosophy, neither \nby regional nor personal loyalties, but simply by the immediate ability \nto increase their revenues at the expense of other Senator's States, \ndecide to set them aside once again? The answer, Mr. President, is that \nit will be simple to do so, and this body will do it.\n  That is wrong, that is capricious, and that is not what we were sent \nhere to do. Mr. President, when the environment of an issue such as \ntransportation has become so reduced to simply bringing home the bacon, \nit is time to act and act decisively. Today's vote demonstrated with \ncrystal clarity that the Federal Government cannot be trusted to \nadminister highway funds. We must extract ourselves from this process \nand allow the States to conduct their own road programs, raising their \nown revenues, and spending their own money. That is why, Mr. President, \nwe need to pass the Transportation Empowerment Act, which I cosponsored \nwith Senator Mack, and stop this highway robbery.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the fiscal year \n1997 supplemental appropriations bill. This bill does many good things, \nincluding the provision of an adequate level of support to our troops \nas they disengage from Bosnia.\n  The bill also provides for a much-needed parking facility at the Wade \nPark VA Hospital in Cleveland. Representative Louis Stokes and I have \nbelieved for years now that this is an absolutely necessary \nimprovement, and we are glad that we have finally been able to see it \nto this point in both the authorization and appropriation process.\n  But on behalf of the people of Ohio, let me say that we appreciate \nmost specifically some of the provisions that will help us cope with \nthe consequences of the terrible flooding that took place in our State \nlast month.\n  The southern part of Ohio was ravaged by the worst flooding we have \nexperienced in 33 years. Today, the flood waters have receded, but life \nis far from back to normal. In some towns, people still do not have \npermanent places to live. They are staying with relatives, or in RV's. \nSome have had their homes condemned--some have lost nearly everything \nand have to start again from scratch.\n  When you drive through these towns, as I did, you see piles of \npeople's belongings--like water damaged carpets--piled up outside their \nhomes to dry, as they endeavor to rebuild their homes and their lives.\n  Townships, villages, and counties all over southern Ohio are \nstruggling to rebuild the roads and bridges that were damaged in the \nflooding. Some of the bridges dated back to the turn of the century.\n  In Brown County, for example, they lost one covered bridge outright, \nand sustained serious damage to another one.\n  In Clermont County, I saw Bear Creek Road that was completely washed \naway. They have been able to fix it temporarily, but school buses and \ngarbage trucks can't use it. A permanent repair has to wait until money \nis available from the Natural Resource Conservation Service--or NRCS.\n  Our hearts go out to all the people who are suffering the \nconsequences of this flood, especially those who have lost family \nmembers and friends. We will do our best to help you carry on.\n  We have already seen a wonderful outpouring of humanitarian \nassistance\n\n[[Page S4191]]\n\nin response to this tragedy, the American Red Cross and the Ohio \nNational Guard--along with many other concerned public and private \norganizations--have offered a desperately needed helping hand to some \nfamilies who are having a really tough time.\n  This legislation will help continue that process. It includes a $77 \nmillion appropriation for the Emergency Conservation Program, which \nprovides cost-sharing assistance to the farmers whose land was damaged \nby the floods.\n  It includes $161 million for the NRCS Watershed and Flood Prevention \nOperations, which are designed to open the dangerously restricted \nchannels and waterways, repair diversions and levees, and assist in \nerosion control on steep slopes.\n  The people of southern Ohio have shown an incredible spirit in \nworking together to get through this crisis. This bill will help them \nmove forward in that same spirit.\n  I thank the members of the Committee for the fine job they have done \nin crafting this legislation, and I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the supplemental \nappropriations bill but do so with great hesitation.\n  Like all of us here today, I want to extend my sympathies to the \ncommunities and families of the Upper Midwest who have experienced the \nterrible flooding over the past several weeks.\n  It brings back vivid memories of the flooding that hit Western \nMaryland last year and I know all Marylanders join me in extending our \nthoughts and prayers to everyone in the Midwest.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I was hoping for quick consideration of \nthis important legislation so we could speed relief to disaster \nvictims. They are counting on us to help them get back on their feet--\nto help them rebuild their homes and businesses.\n  I am so disappointed that what should have been a speedy, nonpartisan \ntargeted relief bill has turned into another nasty partisan battle that \nis designed to divide us and provoke a veto from the President.\n  I am particularly alarmed by the inclusion in this package of what is \nartfully called the Shutdown Prevention Act.\n  Nobody knows the pain of a government shutdown better than me and the \nMarylanders I represent. When the last shutdown occurred, I visited \nGovernment agencies that had to remain open.\n  I saw the frustration on the faces of the workers and the financial \nhardship it caused for all Federal employees.\n  I do not want another shutdown and will do everything I can to \nprevent it. But, the revised bill now provides for a permanent \ncontinuing resolution which is nothing more than a partisan trick.\n  If we fail to enact our appropriations bills on time, the continuing \nresolution contained in this bill will prevent Congress from increasing \nspending for cancer research, crime fighting and education. It will \nalso prevent Congress from cutting spending and eliminating waste.\n  In addition, I am disturbed by the way in which we have chosen to pay \nfor this bill. This bill takes over $3 billion in unobligated funds \nfrom HUD's section 8 public housing program to pay for FEMA's disaster \nrelief fund.\n  I do not believe we should be robbing Peter to pay Paul. Eventually, \nPeter will be broke.\n  The projected budget problems with regard to the section 8 program \nare well known. In fiscal year 1998, section 8 renewals will cost $10.2 \nbillion. That is a $7 billion increase over the fiscal year 1997 \nfunding level.\n  We will need the unobligated funds to pay for the section 8 renewals \nin fiscal year 1998. We should not be raiding the program to pay for \ndisaster funding.\n  We must find a new way to pay for emergency supplemental \nappropriations bills because these disasters are not going to end.\n  We could be facing even more expensive disasters in the near future. \nAre we going to continually rob one or two agencies to pay for these \nbills?\n  I believe we need a new system or a new arrangement to deal with \nthese type of disasters--a new system that is off-budget.\n  Mr. President, I am forced to oppose this bill because of the \ncontinuing resolution and the way in which we have chosen to pay for \nthe bill. As a result of the continuing resolution, the bill is likely \nto be vetoed by the President. I hope in the future we can avoid \npartisan fights over disaster relief bills and find a more equitable \nway to pay for them.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nefforts by the Appropriations committee to fund research into \nenvironmental risk factors associated with breast cancer as a part of \nS. 672.\n  I would especially like to thank and acknowledge the efforts of the \ndistinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator \nStevens, the distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations \nCommittee Senator Byrd, as well as the efforts of the chairman of the \nLabor, HHS Subcommittee, Senator Specter and its ranking member, \nSenator Harkin for their attention to the concerns I have raised \nregarding this issue. All have been dogged advocates of breast cancer \nresearch and I am grateful for their previous efforts and for what they \nhave done in the legislation before the Senate. I am especially \ngrateful for their acknowledgement in the committee's report of the \nalarmingly high breast cancer rates in the Northeast and specifically \nmy State of New Jersey.\n  Few issues pose as significant health threat to the constituents I \nrepresent as does breast cancer. It is estimated that nationally 1 in 8 \nwomen will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime and over \n46,000 women die annually from breast cancer. It is truly one of the \nleading health threats facing American women.\n  However, it is an absolute health crisis confronting the women of New \nJersey with mortality and incidence rates that far exceed the national \naverage. New Jersey has the highest breast cancer mortality rate of any \nState and our incidence rate of breast cancer is 11 percent higher than \nthe national average and the average for in the Northeast. It is \nestimated that there will be 6,400 new cases of breast cancer diagnosed \nthis year and 1,800 women will die from breast cancer in 1997 alone in \nNew Jersey.\n  I have long believed that behind our State's history of environmental \nproblems lies the reasons for our high breast cancer rates. I do not \nbelieve that it is a coincidence that the State, New Jersey, with more \nSuperfund sites than any other, as well as thousands of other \ncontaminated sites not listed under Superfund, has the highest cancer \nrates in the Nation.\n  In response to this I recently introduced the New Jersey Women's \nEnvironmental Health Act with Senator Lautenberg that would authorize a \n4 year $10.5 million study into the possible association between \nenvironmental risk factors and breast cancer. I believe this effort \nwill provide not only answers to the women of my State but ground-\nbreaking research into this association.\n  In New Jersey, we are extremely fortunate to have one of the leading \ncancer research institutes in the Nation. The University of Medicine \nand Dentistry of New Jersey is only 1 of 7 academic institutions in the \nUnited States which houses a National Cancer Institute designated \nclinical center and an NIH-designated comprehensive Center of \nExcellence for environmental health sciences. Indeed, not only does it \nhave the State's only NCI-designated cancer center, but the University \nis also home to a HHS-designated Women's Health Initiative site. I \nbelieve that this unique institution is the type of multicenter \ninstitution envisioned by the committee to do this important research.\n  Working with these scientists and clinicians, we have developed a \nproposal that would assess breast cancer in New Jersey at many levels, \nfrom molecular markers of environmental exposure to clinical evaluation \nand treatment. It also includes the involvement of the State Department \nof Health in a population-based epidemiological study.\n  Mr. President, our leading environmental health scientists from \nRutgers, our State University, and the University of Medicine and \nDentistry of New Jersey, both partners in the State's NIEHS Center of \nExcellence, concur that there are several key elements of this study \nwhich must be pursued. These include the need to: (a) identify the \ndisease patterns in the State--ethnicity, geographic location, \noccupation\n\n[[Page S4192]]\n\nand education of the victims; (b) identify and characterize the \npotential etiologic factors--such as exposure to Superfund effluents, \npesticides and occupational hazards; (c) analyze tissue samples and \nenvironmental samples for etiologic agents and tissue samples for \ngenetic markers of disease; and (d) conduct a full scale case control \nstudy.\n  That is why I am so encouraged by this committee's efforts to fund \nresearch into this important area and am thankful that the project I \nhave developed in consultation with the University of the Health \nSciences of New Jersey and the New Jersey Department of Health will \nhave an opportunity to immediately compete for the funds necessary to \nbegin its implementation.\n  I would like also to thank the subcommittee chairman, Senator \nSpecter, for his recognition that the issues this initiative proposes \nto address are the type of issues the committee envisioned to be \nstudied with this funding.\n  As I have stated earlier, I believe our initiative will not only \nprovide answers to the women of New Jersey but will provide ground-\nbreaking research into the association between environmental conditions \nand breast cancer in this Nation and greatly assist in this committee's \ngoal of providing answers that may account for some of the startling \nregional variations of breast cancer in this Nation.\n\n\n             FUNDING FOR THE DIRECT OPERATING LOAN PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I wanted to take this opportunity to thank \nSenators Cochran and Bumpers, chairman and ranking member of the \nAgriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, and Senators Stevens and Byrd, \nchairman and ranking member of the full committee, for their help in \nmaking loans available to low-income farmers and averting a potential \nman-made disaster.\n  This is planting season. Many farmers in the Commonwealth, and around \nthe Nation, need to borrow funds to cover the costs of planting, which \nare repayed when crops are harvested. In the past, these funds have \nbeen made available by the U.S. Department of Agriculture through its \ndirect operating loan program. Unfortunately, this program is out of \nfunds for the year, and the very livelihoods of many farmers, mostly on \nsmall farms, are threatened.\n  Mr. President, when I was told of this situation by a number of \nfarmers who came to my office 2 weeks ago, I contacted Agriculture \nSecretary Glickman and Senator Bumpers. It was clear to me that the \ncrisis these farmers faced was as real as the floods faced by our \nfellow Americans in the upper Midwest. With their help, we were able to \ninclude in this bill an appropriation that will provide $100 million in \ndirect operating loan funds to our Nation's low-income farmers. Getting \nthis money out into the fields is an emergency. In passing this \nprovision, we will be ``filling the sandbags'' that can protect our \nfarmers from a disaster, this one of manmade origins.\n  Let me just add that this provision is especially important to \nminority farmers, who have suffered in the past from well-documented \ndiscrimination within the Department of Agriculture. I know Secretary \nGlickman is committed to eradicating the discrimination, but I'm not \nsure he will be able to succeed on his own. These loans are crucial to \nthese farmers. To quote a memo from the Department of Agriculture, \n``many of the low-income farmers which we will not be able to provide \noperating loan [OL] funds to--if no further money were appropriated--\nare minorities. Having adequate direct OL loan funds is critical for \nlow-income minority farmers in their effort to become self-sustaining, \nsuccessful, contributing members of rural communities.''\n  Again, Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their help in this \nmatter, and I urge my colleagues to move this legislation quickly, to \nalleviate both the pain of natural disasters past and the possiblity of \nthis manmade disaster in the near future.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 672, the \nemergency supplemental appropriations bill. The President has now \ndeclared a major disaster for over 50 counties in the State of \nMinnesota, and ordered Federal aid to supplement State and local \nrecovery efforts in areas hard hit by severe flooding, severe winter \nstorms, snow melt, high winds, rain, and ice. This disaster assistance \nis urgently needed in my State and I want to thank Senators Stevens and \nByrd for their work in getting this package through the Senate.\n  While I intend to vote for this bill, I am very concerned about the \nramifications of the McCain amendment, which triggers an automatic \ncontinuing resolution for fiscal year 1998 if Congress fails to pass \nappropriations bills. This disaster bill provides important assistance \nto Minnesotans struggling to rebuild their lives following an \nunprecedented natural disaster, and I think it is outrageous that we \nhave used the emergency supplemental bill in this way. The continuing \nresolution will result in harsh cuts to important education and health \nprograms. This is an uncaring and thoughtless way to proceed on the \nbudget and it does not reflect the priorities and needs of the American \npeople.\n  The people of Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota have suffered \ntremendous losses as a result of the devastating winter storms and 500-\nyear spring floods. In Minnesota alone, over 20,000 people have been \ndisplaced from their homes, many of these families will not be able to \nreturn to their homes for weeks and months to come. The record flooding \nand cold temperatures have had a major economic impact on my State. \nFrom small businesses in East Grand Forks to dairy farmers who were \nunable to milk their herds or to transport milk. Where it is still very \nearly in the process of assessing losses, the Federal Reserve Bank has \nalready estimated that there has been a loss of over $1.2 billion in \nthe Red River Valley alone.\n  I want to congratulate Senators Stevens and Byrd for their commitment \nto get assistance out to disaster victims. I appreciate their \ncommitment to continue to do all that we can to help families and \nbusinesses rebuild in the region. While this bill before us does not \ncontain all the funding that the region will need to rebuild from the \nunbelievable losses caused by flooding and winter storms, it does \nprovide the first installment of assistance.\n  The emergency supplemental contains critical funding for the region, \nincluding $500 million in community development block grant funding, \nover $900 million in disaster assistance under FEMA, $54.7 million for \nEDA, and additional funding for transportation losses due to flooding \nand severe winter weather.\n  The State of Minnesota learned in the 1993 that CDBG funding is one \nof the best vehicles to get assistance into the communities for \nrebuilding homes and businesses and for flood mitigation projects. I am \nglad that we were able to secure this additional CDBG assistance and \nthe assurances from Senators Stevens and Byrd that they will support \nthis funding level in conference.\n  In addition, this bill contains a provision to require the \nadministration to release $45 million in emergency contingency funding \nunder the LIHEAP program for emergency energy needs of flood victims. \nAs families begin to return to their homes in Ada, Breckenridge, \nWarren, and East Grand Forks, they will need this assistance to replace \ntheir heating systems. With this funding thousands of families will be \nable to return to their homes and do the hard work of cleaning up.\n  Finally, I want to acknowledge the tremendous volunteer effort that \ncontinues in my State. On my visits to the Minnesota and Red River \nValleys, I was touched by the sense of community among the residents. \nMany folks didn't care who they were working next to, as long as they \nwere working for the common good. People worked tirelessly to build \ndikes to try to save homes and businesses and are now working \ntirelessly to help flood victims begin to clean their homes, schools, \nand businesses. In particular, I want to send a special word of thanks \nto all the high school students who volunteered on the frontlines.\n  In the weeks and months ahead there will be many more hours of hard \nwork; cleanup, removal of sandbags, restoration of buildings, ensuring \nthat water supplies are not contaminated. People need not only the \nsupport of their neighbors, they need the support that only the Federal \nGovernment can provide. I am pleased that the Senate has acted and is \nnow approving this package of much needed disaster assistance. With \nthis funding, the flooded communities and families can begin to rebuild\n\n[[Page S4193]]\n\ntheir towns, their businesses, and their lives.\n\n\n                     dual-use applications program\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to speak about my amendment \nNo. 69, which strikes section 305 of this supplemental appropriations \nbill.\n  Section 305 of the bill states that ``Section 5803 of Public Law 104-\n208 is hereby repealed.'' That is a very economical formulation, but it \ndoesn't tell the reader much about the substantive issues at stake. For \nthis reason, I would like to take some time to describe to my \ncolleagues what I think the key issues underlying section 305 in the \nsupplemental appropriations bill are, and why I believe section 305 is \nan unwise step and should be stricken from this bill.\n  Section 305 repeals a $100 million appropriation to a Department of \nDefense program known as the Dual-Use Applications Program. By doing \nso, it eliminates one of the two major initiatives in this program. The \nDual-Use Applications Program is just getting started. It was \nauthorized for the first time in last year's Defense Authorization Act. \nBecause of this, most of the money appropriated last year has not yet \nbeen spent. Awards are now just being made and announced. So, at a very \nsuperficial level, the $100 million looks attractive as a candidate for \nrescission.\n  But the Dual-Use Applications Program is, in my view, essential to \nour future national defense. This program will introduce major \ntechnological changes and cost savings in military applications, and \nmajor cultural changes in how the Department of Defense manages R We \nhave forged a bipartisan consensus on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee in favor of this program. Once my colleagues in the Senate \nunderstand what this program is all about, I am confident that they \nwill agree with me that gutting the Dual-Use Applications Program at \nits inception is a very bad idea for our long-term national security.\n  America's Armed Forces today enjoy technological supremacy over any \npotential adversary. This is not an accident. It is the result of two \nthings: wise past investments in defense R and competent advocacy \nfrom the top echelons of DOD for moving the fruits of that R into \npractice.\n  Our current recipe for maintaining military technological supremacy, \nthough, is not a guarantee of future success. In fact, to ensure that \nour men and women in uniform maintain their technological edge over any \nfuture adversary, we will need a new strategy for defense technology. \nIn this strategy, we will have to rely more on the commercial sector to \nprovide defense technologies, through adaptation of cutting-edge \ncommercial technologies to military use, rather than developing the \nsame technology in isolation in a MILSPEC world.\n  There are two forces driving this new overall technology strategy.\n  The first force is the constrained budget for defense R Defense \nR, like all defense spending, is under tremendous pressure as we move \ntoward a balanced budget. We no longer have an open checkbook for \ndefense scientists and engineers, as we essentially did during the cold \nwar. Thus, we need to spend our funds more strategically, and seek ways \nto leverage our defense R dollars. with R investments being made by \nother funding sources.\n  The second force driving the defense world toward greater use of \ncommercial technologies is the fact that technological advances from \ncommercial R are outpacing similar advances from military R in many \napplications important to national defense. For example, the military \nis faced with an explosion of requirements for rapid and widespread \nprocessing and dissemination of information. The commercial world has \nled the development of the Internet, despite its origins in DARPA, and \nthere is now much that the defense world can learn from the commercial \nworld's experience with distributed information processing and \ncommunication.\n\n  Despite the emergence of these two new forces, the defense world is \nnot used to, and is not prepared for, working with the commercial R \nsector in a radically new manner. It is used to thinking about its own, \nsupposedly unique, defense requirements and perhaps some subsequent \ndefense spinoff to commercial applications. It is not used to thinking \nabout common requirements between defense and commercial applications \nand desirability of commercial ``spin-ons'' to defense applications.\n  This is where the Dual-Use Applications Program, established by \nsection 203 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n1997, comes in. The missions of this program are to a prototype and \ndemonstrate new approaches for DOD to use in leveraging commercial \nresearch, technology, products, and processes for military systems.\n  Over the long term, these new approaches to working with industry \nmust become widespread throughout DOD, in order for the Department to \ntake full advantage of the technological opportunities afforded by the \ncommercial sector. These leveraging approaches are not widespread in \nDOD today, by DOD's own admission. While acquisition reform has helped \nclear the path to a new relationship between DOD and the commercial \nsector, DOD reports that its experience to date with acquisition reform \nhas shown that leveraging approaches are unfamiliar to many in DOD and \nare not widely adopted in the services.\n  There are two initiatives now underway in the Dual-Use Applications \nProgram. Both encourage the leveraging, by the services, of the \ncommercial sector's research, products, and processes for the benefit \nof DOD and the Nation's defense capabilities.\n  The first initiative is in science and technology research and \ndevelopment. It is very important, and I will describe it at some \nlength. It is not immediately affected by this supplemental \nappropriations bill, in its current form, but I understand that it is \nlikely to become a target for cuts in a conference. I hope that, after \nI finish my statement, the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee can give me some assurance that he will resist attempts to \ncut the Science and Technology Initiative.\n  The second initiative is zeroed out by section 305 of this \nsupplemental appropriations bill. It is a Commercial Operations and \nSupport Savings Initiative that will prototype an approach that the \nservice can use to insert, on a routine basis, commercial products and \nprocesses into already-fielded military systems to reduce operations \nand support costs.\n  Section 305 of the bill would repeal section 5803 of last year's \nDefense Appropriations Act. That provision provides $100 million in \nfunding for DOD's commercial operations and support savings initiative, \nknown as COSSI. Under the COSSI program, DOD plans to insert new \ncommercial technologies into weapons systems to reduce operations and \nsupport costs.\n  I am concerned that the elimination of this program could increase \ndefense costs in the long run. DOD has learned that for many weapons \nsystems, operations and support costs far exceed acquisition costs. By \ninvesting in upgraded commercial technologies with improved \nperformance, the Department hopes to bring operations and support costs \ndown in the long run.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I share the Senator's concern. Under the COSSI \nprogram, DOD intends to make sensible investments that will reduce \nweapons systems costs in the long run. By upgrading the F-14A/B \nInertial System, for example, DOD expects that it could increase the \nmean time between failures from 40 hours to 4500 hours, substantially \nreducing program costs over the next decade. Similarly, by installing \nconstant velocity joints in its fleet of M939 5 ton trucks, the \nDepartment expects to reduce its tire costs by two-thirds. In my view, \nwe can't afford not to make these kinds of money-saving investments.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from Connecticut is exactly right. There are \nmany commercial technologies that can save the Defense Department money \nin the long run. For example, one Navy COSSI program uses sensors and \nsoftware to monitor engine and rotor components on helicopters. The \ntechnology tells the user when a given part needs to be replaced, as \nopposed to the current system, which for safety reasons requires \nperfectly usable parts to be replaced at regular intervals. Navy \nprogram managers have estimated that this technology can save over $1 \nbillion over 10 years if adopted on just two kinds of helicopters. In \nthis\n\n[[Page S4194]]\n\ntime of tight budgets, this is the kind of program that we should all \nbe supporting.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I believe that the Senators have expressed valid \nconcerns. This is an important program, and I hope that we will be able \nto restore a substantial amount of the funding in conference.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I understand the Senators' concerns. The administration \nhas expressed similar concerns about this provision. We will certainly \nlook carefully at this provision in conference and do what we can to \nprovide an appropriate level of funding.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Having made the case for restoring funds to the COSSI \nprogram, I would like to state my hope that such restoration not come \nat the expense of other dual-use technology programs that will benefit \nthe Department of Defense. The Senate Armed Services Committee has \ncarefully reviewed and authorized the dual use science and technology \nresearch element of the Dual Use Application Program as provided for in \nsection 203 of the National Authorization Act for fiscal year 1997. \nPrograms developed under this section will provide major enhancements \nin our military capabilities and can also benefit the commercial \nsector. Cooperation between DOD and the private sector will provide \ndual use benefits at a significantly lower cost to the government.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I understand the Senators' concerns. The administration \nhas expressed similar concerns about this provision. We will certainly \nlook carefully at this provision in conference and do what we can to \nprovide an appropriate level of funding for both elements of the Dual \nUse Program.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I share Senator Bingaman's concern \nabout section 305 of the bill, which would eliminate $100 million in \nfunding for DOD's commercial operations and support savings initiative, \nknown as COSSI. Under the COSSI program, DOD plans to insert new \ncommercial technologies into weapons systems to reduce operations and \nsupport costs. DOD has learned that for many weapons systems, \noperations and support costs far exceed acquisition costs. By investing \nin upgraded commercial technologies with improved performance, the \nDepartment hopes to bring operations and support costs down in the long \nrun.\n  I am concerned that the elimination of the COSSI program will \nincrease defense costs in the long run. At the same time, I agree that \nwe should not try to fund the COSSI program at the expense of the \nDepartment's limited funding for dual use technologies. Senator \nBingaman has worked long and hard to establish the Dual Use Program and \nto keep it going, and this program has shown real benefits for both the \nDepartment of Defense and the economy as a whole. I hope that the \nconferees will be able to find an appropriate level of funding for the \nCOSSI program without undermining the Department's dual use technology \ninitiative.\n\n\n                              section 314\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to express my opposition to section \n314 of S. 672, the supplemental appropriations bill. Section 314 was \nadded to the bill in committee and would prohibit the Health Care \nFinancing Administration from continuing with a Medicare competitive \npricing demonstration project. I believe this provision does not belong \non this emergency supplemental bill and if need be would more \nappropriately be addressed in the upcoming Labor, Health and Human \nServices Appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998. In addition, I \nbelieve this provision would hurt our ability to reform Medicare and \nmake certain that it gets the best deal possible for Medicare \nbeneficiaries and other taxpayers.\n  For many years, I have been working to identify and reform wasteful \npayment policies and practices in the administration of Medicare. The \nGeneral Accounting Office estimates that up to 10 percent of Medicare \nfunds are lost each year to waste, fraud and abuse. And my experience \nis that a large percentage of that is due to wasteful payment policies \nand practices. Clearly, the current Medicare payment scheme for managed \ncare falls into this category and needs reform. Current policy grossly \noverpays in some areas and underpays in many rural areas.\n  While there may be issues that need to be resolved with beneficiaries \nand providers in the area in which this managed care competitive \npricing demonstration is to occur, that does not justify a complete \ncutoff of funds for the test. Officials at HCFA should promptly work \nwith the community to address these issues. If there are legitimate \nissues that cannot be resolved over the next month or two, we could \nconsider options for action on the fiscal year 1998 appropriations \nbill.\n  Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, we need to test ways in which \nwe can achieve Medicare savings to ensure this critically important \nprogram's long-term solvency while preserving access and quality for \nbeneficiaries. Enacting section 314 of this bill would be a setback to \nthis important effort. Because of this I'm hopeful that this matter \nwill be reconsidered and that any problems associated with this \nparticular demonstration project can be promptly worked out \nadministratively without the need for legislative action.\n  I also want to express my concern with section 323 of the bill. This \nsection is a legislative rider that is unrelated to the substance of S. \n672. It repeals section 1555 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining \nAct of 1994 which was intended to save taxpayers millions of dollars by \ngiving State and local governments to take advantage of the purchasing \npower of the Federal Government. Implementation of this provision was \ndelayed for 18 months last year to give time for the General Accounting \nOffice to study the issue and report back recommendations to Congress. \nWe should allow time to get the GAO's report and recommendations before \ntaking action on this important issue.\n\n\n  Amendment to Delay Implementation of the Welfare Law for Immigrants\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, yesterday Senator D'Amato offered an \namendment, which I cosponsored, to delay implementation of certain \nprovisions in the new welfare law which affect legal immigrants.\n  Last year, Congress passed a so-called welfare reform bill that \ndrastically restricts the ability of legal immigrants to participate in \npublic assistance programs. It prohibits them from receiving food \nstamps, SSI benefits, and Federal nonemergency Medicaid benefits.\n  In recent months, we have seen the harsh impact of this bill on legal \nimmigrant families. Many fear being turned out of nursing homes and cut \noff from disability payments beginning on August 1, 1997. In recent \nweeks, some needy immigrants have taken their own lives, rather than \nburden their families.\n  Last week's negotiations on the fiscal year 1998 budget produced more \nhopeful prospects on this issue. But, needy immigrants will begin to \nlose their SSI benefits on August 1, 2 months before the fiscal year \n1998 begins. We need to extend the August 1 deadline while we get our \nact together and work out a satisfactory compromise.\n  Senator D'Amato's amendment extends the effective date for certain \nparts of the welfare law which affect legal immigrants until the end of \nthe 1997 fiscal year. This extension is fair and reasonable. We need to \nensure that no one loses SSI benefits while the budget process works \nits course.\n\n\n                      sampling in the 2000 census\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has agreed \nto Senator Hollings' amendment to allow the Bureau of the Census to \nplan for sampling in the 2000 census. In that year the Bureau proposes \nto count each census tract by mail and then by sending out enumerators \nuntil they have responses for 90 percent of the addresses. The Bureau \nproposes to then use sampling to count the remaining 10 percent of \naddresses in each tract, based on what they know of the 90 percent. \nThis would provide a more accurate census than we get by repeatedly \nsending enumerators to hard-to-count locations and would save $500 \nmillion or more in personnel costs.\n  The census plan is supported by the National Academy of Sciences' \nNational Research Council, which was directed by Congress in 1992 to \nstudy ways to achieve the most accurate population count possible. The \nNRC report finds that the Bureau should:\n\n     make a good faith effort to count everyone, but then truncate \n     physical enumeration after a reasonable effort to reach \n     nonrespondents. The number and character of\n\n[[Page S4195]]\n\n     the remaining nonrespondents should then be estimated through \n     sampling.\n\n  The supplemental appropriations bill would prohibit the Bureau from \nplanning for a census that includes sampling, and would even prevent \nthe Bureau from planning to send out the long form, from which we get \ncrucial and legally required information about education, employment, \nimmigration, housing, and many other areas of American life. The long \nform gives us a detailed picture of the populace that we cannot do \nwithout.\n  Mr. President, the taking of a census goes back centuries. I quote \nfrom the King James version of the Bible, chapter two of Luke: ``And it \ncame to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar \nAugustus that all the world should be taxed [or enrolled, according to \nthe footnote] . . . And all went to be taxed, everyone into his own \ncity.'' The early censuses were taken to enable the ruler or ruling \ngovernment to tax or raise an army.\n  The first census for more sociological reasons was taken in Nuremberg \nin 1449. So it was not a new idea to the Founding Fathers when they \nwrote it into the Constitution to facilitate fair taxation and accurate \napportionment of the House of Representatives, the latter of which was \nthe foundation of the Great Compromise that has served us well ever \nsince.\n  The Constitution says in Article I, Section 2:\n\n     Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among \n     the several States which may be included within this Union, \n     according to their respective numbers, which shall be \n     determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, \n     including those bound to Service for a term of years, and \n     excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other \n     persons. The actual enumeration shall be made within three \n     years of the first meeting of the Congress of the United \n     States, and within every subsequent term of ten years, in \n     such manner as they shall direct by law.\n\n  Opponents of sampling often say that the Constitution calls for an \n``actual enumeration'', and this requires an actual headcount rather \nthan any statistical inference about those we know we miss every time. \nHowever, numerous lower court rulings have found that it is permissible \nunder the Constitution to use sampling. When the New York case was \ndecided last year, the Supreme Court found that the decision by the \nSecretary of Commerce not to adjust the 1990 census for the undercount \nwas a reasonable choice in areas where technical experts disagree, and \nwithin the discretion granted to the Federal Government. The opinion by \nChief Justice Rehnquist stated that ``We do not decide whether the \nConstitution might prohibit Congress from conducting the type of \nstatistical adjustment considered here.'' So it appears to be left to \nthe executive and legislative branches to decide how best to count the \npopulace.\n\n  I note that we have not taken an actual enumeration the way the \nFounding Fathers envisioned since 1960, after which enumerators going \nto every door were replaced with mail-in responses. The Constitution \nprovides for a postal system, but did not direct that the census be \ntaken by mail. Yet we do it that way. Why not sample if that is a \nfurther improvement?\n  Sampling would go far toward correcting one of the most serious flaws \nin the census, the undercount. Statistical work in the 1940's \ndemonstrated that we can estimate how many people the census misses. \nThe estimate for 1940 was 5.4 percent of the population. After \ndecreasing steadily to 1.2 percent in 1980, the 1990 undercount \nincreased to 1.8 percent, or more than 4 million people.\n  More significantly, the undercount is not distributed evenly. The \ndifferential undercount, as it is known, of minorities was 4.4 percent \nfor blacks, 5.0 percent for Hispanics, 2.3 percent for Asian-Pacific \nIslanders, and 4.5 percent for Native Americans, compared with 1.2 \npercent for non-Hispanic whites. The difference between the black and \nnonblack undercount was the largest since 1940. By disproportionately \nmissing minorities, we deprive them of equal representation in Congress \nand of proportionate funding from Federal programs based on population. \nThe Census Bureau estimates that the total undercount will reach 1.9 \npercent in 2000 if the 1990 methods are used instead of sampling.\n  Mr. President, I have some history with the undercount issue. In 1966 \nwhen I became director of the Joint Center for Urban Studies at MIT and \nHarvard, I asked Prof. David Heer to work with me in planning a \nconference to publicize the nonwhite undercount in the 1960 census and \nto foster concern about the problems of obtaining a full enumeration, \nespecially of the urban poor. I ask unanimous consent that my forward \nto the report from that conference be printed in the Record, for it is, \nsave for some small numerical changes, disturbingly still relevant. \nSampling is the key to the problem and we must proceed with it.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Social Statistics and the City\n\n                           (By David M. Heer)\n\n\n                                foreword\n\n       At one point in the course of the 1950's John Kenneth \n     Galbraith observed that it is the statisticians, as much as \n     any single group, who shape public policy, for the simple \n     reason that societies never really become effectively \n     concerned with social problems until they learn to measure \n     them. An unassuming truth, perhaps, but a mighty one, and one \n     that did more than he may know to sustain morale in a number \n     of Washington bureaucracies (hateful word!) during a period \n     when the relevant cabinet officers had on their own reached \n     very much the same conclusion--and distrusted their charges \n     all the more in consequence. For it is one of the ironies of \n     American government that individuals and groups that have \n     been most resistant to liberal social change have quite \n     accurately perceived that social statistics are all too \n     readily transformed into political dynamite, whilst in a \n     curious way the reform temperament has tended to view the \n     whole statistical process as plodding, overcautious, and \n     somehow a brake on progress. (Why must every statistic be \n     accompanied by detailed notes about the size of the \n     ``standard error''?)\n       The answer, of course, is that this is what must be done if \n     the fact is to be accurately stated, and ultimately accepted. \n     But, given this atmosphere of suspicion on the one hand and \n     impatience on the other, it is something of a wonder that the \n     statistical officers of the federal government have with such \n     fortitude and fairness remained faithful to a high \n     intellectual calling, and an even more demanding public \n     trust.\n       There is no agency of which this is more true than the \n     Bureau of the Census, the first, and still the most \n     important, information-gathering agency of the federal \n     government. For getting on, now, for two centuries, the \n     Census has collected and compiled the essential facts of the \n     American experience. Of late the ten-year cycle has begun to \n     modulate somewhat, and as more and more current reports have \n     been forthcoming, the Census has been quietly transforming \n     itself into a continuously flowing source of information \n     about the American people. In turn, American society has \n     become more and more dependent on it. It would be difficult \n     to find an aspect of public or private life not touched and \n     somehow shaped by Census information. And yet for all this, \n     it is somehow ignored. To declare that the Census is without \n     friends would be absurd. But partisans? When Census \n     appropriations are cut, who bleeds on Capitol Hill or in the \n     Executive Office of the President? The answer is almost \n     everyone in general, and therefore no one in particular. But \n     the result, too often, is the neglect, even the abuse, of an \n     indispensable public institution, which often of late has \n     served better than it has been served.\n       The papers in this collection, as Professor Heer's \n     introduction explains, were presented at a conference held in \n     June 1967 with the avowed purpose of arousing a measure of \n     public concern about the difficulties encountered by the \n     Census in obtaining a full count of the urban poor, \n     especially perhaps the Negro poor. It became apparent, for \n     example, that in 1960 one fifth of nonwhite males aged 25-\n     29 had in effect disappeared and had been left out of the \n     Census count altogether. Invisible men. Altogether, one \n     tenth of the nonwhite population had been ``missed.'' the \n     ramifications of this fact were considerable, and its \n     implications will suggest themselves immediately. It was \n     hoped that a public airing of the issue might lead to \n     greater public support to ensure that the Census would \n     have the resources in 1970 to do what is, after all, its \n     fundamental job, that of counting all the American people. \n     As the reader will see, the scholarly case for providing \n     this support was made with considerable energy and candor. \n     But perhaps the most compelling argument arose from a \n     chance remark by a conference participant to the effect \n     that if the decennial census were not required by the \n     Constitution, the Bureau would doubtless never have \n     survived the economy drives of the nineteenth century. The \n     thought flashed: the full enumeration of the American \n     population is not simply an optional public service \n     provided by government for the use of sales managers, \n     sociologists, and regional planners. It is, rather, the \n     constitutionally mandated process whereby political \n     representation in the Congress is distributed as between \n     different areas of the nation. It is a matter not of \n     convenience but of the highest seriousness, affecting the \n     very foundations of sovereignty. That being the case, \n     there is no lawful course but to provide the Bureau with \n     whatever resources are necessary to obtain a\n\n[[Page S4196]]\n\n     full enumeration. Inasmuch as Negroes and other \n     ``minorities'' are concentrated in specific urban \n     locations, to undercount significantly the population in \n     those areas is to deny residents their rights under \n     Article I, Section 3 of the Constitution, as well, no \n     doubt, as under Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n     Given the further, more recent practice of distributing \n     federal, state, and local categorical aid on the basis not \n     only of the number but also social and economic \n     characteristics of local populations, the constitutional \n     case for full enumeration would seem to be further \n     strengthened.\n       A sound legal case? Others will judge; and possibly one day \n     the courts will decide. But of one thing the conference had \n     no doubt: the common-sense case is irrefutable. America needs \n     to count all its people. (And reciprocally, all its people \n     need to make themselves available to be counted.) But if the \n     legal case adds any strength to the common-sense argument, it \n     remains only to add that should either of the arguments bring \n     some improvement in the future, it will be but another \n     instance of the generosity of the Carnegie Corporation, which \n     provided funds for the conference and for this publication.\n\n\n                                  cdbg\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. I would like to remind my colleagues that our CDBG request \nis based on very preliminary loss figures. There are many residents of \ncommunities along the Red River Valley who still have not returned to \ntheir homes. It will take months before we have a better idea of what \nthe total losses will be.\n  As a result, all of us in Minnesota, North and South Dakota hope we \ncan count on the support of the Appropriations Committee to help meet \nour future needs during the 1998 appropriations process, or, if \nnecessary, in future supplemental requests. I realize that the \nrebuilding effort will take some time, and I would request the support \nof my distinguished colleague, the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, to help us fund additional disaster relief beyond this \nsupplemental request as the true losses are determined.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The committee is well aware that funds for these \ndisasters must be appropriated during the entire rebuilding period, \nwhich can take several years. We will work with the Senators from \nMinnesota, North and South Dakota to ensure that the disaster needs of \nyour States are met during the 1998 appropriations process, as well as \nfuture appropriations bills, if necessary.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, during the last several days, I have \nexpressed concerns about various provisions and amendments on this \nsupplemental appropriations Bill. In the end, however, I believe that \nthis bill addresses not only New Mexico's transportation infrastructure \nneeds but also many of the disaster relief demands facing other parts \nof the Nation, and I will vote for passage.\n  Unfortunately, this bill's continuing resolution provisions--which \ncall for automatic across-the-board cuts--if the Congress fails to pass \nour appropriations bills before the end of the fiscal year is a poor \nand unacceptable way to legislate. I strongly oppose this provision \nwhich does remain in the supplemental appropriations bill. I am hopeful \nthat this provision will be struck in conference and support the \nPresident's promised veto if this provision is not struck.\n  These supplemental appropriations bills should focus on the most \npressing needs of the Nation--particularly natural disasters that call \nfor our care and attention. We should not be cluttering these bills \nwith provisions such as the continuing resolution provision which \neither the Conference Committee or the President must remove.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the supplemental appropriation before us \ntoday contains funding for floods which devastated the Northwestern and \nMidwestern States. I can appreciate the necessity of providing FEMA \nfunding for those States. The last time that this body considered a \nmeasure to provide funding for disaster assistance, it was a proposal \nfor $1.2 billion in assistance, mainly to my State of Pennsylvania. \nThat funding was an acknowledgment of the devastation that occurred as \na result of the harsh winter, extensive snowfall, and severe flooding \nthroughout Pennsylvania.\n  Again, Mr. President, the situation is no less severe and the need no \nless dire in the Northwest and Midwest. I sympathize with those \nSenators from affected States that have taken to the floor during this \ndebate to talk about the devastation to homes, businesses, and \ncommunities that they have seen firsthand. The FEMA funding in this \nbill will be very helpful to States and localities in providing swift \nassistance in a timely manner.\n  During our last debate, Mr. President, I offered an amendment \naddressing the need for a structural change in the manner in which the \nFederal Government provides disaster funding. Specifically, the Senate \npassed several amendments I offered to the fiscal year 1996 omnibus \nappropriations bill which provided a mechanism to pay for $1.2 billion \nin disaster funding, called for a long-term funding solution, and \nensured that disaster assistance funds were deficit neutral in the \nfinal conference committee bill.\n  The bill before us today and, specifically, the committee report \nbuild upon several of those amendments debated and passed last year. \nThe committee report addresses concerns with the long-term structure of \nFEMA. The FEMA funding contained in this bill is offset by \ncorresponding spending reductions within the same subcommittee \njurisdiction. The work done by Senator Bond, chairman of the VA/HUD \nAppropriations Subcommittee, and Senator Mikulski, the ranking member, \nadmirably balances the need for FEMA funding with the necessity of \nfinding reductions within the jurisdiction of their subcommittee.\n  Specifically, I would like to cite page 26 of the committee report \nwhich mentions that:\n\n       The Committee notes its continuing concern with the \n     escalating costs of FEMA disaster relief. . . . FEMA \n     acknowledges that the escalation of costs is due not only to \n     the increase in large-scale disasters, but also because the \n     scope of Federal disaster assistance has expanded, the \n     Federal role in response has expanded considerably, and State \n     and local governments are increasingly turning to the Federal \n     government for assistance. . . .\n\n  The report also states that, ``The FEMA Director is committed to \nsubmitting a comprehensive proposal, including proposed legislation, by \nJuly 4, 1997.''\n  Mr. President, I would like Senator Bond to know of my continuing \ninterest in working with him and the subcommittee on structural reform \nof FEMA, and of my anticipation of the report and recommendations from \nFEMA due in a few months. I will be sending him a letter offering my \nassistance, resources, and energies in restructuring the manner in \nwhich we have budgeted and provided relief for natural disasters. \nSenator Bond's statement in the committee report references several \nproposals worth considering. Among those reforms are the development of \nobjective disaster declaration criteria and comprehensive Federal \npolicies to control the Federal costs of disaster assistance, review of \nthe appeals process, elimination of funding for tree and shrubs \nreplacement, elimination of assistance for cultural and decorative \nobjects, elimination of funding for certain revenue-producing \nfacilities such as golf courses and stadiums, and creation of \nincentives for States and local governments to carry insurance to cover \nthe repair and rebuilding of their infrastructure after a disaster.\n\n  There are several other proposals and recommendations that I have \npreviously reviewed and that I hope we would also consider. Those \nproposals would require stringent, written justification by the \nPresident and Congress to designate emergency appropriations; enact a \nrequirement for a three-fifths majority budget point of order for \nemergency supplemental appropriations; identify multi-year spending \ncuts to pay for emergency appropriations and remain within the budget; \nbase annual disaster funding on historic funding levels, permitting \noccasional surpluses; and protect the contingency fund from being \nraided as a funding source for nondisaster projects.\n  Our action today is not without concerns, and I wanted to touch on a \nfew areas of the supplemental appropriation, aside from the issue of \ndisaster assistance. The supplemental appropriation is unfortunately \nriddled with additional spending in a variety of accounts and programs. \nThe majority of these programs are not associated with the Northwest \nand Midwest floods. Rather, this process seems to serve as a vehicle to \nbolster Federal funding for programs that have otherwise operated this \nfiscal year under a very fair and\n\n[[Page S4197]]\n\nwidely supported allocation. The supplemental funding that is not \nassociated with either Federal disaster assistance or support for our \ntroops in Bosnia reverses the work done in both the fiscal year 1996 \nand fiscal year 1997 omnibus appropriations bills. More troubling is \nthe fact that the total amount of funds provided in this bill today is \nnot completely offset with spending reductions and this overall \nsupplemental appropriations package is not deficit neutral. For the \nremainder of this fiscal year, the bill creates excess spending of $467 \nmillion in budget authority and roughly $1 billion in outlays. The \nbudget projection for years 1998 through the year 2002 create an even \nmore troubling scenario.\n  I have been working with Senator Gramm on two amendments to pay for \nboth the 1997 funding shortfall and the imbalance for the remaining \nfiscal years. Those two amendments would make the fiscal year 1997 \nappropriations deficit neutral. The remaining spending obligations \nunder the bill would count against the new budgetary caps established \nunder the recent balanced budget agreement. Both amendments will \nrectify shortfalls in the bill and are in the spirit of how this body \nshould continue to conduct our business--spending must remain deficit \nneutral. Again, Mr. President, the FEMA disaster assistance in this \nbill is offset. The issue with this bill is about additional \ndiscretionary spending versus shortfalls in spending reductions, and \nthe need for this bill to be deficit neutral. I hope that this body \nwill support the amendments.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I speak today on behalf of the thousands \nof citizens of my home State whose homes and businesses were damaged or \ndestroyed by floods and landslides this year. Washington was hit hard \nin late December and early January by unprecedented weather patterns \nthat wreaked havoc across the State and again in the spring by flooding \ncaused by snow melt in the mountains.\n  Freezing rain, snow, strong winds, and rapidly rising temperatures \nwith warm rains led to unprecedented problems across the State. \nMudslides and flooding eroded major roads and bridges, rendering them \nimpassable; small businesses were destroyed by collapsing roofs due to \nheavy snow; and flooding harmed hundreds of homes and businesses. All \nbut 1 of Washington's 39 counties were declared Federal disaster areas.\n  I visited many of the people whose lives and livelihoods were \naffected by the storms. Traveling across the State in February, I \nwitnessed first hand nature's devastating impact. In Kalama, ground \nmovement caused by soggy soil led a natural gas pipeline to rupture and \nexplode, sending flames hundreds of feet into the air and terrifying \nnearby neighborhoods. In Edmonds, heavy, wet snow collapsed the roof of \na marina housing 400 private boats, causing $15 million in damage. \nSeveral homes, roads, and bridges were destroyed by landslides \nthroughout the Seattle area. Tragically, on Bainbridge Island, a family \nof four was killed when a mudslide buried their home in the middle of \nthe night without warning. And in Yakima, Wenatchee, and across eastern \nWashington, farms and farm buildings sustained heavy damage. Apple, \npear, and potato storage houses and dairy farms were destroyed when \nroofs collapsed under heavy snow.\n  Mr. President, when natural disasters touch the lives of so many \npeople, it is the Federal Government's responsibility to offer a \nhelping hand. The bill before the Senate today will do just that. The \n$5.8 billion in disaster relief funded by this legislation will go a \nlong way to help Americans hurt by natural disasters across the Nation \nget back on their feet. Small Business Administration loans will help \nbusiness and homeowners alike with necessary repairs. The Federal \nEmergency Management Agency will provide assistance to both individuals \nand State and local governments to repair private homes and businesses \nand roads and bridges damaged by the storms. And the Corps of Engineers \nwill work to rebuild and strengthen levees and other flood protection \nmeasures to provide our communities better protection from rising \nrivers in the future.\n  On behalf of the people of Washington State, I commend Senator \nStevens for his dedication and diligence in bringing this legislation \nto the floor. His work and the work of my colleagues on the \nAppropriations Committee will ensure that America can recover from a \nparticularly harsh winter and spring. This legislation will help \nmillions of people who had the misfortune to be in the path of mother \nnature. I strongly support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n\n\n                    Dairy Price Reporting Amendment\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am pleased that the supplemental \nappropriations bill will include an amendment that I introduced to \nassist our Nation's dairy farmers. The amendment, which was cosponsored \nby Senators Santorum, Feingold, and Kohl, would require the Secretary \nof Agriculture to collect and disseminate statistically reliable \ninformation from milk manufacturing plants on prices received for bulk \ncheese and would require the Secretary to report to Congress on the \nrate of reporting compliance.\n  Dairy prices set an all-time high in 1996, with an average price of \n$13.38 per hundredweight for the year. The price reached its peak in \nSeptember at $15.37 per hundredweight, then dropped to $14.13 per \nhundredweight in October. The market experienced its largest drop in \nhistory during November, falling to $11.61 per hundredweight, which \nrepresents a 26-percent decline. During this same period, the cost of \ndairy production reached a record high due to a 30- to 50-percent \nincrease in grain costs.\n  On November 22, 1996, I joined with 19 of my Senate and House \ncolleagues in writing to Agriculture Secretary Glickman, urging him to \ntake action to help raise dairy prices. Secretary Glickman responded on \nJanuary 7, 1997, by announcing several short-term actions to stabilize \nmilk prices. While these actions did have a small positive effect in \nincreasing dairy prices, they did not provide adequate relief to our \nNation's dairy farmers.\n  In order to hear the problems that dairy farmers are facing first \nhand, I asked Secretary Glickman to accompany me to northeastern \nPennsylvania, which he did, on February 10. We met a crowd of \napproximately 500 to 750 angry farmers who complained about the \nprecipitous drop in the price of milk.\n  During the course of my analysis of the pricing problem, I had found \nthat the price of milk depends on a number of factors, one of which is \nthe price of cheese. For every 10 cents the price of cheese is raised, \nthe price of milk would be raised by $1 per hundredweight. Then I found \nthat the price of cheese was determined by the National Cheese Exchange \nin Green Bay, WI. At least according to a survey made by the University \nof Wisconsin, there was an issue as to whether the price of cheese \nestablished by the Green Bay exchange was accurate. The authors of the \nreport used a term as tough as manipulation. Whether that is so or not, \nthere was a real question as to whether that price was accurate. \nTherefore, 3 days after the hearing at Keystone College, I introduced a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution with Senators Santorum, Feingold, Kohl, \nJeffords, Leahy, Wellstone, Snowe, Collins, and Grams. The resolution, \nwhich passed by a vote of 83 to 15, stated that the Secretary of \nAgriculture should consider acting immediately to replace the National \nCheese Exchange as a factor to be considered in setting the basic \nformula price for dairy.\n  In my discussions with Secretary Glickman, I found he had the power \nto raise the price of milk unilaterally by establishing a different \nprice of cheese. Therefore, on March 10, I wrote to Secretary Glickman \nand urged him to take immediate action to establish a price floor at \n$13.50/cwt on a temporary, emergency, interim basis until he completes \naction on delinking the National Cheese Exchange from the basic formula \nprice.\n  This subject was aired during the course a special hearing before the \nappropriations subcommittee on March 13. At that time, Secretary \nGlickman said that they had ascertained the identity of 118 people or \nentities who had cheese transactions that could establish a different \nprice of cheese. He told me they had written to the 118 and were having \nproblems getting responses. I suggested it might be faster to telephone \nthose people. Secretary Glickman provided my staff with the list of \npeople, and we telephoned them\n\n[[Page S4198]]\n\nand found, after reaching approximately half of them, that the price of \ncheese was, in fact, 16 cents higher by those individuals than \notherwise. On March 19, I again wrote Secretary Glickman and informed \nhim of the results of my staff's survey, explaining that there is a \n$.164 difference in the price of cheese and the price from the National \nCheese Exchange. This translates to a $1.64 per hundredweight addition \nto the price of milk.\n\n  Moreover, on April 17, I introduced two pieces of legislation to \nrevise our laws so that they better reflect current conditions and \nprovide a fair market for our Nation's dedicated and hard-working \nfarmers. The legislation goes to two points. One is to amend the \nAgriculture Market Transition Act to require the Secretary to use the \nprice of feed grains and other cash expenses in the dairy industry as \nfactors that are used to determine the basic formula for the price of \nmilk and other milk prices regulated by the Secretary. Simply stated, \nthe Government should use what it costs for production to establish the \nprice of milk, so that if farmers are caught with rising prices of feed \nand other rising costs of production, they can have those rising costs \nreflected in the cost of milk.\n  The second piece of legislation would require the Secretary of \nAgriculture to collect and disseminate statistically reliable \ninformation from milk manufacturing plants on prices received for bulk \ncheese and provide the Secretary with the authority to require \nreporting by such manufacturing plants throughout the United States on \nthe prices of cheese, butter, and nonfat dry milk.\n  On Tuesday, May 6, 1997, the Department of Agriculture announced that \nthey were replacing the National Cheese Exchange in Green Bay, WI with \na survey of cheddar cheese manufacturers in the United States in order \nto determine the price of cheese for use in setting the basic formula \nprice for dairy.\n  Currently, the Department of Agriculture is relying on the voluntary \ncompliance of cheese manufacturers to obtain information for their \nnewly announced survey. My amendment requires the Secretary to report \nto Congress 150 days after the date of enactment of this bill the rate \nof reporting compliance by cheese manufacturers. The amendment further \nallows the Secretary to submit legislative recommendations to improve \nthe rate of reporting compliance. The amendment also protects the \npricing information provided to the Secretary of Agriculture. This \ninformation shall be kept confidential, and shall be used only to \nreport general industry price figures which do not identify the \ninformation provided by any individual company.\n  This amendment takes a significant step toward ensuring that our \nNation's dairy farmers receive a fair price for their milk. However, we \nstill have much work ahead of us as the Department of Agriculture and \nCongress work together to reform the entire milk pricing system. I will \ncontinue to work in this area to ensure that the voices of dairy \nfarmers in Pennsylvania and throughout the Nation are heard, and to \nensure that any change in Federal dairy policy is fair and provides the \nnecessary support for our Nation's milk industry.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the Senators will bear with us, I think we will start \na vote at about 20 minutes of 6 o'clock.\n  Let me first take care of the housekeeping problem. I ask unanimous \nconsent after the Senate votes on the question of advancing S. 672 to \nthird reading, it be held at the desk, and that when the Senate \nreceives H.R. 1469, the Fiscal Year 1997 Supplemental Appropriations \nand Rescissions Act from the House, the Senate proceed immediately to \nits consideration, that the text of S. 627 as amended by the Senate be \nadopted as a substitute for the House text, that the House bill as \namended be read for a third time and passed, the Senate insist on its \namendment, request a conference with the House, that the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees, that motions to reconsider the votes \non the preceding action be tabled, and that all the above mentioned \nactions take place without any intervening action or debate.\n  Let me explain. That means in a few minutes we will vote on advancing \nthis bill to third reading. That, in effect, will be the final vote by \nthe Senate on this bill. There are people that asked for a final vote. \nThis is the way to do it. The House has not acted on the bill. We have \ndone this before. It has been cleared with both sides.\n  I repeat my request for unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have a series of matters, here, and then I ask the \nChair to recognize the Senator from Texas, [Mrs. Hutchison] once we \ncomplete these matters. That is the end of the business before the \nSenate. There are some Senators that wish to make statements. I will \ndeal with that in a minute.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 114\n\n  (Purpose: To study the high rate of cancer among children in Dover \n                         Township, New Jersey)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment \nby Senators Conrad, Dorgan, Grams, Wellstone, Daschle, and Johnson. \nThis is an amendment that is strongly supported and promoted by all six \nSenators in the three States devastated by the flooding of the Red \nRiver as well as the Minnesota River. It will increase the funds \navailable in the bill for community development block grants from $100 \nto $500 million from funds offset from FEMA.\n  While I appreciate the $100 million request by the President for CDBG \nfunds, included in the supplemental, it was evident to me as I surveyed \nthe damage in my own State, that $100 million for all 23 States covered \nin this bill, was not enough. Therefore, I am grateful to my \ncolleagues, Senators Bond, Mikulski, Stevens, and Byrd for supporting \nthis additional request, since I am well aware of how difficult it is \nfor the committee to find the needed offsets.\n  I am grateful also to the efforts of Lynn Stauss, the mayor of East \nGrand Forks, MN, who traveled to Washington to communicate the needs of \nhis city to Senate leaders yesterday. Mayor Stauss had particular \nconcerns that the $100 million in the bill, combined with limited FEMA \nfunds, would not be enough to help the flood communities complete the \nmitigation process involved with actually moving homes and businesses \noff the flood plain. It seems reasonable to increase CDBG funding in \nthe bill to allow these devastated communities to start the relocation \nprocess with the certainty they need to sign construction contracts and \nstart the rebuilding before the Minnesota winter complicates that \nprocess. Further, one of FEMA's goals is to move people off the flood \nplain to minimize future flood losses. This funding will facilitate \nthat process.\n  I am pleased that the committee has made a commitment to address our \nfunding needs through the supplemental conference committee as well as \nadditional funding needs in the 1998 appropriations cycle and future \nsupplementals. Since we are still paying for the 1993 floods in \nMinnesota, I am aware that the rebuilding effort is long-term, and I \nappreciate the concern and commitment of my colleagues on the \nAppropriations Committee to help us recover.\n  Again, on behalf of Minnesota flood victims, I thank my colleagues on \nthe committee, and all of my Senate colleagues for their support of \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this does not increase the amount under \nthe bill but transfers money from one account to another to take care \nof the CDBG problem outlined by the Senators from the States of the \ndisaster area in the upper Midwest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 237) was agreed to.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 80\n\n  (Purpose: To provide rules for the issuance of take-reduction plan \n                              regulations)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

On behalf of Senators Snowe, Kerry, Gregg, Collins, \nKennedy, Smith, and Breaux, I send to the desk a revision, a \nmodification of that amendment, and I ask unanimous consent it be \nconsidered in place of the amendment originally offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       Sec.   . Section 101 of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of \n     1972 (16 U.S.C. 1371) is amended by adding at the end thereof \n     the following:\n       ``(d) Good Samaritan Exemption.--It shall not be a \n     violation of this Act to take a marine mammal if--\n       ``(1) such taking is imminently necessary to avoid serious \n     injury, additional injury, or death to a marine mammal \n     entangled in fishing gear or debris;\n       ``(2) reasonable care is taken to ensure the safe release \n     of the marine mammal, taking into consideration the \n     equipment, expertise, and conditions at hand;\n       ``(3) reasonable care is exercised to prevent any further \n     injury to the marine mammal; and\n       ``(4) such taking is reported to the Secretary within 48 \n     hours.''\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, the amendment that I am introducing today \nprovides that the disentanglement of a marine mammal from fishing gear \nor debris does not violate the Marine Mammal Protection Act. This \namendment is co-sponsored by Senators Kerry, Gregg, Collins, Kennedy, \nSmith, and Breaux.\n  I would also like to thank the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Stevens, for his efforts in helping us craft this \namendment. Senator Stevens has been a leader on marine mammal issues \nsince the act was first enacted in 1972, and we value his expertise.\n  As a nation, we have taken great steps toward protecting marine \nmammals. The Marine Mammal Protection Act is an international model for \nminimizing adverse human impacts on marine mammal populations. Under \nthe Act, the term ``take'' means ``to harass, hunt, capture, or kill, \nor attempt to harass, hunt, capture, or kill any marine mammal''. \nTakings are expressly prohibited without an exemption approved by the \nNational Marine Fisheries Service, consistent with the MMPA. The \ntakings language is clear. It is meant to prevent unnecessary injury to \nmarine mammal populations. But unfortunately, as the law currently \nstands, the takings provision could be used to hold liable a person \ninvolved in attempting to rescue a marine mammal from entanglement.\n  Perhaps nowhere else is this problem more critical than in my own \nState of Maine, where NMFS has recently proposed a rule to reduce the \ntakings of large Atlantic whales. Many of the stakeholders who have \nbeen involved in the debate over this rule believe that improved \ndisentanglement of whales is a crucial part of any take reduction plan. \nIn fact, while the NMFS's rule, which is badly flawed, relies heavily \non untested and unproven fishing gear modifications, many knowledgeable \npeople believe that enhanced disentanglement is the most effective \nknown method of reducing serious injury or mortality.\n  However, fishermen and others will be very reluctant to participate \nin disentanglement efforts unless they have an ironclad guarantee that \nthey would not be held liable for a taking. Thus, without a change in \nthe law, the success of disentanglement programs would be severely \nlimited.\n  The Snowe-Kerry amendment provides that change, encouraging fishermen \nand others to help rescue a marine mammal by removing the threat of \nprosecution. And we need the help of our fishermen. The fishing \ncommunity provides our eyes and ears on the sea, working across areas \nfar larger than\n\n[[Page S4200]]\n\nany single agency could hope to monitor. With the participation and \nsupport of fishermen, we can add to our understanding of marine mammal \npopulations and reduce the incidence of serious injury.\n  Mr. President, this amendment enjoys bipartisan support and is not \ncontroversial. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the amendment offered today by Senator \nSnowe and me represents an important and urgently needed step in our \nefforts to protect marine mammals. The provision amends the Marine \nMammal Protection Act [MMPA] to encourage life-saving and well-\nintentioned efforts to free marine mammals from entanglement in fishing \ngear and marine debris.\n  Under existing law, fishermen and others who come to the assistance \nof a marine mammal that has become entangled in fishing lines or debris \ntechnically are in violation of the MMPA's moratorium on the taking, or \nincidental killing, of a marine mammal. This situation is a true \nexample of the old axiom that no good deed goes unpunished. However, \nFederal officials have recognized that while such incidents may violate \nthe letter of the law, they are entirely consistent with the goals and \nobjectives of the MMPA to protect marine mammals and reduce injuries. \nConsequently, the Federal Government has exercised discretion and has \nnever prosecuted individuals for such rescue efforts. This amendment \nsimply codifies the existing practice of allowing good Samaritans to \nfree entangled marine mammals without fear of prosecution under the \nMMPA. I think it is an idea that is long overdue and to which both \nconservationists and fishermen can agree.\n  The MMPA revision authorized by this amendment is particularly \nimportant for our ongoing efforts to forge partnerships with New \nEngland fishermen in the protection of endangered right whales. I know \nthat Massachusetts lobstermen and fishermen are concerned about threats \nto these magnificent whales. This amendment should provide them needed \nreassurances that they will be protected in their efforts to reduce \nwhale entanglement, injuries, and deaths.\n  I recognize that this is just one step in developing a comprehensive \nsolution to the problem of interactions in New England waters between \nendangered whales and fishermen. We still must deal with substantial \nand well-justified concerns raised by New England fishermen about the \neffect of recent court decisions and proposed federal regulations on \ntheir economic well-being and ability to continue to pursue their \ntraditional livelihood as we seek measures to enable the preservation \nand rebuilding of the seriously depleted right whale population.\n  As a New Englander and the ranking member of the Subcommittee on \nOceans and Fisheries, I look forward to working with the distinguished \nchairwoman, Senator Snowe, other members of the New England delegation, \nthe fishing industry, conservation groups, and the Clinton \nadministration to ensure that the final regulations are fair and \nbalanced. Toward that goal, I will convene a meeting in Boston next \nweek with other members of the Massachusetts delegation to hear from \nfishermen, whale conservationists, and the administration. While \nsignificant work remains to be done, I am confident that together we \ncan resolve the current uncertainties and develop a solution that \npreserves both whales and fishermen.\n  Mr. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe amendment offered by my colleague and friend from Maine, Senator \nSnowe.\n  As many of you may know, the Maine lobster industry and many other \nfishing industries along the Atlantic coast have been threatened with \nextinction by a seriously flawed proposal from the National Marine \nFisheries Service. That proposal was designed supposedly to protect the \nendangered right whale and other large whales from getting entangled in \ncommercial fishing gear.\n  Yet few Maine lobstermen have ever seen a right whale, let alone \nentangled one. Records show that about 20 right whales have been \nsighted within 12 miles of the Maine coast in the last quarter-century, \nand only one has become entangled in that period--a whale that, it is \ncritical to note, was released unharmed. Clearly, the proposed rules \naffect Maine in a way that is drastically disproportionate to the \nthreat to right whales in our State.\n  But though entanglements in or near Maine waters are exceedingly \nrare, they do occur more frequently in other waters. And when an \nentanglement does occur, we should make certain that there is in place \na system that encourages the fisherman to do all he can to help that \nwhale. This amendment would remove a significant barrier to that, and \ncreate an environment where a fisherman is more likely to take the \nappropriate steps to help the entangled whale.\n  This amendment would simply protect a fisherman who comes across a \nwhale entangled in fishing gear or debris, reports the entanglement, \nand either begins to disentangle the whale himself or stays with the \nwhale to await help from a trained disentangling team, from being \nprosecuted or fined for doing so.\n  Currently, there is a disincentive for a fisherman to help or even \nreport a whale that has become entangled in fishing gear: the fear of \nbeing held liable if that whale suffers a serious injury or dies as a \nresult of the entanglement. Several large whales are among our most \nendangered species. It seems to me that it is in our best interest--and \nsurely the whale's best interest--to encourage, rather than discourage, \nfishermen to do all they can to protect this species from being \neradicated.\n  This amendment would provide a measure of protection for the \nfisherman who, through no fault of his own, comes across an entangled \nlarge whale. That fisherman could feel confident in reporting the \nentanglement to the appropriate officials, staying with the whale until \na disentanglement team arrived, and helping in the disentanglement, all \nwithout fear of being slapped with a fine when he or she returned to \nshore.\n  We all want to protect whales, particularly right whales, and do all \nwe can to restore this troubled species. The Snowe amendment takes a \nstep in the right direction by specifically permitting a fisherman to \nreport and stay with a whale that is entangled, without fear of \nreprisal. I am pleased to support it and I encourage my colleagues to \ndo the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \n(No. 80), as modifed.\n  The amendment (No. 80), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 175\n\n     (Purpose: Second degree amendment to amendment #161.

Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues, Senator \nStevens, Senator Byrd, Senator Gregg, Senator Hollings, and Senator \nGorton for their assistance and support in addressing this critical \nprogram for salmon fishers in the Pacific Northwest. This amendment \ncontinues to provide disaster relief for salmon fishers through a \nsalmon fishing permit buy-back program. This buy-back program has \nproven to be a tremendously effective way to help fishers and fish.\n  Over the last few years, the State of Washington has implemented a \nsalmon fishing permit buy-back program to address the substantial \nreduction in salmon harvest opportunities that have confronted salmon \nfishers in recent years. In 1994, when stocks crashed as a result of \npoor ocean conditions and other factors, the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, in response to the requests of the \nGovernors of Washington, Oregon, and California, declared a fishery \nresource disaster and provided funding to implement relief programs. \nFunding for these programs was continued in 1995.\n  The three programs implemented were a habitat jobs program, a data \ncollection jobs program, and a salmon fishing permit buy-back program \nin Washington State. These programs provided desperately needed relief \nto fishers devastated by the collapse of fishing opportunities. While \nthe jobs programs continue, the buy-back program, after two-rounds of \nbuy-backs, has run out of funding. However, the fishery resource \ndisaster continues. Poor ocean conditions and habitat losses have \nhammered these salmon stocks. The recent floods in the Pacific \nNorthwest have compounded these problems by washing out natural \nspawning beds, cutting off pristine stream stretches with landslides, \nand destroying hatchery brood stocks.\n  With the shortest and most severely restricted salmon fishing seasons \never proposed for this summer, this buy-back program is needed more \nthan ever. While the previous buy-backs have only addressed the \nColumbia River and Coastal Washington fisheries, this program must be \nexpanded to include Puget Sound fisheries as well. Whatcom and Skagit \nCounty have declared fishery resource disasters as a result of last \nyear's harvest. The gillnetters, reef netters, and purse seiners of the \nSound need relief as well as the gillnetters and trollers on the \nColumbia and the coast.\n  The $7 million for buy-back included in this amendment will provide \nmuch needed assistance to the fishing communities of Washington State. \nThe buy-back program will provide financial help to those who chose to \nbe bought out, reduce competition for those who stay in, and help fish \nby reducing pressure on dwindling fish stocks. I appreciate the support \nof my colleagues.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am pleased that we have been able to \nwork out an agreement that supports the amendment by Senator Murray and \nSenator Gorton. This amendment provides $7 million in emergency \nassistance to deal with the impact on northwest fisheries.\n  Senator Murray has worked tirelessly on this issue. She has refused \nto take no for an answer. These northwest fishermen should know they \nhave a champion here in Washington DC who really understands their \nindustry. I know that from my work on this Appropriations Committee and \nfrom my service on the authorization committee that oversees the \nNational Marine Fisheries Service.\n  There are no free emergencies any more with this crowd. This \nparticular amendment takes advantage of satellite procurement savings \nthat can be achieved because of the particulars of how NOAA reimburses \nNASA. So it is fully offset.\n  I truly appreciate the willingness of our chairman, Senator Stevens, \nand our subcommittee chairman, Senator Gregg, to work out a compromise \nthat allows this assistance move forward.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment makes available $7 \nmillion, with an offset, to take care of the problem regarding the \nsalmon on the Columbia. I ask it be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

EMERGENCY USE OF CHILD CARE FUNDS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, during the period beginning on April 30, 1997 and ending \n     on July 30, 1997, the Governors of the States described in \n     paragraph (1) of subsection (b) may, subject to subsection \n     (c), use amounts received for the provision of child care \n     assistance or services under the Child Care and Development \n     Block Grant Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 9801 et seq.) and under \n     part A of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 \n     et seq.) to provide emergency child care services to \n     individuals described in paragraph (2) of subsection (b).\n       (b) Eligibility.--\n       (1) Of states.--A State described in this paragraph is a \n     State in which the President, pursuant to section 401 of the \n     Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 5121), has determined that a major disaster \n     exists, or that an area within the State is determined to be \n     eligible for disaster relief under other Federal law by \n     reason of damage related to flooding in 1997.\n       (2) Of individuals.--An individual described in this \n     subsection is an individual who--\n       (A) resides within any area in which the President, \n     pursuant to section 401 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster \n     Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121), has \n     determined that a major disaster exists, or within an area \n     determined to be eligible for disaster relief under other \n     Federal law by reason of damage related to flooding in 1997; \n     and\n       (B) is involved in unpaid work activities (including the \n     cleaning, repair, restoration, and rebuilding of homes, \n     businesses, and schools) resulting from the flood emergency \n     described in subparagraph (A).\n       (c) Limitations.--\n       (1) Requirements.--With respect to assistance provided to \n     individuals under this section, the quality, certification \n     and licensure, health and safety, nondiscrimination, and \n     other requirements applicable under the Federal programs \n     referred to in subsection (a) shall apply to child care \n     provided or obtained under this section.\n       92) Amount of funds.--The total amount utilized by each of \n     the States under subsection (a) during the period referred to \n     in such subsection shall not exceed the total amount of such \n     assistance that, notwithstanding the enactment of this \n     section, would otherwise have been expended by each such \n     State in the affected region during such period.\n       (d) Priority.--In making assistance available under this \n     section, the Governors described in subsection (a) shall give \n     priority to eligible individuals who do not have access to \n     income, assets, or resources as a direct result of the \n     flooding referred to in subsection (b)(2)(A).\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment makes available certain \nchild care funds to assist the residents of areas affected by the \nflooding of the Red River of the North and other areas flooding in the \narea. It has been cleared on both sides. I ask it be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 151) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield to the \nSenator from New Jersey for such time as he needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska [Mr. \nStevens]; the Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords]; and the Senator from \nMassachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for their assistance in what is, for the \nState of New Jersey, a very important matter.\n  Mr. President, while the people of the Dakotas were realizing an \nextraordinary emergency of massive proportions, which the entire Nation \nwas witnessing, the people of Ocean County, NJ, were witnessing an \nequally devastating, though not nearly so noticed, tragedy in their \nlives. Extraordinarily high rates of childhood cancer, brain cancers, \nand neurological cancers were occurring in only a few individual \ncommunities in Ocean County, NJ.\n  I am extremely proud that the Department of Health of the State of \nNew Jersey and, in the Federal Government, the Centers for Disease \nControl responded immediately in undertaking studies to find possible \nenvironmental causes for these high rates of cancer. Today, with the \nhelp of Senators Bond, Stevens, Kennedy, and Jeffords, we are \nresponding in this emergency supplemental appropriations bill. We are \nauthorizing the continuation of the study to try to find the reasons \nfor these childhood cancers.\n  I am very grateful for this Federal response. This legislation \nassures that these studies will continue to their conclusion, possibly, \nand hopefully finding the reasons for these tragedies. For this, I am \nvery grateful to my colleagues, Mr. President. I wanted to express my \nthanks.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield a minute to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, as we know, the eyes of thousands of \nresidents of Minnesota and North Dakota and South Dakota have been \nwatching this debate today. I want to thank the chairman, Senator \nStevens of Alaska, and all the others who have worked on this, like my \ncolleague from Minnesota and the Senators from the Dakotas, for helping \nto provide flexible funding for the flooding disaster that ravaged our \nState and the Dakotas. We look to our colleagues in the House now to \nensure that this additional money and community development block \ngrants are preserved and the dollars make it into the hands of those \nwho need it in these communities.\n  I wanted to take a moment to say thank you very much, Mr. President, \nfor all their hard work and for all the hard work on the floor. I know \nthe eyes and ears of Minnesotans and South Dakota and North Dakota \nresidents have been watching and they thank you as well.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                              section 417\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, as Chairman Bond knows, last week I \ndiscussed the impact of recent floods along the Red River Valley on \neducation communities in North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota, \nspecifically on local school districts that have enrolled displaced \nstudents from the Grand Forks and other communities. I mentioned that \n11,000 elementary and secondary students from Grand Forks, ND, were \ndisplaced and attending class in more than 30 school districts across \nthe State. More than 20,000 students are displaced in Minnesota.\n  At the time, I outlined the concerns of local school districts who \nwere hit with unanticipated educational operating expenses as a result \nof enrolling displaced students in communities surrounding Grand Forks. \nAfter discussing the availability of emergency assistance with \nofficials of the Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA], I was \nadvised that while FEMA had authority to assist communities with the \nrepair of educational facilities, the agency did not have authority \nunder section 403, Essential Assistance, to assist a local district \nwith emergency education operating expenses, for example, additional \nstaffing, instructional materials.\n  In response to the concerns expressed by the North Dakota Department \nof Public Instruction, and local school districts, I introduced \nlegislation on May 1, 1997, to authorize FEMA under section 403 to \nprovide emergency education operations assistance to elementary and \nsecondary schools.\n  Since the introduction of this legislation, I have been informed by \nFEMA officials, that following a review of authorized programs, FEMA \nwill use authority under section 417, Community Disaster Loans, to \nprovide a local school district with emergency education operating \nexpenses. Under the Community Disaster Loans Program, the President is \nauthorized to make loans to a local government agency which has \nsuffered substantial loss of tax and other revenues as a result of a \nmajor disaster.\n  Mr. President, I know the chairman has been very understanding of the \nconcerns of local school districts in the Upper Midwest, and have been \nworking to respond to the concerns of local North Dakota communities. \nAs you have been involved in discussions with FEMA officials regarding \nthese emergency disaster funds, is it your understanding that FEMA may \nexercise existing authority under section 417 to provide funds for \nunanticipated emergency education operating needs of local school \ndistricts? These funds would be used to provide services for displaced \nstudents including emergency staffing and instructional materials.\n  Mr. BOND. Section 417 authorizes loans to local governments to carry \non existing local government functions of a municipal operation \ncharacter or to expand such functions to meet disaster-related needs. \nMy understanding is that this would include emergency education \noperating needs.\n\n[[Page S4203]]\n\n                     emergency drinking water needs\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would like to engage my colleagues on the Senate \nAgriculture Appropriations Subcommittee in a colloquy.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I would be happy to engage in a colloquy with my \ncolleague from South Dakota.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I am pleased to do so, as well.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. As a result of the flooding and the extremely high water \nlevels on Lake Oahe this year, its banks are sloughing, causing the \nintake pipes for the Gettysburg drinking water system to crack and \nbreak, endangering the water supply for the city.\n  The best solution to this problem is to connect the city to the Mid-\nDakota Rural Water System. The city is scheduled to be connected to the \nMid-Dakota RWS in 1998 or 1999, at a cost of $1.5 million. If this \nmoney were made available this year, we could ensure that the residents \nof Gettysburg will have a safe stable supply of drinking water, despite \nthese flooding-related problems.\n  It is my understanding that the Appropriations Committee has provided \n$6.5 million in the emergency supplemental spending bill for the Rural \nUtilities Service to address problems such as this. I very much \nappreciate the committee's willingness to add these funds to the bill. \nIt is my hope and expectation that some of those funds could be used to \nhelp Gettysburg connect to the Mid-Dakota project this year.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. It is my expectation that the funds that were included \nfor the Rural Utilities Service in the emergency funding bill will be \nused for a variety of disaster-related purposes, including providing \nassistance to communities, such as Gettysburg, to address emergency \ndrinking water needs. It appears to me, based on your description of \nthe problem, that the city of Gettysburg could qualify for some of \nthese funds.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. That is my understanding as well. Addressing the \nemergency drinking water needs of rural communities is one of the \npurposes of this funding.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from Texas seeks to offer an amendment.\n  How much time does the Senator want?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] for herself and Mr. \n     Gramm proposes an amendment numbered 62.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . ENROLLMENT FLEXIBILITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, any State plan (including any subsequent technical, \n     clerical, and clarifying corrections submitted by the State) \n     relating to the integration of eligibility determinations and \n     enrollment procedures for Federally-funded public health and \n     human services programs administered by the Department of \n     Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture \n     through the use of automated data processing equipment or \n     services which was submitted by a State to the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services and to the Secretary of Agriculture \n     prior to October 18, 1996, and which provides for a request \n     for offers described in subsection (b), is deemed approved \n     and is eligible for Federal financial participation in \n     accordance with the provisions of law applicable to the \n     procurement, development, and operation of such equipment or \n     services.\n       (b) Request For Offers Described.--A request for offers \n     described in this subsection is a public solicitation for \n     proposals to integrate the eligibility determination \n     functions for various Federally and State funded programs \n     within a State that utilize financial and categorical \n     eligibility criteria through the development and operation of \n     automated data processing systems and services.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, 6 months ago, the State of Texas \nstarted the process of asking for a request for offers, permission from \nthe Federal Government to consolidate services in its welfare system. \nIt would allow a welfare recipient to come into one place to get AFDC, \nfood stamps, Medicaid, or disaster assistance. It would allow the State \nof Texas to run its own welfare system. Now, Mr. President, that is \nexactly what Congress asked the States to do. We said we are going to \ngive you block grants, we want you to be more efficient, we want you to \nsave money. The State of Texas is complying. In fact, Mr. President, \nMassachusetts is doing much the same as the State of Texas is now \ntrying to do. Wisconsin is doing it, and Arizona is looking at it. It \nreally is the beginning of what we have asked the States to do, and \nthat is to become more efficient and do a better job for the recipients \nof welfare.\n  The State of Texas has been waiting for 6 months and has gotten no \nanswer from this administration. My amendment would grant the request \nfor offers that Texas has put forward so that they can, in fact, \nconsolidate their services and go out for bids to do it more \nefficiently.\n  Our Governor has said he believes the State of Texas is losing $10 \nmillion a month while this request is pending. There is precedent in \nCongress to grant waivers such as this. Washington State and New York \nState were granted child support waivers.\n  Mr. President, Congress has spoken. We have asked the States to do a \njob. The State of Texas is trying to comply, and others States are \nfollowing along, and I am sorry to say that this administration is \nimpeding the progress. They are thwarting the will of Congress. Mr. \nPresident, we must take action. We must take action so that the will of \nCongress can be done, which is to save welfare dollars and give the \nbest service possible to welfare recipients. The will of Congress must \ngo forward. I hope the President is not playing a game with the State \nof Texas. I hope the President is not waiting until this bill is \nfinished and on his desk to turn down this request, because, in fact, \nTexas has met all of the requirements of the Federal Government.\n  I have spoken to Secretary Donna Shalala about this, and I have \ntalked to other people in the White House. I have done everything I can \ndo to speed up this process. My colleague, Senator Gramm, who \ncosponsors this amendment, has also made the calls and written the \nletters to ask that this request be granted.\n  Mr. President, this is the wave of the future. Texas is trying to \nsave the taxpayer dollars of our States and, at the same time, save the \ntaxpayer dollars of all Americans. This will not cost anything; this \nwill save money. I know that everyone is ready to vote on this bill. It \nis very important to my State that we grant this request for offers so \nthat Texas can fulfill its mission, which is to give the best service \nin the most efficient way, and that is exactly what we asked them to \ndo.\n  I urge adoption of my amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Is the pending \namendment germane?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In the opinion of the Chair, the amendment is \nnot germane.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I make a point of order that the \namendment is not in order because it is not germane post-cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will not appeal the ruling of the \nChair, but I believe that Congress has to step up to the line and do \nwhat is right by the States. We have asked them to do more; they are \ntrying to comply. Texas will not be the last one to come forward. I am \ngoing to pursue this legislatively if the President of the United \nStates does not grant this request for offers, which meets all of the \nstandards Congress has put forward. I will be back, Senator Gramm will \nbe back, and there will be other States that will be affected by this. \nI hope that the Senate will be able to help us when we are able to put \na germane amendment on a bill. Thank you.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Texas, we \nwill be ready for debate, and it will be a substantive debate.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to thank the \nfloor staff, particularly the Parliamentarian, the people who really \nrepresent the Senate. The public sees them and\n\n[[Page S4204]]\n\nhardly knows who they are, unfortunately, because we don't address each \nother by name on the floor.\n  We had 109 first-degree amendments and 75 second-degree amendments. \nWe have handled a series of other amendments that were not presented, \nbut we have done it by unanimous consent. We have gone through this \nbill. It is a disaster bill of monstrous proportions, and it is very \nvitally needed.\n  Unfortunately, we cannot pass it yet because of the tradition of the \nSenate awaiting passage by the House of appropriations bills. It is a \ntradition that we have honored and I seek to honor it again now.\n  I thank all of those who have helped us.\n  I want to put in the Record at this point the names of the people who \nhave been on the staff of the Appropriations Committee on both sides, \nwho worked on this bill and enabled us to get where we are now.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n [Names of Majority Staff in roman; Names of Minority Staff in italics]\n\n       Staff Director, Steven J.

Mr. President, before the vote, I yield to my friend \nfrom West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will be brief. This is the first \nappropriations bill that Senator Stevens has managed since he assumed \nthe chairmanship of the committee. On behalf of all Senators, I want to \ncongratulate him on the skill and expertise which he has demonstrated \nin the handling of this bill. It is a complex and difficult bill. It is \nan exceedingly important bill. Although I shall vote against it for \nother reasons, I feel it incumbent upon me, especially, to call \nattention to his excellent management of this bill. I would have \nexpected that out of him, as I have watched him over the years. He is \nan outstanding member of the Appropriations Committee and takes his \nresponsibilities very seriously there. As always, he is so gentlemanly \nand considerate of the needs of other Senators with respect to their \nrepresentations of their respective States. I thank him for his \ndedication and, once again, I salute him and congratulate him on the \nfine example he has shown. It is an example which I hope we all will \nattempt to emulate.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The words of the Senator are very kind. If I have any \nability to work on the floor, it is because I have watched masters work \nbefore me.\n  I ask for the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the motion offered by the \nSenator from Alaska that the bill be read the third time.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 78, nays 22, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 63 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--78\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Shelby\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--22\n\n     Byrd\n     Dodd\n     Durbin\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Helms\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Nickles\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Sessions\n     Smith (NH)\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, in \nlight of this vote on the supplemental appropriations bill, there will \nbe no further votes this evening.\n  The Senate will be in session tomorrow for general debate on the \ncomptime-flextime bill. However, no votes will occur during Friday's \nsession of the Senate.\n  The Senate will be in session on Monday to consider the IDEA, the \nindividual disabilities education bill, hopefully, under a time \nagreement that we are still working on. I urge that all my colleagues \nagree to be brief on the time agreement that we can reach so that we \ncan complete this very important legislation that has very broad based \nbipartisan support. If that agreement can be reached, any votes ordered \nthen will be stacked on Tuesday at the request of a number of Senators. \nI fear that if the Senate cannot consider this bill on Monday, that \nevents then will cause--because of the budget and other bills that we \ndo have to consider, including the Chemical Forces in Europe Treaty, it \nwould be pushed off until after the Memorial Day recess and everybody \nwould like to get the IDEA bill done.\n  On Tuesday, the Senate will begin formal consideration of the \nflextime-comptime bill.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  I now ask unanimous consent that we begin consideration of S. 4 at 10 \na.m. on Tuesday, May 13.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank my colleagues for their cooperation. I now ask \nthere be a period for the transaction--Mr. President I withhold.\n  Does the Senator have further business?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have other business on this bill, if I may.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will withhold that request at this time, and I yield the \nfloor for the time being, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/08/senate-section/article/S4137-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S4205]]\n\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 239\n\n   (Purpose: To provide relief to agricultural producers who granted \neasements to, or owned or operated land condemned by, the Secretary of \nthe Army for flooding losses caused by water retention at the dam site \nat Lake Redrock, Iowa, to the extent that the actual losses exceed the \n                      estimates of the Secretary)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I would like to report to the Senate that \nthe Committee on Rules and Administration is about to embark on a \nbipartisan investigation into allegations that fraud, irregularities, \nand other errors, affected the outcome of the 1996 election for U.S. \nSenator from Louisiana--the first such Senate investigation into vote \nfraud since the early 1950's.\n  A review of the basis for this investigation and the developments to \ndate is an obligation I have as chairman.\n  On November 5, 1996, Ms. Mary Landrieu and Mr. Louis ``Woody'' \nJenkins competed in a very close election in which Ms. Landrieu was \ndeclared the victor by Louisiana State officials, by a margin of 5,788 \nvotes out of approximately 1.7 million total votes cast. This margin \nrepresented a percentage difference of only 0.34 percent, one of the \nclosest contested elections in U.S. Senate history.\n  On December 5, 1996, Mr. Jenkins filed a petition with the U.S. \nSenate asking that the election be overturned because of vote fraud and \nirregularities which he believed affected the outcome of the election. \nAlong with an amended petition, Mr. Jenkins filed supporting evidence \nwith the Senate on December 17.\n  Senator Landrieu filed a response to the petition on January 17, \n1997. On February 7, 1997, Mr. Jenkins then submitted an answer to \nSenator Landrieu's filing.\n  In accordance with Senate precedent, Ms. Landrieu was seated \n``without prejudice'' as the Senator from Louisiana on January 7, 1997, \nwith all of the privileges and authority of a U.S. Senator. Majority \nLeader Lott quoted former Majority Leader Robert Taft in defining the \nterm ``without prejudice'' when Senator Lott spoke on the floor on \nJanuary 7:\n\n       [T]he oath is taken without prejudice to the right of \n     anyone contesting the seat to proceed with the contest and \n     without prejudice to the right of anyone protesting or asking \n     expulsion from the Senate to proceed.\n\n  The U.S. Constitution provides that the Senate is--and I quote from \narticle I, section 5--``the Judge of the Elections, Returns, and \nQualifications of its own Members. * * *'' The U.S. Supreme Court has \nreviewed this Constitutional provision on several occasions and held in \nthe 1928 case of Reed et al. v. The County Comm'rs of Delaware County, \nPenn. [277 U.S. 376, 388 (1928)]:\n\n       [The Senate] is the judge of elections, returns and \n     qualifications of its members. . . It is fully empowered, and \n     may determine such matters without the aid of the House of \n     Representatives or the Executive or Judicial Department.\n\n  In discussing the responsibilities of the Senate, Senator Robert C. \nByrd, who has been a member of the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration since 1963, stated on the floor of the Senate on January \n15, 1975, as part of the debate on the New Hampshire contested \nelection:\n\n       . . . The Constitution of the United States places in this \n     body the responsibility of being the sole judge of the \n     elections, returns, and qualifications of its own members. \n     Article 1, section 5, does not say that the Senate may be the \n     judge; it says the Senate shall be the judge.\n\n[[Page S4206]]\n\n       . . . The Constitution vested in this body not only the \n     power but the duty to judge, when there is a challenged \n     election result involving the office of U.S. Senator. \n     [Congressional Record Vol. 121, Part 1, page 440. (emphases \n     added).]\n\n  And indeed, the Senate has taken this constitutional responsibility \nvery seriously, handling approximately 100 contested cases over its \n208-year history. Under the current Senate Rules, responsibility for \ndeveloping the facts and recommendations for the full Senate in \ncontested elections lies with the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n  Following the precedent of the Huffington versus Feinstein contest in \n1995, I and ranking member, Mr. Ford, retained two outside counsel who \nare experts in the field of election law: Mr. William C. Canfield III, \nand Mr. Robert F. Bauer. These are the same two attorneys who assisted \nthe committee in the Huffington contest.\n  Senator Ford and I requested that these experts review the pleadings \nand provided the following guidance:\n\n       We request a written analysis of the sufficiency of the \n     petition, based on the precedents and rules of the Senate, \n     with specific reference to any documentation submitted by Mr. \n     Jenkins or Ms. Landrieu relevant to the petition. The opinion \n     should focus on the question of whether the petition is \n     subject to dismissal without further review, or requires \n     additional review or investigation, and, if so, the scope and \n     structure of such review or investigation.\n\n  On April 8, 1997, these two counsel submitted a joint report which, \nin summary, recommended that the committee conduct ``a preliminary, \nlimited investigation into the sufficiency of claims in three areas, \nand the dismissal of claims in four areas.'' The areas counsel \nrecommended further review of were: vote buying, multiple voting, and \nfraudulent registration.\n  Mr. Canfield and Mr. Bauer then appeared before the committee, in \nopen session, on April 10 to describe their review and recommendations, \nand to answer questions from the members of the Rules Committee.\n  On April 15, 1997, again in open session, Mr. Jenkins and attorneys \nfor Senator Landrieu made presentations to the committee which laid out \ntheir respective views of the contest, the allegations made and \nevidence presented, and the standards of pleading and proof required to \nwarrant further committee action.\n  As I stated at those hearings, I believe the counsel's report is a \nvaluable contribution to the committee's evaluation of the contest. \nNevertheless, it is important to remember that these lawyers were not \nasked to conduct an investigation, and they did not do so. Rather, they \nreviewed and analyzed only the petition and facts submitted by both Mr. \nJenkins and Senator Landrieu.\n  When the committee met on April 17, 1997, to determine a further \ncourse of action, I advised my colleagues that I agreed with our \ncounsel that an investigation was warranted. Indeed, I believed that \nSenate precedent dictated that an investigation be conducted. It was \nalso my opinion that the committee's investigation should:\n  First, not be limited to specific areas which might preclude \ninvestigation of other potential sources of evidence; and\n  Second, should involve the use of attorneys with investigative \nexperience to conduct an initial investigation in Louisiana within \napproximately a 45-day period.\n  In furtherance of these objectives, the committee met on April 17, \nand I offered a committee motion to authorize such an investigation. \nAfter several amendments, the committee authorized the chairman, in \nconsultation with the ranking member to conduct an investigation,\n\n       * * * into illegal or improper activities to determine the \n     existence or absence of a body of fact that would justify the \n     Senate in making the determination that fraud, irregularities \n     or other errors, in the aggregate, affected the outcome of \n     the election for United States Senator in the State of \n     Louisiana in 1996.\n\n  Since the committee hearing of April 17, I have worked with Senator \nFord toward jointly selecting--as required by 2 U.S.C. 72a(I)(3)--the \nconsultants that would assist the committee in the conduct of its \ninvestigation. The contracts hiring these consultants were signed by me \nand Senator Ford on May 7.\n  The investigative team will be headed by Richard Cullen, a former \nU.S. Attorney in Virginia, and George Terwilliger, also a former U.S. \nAttorney and later Deputy Attorney General of the United States, both \nwith Republican affiliations, of the law firm McGuire Woods Battle & \nBoothe. They will be assisted by several of their firm's colleagues, \nincluding Jim Dyke, former top official for Vice President Walter \nMondale and Gov. Doug Wilder, Bill Broddaus, former Democratic Attorney \nGeneral of Virginia, and Frank Atkinson, former counsel to Gov. George \nAllen, comprising a well-experienced, bipartisan team who will take \ndirection from me.\n  Participating fully in the investigation--pursuant to a protocol \nestablishing the basic procedures under which all counsel will conduct \nthe investigation--will be a second team of attorneys selected by \nSenator Ford and headed by Robert Bauer and John Hume of the law firm \nPerkins Coie, with Democrat affiliations.\n  This protocol, which was jointly drafted by the two teams, includes \nprocedures for subpoenaing witnesses and documents, and conducting \ninterviews and taking depositions. It establishes confidentiality \nprocedures to protect the integrity of the investigation.\n  As Senator Ford and I worked toward the selection of our consultants \nand a joint investigation, I also spoke with the Governor of Louisiana, \nMike Foster, who has assured the fullest cooperation with the Senate's \ninvestigation. And, committee staff is coordinating with the Federal \nBureau of Investigation and the General Accounting Office seeking a \ndetail of personnel to assist the committee.\n  The Senate's investigation in Louisiana is about to begin. Records \nwill shortly be requested from the State, and the teams of counsel will \ngo down to Louisiana next week to establish a local headquarters and \nmake initial coordination with appropriate State and local officials, \nand prepare for witness interviews.\n  Mr. President, in the course of one's career as a Senator there are \nresponsibilities you must perform. I did not seek this task, but I will \ntruly and faithfully discharge a duty I have been given as chairman of \nthe Rules Committee.\n  I have but one goal: to see that my work is performed in keeping with \nthe tradition of the Senate in past cases and to give the full \nCommittee my honest judgement of the established facts, and so that the \nCommittee might give to the Senate its honest judgement of these facts, \nrespecting the Senate's duty under article 1, Section 5 of the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  It is my intention that this investigation will determine the \nexistence, or absence, of that body of credible fact that would justify \nthe Senate in making a determination that fraud or irregularities or \nother errors, in the aggregate, did or did not, affect the outcome of \nthe 1996 election for U.S. Senator in the State of Louisiana--thereby \nfulling the Senate's constitutional duty of judging the results of that \nelection.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/08/senate-section/article/S4205-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4206-S4207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              COMMENDING GIRL SCOUT GOLD AWARD RECIPIENTS\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I want to draw special attention today to \nfive young women from northern Kentucky. These five young women from \nthe Licking Valley Girl Scout Council are recipients of the Girl Scout \nGold Award--the highest achievement a Girl Scout can earn. Each one has \ndemonstrated outstanding achievements in the area of leadership, \ncommunity service, career planning, and personal development.\n  Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. serves over 3.5 million girls and has \nawarded more than 20,000 Girl Scout Gold Awards to Senior Girl Scouts \nsince the inception of the program in 1980. Recipients of the award \nhave not only earned patches for the Senior Girl Scout Leadership \nAward, the Senior Girl Scout Challenge, and the Career Exploration Pin, \nbut also designed and implemented a Girl Scout Gold Award project.\n  But perhaps most important, these five Gold Award recipients have \nmade a commitment to community that should not go unrecognized.\n  Kelly Buten, Mary Jane Hendrickson, Alyssa Hensley, Mandy Radle, and \nBecky Thomas have put an extraordinary amount of work into earning\n\n[[Page S4207]]\n\nthese awards, and in the process have received the community's and the \nCommonwealth's respect and admiration for their dedication and \ncommitment. Their projects included teaching beginning violin classes \nto local elementary school children, organizing a fundraising breakfast \nfor local elementary schools and holding a children's Christmas party.\n  For 85 years, the Girl Scouts have provided an informal educational \nprogram to inspire girls with the highest ideals of character, conduct, \npatriotism, and service so they will become resourceful, responsible \ncitizens. The Licking Valley Girl Scouts alone serve over 5,000 girl \nand adult members.\n  Mr. President, I know my colleagues share my enthusiasm and \nadmiration for the Girl Scouts' commitment to excellence. And, I know \nyou will agree with my belief that this award is just the beginning of \na long list of accomplishments and successes from these five Girl \nScouts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/08/senate-section/article/S4206-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4207-S4209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              AMERICAN INTERESTS IN THE CASPIAN SEA REGION\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, American involvement and interests in the \nCaspian Sea Region, have been increasing recently. While this region is \nnew on the political map of American policy-makers, in that the newly-\nsovereign nations there were formerly Republics under the rule of the \nSoviet Union, they represent very substantial new opportunities for the \nUnited States.\n  From the point of view of energy reserves, the tremendous hydrocarbon \nresources which are available for development in the region are of \nworld-class potential. The extent of the resources which apparently \nexist, particularly in Kazakstan, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan could \nwell serve as a long-term alternative to Western dependence on \nvulnerable supplies of Persian gulf oil. The proper development of the \nenergy resources of the Caspian Sea region should also provide an \ninvaluable impetus to the economic development of all the nations of \nthe region. As a result of this growing potential, the Foreign \nOperations Appropriations Act for FY 1997 included a provision that I \nproposed for the Administration to develop a plan of action for the \nUnited States government to assist and accelerate the earliest possible \ndevelopment and shipment of oil from the Caspian Sea region to the \nUnited States and other Western markets.\n  Mr. President, the Secretary of State has forwarded to the Congress, \non April 15, 1997, the study which was required by the Appropriations \nCommittee, and I am pleased to include the Summary, as well as \nrecommended legislative and executive actions proposed by the report. \nIt is a good report and should be of assistance to the Congress as it \ndeliberates how to provide incentives for the United States to help \npromote the development of this new source of Western energy supplies, \nand to promote the future stability of the nations of the Caspian \nregion, which is so necessary in order that our companies can operate \neffectively with the governments of those nations in developing these \nenergy resources.\n  Mr. President, the full report is available from the Department of \nState, which originated it. I would, however, like to point out that \nthe interagency group which developed the recommendations puts great \nemphasis on the need for the Congress to review the prohibition on \ndirect bilateral assistance to Azerbaijan which is contained in Section \n907 of the Freedom Support Act. The report indicates that Section 907 \nhas the effect of limiting the influence of the United States in \nAzerbaijan, including the ability of the United States government to \n``provide financial support, such as risk insurance and grants for \npipeline studies, to companies that are involved with the Azerbaijani \ngovernment,'' thereby giving advantage to other governments who have no \nsuch limitations placed on their ability to assist their companies in \nthe competition for access and opportunities in Azerbaijan. Revisiting \nthe necessity of retaining, revising, or eliminating Section 907, would \nallow our institutions, such as the Trade and Development Agency, the \nDepartment of Commerce's Foreign Commercial Service, and the Overseas \nPrivate Investment Corporation, to assist U.S. companies to compete \nagainst foreign corporations, which presently enjoy the support of \ntheir own governments in the competition for business and opportunities \nin Azerbaijan. The report also encourages high-level political and \nbusiness visits to and from the region, and in this regard I would \nencourage the President to invite the President of Azerbaijan, Mr. \nHeydar Aliyev, to make an official visit to Washington. Furthermore, \nthe report encourages the United States to continue to play a mediation \nrole among the countries of the Caspian region, when they are involved \nin disputes. This is particularly important today with regard to the \ndispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which has inhibited joint \ndevelopment of energy and other projects, and has caused the \ndislocation and suffering of up to a million refugees in the region. As \nthe report concludes, from a U.S. policy standpoint, ``Caspian energy \ndevelopment is not a zero sum game--all can benefit from the region's \nrapid economic development, including Russia.''\n\n  Mr. President, the Senate will soon be taking up the Treaty on \nConventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Revisions of the Flank \nAgreement. I find it disturbing that some of the governments most \ndirectly affected by this agreement, particularly the governments of \nGeorgia, the Ukraine, and Azerbaijan have refused to sign the \nagreement. I have received a letter from the ambassador from Azerbaijan \non May 5, 1997, Mr. Hafiz Pashayev, in which he expresses his concern \nover what he describes as an imbalance of forces in the flank area, \nwhich includes his country, and says that the agreement poses a \nsecurity concern for Azerbaijan. In this regard, he points out that \nthere are credible reports of the provision of massive Russian arms \nshipments to Armenia, which could well have the effect of further \ndestabilizing the situation in the caucasus. It is important to note \nthat the chairman of the Defense Committee of the Duma, the lower house \nof the Russian parliament, Mr. Lev Rokhlin, is reported, by Russian \nnewspaper Nezavisimaya gazeta, to have revealed that elements of the \nRussian government or armed forces, from 1993-96, shipped some $1 \nbillion in arms to Armenia, including 32 R-17's, or Scud missiles and \nassociated launchers, 82 T-72 tanks, 50 armored combat vehicles, \nvarious howitzers, grenade launchers, and other missiles and armaments. \nThis, of course, has alarmed American oil companies located within \nrange of these missiles in Azerbaijan, and the ambassador says in his \nletter that there is concern in his country that these military \nshipments have caused an imbalance in forces in the so-called ``flank'' \narea, and pose a ``security concern for Azerbaijan.''\n  The Russian Government, or elements of it, appears to have used its \narmed forces in recent years in Georgia, in Azerbaijan, certainly in \nChechnya, and perhaps other states in the region to exert influence and \npressure on those governments. I note that Russia has maintained \nmilitary bases in both Georgia and Armenia, and I have been informed \nthat Russian officials have brought pressure on the government of \nAzerbaijan to allow Russian forces to establish a base in that nation. \nThe government of Azerbaijan has, wisely I believe, resisted these \npressures and retains its sovereignty without the presence of Russian \nforces on its soil. Administration officials testified last week, on \nApril 29, 1997, before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in \nconnection with the CFE Flank agreement, and have pointed out that it \nis the policy of the United States not to support the stationing of \nforeign troops such as Russian forces on the territory of any other \nstates unless that is achieved by means of free negotiations and with \nfull respect for the sovereignty of the states involved. We need to be \ncareful that we do not in any way appear to countenance the imposition \nof Russian forces or equipment on any nation through heavy-handed \ntactics, tactics which might push the states of the Caspian region into \npositions that they would not otherwise freely assent to. Thus, it is \ncertainly of legitimate concern that key states of the Caspian region \nhave not agreed to the terms of the terms of the revisions of the CFE \nTreaty. This is a matter which I am sure the knowledgeable Senators on \nthe Foreign Relations Committee will be discussing when that Treaty \ncomes to the Senate floor\n\n[[Page S4208]]\n\nfor consideration, and I look forward to that discussion.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the Ambassador from \nAzerbaijan and the letter of transmittal with the accompanying report \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    Embassy of the\n\n\n                                       Republic of Azerbaijan,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 5, 1997.\n     Hon. Robert Byrd,\n     U.S. Senate\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: During Senate consideration of the CFE \n     Treaty, I hope, members of the Senate will address concerns \n     of the Government of Azerbaijan regarding this Treaty.\n       Specifically we are concerned about of an imbalance forces \n     in ``flank'' area, which could pose security concern for \n     Azerbaijan.\n       I would also remind you about the one billion an illegal \n     arms shipments from unofficial sources in Russia to Armenia, \n     which has already created a strategic imbalance for my \n     country.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Hafiz M. Pashayev,\n     Ambassador.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     U.S. Department of State,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 15, 1997.\n     Hon. Robert Byrd,\n     Committee on Appropriations,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: On behalf of the Secretary of State, I \n     am transmitting to you a report as requested by the Joint \n     Explanatory Statement of the Committee of Conference \n     accompanying the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and \n     Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1997, as enacted in P.L. \n     104-208, that contains a plan for action for the United \n     States Government to assist and accelerate the earliest \n     possible development and shipment of oil from the Caspian Sea \n     region to the United States and other Western markets.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have questions \n     on this issue or on any other matter.\n       Enclosure: Report on the Caspian Region Energy Development.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Barbara Larkin,\n\n                                              Assistant Secretary,\n                                              Legislative Affairs.\n\n   Caspian Region Energy Development Report, As Required By H.R. 3610\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       This report to congress addresses the request of the FY 97 \n     statement of managers accompanying the FY 97 Foreign \n     Operations bill as incorporated in Public Law (104-208).\n       The Caspian Basin region is made up of the five littoral \n     states of the Caspian Seas (Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakstan, \n     Russia, and Turkmenistan). With potential reserves of as much \n     as 200 billion barrels of oil, the Caspian region could \n     become the most important new player in world oil markets \n     over the next decade. The United States supports the \n     development of secure, prosperous, and independent energy-\n     exporting states at peace with each other and their neighbors \n     in the region. We want to see these countries fully \n     integrated into the global economy. As the newly independent \n     countries of the Caspian region work to enhance their \n     sovereignty and to create stability within their own borders \n     and in the region, energy resource development has emerged as \n     a critical factor and means to these ends. The speed and \n     depth of macroeconomic reforms and democratization of these \n     states will provide the foundation for a favorable climate to \n     attract foreign investment and will determine their future \n     economic prosperity as well as the extent of their \n     integration into the world economy. Resolution of regional \n     conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia, and Chechnya is also \n     critical for successful and comprehensive energy development \n     in the region.\n       As a consumer nation, the United States is interested in \n     enhancing and diversifying global energy supplies. It is the \n     Clinton Administration's policy to promote rapid development \n     of Caspian energy resources through multiple pipelines and \n     diversified infrastructure networks to reinforce Western \n     energy security, and provide regional consumers alternatives \n     to Iranian energy. It is our judgment that the scale of \n     Caspian basin energy resources not only justifies--but will \n     demand--multiple transportation options for moving production \n     out into world markets. Multiple pipelines will prompt \n     competition, will ensure reliable, more efficient operations, \n     and will promote commercial viability.\n       The United States has a policy that focuses on expanding \n     and strengthening the web of relations with the region's \n     newly independent states across bilateral, regional and \n     multilateral levels; supporting the development and \n     diversification of regional infrastructural networks and \n     transportation corridors to tie the region securely to the \n     West and providing alternatives to Iran; and constructively \n     engaging these states in a dialogue on Caspian energy \n     development, particularly through trade and investment.\n       We are encouraging these countries to adopt open, fair, and \n     transparent investment regimes which will create favorable \n     climates for U.S. companies to participate directly in the \n     development of the region's energy resources. We are \n     confident that their participation will bring strong partners \n     and environmentally sound technology and practices to the \n     countries in the region. The Clinton Administration has an \n     active dialogue with the private sector and has developed \n     working relations with the countries in the region to reduce \n     or remove barriers to investment by U.S. companies. However, \n     U.S. companies are disadvantaged in some crucial respects, \n     preeminently by the burden that Section 907 of the FREEDOM \n     Support Act places on companies working in Azerbaijan. \n     Furthermore, foreign companies benefit significantly from \n     unrestricted political and financial support from their \n     governments.\n       In addition, the division of development rights to the \n     significant oil and gas deposits beneath the Caspian Sea \n     remains a critical issue for the five littoral states. The \n     U.S. Government has encouraged the littoral states to adopt a \n     legal regime in the Caspian Sea which includes the division \n     of seabed resources through clearly established property \n     rights and unrestricted transportation.\n       Another U.S. policy goal is to continue to isolate the \n     Iranian regime until such time as its unacceptable practices, \n     including support for international terrorism, cease. Iran's \n     economic isolation imposed by U.S. sanctions is leading \n     Teheran to look for new opportunities as well as new markets \n     in the region. This presents a particular challenge as the \n     USG works to balance its commercial interests in the region \n     with its foreign policy goals.\n       An interagency working group for Caspian energy chaired by \n     the National Security Council meets regularly to discuss U.S. \n     policy toward the Caspian Basin. The Administration believes \n     that significant progress is being made on these goals but \n     suggests the following steps which can further advance U.S. \n     interests in the region:\n       (1) Repeal Section 907 of the FREEDOM Support Act which \n     restricts the provisions of USG assistance to the Government \n     of Azerbaijan and limits U.S. influence and assistance in \n     Azerbaijan;\n       (2) Take the necessary legislative and administrative \n     actions to make TDA, OPIC, and EXIM programs available to our \n     companies in the Caucasus, Central Asia, Afghanistan, and \n     Pakistan;\n       (3) Encourage high-level visits to and from the region;\n       (4) Continue active U.S. support for international and \n     regional efforts to achieve balanced and lasting political \n     settlement of conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia, and \n     elsewhere in the region. Be prepared to contribute a fair \n     share to reconstruction and development costs of warn-torn \n     zones following achievement of peace agreements;\n       (5) Make available USG resources to support a UN-led peace \n     process in Afghanistan if/when the Afghan parties agree on \n     terms for these elements;\n       (6) Encourage installation of upgraded navigation systems \n     in the Bosporus;\n       (7) Encourage the development of new markets in the Black \n     Sea region;\n       (8) Structure assistance to the region to encourage \n     economic reform and the development of appropriate investment \n     climates in the region.\n\n\n             recommended legislative and executive actions\n\n       1. Repeal Section 907 of the FREEDOM Support Act (FSA) \n     which limits U.S. influence and assistance in Azerbaijan.\n       Section 907 of the FSA, enacted in 1992, provides that U.S. \n     assistance ``may not be provided to the Government of \n     Azerbaijan until the President determines, and so reports to \n     Congress, that the Government of Azerbaijan is taking \n     demonstrable steps to cease all blockades and other offensive \n     uses of force against Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh.'' \n     Unfortunately, this statutory restriction on assistance to \n     the Government of Azerbaijan limits our ability to advance \n     U.S. interests in Azerbaijan. The Clinton Administration has \n     from the start opposed this restriction on assistance to the \n     Government of Azerbaijan. Section 907 hinders U.S. policy \n     objectives, including the provision of humanitarian aid, \n     support for democratic and economic development, support for \n     the Nagorno-Karabakh peace process, and promotion of U.S. \n     investment opportunities in Azerbaijan. Section 907 \n     restrictions have placed American firms at a disadvantage \n     because they limit the ability of the U.S. Government to \n     provide financial support, such as risk insurance and grants \n     for pipeline studies to companies that are involved with the \n     Azerbaijani government of its institutions, including the \n     State Oil Company of Azerbaijan (SOCAR), on projects that \n     involve substantial Azerbaijani government ownership or \n     control. Section 907 prevents the U.S. from offering many \n     kinds of technical assistance and exchange programs offered \n     to other governments throughout the NIS and which are needed \n     to help create an attractive business climate and commercial \n     infrastructure. When the European Union, Japan, or \n     International Financial Institutions step in to fill this \n     void, the U.S. loses influence and U.S. businesses lose \n     opportunities. This also creates hostility towards the U.S. \n     and U.S. businesses. As foreign competition for oil and gas \n     resources in the region increases, American companies--\n     particularly smaller firms--will lose out and may be unable \n     to compete with other, government-supported, foreign \n     companies in Azerbaijan due to the restrictions Section 907 \n     places on U.S. Government-funded support for American \n     investment involving Government of Azerbaijan owned or \n     controlled enterprises in Azerbaijan.\n\n[[Page S4209]]\n\n       2. Take the necessary legislative and administrative \n     actions to make TDA, OPIC and EXIM programs available to our \n     companies in the Caucasus, Central Asia, Afghanistan and \n     Pakistan.\n       Since U.S. companies will frequently not be participating \n     as majority owners in pipeline and consortia agreement, we \n     need to find creative ways in which we can assure their \n     access to these programs within existing requirements on U.S. \n     content and equity participation. Our competitors, as noted \n     below, are already operating in the area with government-\n     backed credit lines. Repealing Section 907 of the FREEDOM \n     Support Act would make it easier for these programs to \n     operate effectively throughout the Caspian region. We \n     recognize that opening these programs in individual countries \n     is contingent upon decisions from respective Boards of \n     Directors taking into account legal strictures and country \n     risk assessment.\n       3. Encourage high-level visits to and from the region.\n       Many observers point to high-level visible government \n     support as major factor in the successful involvement of \n     British, French, and Japanese firms throughout the Caspian \n     region--support which gives these companies a significant \n     competitive edge against American companies. This support \n     typically takes two forms--high level, high visibility trade \n     missions and export credits. The Caspian Basin is new to many \n     political and business leaders in the U.S. High-level \n     congressional, administration, and business travel to the \n     region--for example cabinet-level participation in the oil \n     and gas shows in Baku, Ashgabat, and Almaty, and in support \n     of companies' bids for contracts--would be particularly \n     useful. These visits should be reinforced by invitations to \n     decision-makers from the region to come to the U.S.\n       4. Continue active U.S. support for international and \n     regional efforts to achieve balanced and lasting political \n     settlement of conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia, and \n     elsewhere in the region (e.g. Chechnya, Tajikistan). Be \n     prepared to contribute a fair share to reconstruction and \n     development costs of war-torn zones following achievement of \n     peace agreements.\n       5. Make available USG resources to support a UN-led peace \n     process in Afghanistan if/when the Afghan parties agree on \n     terms for these elements.\n       A lasting Afghanistan peace settlement is not only in the \n     interests of the Afghan people but would promote regional \n     stability and development. U.S. companies are eager to \n     participate in exporting Caspian energy via Afghanistan.\n       6. Encourage installation of upgraded navigation systems in \n     the Bosporus.\n       This issue should be kept separate from consideration of a \n     main export pipeline through Turkey: it stands on its own \n     merits. As noted earlier, the capacity of the Bosporus to \n     carry Caspian oil safely and efficiently will eventually be \n     exceeded. The present system is inadequate and needs \n     replacement regardless of the additional volume of oil which \n     transits this area. Turkish concerns for the safety of the 13 \n     million people who live along the straits are valid and we \n     should work through the International Maritime Organization \n     (IMO) to set reasonable standards for safe and secure transit \n     through the Straits. The adoption of more advanced technology \n     would further improve the flow of traffic in the Straits and \n     increase safety for shippers and reduce the risk of an \n     environmentally devastating oil spill. Currently, while there \n     are some aids to navigation, there is no continuous tracking \n     of ships. The USG should continue to urge and work with the \n     Turkish government to install a state-of-the-art Vessel \n     Tracking System (VTS) for the Turkish Straits, preferably \n     from an American supplier, which would provide complete radar \n     coverage throughout the Straits and would have the ability to \n     communicate with ships by radio. The U.S. Coast Guard is \n     currently working on installing 17 such systems across the \n     United States. The Coast Guard estimates that complete \n     coverage of the Straits would cost $60 million to install, \n     and up to $1 million annually to operate. The Turkish \n     government has prepared a tender to install a world class VTS \n     three times. The USG should support efforts to secure \n     international financing for such a system.\n       7. Encourage the development of new markets in the Black \n     Sea Region.\n       All current oil export routes from the Caspian Basin \n     terminate at the Black Sea. Given the limitations on the \n     volume of oil which can be exported through the Bosporus as \n     outlined above, alternatives to the Straits must be \n     identified and developed. One possibility is to develop the \n     oil, gas, and power markets in the Black Sea Region and to \n     develop the infrastructure to transport Caspian energy to \n     other markets. Additional sources of energy for the countries \n     of this region and increased transit fees would stimulate \n     economic development, reduce existing monopolies over \n     supplies, and provide lucrative marekts for the producing \n     countries.\n       8. Structure assistance to the region to encourage economic \n     reform and the development of appropriate investment climates \n     in the region.\n       Continued USG support through technical assistance is \n     essential in assisting these countries to establish strong \n     market economies and encourage the emergence of a financially \n     vibrant energy sector. Transparent legal and regulatory \n     environment, and restructured and privatized energy sectors \n     in these countries will ensure the commercial viability of \n     new investments and expand opportunities for U.S. industry. \n     To a great extent, the Clinton Administration's ability to \n     tailor assistance strategies to address U.S. interests is \n     hampered by restrictions on how assistance money can be \n     spent. Besides the restrictions imposed by Section 907 of the \n     FSA on USG funded assistance to the Government of Azerbaijan, \n     Congressional earmarks limit assistance flexibility and often \n     channel money away from projects and programs which might \n     further U.S. interests more rapidly. We recommend that \n     earmarks and other restrictions be kept as low as possible, \n     if not completely eliminated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/08/senate-section/article/S4207-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO THOMAS SALMON\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Tom \nSalmon, president of the University of Vermont, who will be retiring \nlater this month.\n  Tom and I have worked together for nearly three decades. First as \nyoung lawyers in our hometown of Rutland, VT, and then in the general \nassembly. While he went on to serve as Governor for two terms, I went \nto Washington to serve in Congress. Although we represented different \npolitical parties, we shared a love for Vermont which enabled us to \nwork together and put politics aside.\n  More recently, during Tom Salmon's tenure as president of the \nUniversity of Vermont, we have had the opportunity to work closely \nagain. His commitment to improving the quality of education has been \noutstanding, and I have watched with admiration as the university has \nflourished under his guidance. His capacity to make tough decisions \nwhile also connecting with students at the university has contributed \nto his success. No one could ever question Tom Salmon's dedication \nafter hearing about the time he had to excuse himself from an important \nmeeting of the Governor's council of economic advisors because it \nconflicted with his graduate school seminar. This has been a job that \nTom has loved, and one that he has done well.\n  As I think back over the years, one thing is very clear, Tom Salmon \nis a man who cares about the State of Vermont and its citizens. Be it \nas Governor, teacher, chairman of the board, or adviser, his \noutstanding ability always shines through making him one of Vermont's \nmost successful leaders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/08/senate-section/article/S4209-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    COMMENDATION FOR LINDA ESPINOSA\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to insert in \ntoday's Record a summary of a longer report on a November 1996 trip \ntaken by a congressional delegation consisting of Senators Glenn, \nLeahy, Dorgan, Kempthorne, and myself. The delegation traveled to \nVietnam, China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, meeting with senior government \nofficials in each location. The summary discusses the highlights of the \ntrip. The full report is also available. As the trip report summary \nhighlights, members of the delegation raised important U.S. national \npriorities in each country and gained valuable insight into the \nleaders' views.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S4210]]\n\n   Report of the Senate Delegation Visit to Asia, November 8-17, 1996\n\n\n                          Summary and Findings\n\n       A delegation from the United States Senate, consisting of \n     Democratic Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD), Senator John Glenn (D-\n     OH), Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Senator Byron Dorgan (D-\n     ND) and Senator Dirk Kempthorne (R-ID), met with leading \n     officials in Vietnam, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan during a \n     trip to that region from November 8-17, 1996. The \n     delegation's mission was to explore firsthand U.S. policy \n     issues in this part of the world where the United States has \n     important national security, humanitarian and economic \n     interests.\n       In each country, the delegation discussed various aspects \n     of U.S. policy with high level government officials. In \n     meetings in Vietnam, they raised a variety of important U.S. \n     policy interests, beginning with the high priority the United \n     States places on resolving remaining cases of U.S. service \n     members reported missing in action (MIA). They also discussed \n     the need for a comprehensive trade agreement and the issues \n     that must be addressed before one can be completed. They \n     raised a number of other issues, including urging greater \n     cooperation on Agent Orange research issues; pressing the \n     need or improvements in Vietnam's human rights practices; \n     requesting that the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi be relocated to a \n     more central location in the city closer to most of the \n     organizations with which it works; and encouraging the \n     Vietnamese to resolve remaining immigration issues and remove \n     existing obstacles to trade.\n       In these meetings, the Vietnamese expressed a willingness \n     to work with the U.S. to resolve problems in U.S.-Vietnamese \n     bilateral relations. They clearly understood the importance \n     of the MIA issue and pledged cooperation. They appeared to \n     welcome the trade that has taken place in the absence of a \n     comprehensive trade agreement and looked forward to expanding \n     trade with such an agreement. The Vietnamese acknowledged \n     that they had a way to go in modifying their laws and \n     practices to enter fully the international marketplace. In \n     addition, they were eager to have the National Assembly, \n     their legislative branch, host a congressional delegation for \n     the first time. They expressed strong interest in expanding \n     contracts between our respective legislative branches in the \n     future.\n       The Chinese leaders with whom the delegation met appeared \n     very interested in moving U.S.-Chinese relations in a more \n     positive direction. The delegation had a good exchange of \n     views with the Chinese in a number of areas, including \n     expressing the importance to the United States of human \n     rights practices; the need for improvements in China's trade \n     policies to open its markets and increase opportunities for \n     U.S. exports; and the need for additional attention in the \n     area of nuclear proliferation. They heard varying levels of \n     acknowledgment of U.S. positions and willingness to work with \n     us.\n       The delegation also discussed with the Chinese the upcoming \n     July 1, 1997 transition in which Hong Kong reverts to Chinese \n     sovereignty. The delegation indicated that it is very \n     important to the U.S. that the transition go smoothly, and \n     the Chinese said that they wished to see that outcome as \n     well. The delegation also met with a wide range of Hong Kong \n     residents to assess their views on the transition. Some were \n     quite optimistic, as were the U.S. businesses with whom the \n     delegation met. Others were more cautious and pointed out the \n     potential for conflict.\n       The delegation had a number of discussions with leaders in \n     China and Taiwan about the relations between Taiwan and the \n     Mainland. Both sides indicated that tensions had diminished \n     since the U.S. sent carriers to the Taiwan Straits shortly \n     before Taiwan's March 1996 election. However, the delegation \n     observed a wide gulf between each side's interpretation of \n     the relations between them and the prospects for \n     reunification.\n     Tom Daschle,\n     John Glenn,\n     Patrick Leahy,\n     Byron Dorgan,\n     Dirk Kempthorne.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/08/senate-section/article/S4209-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, the tragic days of the Dirty Thirties are \nstill remembered by many in my State. As an unbreakable drought settled \nover our region, the fields dried and the crops withered. Hot, dry \nwinds whipped the dust into dark clouds that blew over the land and \nsettled in great drifts on the ground. It was a desperate time for our \nState. Destitute and facing foreclosure, many South Dakotans had no \nchoice but to abandon the farms in which they had invested countless \nyears of labor. These losses rippled through our economy with a \ndevastating effect, stripping businesses of their livelihood and \nfarmworkers of their jobs. As the lines of the unemployed grew, so did \na feeling of hopelessness among our people.\n  It was in the midst of this terrible Depression that one of our \nNation's greatest Presidents, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, offered hope \nto the people of South Dakota. Through the Civilian Conservation Corps \nand the Works Progress Administration [WPA], he provided jobs for South \nDakotans, and gave us back the dignity that comes with earning your \nkeep. Roosevelt's mark can still be seen across the State, where the \nthousands of people he put to work left stadiums, sewer systems, and \nmiles of highways and sidewalks as their legacy.\n  In Milbank, a quiet, friendly town in the northeast corner of my \nState, the WPA-built municipal water system still ingeniously delivers \nwater from springs outside of town without the work of a single pump. \nAnd only recently was the stretch of Highway 12 that runs through \nMilbank, built by WPA workers and nearly six decades old, finally \nrepaved.\n  After all Franklin Roosevelt gave to South Dakota and the people of \nMilbank, I am pleased to say that we have had the rare and wonderful \nopportunity to give something back to him. Mr. President, last week the \nlong-awaited memorial to Franklin Roosevelt was unveiled. Over 800 feet \nlong, its rough-hewn granite walls form outdoor rooms that honor each \nof Roosevelt's four terms as President.\n  I am proud to say that the stone for this memorial was quarried by \nworkers in Milbank. Nearly 60 years after Roosevelt put the citizens of \nMilbank to work in the WPA, they have again been hard at work for him, \ncutting and hammering the granite for our memorial to the man who led \nour Nation through its worst depression and most terrible war.\n  Quarrying this granite has been a source of deep inspiration and \npride for the workers of the Cold Springs Granite Co., which owns the \nquarry. Often working in the bitter cold, their fierce dedication \nensured that the 4,500 hundred tons of stone they cut reached \nWashington safely and on schedule.\n  This was no mean feat--to meet the needs of the memorial, the 3-\nbillion-year-old layer of granite that runs beneath Milbank was cut in \npieces weighing up to 100 tons. These monstrous stones then had to be \ncarefully raised, without cracking or falling, from the base of a pit \n140 feet beneath the ground. Once they reached the surface, the stones \nwere sent by flatbed truck to Cold Springs, MN, where workers shaped \nthem according to the models of Lawrence Halprin, the designer of the \nmonument. According to workers like Frank Hermans, who has worked in \nthe quarry his entire adult life, the job gave him and his coworkers \nthe chance to leave their mark in history. ``We can say we were part of \nsomething,'' he said. ``Not many get the chance to say that.''\n\n[[Page S4211]]\n\n  I know I speak for my colleagues as I say thank you to the workers of \nMilbank for their dedication and hours of labor. Their efforts have \nhelped the Nation to honor a man who gave us hope when we were hopeless \nand the determination to fight when our freedom was threatened.\n  Mr. President, the Washington Post recently printed an outstanding \narticle on quarrying of the memorial's granite. I ask unanimous consent \nthat it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 2, 1997]\n\n               By Proud Toil, Stone Is Hewn Into History\n\n                            (By Peter Finn)\n\n       Milbank, S.D.--The wind chill was 70 below one Saturday \n     last November when the six quarrymen working in a deep gouge \n     in the earth here had to move one last piece of granite. It \n     was a 65-ton clossus.\n       The rock had been quarried loose a month earlier, but the \n     permit to transport it on state roads to a factory in Cold \n     Spring, Minn., for cutting and shaping stated that it had to \n     go that day, bonechilling temperatures not withstanding.\n       ``We had the warn clothes on,'' said Frank Hermans, the \n     quarry foreman. ``But your face hurt. It was a cold one.''\n       It took three excruciating hours to bring the granite up \n     from the 140-foot-deep quarry, making sure it did not fall or \n     crack. Hermans, his face chapped and burnished, felt a fierce \n     satisfaction as he watched it leave on a flatbed truck.\n       ``We can say we were part of something,'' said the 46-year-\n     old, who has worked down in ``the hole,'' as he calls it, \n     since he was a teenager. ``Not many get to say that.''\n       Now, six months later, that piece of granite is a base \n     stone in one of four fountains at the Franklin Delano \n     Roosevelt Memorial, which will be dedicated today on a 7\\1/\n     2\\-acre site by the Tidal Basin.\n       The memorial's dominant feature is its granite spine, an \n     800-foot-long meandering wall that forms four outdoor rooms, \n     each representing one of FDR's presidential terms. The 12-\n     foot-high wall defines the memorial sculpture and fountains, \n     embracing and guiding the visitor through Roosevelt's time, \n     the years of the Great Depression and World War II.\n       ``As the stone gets rougher and rougher, the emotion builds \n     up,'' said landscpe architect Lawrence Halprin, the \n     memorial's designer. With the progression of the wall into \n     the room representing World War II, the stone's face becomes \n     increasingly irregular. ``I'm choreographing experiences.''\n       From the quarry here on the dull Dakota flatlands to \n     Washington, where today's dignitary-studded dedication will \n     take place, the hands of many people gave physical life to \n     Halprin's artistry. Working hands. Hands that hammered and \n     gouged and chiseled the stone. Hands that blistered and \n     calloused and ached. Hands that bled passion as well as \n     sweat.\n       The schedule wore on the workers. One got shots of \n     cortisone in his shoulder to keep working. Another, who was \n     responsible for coordinating all the stonework, literally \n     lost his hair last year under the strain of meeting \n     deadlines. When it grew back this year, it had turned white.\n       ``This was very personal for us,'' said LaVern Maile, 55, a \n     stonecutter at Cold Spring Granite Co., which owns the quarry \n     and cut the stone for the memorial--enough to build an 80-\n     story building.\n       ``It was a monster of a job,'' he said. ``I don't think any \n     of us realized until we were halfway into it just how big it \n     was. And probably that was just as well.''\n       The Millbank quarry, once a natural outcropping of stone \n     valued for its reddish hue, is now a vast tear that extends \n     1,000 feet long and 650 feet across as it falls in terraces \n     to its deepest point of 140 feet. Surveys estimate that the \n     granite runs for 12 miles under this desolate plain. Each \n     year this slice of earth yields 463,000 tons of stone for \n     malls, banks, office buildings and grave markers.\n       Here, in the swirl of red and gray dust kicked up daily by \n     heavy machinery and the boom of explosives cracking rock, \n     Halprin first laid hands on his creation. He chose this \n     granite 22 years ago because the rock closely resembled the \n     stone FDR had selected for additions to the family estate at \n     Hyde Park, N.Y.\n       The granite is called carnelian, a derivative of the Latin \n     word for flesh. It is 2 billion years old, dating from the \n     pre-Cambrian era, the period before there was abundant life \n     on Earth. The granite formed when molten rocks deep in the \n     earth's crust solidified and either rose to the surface or \n     were exposed by erosion.\n       Halprin says the wall, too, will endure. He promises it \n     will still be standing 3,000 years from now.\n       The architect drew and made models of every stone he wanted \n     in the memorial--their lengths, shapes, protrusions, \n     recesses, smoothness and roughness. ``I could see every stone \n     in my mind,'' said Halprin, comparing the process to the way \n     a composer documents musical arrangements.\n       If Halprin was the composer and conductor, a select group \n     of Minnesota stonecutters was his orchestra.\n       Stonecutter Wally Leither, 55, carried drawings of each \n     block as he prowled the quarry looking for granite that \n     matched Halprin's specifications.\n       Usually, granite is blasted loose with explosives, but \n     because Halprin's demands were so specific and explosives \n     leave long rivets on the outside of the stone, Leither had to \n     cut most of the blocks for the memorial by hand.\n       Using jackhammers, he drilled holes into the stone every \n     four inches, shaping a piece of stone. Two pieces of steel \n     were placed in the shallow holes, and an iron wedge was \n     hammered between them.\n       ``We'd let it sit like that overnight, and the stone would \n     crack with the pressure,'' said Leither, whose graying \n     mustache doesn't quite hide a persistent smile. ``It was slow \n     work.''\n       Stone was first cut for the memorial in 1991 after Congress \n     appropriated the $42.5 million in public funds needed to \n     build it. (An additional $5.5 million came in private \n     donations.) Over the last six years, 15,000 tons of stone was \n     chipped from the earth in South Dakota and trucked two hours \n     east to Minnesota to the Cold Spring Granite Co., where 4,500 \n     tons of it was cut and shaped. The contract for quarrying and \n     preparing the granite was $6.35 million, according to the \n     National Park Service.\n       Halprin visited the quarry frequently, sometimes becoming \n     seized with excitement when he saw a particular stone and \n     adjusting his design to incorporate it if Leither told him \n     the men could get it out just as Halprin imagined it would \n     look.\n       ``I've never seen anyone look at stone quite like him,'' \n     said Don Noll, 57, the West Coast Salesman for Cold Spring \n     Granite, who accompanied Halprin on some of his trips to \n     South Dakota. ``Each stone has a personality with him. Where \n     I saw nothing except a chunk of rock, he saw part of a \n     fountain. He'd stand in front of stone and say, `Do you see \n     it? Do you see it?' And I'd say, `See what, Larry? What do \n     you see?'''\n       Some uses of the granite came about by happenstance.\n       In 1978, at the New Jersey studio of George Segal, one of \n     four sculptors who worked on the memorial, Halprin and the \n     others were discussing how to depict World War II in stone. \n     But their ideas seemed uninspired. As they stood over a stone \n     model of the wall, someone waved his hand in agitation, \n     knocking down a section and creating a pile of rubble.\n       ``Suddenly we all realized we had captured the destructive \n     image that expressed what we needed,'' Halprin recalled.\n       The Cold Spring Granite Co.'s fabrication plant in \n     Minnesota is a sea of thundering industry: furnaces that \n     blast granite at 1,800 degrees to give it a thermal finish, \n     10-foot-high wire saws that pulsate rhythmically as they \n     slice the stone, and huge polishing units that smooth the \n     granite. High above the shop floor, cranes straddle the width \n     of the factory, lifting slabs of granite some weighing \n     several tons, with suction cups.\n       That machinery cut and finished the granite paving stones \n     that visitors to the memorial will walk on, as well as the \n     smooth blocks on which carver John Benson sandblasted some of \n     FDR's words.\n       But no machine could give the wall stone the roughness that \n     the landscape architect desired.\n       Leither and Maile and three other stonecutters, Mervile \n     Sabrowsky, 56, Dean Hemmech, 39, and Kraig Kussatz, 38, began \n     work on the rock faces the public would view. They started \n     with 16-pound hammer sets, then moved to smaller and smaller \n     chisels until the stone began to resemble Halprin's drawings.\n       ``It looks easy, but if you take too much, you ruin the \n     granite,'' Leither said. ``Sometimes we had to compromise \n     with Larry. He wanted it a certain way, and we had to say we \n     can't take that much off.''\n       Over the last three years, the pace has been furious. The \n     team of four stonecutters tried to work on at least nine \n     blocks a day, always starting three and finishing three each \n     shift.\n       Some of the larger stones could not fit in the factory, so \n     the cutters had to work outside, standing on massive chunks \n     of stone and hammering away. One stone was reduced from 92 \n     tons to 40 tons before it was sent to Washington.\n       Part of the wall's effect is the sense that one huge block \n     is stacked atop another. In fact, in much of the wall the \n     granite is no more than 10 inches thick, the back having been \n     sheared away. Behind it, in a two-inch space, stainless steel \n     anchors hook the granite slabs to an unseen concrete wall \n     that runs inside the memorial, ensuring that the granite \n     cannot fall.\n       Neither Maile nor Leither has any specific memories of FDR; \n     each was a young child when the President died in 1945. ``My \n     day was strong Democratic,'' Maile said. ``He talked about \n     him. He enjoyed him.''\n       Through the FDR Memorial, however, Maile and Leither, along \n     with hundreds of other Cold Spring Granite employees, felt \n     the excitement of leaving a little stamp on history, a mark \n     not easily made in the anonymity of small-town factory work.\n       ``Someday I know that my grandchildren or my great-\n     grandchildren will see this memorial,'' Maile said, ``and in \n     the stone they'll see a little piece of me.''\n       When the last block left the factory late last year, Maile \n     said he felt like retiring.\n       ``We'll never work on something like this again. It's part \n     of history,'' he said. ``And we were all giving 100 percent \n     and a little bit more. When the last piece went out, it was a\n\n[[Page S4212]]\n\n     letdown in some ways. We did nothing else for years.''\n       Construction on the memorial site began in October 1994. It \n     took 210 flatbed truck trips to transport the 4,000 wall \n     stones and 27,239 paving stones from Cold Spring to \n     Washington, the last arriving late last year.\n       The peninsula on which the memorial sits was formed from \n     mud dredged from the Tidal Basin in the late 1800s and early \n     1900s. Tests indicated it could not support the 4,500-ton \n     memorial, so about 900 steel pilings were driven down 100 \n     feet to the solid ground under the settled mud. Concrete \n     beams were then built over the pilings.\n       ``It's like it is built on a bridge,'' Halprin said.\n       The four sections of the wall were built one by one over \n     the last 30 months, with cranes hoisting the granite stones \n     into position so they could be hooked to the concrete wall \n     behind. The William V. Walsh Construction Co. of Rockville \n     with the primary contractor on site.\n       Halprin and the workers at Cold Spring had built mock-ups \n     of the wall in Minnesota to see how corners, buttresses and \n     ground connections could best be assembled when the stone \n     reached Washington. Those mock-ups also gave Benson, the \n     inscription designer and carver, an opportunity for some \n     trial runs on the heavily pillowed granite.\n       He chose a form of Roman inscription that was refined in \n     his studio in Newport, R.I., but the actual carving was done \n     on the erected memorial. Benson traced the letters, some 16 \n     inches tall, onto the granite with water-based paint. Once he \n     saw how the rough surface distorted the appearance of the \n     letters, he repainted them before carving the quotations, \n     using a chisel driven by a pneumatic hammer.\n       Benson, whose stone-carving business is the oldest in the \n     country, dating to 1705, said he cut at a rate of about two \n     letters a day.\n       ``You don't make mistakes,'' he said. ``You can't make a \n     mistake. The wall was up.''\n       The stonecutters from Cold Spring also worked on site in \n     the last four months, making last-minute cuts at Halprin's \n     direction.\n       ``That was awful scary,'' Leither said. ``Mess up and the \n     whole wall has to come down.''\n       On one of the last pieces the cutters worked on--a bench--\n     Maile gave the 16-pound hammer to Halprin so he could pitch \n     away a piece of stone.\n       ``I couldn't let it pass without him taking one swing,'' \n     Maile said.\n       Halprin kept the piece of stone as a souvenir.\n       Leither and Maile, along with 30 other people from Cold \n     Spring, will be at the dedication today.\n       ``When we said those stones, all finished, it'll be almost \n     like a family reunion,'' Leither said. ``We gave birth to \n     them out in Millbank, nurtured them in Cold Spring and sent \n     them off like grown children to Washington, D.C.''\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of H. Con. Res. 25, which was received \nfrom the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 25) providing for \n     acceptance of a statue of Jack Swigert, presented by the \n     State of Colorado, for placement in National Statuary Hall.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the concurrent resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am proud to announce on behalf of the \nState of Colorado that today the Senate will have the opportunity to \napprove House Resolution 25 to allow the placement of the statue of \nJack Swigert in National Statuary Hall.\n  Coloradans chose astronaut Jack Swigert as the second State statue to \nbe placed in the U.S. Capitol. He was elected to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives in 1982 representing the Sixth Congressional District. \nUnfortunately, his successful campaign was beset by his battle with \nbone-marrow cancer. The cancer spread quickly but he insisted on \ntraveling from Colorado to Washington despite his failing health. The \nRepresentative-elect died only days before the swearing in ceremony.\n  Mr. Swigert is well known as one of the astronauts on the famous \nApollo 13 mission. The details of the mission are familiar to many; the \nsuspenseful story of the astronauts' journey was recently depicted in a \nmajor movie. The ship and crew of Apollo suffered several complications \nand disasters, including an oxygen tank explosion that threatened the \nlives of the crew. It was the relentless determination and competence \ndemonstrated by Jack Swigert and the other crew members that made it \npossible for the return of the spacecraft to Earth.\n  Jack Swigert was born in Denver. He began flying while he was in high \nschool and dedicated himself to becoming a pilot. After graduating from \nthe University of Colorado at Boulder he joined the Air Force and \nserved as a pilot during the Korean war. His strong desire to become an \nastronaut inspired him to return to school after twice being rejected \nby NASA's space program. He was admitted to the program at NASA on his \nthird try.\n  The statue of Jack Swigert will join the statue commemorating \nColorado native Dr. Florence Rena Sabin. Dr. Sabin broke many barriers \nfor women in the field of medicine. She entered medical school in 1893 \nand pursued a career in medical teaching and research. At a time when \nwomen were not considered eligible for the medical teaching profession, \nshe became the first woman to attain the position of full professor at \nJohns Hopkins University in Baltimore. She also was the first woman to \nbe invited to join the Rockefeller Institute.\n  Upon returning to Colorado, Dr. Sabin was appointed to a subcommittee \non public health and helped to draft legislation reorganizing the State \nhealth department. At the age of 76, Dr. Sabin took on the duties of \nmanager of the Department of Health and Welfare of Denver and continued \nto implement public health legislation.\n  The passage of House Concurrent Resolution 25 will mark the \ntriumphant end to a 10-year effort to honor Mr. Swigert. The striking \nstatue, which was cast by the Lundeen brothers in my hometown of \nLoveland, CO, will be provided entirely by private funding.\n  Jack Swigert's close friends remember him for his humbling tenacity \nand courage. I remain in awe of his achievements and spirit, and I am \npleased that this statue will join Dr. Sabin in representing the State \nof Colorado to everyone who visits the Capitol.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I join my colleague from Colorado, \nSenator Wayne Allard, in supporting adoption of House Concurrent \nResolution 25, which authorizes the placement of the statue of Jack \nSwigert in Statuary Hall of the U.S. Capitol. This important resolution \nwas submitted by our colleague, Congressman Dan Schaefer, in the House \nof Representatives, who is the dean of our delegation.\n  The inclusion of this statue would not be possible without the \nefforts of many Coloradans, who I would like to thank for their \ndedicated efforts. Among these groups, the Arapahoe County Republican \nMen's Club stands out for its large contribution. Club members lobbied \nthe state legislature and donated substantial amounts of money in an \neffort to commission the statue.\n  Also a key supporter of this effort was Veterans of Foreign Wars \nChapter 11229. This chapter was commissioned solely for the purpose of \npersuading the state legislature to create the statue of Mr. Swigert \nand put the initiative on the ballot. Mr. Swigert was a lifelong member \nof VFW Post #1, which is the oldest VFW in the nation, founded after \nthe Spanish-American War.\n  Among the many individuals who worked on this honor, Mr. Hal \nSchroyer, who lives north of Denver, should be mentioned for 10 years \nof work on this project.\n  Mr. Swigert was an extraordinary individual, even before his flight \nin the Apollo 13 spacecraft, made famous by the movie in 1996 that my \ncolleague mentioned.\n  Jack learned to fly at age 16, while attending Denver East High \nSchool, and was on the move ever since. Jack served in the Air Force in \nKorea, where he flew jet fighters. Even after his plane crashed into a \nradar unit on a Korean airstrip, Jack continued to fly. After leaving \nthe service, he was a test pilot to 10 years. He kept busy, earning two \nmaster's degrees as a followup to his 1953 mechanical engineering \ndegree.\n\n[[Page S4213]]\n\n  What Jack is best remembered for though, is his fateful aborted trip \nto the moon in 1970, as part of the Apollo 13 mission. Jack joined the \ncrew at the last minute, after his colleague, Thomas Mattingly, was \nexposed to German Measles and could not make the trip. He had no idea \njust how exciting this trip would become when he started. After an \noxygen tank exploded, the three-member crew used all their knowledge \nand ingenuity to bring the disabled ship home safely. Because of their \nquick thinking and grace under extreme pressure, all three members, \nJack Haise, James Lovell and Jack Swigert returned safely to Earth.\n  Following his service with NASA, Swigert put his extensive \naeronautical expertise to use as the executive director of the House \nCommittee on Science and Technology. He held the position until 1977, \nwhen he decided to run for the U.S. Senate. He was defeated by his \nfriend William Armstrong in the primary and returned to private \nindustry as the vice president for two prominent Denver companies.\n  In 1982, Jack made a successful bid for a House seat, even after \nlearning that he had cancer. Jack's courageous battle was an effort to \nprove that, to use his words, ``technology and commitment can overcome \nany challenge.'' Unfortunately, Jack did not win his battle with bone \ncancer, and, in December 1982, a month after winning the election, Jack \npassed away.\n  Jack Swigert will be remembered and honored with this statue we \ndedicate to him as a true American hero. And, his statue will represent \nColorado with honor and distinction here in the U.S. Capitol for years \nto come. To my knowledge, this will be the first space age statue to be \nincluded. With my colleague from Colorado, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport passage of this important resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that H. Con. Res. \n25 be agreed to; that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; \nand that any statements relating to the resolution appear at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 25) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  MR. KEMPTHORNE. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Craig and Mr. Torricelli, \npertaining to the introduction of S. 730 are located in today's Record \nunder ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. ALLARD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A bill to amend the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency \nPrevention Act of 1974, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n    THE JUVENILE CRIME CONTROL AND COMMUNITY PROTECTION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today, with the Senator from \nMissouri, Senator Ashcroft, and the Senator from Oregon, Senator Wyden, \nto introduce the Juvenile Crime Control and Community Protection Act of \n1997. I don't think there is anything that is worrying the American \npeople more than what is happening to the criminal justice system in \ntheir cities, their counties, and their States.\n  Senator Ashcroft, a former attorney general from Missouri, knows a \nlot about these matters on a firsthand basis from having been there. I \nam hopeful he will arrive before the time expires to speak to one \naspect of the bill, which we are introducing, and then I will, as soon \nas I can, yield to Senator Wyden for some of his observations.\n  Last year, I had field hearings in New Mexico to hear the concerns \nand problems faced by all of the people affected by juvenile crime. We \nheard from the police, prosecutors, judges, social workers and, most \nimportant, Mr. President, as you well know, the victims who reside in \nour communities.\n  The sentiments expressed at these hearings are the same ones felt by \npeople all over this country: One, some juveniles are out of control \nand the juvenile justice system cannot cope with them; second, other \nchildren do not have enough constructive things to do to keep them from \nsliding into delinquency; third, the current system does little, if \nanything, to protect the public from senseless youth violence; and \nfourth, the current system has failed its victims.\n  I want to tell my colleagues about an 18-year-old girl from New \nMexico named Renee Garcia who was stabbed and left paralyzed by a 15-\nyear old gang member. The stabbing was part of that\n\n[[Page S4218]]\n\ngang's initiation ritual. The gang member later received only a \nsentence of 4 years in a juvenile facility. This is what Renee Garcia \nhad to say about the current justice system as it applied to her and \nher family:\n\n       The outdated laws which exist in our legal system today are \n     nothing but a joke to juveniles. Our laws were meant for \n     juveniles who were committing [small] crimes like truancy and \n     breaking curfews. They are not designed to deal with violent \n     crimes that juveniles are committing today.\n\n  Renee has made quite a recovery from her attack, and we are quite \npleased that she is doing reasonably well in our community and in our \nState.\n  The time has come, in my opinion, for the U.S. Government to be a \nbetter partner in a major American effort to improve the criminal \njuvenile justice system across this land. For many, it is well known, \nwe have an adult juvenile system that developed over a long period of \ntime, but we have a juvenile justice system that sort of evolved willy-\nnilly. It has never reached the stature of the adult system. There are \nvagaries and much has been left to judges who are asked to respond to \nthe young criminals in a way completely different than if they were \nadults.\n  Some statutes were passed that made this response mandatory, and \nthose statutes still exist today. Still today, in many States, you do \nnot disclose to the public the name and detailed information about \njuvenile criminals who are committing adult crimes. Their fingerprints \nand their records are not part of law enforcement's ability to cope \nwith repeated crime, committed over and over, from one State to another \nby some of these same teenage criminals.\n  The Federal Government, in my opinion, should get involved. As we do \nthis, however, we should expect the States to get tough on youth \nsentencing. We should reward States for enacting law enforcement and \nprosecutorial policies designed to take violent juvenile criminals off \nthe streets.\n  This bill makes some fundamental changes to the crime-fighting \npartnership which exists between the States and the Federal Government. \nIt contains two important ideas: One, strict law enforcement and \nprosecution policies for the most violent offenders. We cannot tell the \nStates they must do that, but in this bill, we set up a very \nsignificant grant program, part of which goes to States that do certain \nminimal things to improve their system. If they do not, they do not get \nthat money. It goes to States that choose to modernize their system in \naccordance with a series of options that we have found are clearly \nnecessary today.\n\n  This approach is going to help States fight crime as well as prevent \njuveniles from entering the juvenile justice system in the first place. \nIt makes important fundamental changes to the Federal juvenile justice \nsystem, and I am going to leave an explanation of how we change our \nFederal juvenile justice system and modernize it to the Senator from \nMissouri. It would be a shame if we tell the States to do things \nbetter, but we leave the prosecutions in the Federal juvenile justice \nsystem alone.\n  The bill adopts an approach that I suggested last year as part of a \njuvenile justice bill. It authorizes--we do not have it appropriated \nyet--but we authorize $500 million to provide the States with two \nseparate grant programs: One, with virtually no strings attached, based \non a current State formula grant program; the second is a new incentive \ngrant for States that enact what we call ``best practices'' to combat \nand prevent juvenile violence.\n  This bill authorizes $300 million, divided into two $150 million \npots, for a new grant program, the purpose of which is to encourage \nStates to get tough and enact reforms to their juvenile justice \nsystems.\n  I am not going to proceed with each one, but I will just read off the \nsuggested reforms that will comprise ``getting tough'' and ``best \npractices'':\n  Victims' rights, including the right to be notified of the sentencing \nand release of the offender;\n  Mandatory victim restitution;\n  Public access to juvenile records;\n  Parental responsibility laws for acts committed by juveniles released \nto their parents' custody;\n  Zero tolerance for deadbeat juvenile parents, a requirement that \njuveniles released from custody attend school or vocational training \nand support their children;\n  Zero tolerance for truancy;\n  Character counts training, or similar programs adopted and enacted \namong the States;\n  And mentoring.\n  These programs are a combination of reforms which will positively \nimpact victims, get tough on juvenile offenders, and provide states \nwith resources to implement prevention programs to keep juveniles out \nof trouble in the first place.\n  The bill also increases from around $68 million to $200 million the \namount available to states under the current OJJDP grant program. It \nalso eliminates many of the strings placed on states as a condition of \nreceiving those grants.\n  In my home state of New Mexico, juvenile arrests increased 84 percent \nfrom 1986 to last year.\n  In 1996, 36,927 juveniles were referred to the state juvenile parole \nand probation office. Some 39 percent of those referred have a history \nof 10 or more referrals to the system.\n  While the Justice Department has said that the overall juvenile crime \nrate in the United States dropped last year, states like New Mexico \ncontinue to see yearly increases in the number of juveniles arrested, \nprosecuted and incarcerated.\n  I mention these numbers because they have led to a growing problem in \nmy home State, a problem which this bill will help fix.\n  More juvenile arrests create the need for more space to house \njuvenile criminals. But, because of burdensome federal ``sight and \nsound separation'' rules, New Mexico has been unable to implement a \nsafe, reasonable solution to alleviate overcrowding at its juvenile \nfacilities.\n  Instead, the state has been forced to consider sending juvenile \nprisoners to Iowa and Texas to avoid violating the federal rules and \nlosing their funding. That is unacceptable and this bill will fix that.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to work with the Senator from Missouri on \nthis important legislation. I know that many of my colleagues share my \nconcerns about the need to update our juvenile justice system. I hope \nthat they will examine our bill and lend their support.\n  I am going to stop here. I ask unanimous consent that the entire bill \nand a summary of the bill be printed in the Record, and that it be \nappropriately referred. It will bear the signatures today of Senator \nAshcroft, Senator Wyden, and Senator Campbell as cosponsors.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 718\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I yield to Senator Wyden at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico, and \nwant him to know I very much appreciate the chance to join him and \nSenator Ashcroft on this bipartisan bill.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, it is very clear that the \njuvenile justice system today in our country is very much like a \nrevolving door. A young person can commit a violent crime, a series of \nviolent crimes, be apprehended, visit the juvenile justice system--and \nthat is really an appropriate characterization--and be back on the \nstreet virtually immediately. In fact, in our newspaper, the Oregonian, \nit was recently reported that a child committed 52 crimes, 32 of which \nwere felonies, before the juvenile justice system took action to \nprotect the community.\n  I felt--and I think this is the focus of the legislation that the \nSenator from New Mexico, the Senator from Missouri and I bring to the \nfloor today--that there should be three principles for the new juvenile \njustice system for the 21st century.\n  The first ought to be community protection; the second should be \naccountability; and the third should be restitution. The principle of \naccountability is especially important with young people. I even see it \nwith my own small kids, a 7-year-old and a 13-year-old. If they act up, \nthere needs to be some consequences.\n  I am particularly pleased that the legislation the Senator from New \nMexico brings to the floor today puts a special focus on trying to deal \nwith offenses perpetrated by young people that have not yet risen to \nthat level of violent crime and, in effect, try to send a message to \nyoung people that there will be consequences.\n  The last point that I will make, because I know time is short and we \nhave much to do today, is that this legislation is particularly \nimportant in such areas as recordkeeping. We have found across the \ncountry that it has not even been possible to keep tabs on the violent \njuveniles, because there are so many gaps in the recordkeeping in the \nStates. Both the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from Missouri \nhave done yeoman work in this regard.\n  This is a balanced bill; it is a bipartisan bill. It moves to update \nthe laws dealing with juveniles for the 21st century.\n  I thank my friend from New Mexico and the Senator from Missouri for \nallowing me to be part of this bipartisan coalition. They included a \nnumber of provisions that are important to our State in the drafting \nthat went on in the last week. I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nCampbell be added as an original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am proud to join with the Senators \nDomenici and Wyden in introducing the Juvenile Crime Control and \nCommunity Protection Act of 1997 to reform the juvenile justice system \nin order to protect the public and hold juvenile offenders accountable \nfor their actions.\n  In 1994, juvenile courts handled an estimated 120,200 drug offense \ncases, a jump of 82 percent from 1991. Violent crime arrests among \njuveniles in 1995 was 12 percent higher than the level in 1991 and 67 \npercent above the level in 1986.\n  This year, Mr. President, it seems as though incidents of juvenile \nviolence are occurring every day and everywhere.\n  In Alton, IL, two teens were gunned down--one shot twice in the face \nand the other shot once in the back of the head when he turned to \nflee--by a 15-year-old of East St. Louis who had driven 30 miles to \ncarry out the shooting.\n  In Dayton, KY, a 15-year-old killed her 5-month-old son. She was \ngiven the maximum sentence--30 days of detention.\n  In Montgomery County, MD, a 14-year-old girl along with three adults \nwere arrested for two bank robberies in Silver Spring.\n  In Boston, MA, three schoolgirls--two 14-year-olds and one 15-year-\nold--were charged with putting knives to the throat or stomach of \nclassmates and stealing their gold jewelry and lunch money.\n  As these incidents demonstrate, the perpetrators of violence and \ntheir victims are getting younger. Similarly, gang activity is getting \nworse in our inner cities, suburbs, and rural communities. A 1995 \nnationwide survey of law enforcement agencies reported a total of \n23,388 gangs, and 664,906 gang members in their jurisdiction. In \ncomparison, a 1993 survey showed an estimated 4,881 gangs with 249,324 \ngang members in the United States.\n  The need for juvenile justice reform is clear, especially in light of \nthe fact that probation was the sentence handed out for 56 percent of \nthe 1992 juvenile court cases in which the juvenile was adjudicated \ndelinquent whether the offense was a felony or misdemeanor in nature.\n  Mr. President, this bill takes substantial steps toward addressing \nthe problems of violent juvenile offenders and the prevalence of youth \ngangs. The Federal Government would assist State and local efforts in \ndealing with the epidemic of juvenile crime by helping target the most \nviolent and problematic offenders.\n  Mr. President, the Juvenile Crime Control and Community Protection \nAct of 1997 would provide $1.5 billion over 5 years in incentive grants \nto encourage and assist States in reforming their juvenile justice \nsystems.\n  States are encouraged to revise their laws to reflect three much-\nneeded reforms. First, juveniles age 14 or older who commit serious \nviolent crimes--such as murder, forcible rape, aggravated assault, or \nserious drug offenses--should be tried as the adult criminals they are. \nBy making sure that the punishment fits the seriousness of the crime, \nthis proposal would deter juveniles who currently believe that the law \ncannot touch them.\n  Second, the States are encouraged to ensure that records of juveniles \nunder age 15, who are found to be delinquent regarding serious violent \ncrimes and serious drug offenses, are maintained and made available to \nlaw enforcement agencies, including the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, prosecutors, adult criminal courts, and appropriate \nschool officials.\n  Finally, the States are encouraged to establish graduated sanctions \nfor juvenile offenders, ensuring a sanction for every delinquent or \ncriminal act and that the sanctions increase in severity based on the \nnature of the act. The sanctions should also escalate with each \nsubsequent delinquent or criminal act, and should include mandatory \nrestitution to victims, longer sentences of confinement, or mandatory \nparticipation in community service.\n  For States that enact such reforms, additional grant funds would be \nmade available to implement at least 5 of 18 accountability-based \npractices including: record-keeping for juvenile criminals age 14 or \nolder who commit offenses equivalent to an adult felony; increasing \nvictims' rights concerning information about the conviction, \nsentencing, imprisonment, and release of their juvenile attackers; \nmandatory\n\n[[Page S4225]]\n\nrestitution to victims of juvenile crimes; public access to juvenile \ncourt proceedings; parental responsibility laws; zero tolerance for \ndeadbeat juvenile parents; implementation of a Serious Habitual \nOffenders Comprehensive Action Program [SHOCAP]--a comprehensive and \ncooperative information and case management process for police, \nprosecutors, schools, probation departments, corrections facilities, \nand social and community aftercare services; establishment of \ncommunity-wide partnerships involving county, municipal government, \nschool districts, and others to administrator a unified approach to \njuvenile delinquency; antitruancy initiatives; alternative schooling \nfor juvenile offenders or juveniles who are expelled or suspended from \nschool for disciplinary reasons; tougher penalties for criminal street \ngang crimes; and the establishment of penalties for juvenile offenders \nwho use a firearm during a violent crime or a drug felony.\n  The bill would provide $200 million in formula grants, a $130 million \nincrease over the FY1997 level for each fiscal year, FY1998 through \nFY2002. Under current law, states and localities must comply with \nseveral mandates to be eligible for these funds. For example, states \nmust currently ensure that (1) no status offender may be held in secure \ndetention or confinement; (2) juveniles cannot be held in jails and law \nenforcement lockup in which adults may be detained or confined for any \nperiod of time; and (3) complete sight and sound separation of juvenile \noffenders from adult offenders in secure facilities.\n  These mandates are costly and burdensome on state and local law \nenforcement efforts. For example, in February of this year, I visited \nwith law enforcement and juvenile justice officials in Kirksville, MO, \na rural community in Northeast Missouri, who told me about a problem \nthat is all too common for rural communities. A deputy juvenile officer \nsaid that local law enforcement officers were able to apprehend four \nMissouri 15-year-olds who had brutally murdered a Iowa farm wife in \nOctober of 1994, and were even able to secure confessions to the \nmurder. However, the Kirksville police could not detain the murderers \nbecause the Federal law prohibits juveniles from being held in jails in \nwhich adults may be detained and Kirksville did not have secure \ndetention facilities.\n  As a result, the teens had to be detained in other Missouri \nfacilities. Two of the teen had to be transported to Boone County, MO--\n100 miles from Kirksville--while the other two teens had to be taken to \nUnion, MO, more than 200 miles away.\n  The legislation introduced today would eliminate this absolute jail \nand lockup prohibition. If enacted, the Kirksvilles of our country \nwould no longer have to bear additional costs in trying to find a \ncompletely separate facility in order to detain violent juvenile \noffenders.\n  A thorough reform of juvenile justice systems must also include \nparticipation by our charitable and faith-based organizations. \nGovernment needs to rebuild civil society by fostering a partnership \nwith charitable and faith-based organizations to promote civic virtues \nand individual responsibility.\n  Govenrment needs to look beyond its bureaucratic, one-size-fits-all \nprograms and give assistance to those groups toiling daily in our \ncommunities, often publicly unnoticed and virtually unaided by \nGovernment.\n  For example, Teen challenge, which is headquartered in Missouri, \nreceives little or no local, State, or Federal government financial \nassistance. Teen Challenge is a nonprofit, faith-based organization \nthat works with youth, adults and families. Teen challenge has 16 \nadolescent programs in several states, including Florida, Indiana, and \nNew Mexico.\n  Most of the juveniles in the program has drug or alcohol problems. A \nlarge number of the adolescents have been physically or sexually \nabused. Almost all of them had a major problem with rebelling against \nauthority, according to a 1992 survey of Indianapolis Teen Challenge. \nThirteen percent were court-ordered placements. This same study \nindicated that 70 percent of the graduates were abstaining from illegal \ndrug use.\n  Mr. President, this bill would amend the Juvenile Justice and \nDelinquency Prevention Act to allow states to conduct with, or make \ngrants to, private, charitable and faith-based organizations to provide \nprograms for at-risk and delinquent juveniles.\n  Charitable and faith-based organizations have a proven track record \nof transforming shattered lives by addressing the deeper needs of \npeople, by instilling hope and values which help change behavior and \nattitudes. Under this bill states would be allowed to enroll these \norganizations as full-fledged participants in caring for and supporting \njuveniles who are less fortunate.\n  The bill also proposes reforms to the federal criminal justice system \nconsistent with those it encourages those states to adopt. The \nlegislation strengthens the federal law by requiring the adult \nprosecution of any juvenile age 14 or older who is alleged to have \ncommitted murder, attempted murder, robbery while armed with a \ndangerous or deadly weapon, assault or battery while armed with a \ndangerous weapon, forcible rape or a serious drug offense. Repeat \njuvenile offenders would also be subject to transfer to adult court, if \nthey have 2 previous adjudications for offenses that would amount to a \nfelony if committed by an adult.\n  Juvenile criminals found delinquent in U.S. district courts of \nviolent crimes would be fingerprinted and photographed, and then the \nfingerprints and photograph are sent to the FBI to be made available to \nthe same extent as that of adult felons to law enforcement agencies, \nschool officials, and courts for sentencing purposes.\n  In addition, the bill would clearly express the intent of Congress \nwith regard to special education students who commit criminal acts at \nschool or school-related events. Earlier this year, the Sixth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, in Morgan v. Chris L., upheld the ruling of a \ndistrict court that the Knox County Tennessee Public School violated \nthe procedural requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act (IDEA) by in essence filing criminal charges against a \nstudent with a disability. IDEA provides grants to states and creates \nspecial due process procedures for children with disabilities.\n  In this case, a student diagnosed as suffering from attention deficit \nhyperactivity disorder kicked a water pipe in the school lavatory until \nit burst--a crime against property--resulting in about $1,000 water \ndamage. The Knox County School District filed a petition in juvenile \ncourt against the child. The disabled student's father filed for a due \nprocess hearing under the IDEA to review the filing of the petition in \njuvenile court by the school. The hearing officer ordered the school \ndistrict to seek dismissal of its juvenile court petition and that \ndecision by the hearing officer was upheld by the Federal District \nCourt and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  The Court of Appeals concluded that under ``IDEA's procedural \nsafeguards, the school system must adopt its own plan and institute a \n[multi-disciplinary] team meeting before initiating a juvenile court \npetition.'' The problem with the circuit court's holding is that the \nspecial due process procedures for disabled students take several \nmonths, and sometimes a year, to complete. The practical effect of the \nruling is that schools, as a matter of law, cannot unilaterally file \ncharges against disabled students unless students' parents consent to \nsuch referrals. Schools must keep a student in school--potentially \nendangering others--and wait until the completion of the due process \nprocedures required by IDEA.\n  In addition to Tennessee, other States--such as Georgia, Ohio, \nMinnesota, Illinois, Michigan, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire--allow \nindividuals, including school officials who witness students committing \ncrimes at school, to file petitions in juvenile courts against the \nstudents. School officials should not be required to exhaust the IDEA's \nsignificant due process procedures before filing criminal juvenile \npetitions against students with disabilities.\n  The ramifications of the sixth circuit's ruling have been immediate \nand troubling for school districts. Citing the ruling of the Chris L \nholding as authority, a Knox County, TN chancellor recently set aside \nthe juvenile conviction of a high school special education student--\nbecause he is deaf in his right ear--who brought a butterfly knife to\n\n[[Page S4226]]\n\nschool. The chancellor court based its decision on the fact that the \nschool had failed to convene a multidisciplinary team before referring \nthe student with a disability to the juvenile court. The chancellor, \nwhen asked about his ruling, reportedly said, ``There's a serious \nquestion to whether or not a student under this IDEA program can be \ncharged at all.''\n  The bill we are introducing today would make it clear to the \nTennessee chancellor and other courts that students with disabilities \nwho commit criminal acts on school property are not shielded from \nimmediate referral to juvenile court or law enforcement authorities \nunder IDEA's special due process procedures. We must restore the \ncapacity of schools to create secure environments where all students \ncan learn and achieve their highest potential.\n  Mr. President, this bill would assist State and local governments in \nincreasing public safety by holding juvenile criminals accountable for \ntheir serious and violent crimes, by encouraging accountability through \nthe imposition of meaningful sanctions for delinquent acts, and by \nimproving the extent, accuracy, availability, and usefulness of \njuvenile criminal records and public accessibility to juvenile court \nproceedings.\n  In short, Mr. President, enactment of the Juvenile Crime Control and \nCommunity Protection Act of 1997 would be a significant step in the \nright direction toward addressing America's juvenile crime problem.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, last month, I talked about the importance \nof the innovative ``Community Justice'' model for juvenile justice \nbeing developed in Deschutes County and Multnomah County, OR. Today, \nSenators Domenici and Ashcroft and I are introducing legislation that \nincorporates many important pieces of this Oregon model and also \nrepresents an effort to bring some new, bipartisan thinking to the \nissue of juvenile justice.\n  Oregon's idea is that the juvenile justice system should weave the \ncommunity into the very fabric of juvenile justice. This entails \ntreating the victim as a customer of the juvenile justice system and \nrealizing that when a crime is committed the whole community is the \nvictim. There is a reciprocal obligation in communities--first, to give \nchildren the values and tools to ensure that youth crime is prevented \nand second, to look for at-risk children and try to form a net of \nservices to keep these children from getting into trouble. However, \nonce a young person steps over the line and commits a crime, part of \nthe reciprocity involves the youth making the community whole through \nrestitution and community service.\n  I was pleased to work with Senators Domenici and Ashcroft to include \nsome of these Oregon ideas into this bill. In particular, I think that \nthe second tier of incentive grants will help encourage States to come \nup with ways to integrate the community into the juvenile justice \nprocess. In particular, the bill promotes consideration for victims and \nrestitution for all crimes. It will also ensure that this restitution \nis collected. The legislation encourages States to look at mentorship \nprograms, parent accountability, and ways to bring together service \nproviders to form a network of information sharing to prevent juvenile \ncrime.\n  One of the key aspects of the Deschutes County model that is so \nimpressive is the coordination between schools, juvenile justice \nservices, child protection services, police, district attorneys, \njudges, and others. Not only does this build a broad base of support \nfor the juvenile justice system, but it allows these agencies to \nidentify the most at-risk youth early, to see whether efforts to divert \nthem from delinquency are effective and to concentrate resources on \nthem.\n  When I began working on this issue in 1995, I laid out three \nprinciples for a new juvenile justice system: community protection, \naccountability, and restitution. We need to keep our streets safe, \npunish criminals, and make sure victims--including the community \nitself--are repaid. This legislation will encourage States to develop \nsystems based on these principles and to add to the the important \ningredient of community involvement in the juvenile justice system.\n  I thank the Senators from Missouri and New Mexico for their \nbipartisan effort to develop juvenile justice legislation that takes a \nbalanced approach to juvenile justice.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 719. A bill to expedite the naturalization of aliens who served \nwith special guerrilla units in Laos; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n             the hmong veterans' naturalization act of 1997\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today, I have introduced the \nHmong Veterans' Naturalization Act of 1997.\n  The purpose of this bill is to help expedite the naturalization of \nHmong veterans who served and fought alongside the United States during \nthe United States secret war in Laos. This legislation acknowledges \ntheir service and officially recognizes the service of Hmong and other \nethnic Lao veterans who sacrificed and loyally fought for America and \nits principles of freedom, human rights, and democracy.\n  This legislation continues the tradition of recognizing the service \nof those who came to the aid of the United States in times of war. \nCurrent law permits aliens or noncitizens who served honorably in the \nU.S. military forces during wartime to be naturalized, regardless of \nage, period of U.S. residence, or physical presence in the United \nStates. However, expedited naturalization does not apply to Hmong and \nLao veterans and their families because of the covert status of their \nwork. This bill would help expedite this process by eliminating the \nliteracy requirement in the naturalization process.\n  Classified studies conducted by the defense policy think tank RAND \nhave recently been declassified. They show the unique and important \nrole that the Hmong people played during the Vietnam war. The studies \nreveal that this group, the ``Secret Army,'' specially created by the \nUnited States Government, played a critical role in the clandestine \nmilitary activities in Laos.\n  Hmong men, women, and children of all ages fought and died alongside \nU.S. military personnel in units recruited, organized, trained, funded \nand paid by the U.S. Government. It is estimated that during the United \nStates involvement in Vietnam, 35,000 to 40,000 Hmong veterans and \ntheir families' were killed in conflict. 50,000 to 58,000 were wounded \nin conflict and an additional 2,500 to 3,000 were declared missing.\n  During the Vietnam conflict, Hmong forces were responsible for \nrisking their lives by crossing enemy lines to rescue downed American \npilots. It is estimated that they saved at least 60 American lives and \noften lost half their troops rescuing one soldier.\n  When the United States withdrew from Southeast Asia, thousands of \nHmong were evacuated by the U.S. Government. However, many were left \nbehind and experienced mass genocide at the hands of Communists. Many \nfled to neighboring Thailand. During their journey, many were murdered \nbefore they reached the Thai border. Even today, despite official \ndenial by the Lao Government, the Communist regime of Laos continues to \npersecute and discriminate against the Hmong specifically because of \ntheir role in the United States secret army.\n  Edgar Buell, the senior U.S. CIA official who worked with the Hmong \nsecret army, explained their critical role on national television:\n  ``Everyone of them (Hmong) that died, that was an American back home \nthat didn't die, or one that was injured that wasn't injured. Somebody \nin nearly every Hmong family was either fighting or died from fighting. \nThey became refugees because we (the United States) encouraged them to \nfight for us. I promised myself: `` `Have no fear, we will take care of \nyou.' ''\n  It is now time to live up to earlier promises and take care of this \ngroup that so valiantly fought alongside American forces. We can only \nmake good on our word by passing this legislation.\n  Currently, many of the 45,000 former soldiers and their refugee \nfamily members living in the United States cannot become citizens \nbecause they lack the sufficient English language skills to pass the \nnaturalization test. The intense and protracted war in Laos and the \nsubsequent exodus of the Hmong veterans into squalid refugee camps did\n\n[[Page S4227]]\n\nnot permit these veterans the opportunity to attend school and learn \nEnglish. Also, many suffer from injuries that occurred during the war \nthat make learning difficult and frustrating.\n  Because of the welfare and immigration reform bill enacted last \nCongress, aging, elderly, illiterate (in English), semiliterate and \nwounded soldiers--usually with large families--will suffer greatly \nbecause they are now facing the almost impossible task of immediately \nlearning English and finding gainful employment. People like Chanh \nChantalangsy are faced with an uncertain future:\n  Chanh served in the secret army and was seriously wounded in his \nhead, arm, and legs. After being in the hospital for 7 months, he \nreturned to combat, serving in a CIA sponsored unit. Fleeing Laos, he \nspent 14 years in a refugee camp in Thailand. Realizing that the \nconditions in his country would not improve, Chanh left the refugee \ncamp and came to the United States. He studied English for 5 years but \nit became evident that mental and physical injuries prevented him from \nlearning English. In 1993, he was classified disabled and now receives \n$561 a month in SSI benefits. As of August, he could lose this small \nbenefit.\n  Given the unique role that the veterans served on behalf of the U.S. \nnational security interests, we should waive the difficult \nnaturalization requirements for this group. We have a responsibility to \nthese people. This responsibility was supported by former CIA Director \nWilliam Colby when he said to a House subcommittee:\n  ``The basic burden (of fighting in Laos) was born by the Hmong. We \ncertainly encouraged them to fight. We enabled them to fight in many \ncases, and I think the spirit that they developed was in part a result \nof our offering of support and our provision of it.''\n  Mr. President, it is now time to give our support. These people \nfought for our country for 15 years and came to the United States with \nan understanding that they would be cared for. One act of Congress, the \nwelfare reform law, wiped out this understanding and threw the Hmong \ninto a state of despair. They neither have the capacity to care for \nthemselves if benefits are terminated, nor the ability to return to \ntheir homeland. I implore my colleagues to support one more act of \nCongress that would fulfill our pledge and our obligation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 719\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security \nAct to expand and make permanent the availability of cost-effective, \ncomprehensive acute and long-term care services to frail elderly \npersons through Programs of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) \nunder the medicare and medicaid programs; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     THE PACE PROVIDER ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today, \nalong with Senator Inouye, the distinguished Senator from Hawaii, the \nPACE Provider Act of 1997. PACE, the Program of All-Inclusive Care for \nthe Elderly, is a unique system of integrated care for the frail \nelderly. This Act increases the number of PACE sites authorized to \nprovide comprehensive, community-based services to frail, elderly \npersons.\n  As our population ages, we must continue to place a high priority on \nlong-term care services. Giving our seniors alternatives to nursing \nhome care and expanding the choices available, is not only cost \neffective, but will also improve the quality of life for older \nAmericans.\n  PACE programs achieve this goal. PACE enables the frail elderly to \nremain as healthy as possible, at home in their communities. By doing \nso, elderly individuals maintain their independence, dignity and \nquality of life.\n  Each PACE participant receives a comprehensive care package, \nincluding all Medicare and Medicaid services, as well as community-\nbased long-term care services. Each individual is cared for by an \ninterdisciplinary team consisting of a primary care physician, nurse, \nsocial worker, rehabilitation therapist, home health worker, and \nothers. Because care providers on the PACE team work together, they are \nable to successfully accommodate the complex medical and social needs \nof the elderly person in fragile health.\n  What's more, PACE provides high-quality care at a lower cost to \nMedicare and Medicaid, relative to their payments in the traditional \nsystem. Studies show a 5-15 percent reduction in Medicare and Medicaid \nspending for individuals in PACE.\n  The potential savings to Medicare and Medicaid is significant. PACE \nprograms provide services for one of our most vulnerable, and costly, \npopulation: frail, elderly adults who are eligible for Medicare and \nMedicaid. In many cases, these ``dually eligible'' individuals have \ncomplex, chronic care needs and require ongoing, long-term care \nservices. The current structure of Medicare and Medicaid does not \nencourage coordination of these services. The result is fragmented and \ncostly care for our nation's most vulnerable population.\n  The PACE Provider Act does not alter the criteria for eligibility for \nPACE participation in any way. Instead, it makes PACE programs more \navailable to individuals already eligible for nursing home care, \nbecause of their poor health status. PACE is a preferable, and less \ncostly, alternative. Specifically, this Act increases the number of \nPACE programs authorized from 15 to 40, with an additional 20 to be \nadded each year, and affords regular ``provider'' status to existing \nsites.\n  The PACE Provider Act allows the success of PACE programs to be \nreplicated throughout the country. And, with an emphasis on \npreventative and supportive services, PACE services can substantially \nreduce the high-costs associated with emergency room visits and \nextended nursing home stays often needed by the frail elderly in the \ntraditional Medicare and Medicaid programs.\n  My sponsorship of this bill grows out of my Aging Committee hearing \non April 29, Torn Between Two Systems: Improving Chronic Care in \nMedicare and Medicaid. The plight of the dual eligibles is \nunacceptable. This bill is an immediate and positive step in the right \ndirection.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S4228]]\n\n                                 S. 720\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I join my colleagues in introducing \nthe PACE Provider Act of 1997. I am pleased to support this very worthy \nprogram, aimed at increasing community based long term care options for \nseniors which was initiated and pursued by Senator Dole over the past \nseveral years.\n  This bill amends present law by increasing the number of high \nquality, comprehensive, community based services available to seniors \nwho would otherwise be forced into nursing homes.\n  Frail older people, particularly those 85 years and older are the \nfastest growing population group in this country and have multiple and \ncomplex chronic illnesses. More than 50 percent of this population \nrequire some assistance with activities of daily living.\n  At the same time, the cost of caring for the frail elderly is \nskyrocketing. Many elderly and individuals with disabilities are \neligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. These dual eligibles have \nmultidimensional, interdependent, and chronic health care needs. They \nare at risk for nursing home placement and require acute and long-term \ncare service integration if they are to remain at home. However, as \ncurrently structured, the Medicare and Medicaid Programs are not \nsufficiently coordinated to serve many of these complex health needs. \nIn addition, these programs have traditionally favored institutional \ncare rather than community based or home care. These problems result in \nduplication and fragmentation of services as well as increased health \ncosts.\n  In my own State of Tennessee, the home health industry has come under \nfire because of high Medicare utilization rates. This is partly because \nthere are almost no Medicaid long term care options available to \nTennesseans who want to stay at home. Consequently, nursing home care \nis the only option for frail elders unless they have enough money to \npay privately for their care or if family members can afford to be the \nprimary giver. Tennesseans should be able to choose from a broad array \nof community based long term care services and should not be limited to \ninstitutional care.\n  So, if we are to control costs while providing high quality care to \nthis vulnerable population, we must increase long term care \nopportunities and provide better coordination between Medicare and \nMedicaid reimbursement systems.\n  PACE, Program for All-inclusive Care of the Elderly, is the only \nprogram which integrates acute and long term care service delivery and \nfinance. Designed to help the at-risk elderly who need service \nintegration, it represents a fundamental shift in the way needed health \nservices are accessed. By using capitation mechanisms which pool funds \nfrom Medicare, Medicaid and private pay sources, this program joins \nmedical services with established long term care services. Care is \nmanaged and coordinated by an interdisciplinary team that is \nresponsible for service allocation decisions.\n\n[[Page S4232]]\n\n  As a result: duplicate services and ineffective treatments are \neliminated; participants have access to the entire spectrum of acute \nand long-term care services, all provided and coordinated by a single \norganization; and enrollees are relieved of the burden of independently \nnavigating the bewildering health-care maze.\n  How well has it worked? The accomplishments of PACE include: \ncontrolled utilization of both outpatient and inpatient services; \ncontrolled utilization of specialist services; high consumer \nsatisfaction; capitation rates which provide significant savings from \nper capita nursing home costs or community long term care costs; and \nethnic and racial distributions of beneficiaries served which reflect \nthe communities from which PACE draws its participants.\n  Most importantly, PACE has been able to shift location of care from \nthe inpatient acute care setting to the community setting. By \nintegrating social and medical services through adult day health care, \nPACE has made it possible for frail elders to continue to live at home, \nnot in a nursing care facility.\n  Are there other alternatives? Medicare HMO's and Social HMO's have \nalso attempted to control costs while providing access to high quality \ncare. However, Medicare HMO's exclude long term care and typically do \nnot serve many frail older persons on an ongoing basis. Social HMO's \nalso limit the long term care benefits available to their members. \nThese programs are important, but simply do not meet the needs of this \nparticular population. PACE, on the other hand, serves frail elders \nexclusively and provide a continuum of care. It provides all acute and \nlong term care services according to participant needs and without \nlimits on benefits.\n  Unfortunately, the number of persons enrolled in PACE nationally is \nminuscule compared with other managed care systems. States such as \nTennessee are eager to participate. However, the number of \nparticipating sites has been capped under current legislation.\n\n  The PACE Provider Act of 1997 increases the number of sites \nauthorized to provide comprehensive, community-based services to frail, \nolder adults from 15 to 40 with an additional 20 to be added each year; \nand affords regular provider status to existing sites.\n  Specifically, the bill:\n  Specifies that PACE sites be lower in cost than the alternative \nhealth care services available to PACE enrollees, a goal which has \nalready been accomplished; includes quality of care safeguards; gives \nStates the option of utilizing PACE programs based on their need for \nalternatives to long-term institutional care and the program's \ncontinuing cost-effectiveness; and allows for-profit entities to \nparticipate in PACE as a demonstration project.\n  PACE services frail older people of diverse ethnic heritage and has \noperated successfully under different state and local environments. \nThis program deserves expansion.\n  The PACE Provider Act of 1997 does exactly that. It makes the PACE \nalternative available for the first time to many communities. It also \nallows more entities in the healthcare marketplace to participate in a \nnew way of providing care for frail elders. PACE gives us a chance to \ncontain costs while providing high quality care to one of our most \nvulnerable populations.\n  The PACE program's integration of health and social services, its \ncost-effective, coordinated system of care delivery and its method of \nintegrated financing have wide applicability and appeal. It is an \nexciting way to satisfying an urgent need and I wholeheartedly support \nit.\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I introduce the PACE Provider Act \nof 1997 with my distinguished colleague Senator Grassley.\n  The Program for All-inclusive Care for the Elderly [PACE] Act of 1997 \nbegan in 1983 with the passage of legislation authorizing On Lok, the \nprototype for the PACE model, as a demonstration program. In 1986 \nCongress passed legislation to test the replicability of On Lok's \nsuccess by authorizing Medicare and Medicaid waivers for up to 10 \nreplication sites; and in 1989 the number of authorized sites was \nincreased to 15. The PACE Provider Act of 1997 is the next step in a \nseries of legislative actions taken by Congress to develop PACE as a \ncommunity-based alternative to nursing home care.\n  Currently PACE programs provide services to approximately 3,000 \nindividuals in eight States: California, Colorado, Massachusetts, New \nYork, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, and Wisconsin. There are also 15 \nPACE programs in development which are operational, although not \ninvolved in Medicare capitation. In addition, a number of other \norganizations are actively working to develop PACE programs in other \nStates including: Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, New Mexico, Michigan, \nOhio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Washington.\n  PACE is unique in a variety of ways. First, PACE programs serve only \nthe very frail--older persons who meet their States' eligibility \ncriteria for nursing home care. This high-cost population is of \nparticular concern to policy makers because of the disproportionate \nshare of resources they use relative to their numbers.\n  Second, PACE programs provide a comprehensive package of primary \nacute and long-term care services. All services, including primary and \nspecialty medical care, adult day care, home care, nursing, social work \nservices, physical and occupational therapies, prescription drugs, \nhospital and nursing home care are coordinated and administered by PACE \nprogram staff.\n  Third, PACE programs are cost-effective in that they are reimbursed \non a capitated basis, at rates that provide payers savings relative to \ntheir expenditures in the traditional Medicare, Medicaid, and private \npay systems. Finally, PACE programs are unique in that a mature program \nassumes total financial risk and responsibility for all acute and long-\nterm care without limitation.\n  The PACE Provider Act does not expand eligibility criteria for \nbenefits in any way. Rather, it makes available to individuals already \neligible for nursing home care, because of their poor health status, a \npreferable, and less costly alternative.\n  By expanding the availability of community-based long-term care \nservices, On Lok's success of providing high quality care with an \nemphasis on preventive and supportive services, can be replicated \nthroughout the country. PACE programs have substantially reduced \nutilization of high-cost inpatient services. Although all PACE \nenrollees are eligible for nursing home care, just 6 percent of these \nindividuals are permanently institutionalized. The vast majority are \nable to remain in the community and PACE enrollees are also \nhospitalized less frequently. Through PACE, dollars that would have \nbeen spent on hospital and nursing home services are used to expand the \navailability of community-based long-term care.\n  This bill would expand the number of non-profit entities to become \nPACE providers to 45 within the first year and allow 20 new such \nprograms each year thereafter. In addition, the PACE Provider Act of \n1997 will establish a demonstration project to allow no more than 10 \nfor-profit organizations to establish themselves as PACE providers. The \nnumber of for-profit entities will not be counted against the numerical \nlimitation specified for non-profit organizations.\n  Analyses of costs for individuals enrolled in PACE show a 5- to 15-\npercent reduction in Medicare and Medicaid spending relative to a \ncomparably frail population in the traditional Medicare and Medicaid \nsystems.\n  States have voluntarily joined together with community organizations \nto develop PACE programs out of their commitment to developing viable \nalternatives to institutionalization. This legislation provides States \nwith the option of pursuing PACE development; and, as under present \nlaw, State participation would remain voluntary.\n  As our population ages, we must continue to place a high priority on \nlong-term care services. Giving our seniors alternatives to nursing \nhome care and expanding the choices available, is not only cost-\neffective, but will also improve the quality of life for older \nAmericans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI:\n  S. 721. A bill to require the Federal Trade Commission to conduct a \nstudy of the marketing and advertising practices of manufacturers and \nretailers of personal computers; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n\n[[Page S4233]]\n\n         THE PERSONAL COMPUTER TRUTH IN ADVERTISING ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today I am introducing ``The \nPersonal Computer Truth in Advertising Act of 1997,'' which is designed \nto ensure that consumers are provided with accurate information about \nthe performance of what is becoming one of the most important consumer \nproducts in the Nation, the personal computer.\n  My bill requires the Federal Trade Commission to investigate and \nconduct a study of the marketing and advertising practices of personal \ncomputer manufacturers and retailers with regard to possibly misleading \nclaims made about the performance of their products.\n  As we head into the next century, the personal computer is quickly \nbecoming one of the most important consumer products. Indeed, the \nmarket for computers in the home has exploded in recent years with the \nmarket expected to double by 2000. Still, despite their growing \npopularity, purchasing a personal computer involves technology and \nterminology that can be very intimidating and confusing to the average \nconsumer.\n  Of particular concern to me is a practice by personal computer \nretailers and manufacturers in how they advertise the speed of the \ncentral processing unit (CPU) of the personal computer. Indeed, when \nmarketing and advertising personal computers, the CPU speed is a \nprominent selling point and consumers are frequently charged hundreds \nof dollars more for models with faster CPU's.\n  The CPU is to the personal computer as an engine is to an automobile. \nMeasured in millions of cycles per second [mhz], the faster the CPU, \nthe better the software performs. The CPU's in personal computers, \nincluding the popular Pentium chip, operate at two speeds, an external \nspeed and an internal speed. The external speed affects computing \nactivity the user sees in action--the scrolling of a web page or a word \nprocessing document, the smoothness of an animated interactive \nstorybook and the complexity and frame rate of a flight simulator. The \ninternal speed of the CPU involves activity invisible to the user--\nspreadsheet calculations, spell checking and database organization.\n  Nonetheless, personal computers are commonly marketed according to \ntheir internal, and faster, speed. For example, a Pentium computer \nadvertised as a 200 mhz screamer runs at only 66 mhz externally. Still, \nmost advertisements fail to mention this discrepancy and retailers and \nmanufacturers charge hundreds of dollars more for the 200 mhz than they \nwould for a 66 mhz model.\n  Moreover, driving the sales of personal computers has been the \navailability of advanced multimedia and interactive entertainment \nsoftware. This is the very software whose performance depends greatly \non the CPU's external clock speed.\n  My legislation would require the Federal Trade Commission to conduct \na study of the marketing and advertising practices of manufacturers and \nretailers of personal computers, with particular emphasis on claims \nmade about the CPU. My bill requires the FTC to perform their study \nwithin 180 days of enactment of the bill. I had previously written to \nthe FTC on this issue as a member of the House.\n  Car manufacturers provide both highway and city mileage performance \nfigures for the performance of their engines and computer manufacturers \nshould follow the same logic with the engines of the personal computer, \nthe CPU.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill and I will work hard for \nits enactment into law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 721\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Personal Computer Truth in \n     Advertising Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) computer manufacturers and retailers commonly refer to \n     the speed of the central processing unit of a personal \n     computer in selling a personal computer;\n       (2) computer manufacturers and retailers commonly charge \n     hundreds of dollars more for a CPU that has a faster speed;\n       (3) all CPUs operate at 2 speeds (measured in megahertz \n     (MHz)), an external speed and an internal speed;\n       (4) the external speed of a personal computer affects \n     computing activities that computer users experience, \n     including the scrolling of a word processing document, the \n     smoothness of an animation, and the complexity and frame rate \n     of a flight simulator;\n       (5) the internal speed of a personal computer, which is \n     faster than the external speed of the computer, affects \n     activities, such as spreadsheet calculations, spelling \n     checks, and database organizations;\n       (6) it is common for manufacturers and retailers to mention \n     the internal speed of a CPU without mentioning its external \n     speed for the marketing and advertising of a personal \n     computer; and\n       (7) a study by the Federal Trade Commission would assist in \n     determining whether any practice of computer retailers and \n     manufacturers in providing CPU speeds in advertising and \n     marketing personal computers is deceptive, for purposes of \n     the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.).\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to benefit consumers by promoting competition in the \nelectric power industry, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\nThe Electric Utility Restructuring Empowerment and Competitiveness Act \n                            of 1997 [EURECA]\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Electric \nUtility Restructuring Empowerment and Competitiveness Act of 1997. This \nlegislation, which gives states the authority to order the delivery of \nelectric energy to all retail consumers, is based on the idea that less \ngovernment intervention is the best way to achieve affordable, reliable \nand competitive options for retail electric energy services.\n  This is a substantially different approach from other measures that \nhave been introduced in both the House and Senate to restructure the \nnation's electric utility industry. I do not believe that a federal \nmandate on the states requiring retail competition by a date certain is \nin the best interest of all classes of customers. I am concerned that \nthis method could result in increased electricity rates for low-density \nstates or states that have relatively low-cost power. Electricity is an \nessential commodity critical to everyday life in this country. It is \nalso an industry heavily regulated at the Federal and State levels. If \nthe Congress is going to make fundamental changes to the last major \nregulated monopoly, its role should be to help implement competitive \nchanges in a positive manner, rather than interject the heavy hand of \ngovernment with a ``Washington-knows-best'' mentality.\n  This legislation comes down on the side of States' rights. Having \nbeen involved in the electric power industry, I understand the unique \ncharacteristics of each State. As most everyone knows, California was \nthe first State to\n\n[[Page S4234]]\n\npass a retail choice law. Since that time, Arizona, Massachusetts, New \nJersey, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Texas, Montana, Oklahoma and \nothers have followed suit.\n  According to Bruce Ellsworth, President of the National Association \nof Regulatory Utility Commissioners [NARUC], ``more than one-third of \nthe Nation's population live in states that have chosen within the last \nyear to move to open-access, customer choice markets.'' All told, every \nstate except one is in the process of either examining or implementing \npolicies for retail consumers of electric energy. States are clearly \ntaking the lead--they should continue to have that role--and this bill \nconfirms their authority by affirming States' ability to implement \nretail choice policies.\n  This initiative leaves important functions, including the ability to \nrecover stranded costs, establish and enforce reliability standards, \npromote renewable energy resources and support public benefit and \nassistance to low-income and rural consumer programs in the hands of \nState Public Service Commissions [PUC's]. If a State desires to impose \na funding mechanism--such as wires charges--to encourage that a certain \npercentage of energy production comes from renewable alternatives, they \nshould have that opportunity. However, I do not believe a nationally \nmandated set-aside is the best way to promote competition. Likewise, \nindividual states would have the authority over retail transactions. \nThis ensures that certain customers could not bypass their local \ndistribution system and avoid responsibility for paying their share of \nstranded costs.\n\n  One of the most important aspects of this debate--assuring that \nuniversal service is maintained--is a critical function that each State \nPUC should have the ability to oversee and enforce. In my legislation, \nnothing would prohibit a state from requiring all electricity providers \nthat sell electricity to retail customers in that state to provide \nelectricity service to all classes and consumers of electric power.\n  Mr. President, at the wholesale level, my proposal attempts to create \ngreater competition by prospectively exempting the sale of electricity \nfor resale from rates determined by the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission [FERC]. Although everyone talks about ``deregulating'' the \nelectricity industry, it is really the generation segment that will be \nderegulated. The FERC will continue to regulate transmission in \ninterstate commerce, and State PUC's will continue to regulate retail \ndistribution services and sales.\n  When FERC issued Order 888 last year, it allowed utilities to seek \nmarket-based rates for new generating capacity. This provision goes a \nstep further and allows utilities to purchase wholesale power from \nexisting generating facilities, after the date of enactment of this \nAct, at prices solely determined by market forces.\n  Furthermore, the measure expands FERC authority to require non-public \nutilities that own, operate or control transmission to open their \nsystems. Currently, the Commission cannot require the Federal Power \nMarketing Administrations [PMA's], the Tennessee Valley Authority \n[TVA], municipalities and cooperatives that own transmission, to \nprovide wholesale open access transmission service. According to \nElizabeth Moler, Chairwoman of FERC, approximately 22 percent of all \ntransmission is beyond open access authority. Requiring these non-\npublic utilities to provide this service will help ensure that a true \nwholesale power market exists.\n  One of the key elements of this measure is streamlining and \nmodernizing the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 [PURPA] \nand the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 [PUHCA]. While both \nof these initiatives were enacted with good intentions, and their \nobligations fulfilled, there is widespread consensus that the Acts have \noutlived their usefulness.\n  My bill amends section 210 of PURPA on a prospective basis. Current \nPURPA contracts would continue to be honored and upheld. However, upon \nenactment of this legislation, a utility that begins operating would \nnot be required to enter into a new contract or obligation to purchase \nelectricity under section 210 of PURPA.\n  With regard to PUHCA, I chose to incorporate Senator D'Amato's \nrecently introduced legislation in my bill. As Chairman of the Senate \nBanking Committee, which has jurisdiction over the issue, he has \ncrafted a proposal that I believe will successfully reform the statute \nand I support his efforts. Under his proposal, the provisions of PUHCA \nwould be repealed 18 months after the Act is signed into law. \nFurthermore, all books and records of each holding company and each \nassociate company would be transferred from the Securities and Exchange \nCommission [SEC]--which currently has jurisdiction over the 15 \nregistered holding companies--to the FERC. This allows energy \nregulators, who truly know the industry, to oversee the operations of \nthese companies and review acquisitions and mergers. These consumer \nprotections are an important part of PUHCA reform.\n  Mr. President, an issue which must be resolved in order for a true \ncompetitive environment to exist is that of utilities receiving special \n``subsidies'' by the federal government and the U.S. tax code. For \nyears, investor-owned utilities [IOU's] have claimed inequity because \nof tax-exempt financing and low-interest loans that municipalities and \nrural cooperatives receive. On the other side of the equation, these \npublic power systems maintain that IOU's are able to receive special \ntax treatment, not offered to them, which amounts to a ``tax free'' \nloan. The jury is still out on how best to deal with this thorny and, \nundoubtedly complex matter, but make no mistake about it, changes will \nbe made.\n  A viable option the Congress should consider is to ``build a fence'' \naround governmental utilities. Sales in existing service territories \ncould continue to be financed using current methods. However, for sales \noutside of their traditional boundaries, these systems should operate \non the same basis and play by the same rules as other competitors.\n  The Congress should also address existing tax structures to determine \nif the ``benefits'' tax-paying utilities receive results in unfair \nadvantages against their competitors. While tax initiatives, such as \naccelerated depreciation and investment tax credits, are available to \nall businesses that pay income tax, if this amounts to ``subsidies'' \nreforms may have to be made.\n  My bill would direct the Inspector General of the Department of \nTreasury to file a report to the Congress detailing whether and how tax \ncode incentives received by all utilities should be reviewed in order \nto foster a competitive retail electricity market in the future. \nFurthermore, I am pleased that Senator Murkowski, Chairman of the \nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, requested a report by \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation to review all subsidies and incentives \nthat investor-owned, publicly-owned and cooperatively-owned utilities \nreceive.\n  Mr. President, I believe EURECA is a common-sense approach that \nattempts to build consensus to solve some of the critical questions \nassociated with this important issue. The states are moving and should \ncontinue to have the ability to craft electricity restructuring plans \nthat recognize the uniqueness of each state. This legislation is the \nbest solution to foster the debate and allow us to move forward with a \nbetter product for all classes of consumers and the industry as a \nwhole.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 723. A bill to increase the safety of the American people by \npreventing dangerous military firearms in the control of foreign \ngovernments from being imported into the United States, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n                   THE ANTI-GUN INVASION ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today Senators Boxer and Kerry \nand I are introducing legislation to ensure that millions of lethal \nAmerican-manufactured military weapons will not be imported into this \ncountry. Representatives Patrick Kennedy and Maloney are introducing \ncompanion legislation in the House of Representatives.\n  The bill we are introducing repeals a loophole in the law that could \nallow U.S. military weapons that were provided to foreign countries to \nbe sold back to gun dealers in this country. The loophole permits the \nimport of so-called ``curios or relics'' --weapons considered to have \nhistoric value or which are more than 50 years old.\n\n[[Page S4235]]\n\n About 2.5 million American-manufactured military weapons that the U.S. \nGovernment gave away, sold, or were taken as spoils of war by foreign \ngovernments are at issue. This includes 1.2 million M-1 carbines, which \nare easily converted to fully automatic weapons. Though these weapons \nare older, they are lethal. I don't want them flooding America's \nstreets. And I don't want foreign governments making a windfall by \nselling them to commercial gun dealers.\n  As some of my colleagues may know, the term ``curios or relics'' was \noriginally used in the Gun Control Act of 1968 to make it easier for \nlicensed collectors to buy curios or relics weapons from outside his or \nher State of residence. The Treasury Department came up with a \ndefinition and list of ``curios or relics'' for this purpose. At that \ntime, importation of surplus military weapons--whether of United States \nor foreign origin--was prohibited, and the curios or relics list had \nnothing to do with importing weapons.\n  Nearly 20 years later, in 1984, a law was passed that expanded the \nscope of the curios or relics list in ways never foreseen at the time \nthe list was first created. The modified law said that guns that were \non the curios or relics list could not just be sold interstate within \nthis country, but could be imported as well.\n  However, the Arms Export Control Act still prohibited the importation \nof U.S. military weapons that had been furnished to foreign \ngovernments. Although a 1987 amendment to that Act authorized the \nimportation of U.S.-origin military weapons on the curios or relics \nlist as well, only one import license has been granted under the curios \nor relics exception. Since that isolated incident, every \nadministration--Reagan, Bush, and Clinton--has adopted a policy \nestablished by the Reagan administration and based on the Arms Export \nControl Act of denying these kinds of import licenses.\n  Though the Clinton administration and the past two Republican \nadministrations have opposed importing these lethal weapons, the NRA \nsupports importing them and it has allies on the Hill. Last year, an \neffort was made in the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill to \nforce the State Department to allow these weapons to be imported for \nany reason. That effort was killed as part of the negotiations on the \ncatchall appropriations bill that was signed into law on September 30.\n  The provision included in the Senate version of the C, J, S \nappropriations bill last year, section 621, would have prohibited any \nagency of the Government--notwithstanding any other provision of law--\nfrom using appropriated funds to deny an application for a permit to \nimport previously exported United States-origin military firearms, \nparts, or ammunition that are considered to be curios or relics. The \nprovision would have forced the State Department to allow large numbers \nof U.S. military firearms that are currently in the possession of \nforeign governments to enter the United States commercially. Because so \nmany of those firearms can be easily converted to automatic weapons, it \nwould have undermined efforts to reduce gun violence in this country. \nIn addition, it could have provided a windfall for foreign governments \nat the expense of the taxpayer.\n\n  Certainly the dangers posed by many guns on the curios or relics \nlist--in particular the M-1 carbine, which is easily converted into an \nautomatic weapon--are an important reason for preventing imports of \nthose guns. It is the main reason I am proposing legislation to clarify \nthe law to prevent imports in the future. But the provisions of the \nArms Export Control Act that limit the imports are not merely \ntechnical. They support a principle, included in the Arms Export \nControl Act, that is basic to the integrity of our foreign military \nassistance program: No foreign government should be allowed to do \nanything with weapons we have given them that we ourselves would not do \nwith them. For example, the Department of Defense does not transfer \nweapons to a country that is our enemy; no foreign government should be \nallowed to use U.S.-supplied weapons in that way. The Department of \nDefense does not sell its excess guns directly to commercial dealers in \nthe United States, and foreign governments should not be able to do so \neither.\n  As recently as 1994, the General Services Administration Federal \nweapons task force reviewed U.S. policy for the disposal of firearms \nand confirmed a longstanding Government policy against selling or \ntransferring excess weapons out of Government channels. The Federal \nGovernment has made a decision that it should not be an arms merchant. \nThe Federal regulations that emerged from that task force review are \nclear. They say surplus firearms may be sold only for scrap after total \ndestruction by crushing, cutting, breaking, or deforming to be \nperformed in a manner to ensure that the firearms are rendered \ncompletely inoperative and to preclude their being made operative. \nThese are sound regulations. The Department of Defense does not sell \nits guns to private arms dealers. Under the Arms Export Control Act, we \nshould not allow foreign governments to sell 2.5 million U.S. military \nweapons to private arms dealers either.\n  Flooding the market with these curios and relics would only make it \nharder for law enforcement to do its job. The Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco, and Firearms has already seen an increase in M-1 carbines that \nhave been converted to fully automatic machine guns due to the \navailability and relatively low cost of the weapons. The more military \nweapons there are in this country, the more likely they are to fall \ninto criminal hands. Surplus military weapons are usually cheap, and, \nif a government sells its whole stockpile, plentiful. A sudden increase \nin supply of M-1 garands and carbines and M-1911 pistols would drive \ndown the price, making them less attractive to the collector and more \nattractive to the criminal.\n  In fact, the administration opposed last year's provision, in part, \nbecause of the increased availability of low-cost weapons for criminals \nthat invariably would have resulted. According to the administration, \n``The criminal element thrives on low-cost firearms that are \nconcealable, or capable of accepting large-capacity magazines, or \ncapable of being easily converted to fully automatic fire. Thus, such \nweapons would be particularly enticing to the criminal element. In \nshort, the net effect of the proposal would be to thwart the \nadministration's efforts to deny criminals the availability of \ninexpensive, but highly-lethal, imported firearms.''\n  We know that the M-1 carbine has already been used to kill at least 6 \npolice officers. Another 3 were killed with M-1911 pistols. As recently \nas this January, two sheriff's deputies, James Lehmann, Jr. and Michael \nP. Haugen, were killed with an M-1 carbine while responding to a \ndomestic violence call in Cabazon, CA. In October 1994, in Gilford, NH, \nSgt. James Noyes of the State Police Special Weapons and Tactics Unit \nwas killed in the line of duty with an M-1 carbine. In December 1992, \ntwo Richmond, CA police officers were killed with an M-1 carbine. In \njust one State, Pennsylvania, at least 10 people were killed using \nU.S.-origin military weapons during a recent 5-year period. To those \nwho would argue that ``curios and relics'' are not used in crimes, I \nwould say talk to the families of these victims.\n\n  American-manufactured weapons were sold to foreign governments--often \nat a discount rate subsidized by the U.S. taxpayer--because we believed \nit was in our foreign policy interest to strengthen and assist our \nallies. We did not intend to enable foreign governments to make a \nprofit by turning around and selling them back to commercial gun \ndealers in the U.S. We certainly did not help our allies so they could \nturn around and flood America's streets with lethal guns.\n  We also did not provide weapons to foreign governments so they could \nreap a financial windfall at the expense of the taxpayer. Although the \nlaw could allow the United States Government to receive the net \nproceeds of any sales made by foreign governments of defense articles \nit received on a grant basis, the provision in the appropriations bill \nlast year would have forced the administration--notwithstanding any \nother law --to approve the import license, even if a foreign government \nwould not agree to provide proceeds of the sale. As such, it would \nundermine our government's ability to require foreign governments to \nreturn proceeds to the United States and could result in a windfall for \nforeign governments.\n\n[[Page S4236]]\n\n  Even more, some countries like Vietnam, which hold a significant \nquantity of spoils of war weapons, including ``curios or relics,'' \ncould sell those ``spoils of war'' to U.S. importers at a financial \ngain. And, the Government of Iran, which received more than 25,000 M-\n1911 pistols from the United States Government in the early 1970's, \ncould qualify to export weapons to the United States at a financial \ngain as well.\n  Allowing more than 2 million U.S.-origin military weapons to enter \nthe United States would profit a limited number of arms importers. But \nit is not in the interest of the American people. I don't believe \nprivate gun dealers should have the ability to import these weapons \nfrom foreign governments. These weapons are not designed for hunting or \nshooting competitions. They are designed for war. Our own Department of \nDefense does not sell these weapons on the commercial market for \nprofit. Why should we allow foreign countries to do so?\n  Mr. President, this bill would confirm the policy against importing \nthese lethal weapons by removing the ``curios or relics\" exception from \nthe Arms Export Control Act. Under this legislation, U.S. military \nweapons that the U.S. Government has provided to foreign countries \ncould not be imported to the United States for sale in the United \nStates by gun dealers. If a foreign government had no use for surplus \nAmerican military weapons, those weapons could be returned to the Armed \nForces of the United States or its allies, transferred to State or \nlocal law enforcement agencies in the United States, or destroyed. The \nlegislation also asks the Treasury Department to provide a study on the \nimportation of foreign-manufactured surplus military weapons.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this \nlegislation appear in the Record, and I urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 723\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Anti-Gun Invasion Act of \n     1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since 1950, the United States Government has furnished \n     to foreign governments at least 2,500,000 military firearms \n     that are considered to be ``curios or relics'' under the Gun \n     Control Act of 1968.\n       (2) These firearms include more than 1,200,000 M-1 Carbine \n     rifles and 250,000 M1911 pistols of United States manufacture \n     that have been furnished to foreign governments under United \n     States foreign military assistance grant, loan, or sales \n     programs.\n       (4) Criminals tend to use low-cost firearms that are \n     concealable, capable of accepting large-capacity magazines, \n     or are capable of being easily converted to fully automatic \n     fire.\n       (5) An M-1 Carbine can be converted easily to a fully \n     automatic weapon by disassembling the weapon and reassembling \n     the weapon with a few additional parts.\n       (6) An M1911 or M1911A pistol is easily concealable.\n       (7) At least 9 police officers have been murdered in the \n     United States using M-1 Carbines or M1911 pistols in the past \n     7 years.\n       (8) The importation of large numbers of ``curio or relic'' \n     weapons would lower their cost, make them more readily \n     available to criminals, and constitute a threat to public \n     safety and to law enforcement officers.\n       (9) The importation of these ``curios or relics'' weapons \n     could result in a financial windfall for foreign governments.\n       (10) In order to ensure that these weapons are never \n     permitted to be imported into the United States, a provision \n     of the Arms Export Control Act must be deleted.\n\n     SEC. 3. REMOVAL OF EXEMPTION FROM PROHIBITION ON IMPORTS OF \n                   CERTAIN FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION.\n\n       (a) Removal of Exemption.--Section 38(b)(1) of the Arms \n     Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778(b)(1)) is amended by \n     striking subparagraph (B), as added by section 8142(a) of the \n     Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1988 (contained in \n     Public Law 100-202).\n       (b) Savings Provision.--The amendment made by subsection \n     (a) shall not affect any license issued before the date of \n     the enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 4. REPORT ON IMPORTS OF FOREIGN-MADE SURPLUS MILITARY \n                   FIREARMS THAT ARE CURIOS OR RELICS\n\n       Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of the Treasury, acting through the Bureau \n     of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, shall submit a report to \n     Congress on the scope and effect of the importation of \n     foreign-made surplus military firearms under section 925(e) \n     of title 18, United States Code. The report shall contain the \n     following:\n       (1) Current importation.--A list of types and models of \n     military firearms currently being imported into the United \n     States as ``curios or relics'' under section 925(e) of title \n     18, United States Code, which would otherwise be barred from \n     importation as surplus military firearms under section \n     925(d)(3) of that title.\n       (2) Importation during preceding 5 years.--A list of the \n     number of each type and model listed under paragraph (1) that \n     has been imported into the United States during the 5 years \n     preceding the date of submission of the report.\n       (3) Ease of conversion.--A description of the ease with \n     which each type and model listed under paragraph (1) may be \n     converted to a semi-automatic assault weapon as defined in \n     section 921(a)(30)(B) of that title or to a fully automatic \n     weapon.\n       (4) Involvement in criminal activities.--Statistics that \n     may be relevant to the use for criminal activities of each \n     type and model of weapons listed in paragraph (1), \n     including--\n       (A) statistics involving the use of the weapons in \n     homicides of law enforcement officials; and\n       (B) the number of firearm traces by the Bureau of Alcohol, \n     Tobacco and Firearms that involved those weapons.\n       (5) Comprehensive evaluation.--A comprehensive evaluation \n     of the scope of imports under section 925(e) of that title \n     and the use of such weapons in crimes in the United \n     States.\n       By Mr. NICKLES (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Lott, Mr. \n     Breaux, Mr. Hatch, Ms. Mosley-Braun, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. \n     D'Amato, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Mack, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Cochran, Mr. \n     Brownback, Mr. Enzi and Mr. Hutchinson):\n\n  S. 724. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ncorporate alternative minimum tax reform; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX REFORM ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today I join my colleague from West \nVirginia, Senator Rockefeller, to introduce legislation to reform the \nAlternative Minimum Tax, or AMT. We are joined in this effort by 13 of \nour colleagues, including a total of 10 Finance Committee members.\n  Congress created the AMT in 1986 to prevent businesses from using tax \nloopholes, such as the investment tax credit or safe harbor leasing, to \npay little or no tax. The use of these tax preferences sometimes \nresulted in companies reporting healthy ``book'' income to their \nshareholders but little taxable income to the government.\n  Therefore, to create a perception of fairness, Congress created the \nAMT. The AMT requires taxpayers to calculate their taxes once under \nregular tax rules, and again under AMT rules which deny accelerated \ndepreciation, net operating losses, foreign tax credits, and other \ndeductions and credits. The taxpayer then pays the higher amount, and \nthe difference between their AMT tax and their regular tax is credited \nto offset future regular tax liability if it eventually falls below \ntheir AMT tax liability.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, in the real world the AMT has reached \nfar beyond its original purpose. As it is currently structured, the AMT \nis a massive, complicated, parallel tax code which places huge burdens \non capital intensive companies. Corporations must now plan for and \ncomply with two tax codes instead of one. Further, the elimination of \naccelerated depreciation increases the cost of investment and makes \nU.S. businesses uncompetitive with foreign companies.\n  It makes little sense, Mr. President, to allow a reasonable business \ndeduction under one tax code, and then take it away through another tax \ncode. Perhaps there are some bureaucrats who believe regular tax \ndepreciation is too generous and should be curtailed, but the AMT is an \nextremely complicated and convoluted way to accomplish that goal.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would correct this problem by \nallowing businesses to use the same depreciation system for AMT \npurposes as they use for regular tax purposes. This one simple reform \nremoves the disincentive to invest in job-producing assets and greatly \nsimplifies compliance and reporting. In fact, this reform was first \nsuggested by President Clinton in 1993.\n  Further, my bill helps AMT taxpayers recover their AMT credits in a \nmore reasonable timeframe than under current law. Many capital-\nintensive businesses have become chronic AMT taxpayers, a situation \nthat was not contemplated when the AMT was created. These companies \ncontinue to pay AMT year after year with no relief in\n\n[[Page S4237]]\n\nsight, and as a matter of function they accumulate millions in unused \nAMT credits. These credits are a tax on future, unearned revenues which \nmay never materialize, and because of the time-value of money their \nvalue to the taxpayer decreases every year.\n  Since Congress did not intend for the AMT to become a permanent tax \nsystem for certain taxpayers, my bill would allow chronic AMT taxpayers \nto use AMT credits which are 5-years-old or older to offset up to 50 \npercent of their current-year tentative minimum tax. This provision \nwill help chronic AMT taxpayers dig their way out of the AMT and allow \nthem to recoup at least a portion of these accelerated tax payments in \na reasonable manner and time-frame.\n  Mr. President, as the Senate begins working out the details of the \nrecent bipartisan budget accord and the resulting tax bill, I hope we \nwill not forget the importance of savings and investment. In that \nregard, there are few tax code changes we could make which are more \nimportant than eliminating the investment disincentives created by the \nAMT.\n  Does my legislation fix all of the AMT's problems? No, it does not. \nThis bill specifically addresses the depreciation adjustment, but there \nare many other AMT adjustments, preferences, and limitations which are \nunchanged. Some of these, such as the 90-percent net operating loss \nlimitation and the foreign tax credit limitation, are very damaging to \nbusiness profitability and competitiveness. I hope all these issues \nwill be examined when the Senate Finance Committee considers AMT \nreform.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there appear in the \nRecord a list of the original cosponsors of this legislation, as well \nas statements of support by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the \nNational Association of Manufacturers. I encourage my colleagues to \njoin Senator Rockefeller and me in this important initiative.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Alternative Minimum Tax Reform Act Cosponsors, 105th Congress\n\n                (15 total, 10 from Committee on Finance)\n\n       Sponsor: Nickles.\n       Cosponsors: Rockefeller, Lott, Breaux, Hatch, Moseley-\n     Braun, Murkowski, D'Amato, Gramm, Mack, Lieberman, Cochran, \n     Brownback, Enzi, and Hutchinson.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Chamber of Commerce of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 8, 1997.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     Assistant Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: The U.S. Chamber of Commerce--the \n     world's largest business federation representing an \n     underlying membership of more than three million businesses \n     and organizations of every size, sector, and region--supports \n     your legislation to reform the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT).\n       The current AMT system unfairly penalizes businesses that \n     invest heavily in plant, machinery, equipment and other \n     assets. The AMT significantly increases the cost of capital \n     and discourages investment in productivity-enhancing assets \n     by negating many of the capital formation incentives provided \n     under the regular tax system, most notably accelerated \n     depreciation. To make matters worse, many capital-intensive \n     businesses have been perpetually trapped in the AMT system, \n     and unable to utilize their suspended AMT credits. \n     Furthermore, the AMT is extremely complex, burdensome and \n     expensive to comply with.\n       Your legislation addresses many of the problems of the \n     current AMT and its passage will spur capital investment, \n     help businesses to sustain long-term grown and create jobs. \n     Recent analysis by Data Resources, Inc. demonstrates that \n     your reform bill will result in an increase in GDP of 1.6 \n     percent, the creation of 100,000 new jobs each year, and an \n     increase in worker productivity of about 1.6 percent.\n       Thank you for introducing this important legislation, and \n     we look forward to working with you for its passage.\n           Sincerely,\n     R. Bruce Josten.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           Statement of National Association of Manufacturers\n\n\n  nam calls the alternative minimum tax the ``anti-manfacturing tax''\n\n                Urges Support of AMT Reform Legislation\n\n       Washington, DC., May 8, 1997.--Calling the alternative \n     minimum tax (AMT) a disincentive for capital investment and \n     job creation, the National Association of Manufacturers urged \n     lawmakers to support AMT reform legislation introduced today \n     by Senators Don Nickles (R-OK) and John D. Rockfeller (D-WV).\n       ``The alternative minimum tax is a fundamentally flawed, \n     counter-productive tax that stifles the creation of high-\n     skilled, high-paying manufacturing jobs,'' said Gil Thurm, \n     vice president taxation and economic policy, in support of \n     the reform bill. ``It's little wonder that many believe that \n     AMT really stands for `Anti-Manufacturing Tax.' ''\n       The legislation substantially reforms the AMT to allow \n     businesses to use the same depreciation rules for AMT \n     purposes as they use for their regular tax depreciation \n     rules. It also allows AMT taxpayers to recover their existing \n     tax credits quicker than under current law.\n       ``No other industrialized country imposes such a penalty \n     tax on investment made by capital intensive companies. \n     Furthermore, when businesses report little or no profit, they \n     are still frequently required to pay the AMT,'' said Thurm.\n       ``Substantially reforming the alternative minimum tax will \n     result in greater economic growth by creating thousands of \n     new jobs, stronger growth in GDP, increased productivity and \n     improved cash flow, especially for those companies that have \n     been penalized the most under the AMT,'' according to Thurm.\n       The NAM continues to lead a coalition of more than 100 \n     companies and associations in support of complete repeal of \n     the AMT. However, absent complete repeal, the AMT Coalition \n     for Economic Growth supports substantive AMT reform.\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my Senate \nFinance Committee colleague, Senator Nickles, in introducing an \nAlternative Minimum Tax [AMT] reform bill. Our bill will: first, allow \nbusinesses to use the same depreciation system for AMT as they do under \nregular tax, and second, permit businesses to use their AMT credits \nmore easily than under current law. It will help make it easier for \nU.S. businesses to compete and reduce the unintended inequity of \ncurrent law.\n  For several years, I have looked for an opportunity to fix the \nproblems that AMT creates especially for capital intensive industries. \nTwo years ago, I introduced my own bill to reform the aspects of AMT \nthat I believe are most detrimental to businesses for which AMT is \nfrequently their method of tax payment. Unfortunately, with the \ncontroversies and difficulties that made it impossible to enact a \nbudget plan in the last Congress, there was no ability to move that \neffort forward.\n  This year, I am pleased to work with Senator Nickles to make the AMT \nfairer. I hope this means we have a real chance of working together in \na bipartisan manner to compel Congress, the Finance Committee in \nparticular, to figure out a way to deal with some of the unintended \nconsequences of AMT as part of this year's budget deal. I think \nprevious efforts at AMT reform have failed in the part because it is \nvery tough to focus on the merits of certain corporate tax changes. \nThat remains true today in the context of a larger budget agreement, \nbut if we keep our perspective, I think AMT reform will win support on \nits merits and Congress can responsibly find a way to finance it.\n  I am well aware of the fact that as we introduce this legislation, \nthere is no specific provision for AMT relief in the budget deal which \nthe President and Congressional leadership have struck in outline form. \nAs I have noted, the constraints of balancing the budget will require \nus to carefully examine how much AMT relief is practical this year, as \npart of an agreement to balance the budget over the next 5 years. I \nunderstand that very well, as does Senator Nickles. I think that means \nwe will have to zero in on the aspects of AMT relief that are most \ndoable this year--and which can be financed without harming other \npriorities. I am prepared to do that and recognize that it also means \nthe scope of the AMT bill we submit today will have to be tailored \naccordingly. That does not mean that we should put off AMT relief for \nanother day, it just means we will have to be honest about what is \ncritical to do and what portions of this bill will have to remain on \nthe to-do list. I say all this because it is important to understand \nthe context for our introducing this relief bill now, and as the budget \nagreement places some high hurdles on what can realistically be \naccomplished.\n  I also would like to say that it is my strong belief that the \nexcruciating specifics of the budget agreement which relate to matters \nunder the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee are best left to the \nexpertise on that Committee. The Finance Committee serves an extremely \nimportant role in the legislative process. That role cannot and\n\n[[Page S4238]]\n\nshould not be supplanted by private negotiations between the \nadministration and congressional leadership--however worthwhile the \noverall purpose. Reaching consensus on the approach to balancing the \nbudget and protecting priorities of the administration and both sides \nof the aisle in congressional leadership provides the Finance Committee \nwith the framework for its detailed work. The Finance Committee will \nsoon have to work its will within the appropriate parameters of its \nreconciliation instructions. When that happens, I think the committee \nmust address AMT relief, and I intend to work to build support for it \nas we wend our way through the committee process.\n  Let me return to the substance of the bill we submit for our \ncolleagues' consideration today. First, I want to make it absolutely \nclear--this bill does not repeal AMT. AMT has created during the 1986 \nTax Reform Act in response to the problem raised when companies would \nreport profits to stockholders and yet claim losses to the IRS. \nHowever, in an effort to simplify the code depreciation under AMT was \ntreated as an adjustment--which amounts to an increase in income. This \npenalizes low-profit, capital intensive companies, like steel \ncompanies. Compared to other countries, after 5 years, a U.S. \nsteelmaker under AMT recovers only 37 percent of its investment in a \nnew plant and equipment. The recovery of investment in other countries \nis much higher--for example, in Japan it's 58 percent, in Germany \ncompanies recover 81 percent, Korea is 90 percent, and in Brazil it's \n100 percent.\n  The problem is not unique to the steel industry though. Other \ncapital-intensive industries that also have long-lived assets lose \nunder the current AMT. The chemical industry has 9\\1/2\\ years to \ndepreciate under the AMT, as opposed to 5 years under the regular tax. \nAnd for paper, they have 13 years to depreciate under the AMT, as \nopposed to 7 years under the regular tax. We need to fix the AMT so \nthat industries with very high capital costs which they cannot recover \nfor years are not put at such a disadvantage.\n\n  Today's AMT discourages investment in new plants and equipment, while \nunder our regular tax system depreciation investments are encouraged. \nThe need to improve our tax system to make it fairer to capital \nintensive industries is clear--fixing the AMT is one way to do that.\n  U.S. companies have to be able to compete in an increasingly \ncompetitive global market--that's almost an adage. It's what our trade \nlaws and agreements seek to ensure. We'll never be able to sufficiently \npromote U.S. exports if we don't being to equalize the effects of our \ntax laws on American companies as well.\n  This bill would eliminate depreciation as an adjustment under AMT--\ntreating AMT taxpayers the same as those companies that pay under our \nregular tax system. It would also allow tax payers who have not used \ntheir accumulated minimum tax credits which are at least 5 years old to \nuse those credits to offset up to 50 percent of their current year AMT \nliability--with a provision to ensure that taxpayers could not reduce \ntheir current payment below their regular tax liability for that year.\n  AMT has become the standard method of tax payment for many of our \nNation's capital intensive industries and it is not working the way \nCongress initially intended. It's time to fix it.\n  The bill Senator Nickles and I submit for your consideration today \nwill fix the AMT so it works the way I believe Congress originally \nintended. It will have the consequence of improving the competitiveness \nof American business. It is time to stop talking about AMT and do \nsomething that figures out how to address this real problem. I urge my \ncolleagues to cosponsor this legislation and work with me and my \nFinance Committee colleagues to find a way to act on this important \nissue in this year's budget bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 725. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey the \nCollbran Reclamation Project to the Ute Water Conservancy District and \nthe Collbran Conservancy District; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n                the collbran project unit conveyance act\n\n Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I reintroduce legislation \nto transfer the Collbran project from the Federal Government back to \nthe people it serves. The bill is designed with only one goal in mind, \nto guarantee the growing population in the Grand Valley of Colorado a \nsupply of water that they have relied on for the last 30 years.\n  At the same time, this legislation will be a model for transitioning \nthe Federal Government out of the daily operations of facilities where \nits useful participation has ceased. This transfer will also be an \nimportant and symbolic step in downsizing the Federal Government, \nreturning power to the States and localities, while contributing to our \ncontinuing efforts to balance the Federal budget.\n  The Western slope of Colorado, like the rest of the Colorado Plateau, \nhas a unique blend of rich natural resources and beautiful scenery. \nThis fortunate combination attracts and sustains a strong economy of \nboth industry and tourism. Much of this booming economic development \nand recreational opportunities would not exist if not for the water and \nelectricity provided by the various Federal reclamation projects in the \nWest. These projects were authorized in the Federal Reclamation Act in \n1902 by a visionary Congress which saw the need and importance of water \nprojects to the development of the West. Without such projects, there \nwould be virtually no farming, mining, or ranching and little tourism.\n  It is appropriate for the Federal Government to shed the Collbran \nproject at this time because the goals of the project have been met. \nThe project, completed in 1964, provides a reliable supply of \nirrigation water to the users on the arid west slope of Colorado. This \nproject is the main water supplier for a growing population in the \nGrand Valley, currently serving over 55,000 people. It also provides \nelectric power to the grid that serves several Western States.\n  It is also time now to transfer the Collbran project because, as the \nBureau of Reclamation has acknowledged, due to unanticipated \ncircumstances this project has been a net-cash drain on the Treasury. \nThe Ute Water Conservancy District, the public entity that will \npurchase the project, will pay the remaining debt on the project, \nreimbursing the Government completely, returning over $12 million to \nthe Federal Treasury. It is time for the Government to stand aside.\n  Let me stress that this transfer will not in any way jeopardize any \nof the recreation opportunities available in Vega Reservoir and related \nCollbran project reservoirs. In fact, this legislation will transfer \nthe Vega Reservoir from the Federal Government to the State of \nColorado, ensuring continued recreation opportunities there. This bill \nalso preserves all water and power operations of the existing Collbran \nproject.\n  I also want to emphasize that we have striven to accommodate \nenvironmental groups' concerns. Although there is no reason to think \nthat a mere transfer of ownership, without affecting the operations, \nshould require the water district to perform an environmental impact \nstatement under the National Environmental Policy Act, I have \naccommodated the environmental community's requests and eliminated any \nreference to NEPA. In this way, I have ensured that the transfer will \nfully comply with all environmental laws.\n  Finally, as a symbol of the Ute Water Conservancy's good faith, this \nbill explicitly requires that the conservancy district contributes \n$600,000 to the Colorado River Endangered Fish Recovery Program and \nthat the project itself will remain subject to future ESA-related \nobligations that could be imposed on similar projects.\n  Again, the object of this legislation is merely to ensure a reliable \nsupply of quality water for the residents of the Grand Valley who have \ndepended upon this supply for the last 30 years. This bill proposes a \nfiscally and environmentally sound and sensible transfer of an existing \nFederal project to the people it serves.\n  I look forward to working with all interested parties as this bill \nproceeds. I urge my colleagues to join me and support this bill.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S4239]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 725\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to allow postal patrons to contribute to funding for \nbreast cancer research through the voluntary\n\n[[Page S4241]]\n\npurchase of certain specially issued United States postage stamps; to \nthe Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                  the breast cancer research stamp act\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I, along with Senators Boxer, \nGraham, Snowe, Moseley-Braun, Landrieu, Harkin, Specter, D'Amato, Mack, \nJohnson, Reid, and Murray would like to introduce the Breast Cancer \nResearch Stamp Act.\n  In a time of shrinking budgets and resources for breast cancer \nresearch, this legislation would provide an innovative way to provide \nadditional funding for breast cancer research.\n  This bill would: authorize the U.S. Postal Service to issue an \noptional special first class stamp to be priced at 1 cent above the \ncost of normal first-class postage; earmark a penny of every stamp for \nbreast cancer research; provide administrative costs from the revenues \nfor post office expenses; allow 100 percent of the proceeds from the \nstamp to fund HHS breast cancer research projects; clarify current law, \nin that any similar stamp would require an act of Congress to be issued \nin the future.\n  If only 10 percent of all first class mail used this optional 33 cent \nstamp, $60 million could be raised for breast cancer research annually.\n  There is wide support for this legislation. Congressman Fazio, along \nwith over 100 cosponsors have already introduced the companion bill \n(H.R. 407) in the House.\n  The breast cancer epidemic has been called this Nation's best kept \nsecret. There are 2.6 million women in America today with breast \ncancer, one million of whom have yet to be diagnosed with the disease.\n  In 1996, an estimated 184,000 were diagnosed with breast cancer. It \nis the number one killer of women ages 40 to 44 and the leading cause \nof cancer death in women ages 15 to 54, claiming a woman's life every \n12 minutes in this country (source: National Breast Cancer Coalition).\n  For California, 17,100 women were diagnosed with breast cancer and \n4,100 women will die from the disease (source: American Cancer Society \ncancer facts and figures, 1996).\n  In addition to the cost of women's lives, the annual cost of \ntreatment of breast cancer in the United States is approximately $10 \nbillion.\n  Over the last 25 years, the National Institutes of Health has spent \nover $31.5 billion on cancer research--$2 billion of that on breast \ncancer. In the last 6 years alone, appropriations for breast cancer \nresearch have risen from $90 million in 1990 to $600 million today. \nThat's the good news.\n  But, the bad news is that the national commitment to cancer research \noverall has been hamstrung since 1980. Currently, NIH is able to fund \nonly 23 percent of applications received by all the institutes. For the \nCancer Institute, only 23 percent can be funded--a significant drop \nfrom the 60 percent of applications funded in the 1970's.\n  Most alarming is the rapidly diminishing grant funding available for \nnew researcher applicants.\n  In real numbers, the National Cancer Institute will fund \napproximately 3,600 research projects, of which about 1,000 are new, \npreviously unfunded activities. For investigator-initiated research, \nonly 600 out of 1,900 research projects will be new.\n  The United States is privileged to have some of the most talented \nscientists and many of the leading cancer research centers in the world \nsuch as UCLA, UC San Francisco, Memorial Sloan-Kettering, and the M.D. \nAnderson.\n  This lack of increase in funding is starving some of the most \nimportant research, because scientists will have to look elsewhere for \ntheir livelihood.\n  The U.S. must increase the research funds if these scientists and \ninstitutions are to continue to contribute their vast talents to the \nwar on cancer and finding a cure.\n  What is clear is that there is a direct correlation between increase \nin research funding and the likelihood of finding a cure.\n  Cancer mortality has declined by 15 percent from 1950 to 1992 due to \nincreases in cancer research funding. In fact, federally-funded cancer \nresearch has yielded vast amounts of knowledge about the disease--\ninformation which is guiding our efforts to improve treatment and \nsearch for a cure. We have more knowledge and improvements in \nprevention through: identification of a ``cancer gene'', use of \nmammographies, clinical exams, and encouragement of self breast exams. \nYet there is still no cure.\n  The Bay Area has one of the highest rates of breast cancer incidence \nand mortality in the world. According to data given to my staff by the \nNorthern California Cancer Center, Bay Area white women have the \nhighest reported breast cancer rate in the world, 104 per 100,000 \npopulation. Bay Area African-American women have the fourth highest \nreported rate in the world at 82 per 100,000 (source: Northern \nCalifornia Cancer Center).\n  I want to recognize Dr. Balazs (Ernie) Bodai who suggested this \ninnovative funding approach. Dr. Bodai is the Chief of the Surgery \nDepartment at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Group in Sacramento, \nCalifornia. He is the founder of Cure Cancer Now, which is a nonprofit \norganization committed to developing a funding source for breast cancer \nresearch.\n  This legislation is supported by the American Cancer Society, \nAmerican Medical Association, American Hospital Association, \nAssociation of Operating Room Nurses, California Health Collaborative \nFoundations, YWCA-Encore Plus, the Sacramento City Council and Mayor \nJoe Serna, Siskiyou County Board of Supervisors, Sutter County Board of \nSupervisors, Nevada County Board of Supervisors, Yuba City Council, \nCalifornia State Senator Diane Watson and California State \nAssemblywoman Dede Alpert as well as the Public Employees Union, San \nJoaquin Public Employees Association, and Sutter and Yuba County \nEmployees Association and many more on the attached list.\n  Given the intense competition for Federal research funds in a climate \nof shrinking budgets, the Breast Cancer Research Stamp Act would allow \nanyone who uses the postal service to contribute in finding a cure for \nthe breast cancer epidemic.\n  In a sense, this particular proposal is a pilot. I recognize that the \npostal service may oppose this since it hasn't been done before. I also \nrecognize that in a day of diminishing federal resources, this \ninnovation is an idea whose time has come.\n  It will make money for the post office and for breast cancer \nresearch. No one is forced to buy it, but women's organizations may \neven wish to sell the stamps in a fundraising effort.\n  The administrative costs can be handled with the 1 cent added on to \nthe cost of a first class stamp and conservatively it can make from $60 \nmillion per year for breast cancer research.\n  We need to find a cure for breast cancer and I believe the Breast \nCancer Research Stamp Act is an innovative response to the hidden \nepidemic among women. I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 726\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECITON 1.

A bil to amend the Public Health Service Act and Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974 to require that group and \nindividual health insurance coverage and group health plans provide \ncoverage for annual screening mammography for women 40 years of age or \nolder if the coverage or plans include coverage for diagnostic \nmammography; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n     PRIVATE INSURANCE UNIFORM COVERAGE OF MAMMOGRAPHY LEGISLATION\n\n   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today \nto try to bring some uniform coverage of mammography to private \ninsurance, Medicare and Medicaid, consistent with the American Cancer \nSociety and the National Cancer Institute guidelines. Joining me as \ncosponsors are Senators Mikulski, Wellstone and Johnson.\n  I am introducing this bill because I believe mammography is our best \ntool for finding breast cancer early and women will not get mammograms \nwithout good insurance coverage. We now have the two leading \norganizations, the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer \nInstitute, agreeing on screening guidelines and we cannot assume that \ninsurance companies will rush to follow those guidelines. In the \ncurrent highly competitive climate of managed care, with plans and \nproviders reducing services and benefits, with employers cutting back \non coverage, only congressional action will guarantee women the health \ncare they need, especially preventive services like this.\n\n\n                          Breast Cancer's Toll\n\n  Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women, after skin \ncancer. In 1996, 184,300 new cases were diagnosed and 44,300 women \ndied. Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among \nwomen, after lung cancer. Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer \ndeath in women between ages 40 and 55.\n  Most women diagnosed with breast cancer are over age 50. For women \nage 40 to 44, the incidence rate is 125.4 per 100,000 women; for women \nages 50 to 54, it jumps to 232.7 per 100,000.\n\n\n                      Early Detection Saves Lives\n\n  The sooner breast cancer is detected, the better the survival rate. \nIf breast cancer is diagnosed when it is local--\n\n[[Page S4243]]\n\nconfined to the breast--the 5-year survival rate is 96 percent. If \ndiagnosed later, when cancer has metastasized, the survival rate is 20 \npercent.\n  Regularly scheduled mammography screening offers the single best \nmethod of finding breast cancer early. Mammograms, while never \nabsolutely certain, can detect cancer several years before physical \nsymptoms are obvious to a women or her doctor. Mammography has a \nsensitivity that is 76-94 percent higher than that of a clinical breast \nexam. Its ability to find an absence of cancer is greater than 90 \npercent. For women over 50, mammography can reduce breast cancer \nmortality by at least 30 percent.\n  Earlier this year, the National Cancer Institute recommended that \nasymtomatic women in their 40s have a screening mammogram every one to \ntwo years. The American Cancer Society recommends that all women over \nage 40 should have annual screening mammograms.\n  A February 1997 CBS poll found that 71 percent of women think early \ndetection of breast cancer significantly increases a woman's chances of \nsurviving. 85 percent believe mammograms are safe and 88 percent trust \nthe accuracy of mamograms. Between 1987 and 1992, the National Health \nInterview survey found that there was at least a two-fold increase in \nthe percentage of women of all ages who had a recent mammogram.\n\n\n                     Compliance with Guidelines Low\n\n  So women by and large understand the need for mammograms. However, a \nstudy by the Centers for Disease Control found that only 41 percent of \nwomen age 40 to 49 reported having a recent mammogram. Only half of \nwomen aged 50 to 64 had a recent mammogram. And only 39 percent of \nwomen over age 65 reported a recent mammogram.\n\n\n                     Lack of Insurance a Deterrent\n\n  So the question is, if women understand the importance of mammograms, \nwhy is adherence to the guidelines so low? The CDC study said, ``Health \ninsurance coverage and educational attainment were both strongly \nassociated with [mammograms] for women 40-49 years of age.''\n  A survey by the Jacob Institute of Women's Health likewise found that \n56 percent of women in their 40's and 47 percent of women in the 50's \nwere meeting the ACS screening guideline. After lack of a family \nhistory, the cost of a mammogram was the principal reason for not \nhaving a mammogram.\n  The lack of insurance coverage, the CDC study found, is an important \nfactor in determining which women follow the recommended guidelines. \nAmong commercially insured women, more than half were following the \nguidelines. However, for women in government insurance programs, \nbetween 58 percent and 66 percent were not following the guidelines. \nFor women with no insurance of any kind, 84 percent were not in \ncompliance with the guidelines.\n  The cost of a mammogram also varies widely, depending on the \nradiologist's technique, the location, the interpretation needed. One \nunofficial estimate of cost is that a mammogram ranges from $75.00 to \n$200.00 per visit. A $200 medical charge is not something most \nAmericans want to bear out of pocket. They expect their insurance plan \nto cover medically necessary services.\n\n\n                         Coverage Varies Widely\n\n  Commercial insurance coverage for mammograms varies widely, differing \nin terms of the age of the covered person and frequency of the service. \nMany plans follow the American Cancer Society's guidelines, but this is \nnot documented. At least 38 states have mandated some type of coverage \nfor commercial plans, but again the details vary. Medicare covers \nmammograms every other year. Federal law does not require Medicaid to \nhave specific coverage. A 1993 Alan Guttmacher study attempting to \ndescribe coverages of commercial health insurance coverage of \nreproductive services is aptly titled ``Uneven & Unequal.'' So in \nsummary, insurance coverage is ``all over the map.''\n\n\n                                The Bill\n\n  The bill addresses private commercial group and individual insurance \nplans, Medicare and Medicaid. It would--\n  Require private plans that cover diagnostic mammograms for women \nunder 40 to also cover annual screening mammography.\n  Require Medicare and Medicaid to cover annual screening mammography \nfor women over age 40. (Medicare now covers biannual screening. Federal \nlaw does not require State Medicaid programs to cover mammography for \nany age and State approaches vary widely.)\n  Prohibits plans from denying coverage for annual screening \nmammography because it is not medically necessary or not pursuant to a \nreferral or recommendation by any health care provider;\n  Deny a woman eligibility or renewal to avoid these requirements;\n  Provide monetary payments or rebates to women to encourage women to \naccept less than the minimum protections of the bill;\n  Financially reward or punish providers for withholding mammographies.\n\n\n                          Support for the Bill\n\n  The bill is supported by the American Cancer Society, the National \nBreast Cancer Coalition, the Susan B. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, \nthe Breast Cancer Resource Committee, the Association of Women's \nHealth, Obstetrics, and Neonatal Nurses.\n  I believe this bill will put some important principles into insurance \ncoverage for this very necessary service. I hope my colleagues will \njoin me in promptly moving this bill to enactment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Mack, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Reid, \n        and Mr. Johnson):\n\n  S. 728. A bill to amend title IV of the Public Health Service Act to \nestablish a Cancer Research Trust Fund for the conduct of biomedical \nresearch; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  THE CANCER RESEARCH FUND ACT OF 1997\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today Senators Mack, D'Amato, \nReid, and I are introducing a bill to give citizens two ways to \ncontribute to the Nation's cancer research program. In connection with \ntheir annual tax return, taxpayers could make a tax deductible \ncontribution for cancer research of not less than $1 and could check \noff or designate a contribution of not less than $1 from their tax \nrefund owed them by the Government.\n  The bill establishes a Cancer Research Trust Fund and directs the \nNational Institutes of Health to use the funds for research on cancer. \nIt prohibits expenditures from the fund if appropriations in any year \nfor the NIH are less than the previous year so that these funds do not \nsupplant appropriated funds.\n  In fiscal 1997, the National Cancer Institute could only fund 26 \npercent of grants received with appropriated funds. This approval rate \ndropped from 29 percent in 1996 and 32 percent in 1992. Under the \nPresident's budget request for fiscal 1998, the success rate is \nestimated to drop again, to 25 percent.\n  While we do not have a specific estimate for how much our bill for \ncancer research would raise, a Federal tax checkoff for health research \ncould raise $35 million in revenues for health research, if the average \ncontribution were $2, according to Research America. If taxpayers gave \n$10, it would raise $410 million. Their study shows that the average \ncontribution would be $23 and at that rate, $1.1 billion could be \nraised. In 1994, U.S. taxpayers contributed $25.7 million through State \ncheckoffs.\n  I believe Americans would be very willing to make a contribution to \nhealth research and using the tax return is a very easy way. Sixty \npercent of Americans say they would check off a box on the tax return \nfor medical research. The median amount people are willing to designate \nis $23.\n  Virtually everyone is touched by disease and has had some experience \nwith incurable diseases. We all fear dreaded diseases. A May 1996 \nCalifornia poll found that 59 percent of my constituents would pay an \nextra dollar a week in taxes to support medical research. An \noverwhelming 94 percent of Americans believe it is important that the \nUnited States maintains its role as a world leader in medical research \nand medical research takes second place only to national defense for \ntax dollar value.\n  Cancer mortality has risen in the past half-century. By the year \n2000, cancer will overtake heart disease as the leading cause of death \nof Americans. Over 40 percent of Americans will develop cancer and over \n20 percent of us will die from cancers. Cancer is\n\n[[Page S4244]]\n\ncausing twice as many deaths as in 1971. Cancer's total economic costs \nin 1995, according to the National Institutes of Health, came to $104 \nbillion.\n  In my own State of California, in 1996, 125,800 new cases of cancer \nwere diagnosed and 51,200 people died. The incidence of certain \ncancers, specifically cervical, stomach, and liver, is higher than \nnational rates. The San Francisco area has some of the highest rates of \nbreast cancer in the world. There are areas in my State, such as \nAlameda County, where prostate cancer incidence exceeds the national \nrate. In my State, African-American women have a 60-percent higher risk \nof developing cervical cancer than white women. Hispanic women have the \nhighest risk of cervical cancer in my State. Asian-Americans in \nCalifornia are twice as likely to develop stomach cancer and five times \nmore likely to develop liver cancer than whites.\n  We have made great strides in understanding cancer, particularly the \ngenetics of cancer and what makes a normal cell become a cancer cell. \nBecause of research, cancer survival rates have increased for some \ncancers. But we cannot rest until we find a cure.\n  The National Cancer Institute's bypass budget identifies five \npromising areas of research and with 74 percent of grants going \nunapproved, the scientific talent is there. As the National Cancer \nAdvisory Board said in its 1994 report to Congress, ``Current \ninvestment is insufficient to capitalize on unprecedented opportunities \nin basic science research.'' Clearly additional funds can be well used \nby some of the world's leading cancer researchers.\n  By introducing this bill, I do not believe giving taxpayers an \nopportunity to contribute to cancer research will or should be the \nmainstay of funding for our national war on cancer. Congress needs to \ncontinue increasing appropriations and I am disappointed that the \nPresident's fiscal year 1998 budget for the National Cancer Institute \nrepresents only a 2.5-percent increase over fiscal 1997. I hope we can \ndo better and I pledge my help in doing that. To insure that these \ntaxpayer contributions generated by this bill do not supplant \nCongressionally appropriated funds, the bill includes a provision that \nprohibits expenditures from the cancer research fund if appropriations \nin any year for the NIH are less than the previous year.\n  Twenty-six years of research since the 1971 passage of the National \nCancer Act has brought great progress, but some say that the war on \ncancer has really only been a skirmish. We must escalate that war, we \nmust launch an armada of scientists, we must push vigorously ahead, we \nmust find a cure for cancer. I hope this bill will help to escalate \nthat battle.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KEMPTHORNE (for himself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. \n        Thomas, and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 730. A bill to make retroactive the entitlement of certain Medal \nof Honor recipients to the special pension provided for persons entered \nand recorded on the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard Medal of \nHonor Roll; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n                    medal of honor roll legislation\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat is the final step toward correcting a wrong--a wrong which \nlingered for more than 50 years.\n  In January of this year, I attended a moving ceremony at the White \nHouse where the Congressional Medal of Honor was presented to seven \nAfrican-Americans who had been denied the award during World War II. I \ncan tell you, it was a solemn and dignified ceremony in the East Room \nof the White House last January, when the medals were awarded. \nUnfortunately, only one of the soldiers--Lt. Vernon Baker--was able to \nreceive the medal in person. The other six died, unaware their heroism \nwould one day be acknowledged.\n  Like the medal itself, the financial rewards that normally accompany \nthe honor are also past due. My bill offers the stipend that would have \nbeen earned by the three heroes who survived the heroic act which \nearned them the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n  This bill, co-sponsored by Senators Craig, Torricelli, Thomas, and \nEnzi, provides Lt. Vernon Baker and the surviving spouse or children of \nS. Sgt. Edward A. Carter, Jr., and Maj. Charles L. Thomas with the \nfinancial benefits normally given to recipients of the Congressional \nMedal of Honor. The other Medal of Honor recipients, S. Sgt. Ruben \nRivers, 1st Lt. John R. Fox, Pfc. Willy F. James, Jr., and Pvt. George \nWatson were all killed in action performing acts of heroism, and have \nno surviving family members.\n  Mr. Vernon Baker, the only living survivor, now makes his home in the \nquiet north Idaho community of St. Maries. He is a soft spoken, humble \nman, almost embarrassed by all the national and international attention \ngiven him as a result of heroism. In April 1945, on a hill in Italy, \nLt. Vernon Baker performed acts of bravery above and beyond the normal \ncall of duty, risking his life to save the lives of others and taking a \nstrategically important position, which saved countless other American \nlives.\n  Following the battle, Lieutenant Baker's commander recommended this \nhero for our Nation's top military honors. But during World War II, no \nAfrican-American soldier received the Medal of Honor, and so Lieutenant \nBaker never received the commendation due him--until 50 years after the \nfact.\n  An Army review board studied thousands of service records and \nreports, and determined that seven African-Americans should have been \nawarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. I am proud the last Congress \nfinally stepped up to the challenge and overturned this stain on the \nNation's history, when it authorized the President to award the \nCongressional Medal of Honor to Vernon Baker.\n  My bill will provide Mr. Baker and the surviving spouse or children \nof S. Sgt. Edward A. Carter, Jr., and Maj. Charles L. Thomas with the \nCongressional Medal of Honor pension that they would have received had \nthey been rightly given the award in 1945. My bill does not adjust the \npension for inflation nor does it offer interest. Instead, the bill I \nam introducing today offers three American heroes only what they \nrightly earned in combat defending our Nation and the free world.\n  The people of Idaho have embraced Vernon Baker as a true American \nhero. The State's Governor has awarded Mr. Baker Idaho's top civilian \nhonor. The Nation has bestowed upon him its highest military honor.\n  This is a fair bill that will help provide three American heroes with \nthe reward they rightly earned. I urge my colleagues to take a look at \nthis important bill and I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I will just say that as an Idahoan and as \nan American, I am so proud to have been able to get to know Vernon \nBaker, a truly great American, and his wife Heidi. I wish them all the \nbest success and joy as they continue a wonderful life in the State of \nIdaho.\n  Again, as an American, I salute him and the other six African \nAmericans who are true American heroes.\n  Mr. President, I send to the desk the bill. I know that Senator Craig \nwishes to now address this issue as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me first thank my colleague, Senator \nKempthorne, for his action and the work in developing this legislation \nthat appropriately recognizes Vernon Baker, Edward A. Carter, Jr., and \nCharles L. Thomas in what I think can best be called retroactivity, \ncertainly recognizing that there is a special pension tied to the Medal \nof Honor.\n  The Medal of Honor was given to these African American soldiers and \ncitizens and wonderful people in the appropriate fashion, finally, \nafter a long, long wait. We had the opportunity to be at the White \nHouse for the ceremonies, and it was truly moving.\n  Recognition of their outstanding courage and daring leadership during \ntheir service to their country in World War II was far too long coming, \nas I mentioned. However, their rewards should not be based upon the \ndelay in their recognition, but based on the moment of their heroism.\n  In the case of Vernon Baker, one of my fellow Idahoans--as Senator \nKempthorne said, we had the privilege of getting to know he and his \nwife--more than 50 years have passed before the Nation did the \nappropriate thing in recognizing their courageous actions and bestowing \nthem with the Congressional Medal of Honor. Now fairness demands that \nwe couple this honor with\n\n[[Page S4245]]\n\nthe benefits entitled to them and the next of kin in the case of the \ndeceased, effective to the dates corresponding to their actions.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of a grateful Nation, I once more thank \nVernon Baker for his gallant actions on that April day so long ago and \nencourage the support of my colleague's legislation to resolve this \nissue for America for all time.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of \nSenator Kempthorne's effort to provide Medal of Honor recipient Vernon \nJoseph Baker, and the heirs of Medal of Honor recipients Edward Carter \nand Charles Thomas, with retroactive compensation for their awards.\n  During World War II, Mr. Baker was an Army 2d lieutenant serving with \nthe 92d Infantry Division in Europe. During a 2-day action near \nViareggio, Italy, he single handedly wiped out two German machinegun \nnets, led successful attacks on two others, drew fire on himself to \npermit the evacuation of his wounded comrades, and then led a battalion \nadvance through enemy minefields. Mr. Baker is the only one of these \nthree men still alive today, and he currently resides in St. Maries, \nID.\n  Edward Carter, of Los Angles, was staff sergeant with the 12th \nArmored Division when his tank was destroyed in action near Speyer, \nGermany, in March 1945. Mr. Carter led three men through extraordinary \ngunfire that left two of them dead, the third wounded and himself \nwounded five times. When eight enemy riflemen attempted to capture him, \nhe killed six of them, captured the remaining two and, using his \nprisoners as a shield, recrossed an exposed field to safety. The \nprisoners yielded valuable information. Mr. Carter died in 1963.\n  Charles Thomas, of Detroit, was a major with the 103d Infantry \nDivision serving near Climbach, France, in December 1944. When his \nscout car was hit by intense artillery fire, Mr. Thomas assisted the \ncrew to cover and, despite severe wounds, managed to signal the column \nsome distance behind him to halt. Despite additional multiple wounds in \nthe chest, legs, and left arm, he ordered and directed the dispersion \nand emplacement of two antitank guns that effectively returned enemy \nfire. He refused evacuation until certain his junior officer was in \ncontrol of the situation. Mr. Thomas died in 1980.\n  I commend Mr. Baker, Mr. Carter, and Mr. Thomas for their bravery and \nSenator Kempthorne for leading this effort.\n  As a result of their heroics these men had clearly met the criteria \nfor being awarded a Medal of Honor, the Nation's highest award for \nvalor. This medal is only awarded to a member of the U.S. armed \nservices who ``distinguishes themselves conspicuously by gallantry and \nintrepidity at the risk of their life and beyond the call of duty,'' \nwith an act ``so conspicuous as to clearly distinguish the individual \nabove their comrades.'' However, because of the racial climate of the \ntime and the segregated nature of the Army in 1945, African-Americans \nwere denied the Medal of Honor. It is a sad testament to America's \nlegacy of discrimination that although 1.2 million African-Americans \nserved in the military during the Second World War, including Mr. \nBaker, Mr. Carter, and Mr. Thomas, none received 1 of the 433 Medals of \nHonor awarded during the conflict.\n  This past January our Nation took an important step in correcting \nthis injustice by awarding Mr. Vernon Joseph Baker, and six of his dead \ncomrades, the Medal of Honor during a long-overdue ceremony at the \nWhite House. This recognition of these men's extraordinary courage was \na vindication for all African-American heroes of World War II. In order \nto further demonstrate our profound thanks to these brave men, I \nsupport Senator Kempthorne's effort to retroactively compensate Mr. \nBaker, and the heirs of Mr. Carter and Mr. Thomas for the money that \nthey would have received from the Army for receiving the Medal of \nHonor. The other three heroes died as a result of the brave deeds which \nqualified them to receive the Medal, and thus would not have received \nany compensation by the military.\n  Each recipient of this Medal is entitled to receive a token monthly \nstipend from their respective branch of the military after they leave \nactive duty service. In 1945 the stipend was $10 and today it has risen \nto $400. Since he was denied the Medal more than a half century ago, \nMr. Baker and the survivors of Mr. Carter and Mr. Thomas, deserve to \nreceive the same amount of money that they would have received had they \nbeen awarded the Medal at the close of World War II. American is \nprofoundly thankful for the patriotism of these men, and awarding \nretroactive compensation to them is a simple way to express our \ngratitude for their service. For these reasons I stand today to \nrecognize Mr. Baker, Mr. Carter, and Mr. Thomas, and support \nretroactively compensating them for their accomplishments.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FAIRCLOTH (for himself, Mr. Helms, Mr. DeWine, Ms. Snowe, \n        Ms. Collins, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Mack, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Abraham, \n        Mr. Santorum, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Warner, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Cochran, \n        and Mr. Murkowski):\n  S. 732. A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint and \nissue coins in commemoration of the centennial anniversary of the first \nmanned flight of Orville and Wilbur Wright in Kitty Hawk, North \nCarolina, on December 17, 1903; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                THE FIRST FLIGHT COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise today, joined by my colleague \nfrom North Carolina, Senator Helms, and 12 other Senators to introduce \nthe First Flight Commemorative Coin Act. This revenue-neutral \nlegislation instructs the Treasury Secretary to mint coins in \ncommemoration of the Wright Brothers' historic 1903 flight on the North \nCarolina coast.\n  Mr. President, in the cold morning hours of December 17, 1903, a \nsmall crown watched the Wright Flyer lift off the flat landscape of \nKitty Hawk. Orville Wright traveled just 120 feet--less than the \nwingspan of a Boeing 747--in his 12-second flight. It was, however, the \nfirst time that a manned machine sailed into the air under its own \npower. The residents of Kitty Hawk, then an isolated fishing village, \nthus bore witness to the realization of the centuries-old dream of \nflight.\n  The significance of the Wright Brothers' flight reaches far beyond \nits status as the first flight. Their flight represented the birth of \naviation. On that morning, aeronautics moved from untested theory to \nnascent science, and it triggered a remarkable technological evolution. \nIn fact, just 24 years after their fragile craft rose unsteadily and \ntook to the air, Charles Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic Ocean. In 1947, \nless than half a century after the pioneer 31 m.p.h. flight over Kitty \nHawk, Chuck Yeager shattered the sound barrier over the Mojave Desert.\n  The rapid aeronautical progression, which the Wright Brothers \ninitiated on that December morning in Kitty Hawk, is, of course, \nremarkable. Mr. President, it was just 66 years after the Wright \nBrothers' 120-foot flight--a timespan equivalent to the age of many \nMembers of this body--that Neil Armstrong traveled 240,000 miles to \nplant the American flag on the moon. Today, some 86,000 planes lift off \nfrom American airports on a daily basis, and air travel is routine. It \nwas with a sprinkling of onlookers, however, that the Wright Brothers \nushered in the age of flight on that cold winter morning in Kitty Hawk.\n  The site of the first flight, at the foot of Kill Devil Hill, was \ninitially designated as a national memorial in 1927 and is visited by \nclose to a half-million people each year.\n  I think that First Flight Commemorative Coin Act is a most \nappropriate tribute to the Wright Brothers as the centennial \nanniversary of the first flight approaches. The coin will be minted in \n$10, $1, and 50  denominations, and its sales will fund educational \nprograms and improvements to the visitor center at the memorial. These \ncommemorative coins are struck to celebrate important historical \nevents, and, of course, the proceeds are an important revenue source to \nthe custodians of these legacies. The centennial anniversary of the \nWright Brothers' flight merits our observance.\n  Mr. President, because all of the funds raised under this legislation \nwill be used to, build, repair or refurbish structures all within a \nnational park, I have added an exemption to the mintage levels as \nrequired by coin reform\n\n[[Page S4246]]\n\nlegislation last year. Nevertheless, so that coin collectors can enjoy \nsome certainty that the coin will be of value in the future, the Mint \ncan reduce the mintage levels as it deems necessary.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues for their support, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 732\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I have agreed not to offer an \namendment to the supplemental appropriations bill regarding a radio \nstation in my State, because I am told that a point of order may be \nraised against it. But, Mr. President, I will continue to probe this \nmatter further. I intend to request documents from the FCC on this \nissue. Further, I think that the Commerce Committee should hold a \nhearing to investigate the irregularities concerning this case.\n  Mr. President, in 1987, Zeb Lee and his family attempted to get a new \nFM station license in Asheville, NC. At the time, Mr. Lee had owned and \noperated a successful AM station in the area for 40 years.\n  By all accounts, Mr. Lee has been a model citizen and a model radio \nstation operator, this is in stark contrast to a lot of what is taking \nplace on radio today.\n  In 1993, a full 6 years later, Mr. Lee was awarded the station on a \ntemporary basis, beating out 12 other applicants. Several of his \ncompetitors were found to be unqualified. In fact, one lied about his \nability to operate a station. Another lied about his heritage in order \nto obtain a minority preference.\n  Pending final approval, Mr. Lee was required by the FCC to sell his \nAM station and to begin constructing a new FM tower. In reliance on the \nGovernment, he did both. A week after Zeb Lee was on the air, the FCC \nissued a public notice freezing all licensing proceedings affected by \nthe Bechtel versus FCC case.\n  In an unusual move, in 1996, the full FCC Board reversed all previous \ndecisions and awarded temporary operating authority to the four \nopponents of Zeb Lee in the original application process. The four \nopponents were acting as a group by this time.\n  Mr. President, here we are, 10 years later--and Mr. Lee is still \nfighting his case with the FCC. He was on the air for 3 years--only to \nbe told by the FCC that he would now be taken off the air, once his \nopponents could go on.\n  Mr. President, this is a highly unusual case. This was the only \nstation, affected by the Bechtel case, where the initial decision was \nreserved. Furthermore, the FCC has never issued final regulations \npursuant to the Bechtel case.\n  And what did the four opponents who got the radio station do with the \nnew license--they have shopped for another buyer.\n  The four opponents have now turned over their temporary license to a \nlarge out of state radio company.\n  The fact of the matter is that the opponents in the licensing process \nhad no intention of running a radio station. They only hope was that \nZeb Lee would buy them off--in other words pay ``blackmail.'' If that \ndid not work--and they did win the radio station--they would transfer \nthose rights for a big profit.\n  Mr. President, this process is wrong. It is deeply flawed.\n  Any bureaucratic process that takes 10 years, by itself is an \noutrage.\n  But the process that bankrupts an 80 year old man is truly wrong.\n  If he losses the station, the end result will be that a family owned \nradio business, located in Asheville area for 40 years, will have lost \nthe radio license in a deeply flawed process.\n  His four opponents never had any intention of operating a radio \nstation, they only wanted to flip the license to a larger company.\n  This is wrong, and it must stop.\n  Mr. President, my amendment would have provided that Zeb Lee could \ncontinue to operate his station for a period of 6 more months. This \nwould allow the Congress to review this matter. It would allow us to \nget to the bottom of what the FCC is doing.\n  We have to make certain that this process has been fair and even \nhanded, but quite frankly, judging from the facts, there have been \nserious problems with this entire issue.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, I can assure all the citizens in \nAsheville that I will continue to pursue this matter with \nvigor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/08/senate-section/article/S4249-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4249-S4250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ARSON AWARENESS WEEK\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as I am sure many of my \ncolleagues are\n\n[[Page S4250]]\n\naware, this week--May 4-May 10--is Arson Awareness Week. All over the \nNation, people are coming together to combat arson and take back their \ncommunities. One such place where this has been happening is Utica, a \ncity of about 70,000 people in upstate New York. Utica is a pilot city \nin the Federal Emergency Management Agency's [FEMA] Partnership for \nArson Awareness and Prevention. FEMA Director James Lee Witt is heading \nup the National Arson Prevention Initiative [NAPI], a combined effort \nof FEMA and the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Justice, \nand the Treasury. President Clinton asked Director Witt to create the \nNAPI in response to the many church fires which recently occurred in \nthe South.\n  In March, Utica Mayor Edward Hanna and Oneida County Executive Ralph \nEannace formed a local arson prevention coalition and have been working \nwith FEMA officials. Throughout this week and in the future, the people \nof Utica will band together to take back their city from scourge of \narson fires which it has recently seen.\n  On Tuesday, students at the Martin Luther King School heard a public \neducation program on arson from officers of the Utica Fire Department \nand the New York State Office of Fire Prevention. On Wednesday, risk \nassessments were conducted at senior citizen's centers, and on Friday, \nthe Utica National Insurance Co's. are presenting a fire prevention \ngrant to residents of the neighborhood near the intersections of South \nand Steuben Streets.\n  On Saturday, Director Witt will cap off the week with a visit to \nUtica. The day's activities will include boarding up abandoned \nstructures to make them less susceptible to arson and conducting fire \ndrills at several churches in the morning and having a parade and arson \nprevention rally in the afternoon. I would like to thank Director Witt \nfor making Utica a pilot city in this program and for visiting Utica. \nWorking together, the people of Utica will reclaim their city from \narson.\n  Mr. President, I ask that an article by Director Witt on Arson \nAwareness Week be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n         What Are You Doing To Target Arson in Your Community?\n\n       Washington.--In the wake of the church fires last summer, \n     the President asked me to lead a National Arson Prevention \n     Initiative. He wanted to focus the efforts and the resources \n     of the Federal government on supporting community-based \n     activities to prevent arson.\n  The initiative the President implemented was national in scope--not \n     regional, and not focused on houses of worship \n     exclusively. This effort represents the commitment by \n     numerous Federal agencies, governments at all levels, the \n     private sector, and the voluntary community to greatly \n     reduce the 750 fatalities and over $2 billion in losses \n     caused by arson in this country every year.\n       National Arson Awareness Week, which begins Sunday (May 4) \n     and runs through Saturday, May 10th, is the culmination of \n     this initiative. In a very real sense, it marks the first \n     anniversary of an unprecedented crusade to combat a national \n     problem that far too often maims and kills and can destroy \n     the fabric of our communities. The theme of this week is \n     ``Target Arson,'' and each community should ask themselves \n     what they are doing in the fight against arson.\n       Arson is preventable. What is disturbing is that one out of \n     every four fires is intentionally set. That means that \n     someone--a fellow human being--consciously decides for \n     whatever reason to destroy a home, a car, a house of worship, \n     or a business. And in that moment they have attacked the \n     lives, the livelihoods, and the spirit of a community. Arson \n     is a national problem, but it is fundamentally a local \n     problem. This war--like most wars--must be won in the \n     trenches. Local fire and police departments are well-trained \n     and ready to mount heroic efforts. But when the doors of the \n     fire station go up to respond, you have already lost the \n     battle to prevent that fire from happening. In the end, the \n     real responsibility for stopping arson lies with the \n     community--with students, teachers, business leaders, \n     parents, the clergy, and civic organizations.\n       Arson does affect everyone--and every taxpayer should be \n     vitally concerned about arson's destructive and deadly toll. \n     Think of the cost of rolling out fire trucks to deal with a \n     toilet paper fire at a school. Consider that teenagers \n     account for more than 55 percent of all deliberately set \n     blazes, and if you include youth 20 years and younger that \n     figure climbs to 61.2 percent. Then think of the cost of \n     teachers and students killed or scarred for the rest of their \n     lives and a smoldering school that must be rebuilt. Think \n     again of the houses and businesses that disappear from the \n     tax rolls because of arson, and the services that suffer in a \n     community as the result. Imagine what it's like to pull up \n     outside your church or house of worship, and realize that it \n     disappeared in flames the night before.\n       As we observe National Arson Awareness Week, three \n     communities--Charlotte, NC; Macon, GA; and Utica, NY--will be \n     launching grassroots arson prevention coalitions that could \n     well become models for other American cities. These are \n     communities that took firm hold of their arson problems and \n     have put together a partnership from across their community \n     to prevent future arson fires.\n       These communities will step forward as model arson \n     prevention partnerships with a flurry of week-long activity, \n     that includes boarding up abandoned buildings, cleaning up \n     litter and debris from vacant properties, conducting arson \n     prevention training programs in schools and community \n     centers, and promoting arson awareness through public \n     education campaigns and neighborhood watch rallies. Dozens of \n     other cities across the country will also be hosting National \n     Arson Awareness Week events.\n       The most effective way of combating any problem, including \n     arson, it to prevent it from happening. That takes more than \n     federal agencies and federal dollars. It takes you and your \n     family and your friends. It takes your entire community.\n       So ask yourself this week--what you are doing to ``target \n     arson'' in your community? Then get involved--organize a \n     neighborhood watch, assess arson risks in your community, \n     participate in prevention training programs, call your local \n     fire department or call the National Arson Prevention \n     Clearinghouse at 1-888-603-3100 for some arson prevention \n     ideas. Remember fire stops with you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/08/senate-section/article/S4249-4", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CAPT. JAMES HUARD\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay my respects to \nAir Force Capt. James Huard, buried on Thursday, May 1 with full \nmilitary honors at Arlington National Cemetery. The day was long \noverdue; 25 years, in fact, since the Dearborn, MI native's plane \ndisappeared in a mission over North Vietnam.\n  In July 1972, Captain Huard's death left behind a young wife, three \nsmall children, and countless other family and friends. His memory \nlives on today, however, evident in the attendance at Arlington of a \nnumber of members of the Vietnam Veterans of America James L. Huard \nChapter 267, named in his honor.\n  As fitting and well deserved a tribute as last week's ceremony was, \nit also serves as a stirring reminder of those who still wait for \nreturn of the remains of their loved ones. For one quarter of a \ncentury, over 2,000 families have so far been denied the opportunity to \nproperly bring closure to this difficult period in their lives.\n  As Paul Kane, one of Captain Huard's fellow veterans told the Detroit \nNews, ``This ends the Vietnam war for Dearborn, finally. Today, the \ngood captain comes home to rest.''\n  It is my sincere hope the other families and communities across this \ncountry waiting to honor those servicemen still missing in action will \none day, if they have not already, find a similar peace themselves. \nUntil then, we cannot and will not waver or rest in our solemn task of \nreturning every American home for recognition as heroes by the country \nin whose service they made the ultimate sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/08/senate-section/article/S4250-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4250-S4251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NATIONAL SAFE KIDS WEEK 1997\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize May 10 \nthrough 18 as National Safe Kids Week 1997. The National Safe Kids \nCampaign is a joint effort of the Children's National Medical Center \nand its founding sponsor Johnson & Johnson to promote basic child \nsafety precautions among America's parents.\n  To illustrate the importance of this cause, consider the following \nfacts. Unintentional injury is the number one killer of children ages \n14 and under. Every day, more than 39,000 children are injured \nseriously enough to require emergency medical treatment. That is more \nthan 14 million each year. These statistics are all the more tragic \nbecause so many of these accidents could have been prevented with \nadequate basic child safety education.\n  Earlier today, the National Safe Kids Gear Up Games kicked off here \nin Washington. The Gear Up Games will move to New York tomorrow, Los \nAngeles on Saturday, and on to communities across the country in the \ndays ahead. The primary awareness program of National Safe Kids Week \n1997, the Gear Up Games are an interactive safety obstacle course with \nevents centered around the childhood injury risk areas depicted in the \nSafe Kids Gear Up Guide.\n\n[[Page S4251]]\n\n  Mr. President, I am honored to say my wife Jane is a honorary \nchairperson of the Detroit Safe Kids Campaign. She joins such respected \nnational figures as former United States Surgeon General C. Everett \nKoop, our distinguished colleagues from Connecticut and Ohio, Chris \nDodd and Mike DeWine, respectively, and countless others in this \nworthwhile initiative.\n  During National Safe Kids Week 1997, and beyond, I plan to have \navailable in both my Washington and Michigan offices copies of the Safe \nKids Gear Up Guide. Jane and I join Senators Dodd and DeWine in urging \nother Senators to do likewise. As the parents of three children, all \nunder the age of 4, my wife and I believe there is no more important \ntask than working to ensure all of America's children have safe home \nand play environments in which to grow up.\n  I commend those involved in the National Safe Kids Campaign and the \ngood works they do, and look forward to the day accidental childhood \ninjuries are eliminated entirely.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/08/senate-section/article/S4250-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HOPE SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge and commend \nthe State of Georgia's HOPE Scholarship program. The HOPE Scholarship, \nwhich stands for helping outstanding pupils educationally, has served \nas a model of excellence in education for a number of other States, and \nindeed the entire Nation. I am honored to represent a State, which in \nmy opinion, has one of the most innovative educational programs in the \ncountry.\n  The HOPE Scholarship provides eligible students wishing to attend a \nGeorgia Pubic College or University with tuition, mandatory fees and a \n$100 book allowance. The HOPE Scholarship also provides eligible \nstudents wishing to attend a Georgia Private College or University with \n$3000 per academic school year and an additional $1000 in Georgia \nTuition Equalization Grants per academic year. To be eligible, students \nmust be a Georgia resident, graduated from high school after a certain \ndate and have completed high school with a ``B'' average. Students must \ncontinue to perform well academically and maintain a ``B'' average \nwhile in college to continue to receive the HOPE Scholarship.\n  Students wishing to attend a Georgia Public Technical Institute are \nalso eligible for the HOPE Scholarship. The HOPE scholarship provides \ntuition, mandatory fees and a $100 book allowance for students \nattending these technical institutions.\n  Since the program began in September of 1993, more than 238,500 \nGeorgia students have been awarded HOPE Scholarships. Because of the \nHOPE Scholarship college enrollment is up 1.2 percent, full-time \nprivate college enrollment is up 32 percent and technical school \nenrollment is up 24 percent in Georgia. At the University of Georgia, \n97 percent of the entering in-state freshman were on HOPE Scholarships \nfor the Fall 1996 quarter. At the Georgia Institute of Technology, 96 \npercent of in-state entering students in 1996 were on HOPE \nScholarships.\n  The HOPE Scholarship has given, and will continue to give, thousands \nof Georgia students the financial encouragement both to attend college \nand to persist and gain a degree. Students in Georgia know that if they \nwork hard and do well academically, despite the rising cost of higher \neducation, they will be provided the resources needed to further their \neducation. Not only does the HOPE Scholarship reward those students who \nare willing to work hard with tuition money, but it also serves as \nincentive to keep Georgia's best and brightest in the great state of \nGeorgia.\n  A lack of financial resources should not prevent any American from \npursuing a college education and thanks to the Georgia HOPE \nScholarship, in Georgia, it doesn't. Unfortunately, however, the lack \nof financial resources remains the number one obstacle to higher \neducation for many American students and their families. This is why it \nis so important that the necessary financial resources are provided to \nall students pursuing a higher education and why the importance of \ncurrent education legislation, such as S. 12, that addresses this \ncrucial need cannot be overlooked.\n  I believe that federal support for education is one of the best \ninvestments our nation can make to ensure future security and \nprosperity. In keeping with this commitment to education I am a proud \nco-sponsor of S.12. The goal of S. 12 is to make higher education more \naccessible and affordable for all students. S. 12, ``The Education for \nthe 21st Century Act,'' includes two new forms of assistance to help \nfamilies meet the costs of higher education. The first form of \nassistance, also called the HOPE Scholarship, is a $1500 per year \nrefundable tax credit for the first two years of post-secondary \neducation. To qualify for the credit, students must have a ``B'' \naverage and be drug-free. S. 12 also includes a tax deduction of up to \n$10,000 per year for qualified education expenses.\n  In these days of budget cuts, we must not forget that the future of \nour country depends on the youth of today. If we deny our youth the \nnecessary tools to grow and learn we deny ourselves a better tomorrow. \nThe Georgia HOPE Scholarship is a shining example of how the people and \nthe government can come together to create an efficient, highly \nsuccessful program that benefits everyone.\n  The Georgia HOPE Scholarship has been an overwhelming success and \nGeorgians have been very fortunate to have reaped such a wealth of \nbenefits from this innovative program. S. 12 is an attempt to provide \nsimilar opportunities for all Americans. We must work together as a \nnation to ensure that barriers to higher education continue to fall for \nall Americans. It is my sincere hope that the entire nation will follow \nGeorgia's lead and make education a top priority. The future of our \ncountry depends on it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/08/senate-section/article/S4251-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4251-S4253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RULES OF PROCEDURE FOR THE SENATE PERMANENT SUBCOMMITTEE ON \n                             INVESTIGATIONS\n\n Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nRules of Procedure for the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, as adopted, \nApril 28, 1997, be printed in the Record.\n  The rules of procedure follow:\n\n      105th Congress--Rules of Procedure for the Senate Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs \n                       As Adopted, April 28, 1997\n\n       1. No public hearing connected with an investigation may be \n     held without the approval of either the Chairman and the \n     ranking minority Member or the approval of a majority of the \n     Members of the Subcommittee. In all cases, notification to \n     all Members of the intent to hold hearings must be given at \n     least 7 days in advance to the date of the hearing. The \n     ranking minority Member should be kept fully apprised of \n     preliminary inquiries, investigations, and hearings. \n     Preliminary inquiries may be initiated by the Subcommittee \n     majority staff upon the approval of the Chairman and notice \n     of such approval to the ranking minority Member or the \n     minority counsel. Preliminary inquiries may be undertaken by \n     the minority staff upon the approval of the ranking minority \n     Member and notice of such approval to the Chairman or Chief \n     Counsel. Investigations may be undertaken upon the approval \n     of the Chairman of the Subcommittee and the ranking minority \n     Member with notice of such approval to all members.\n       No public hearing shall be held if the minority Members \n     unanimously object, unless the full Committee on Governmental \n     Affairs by a majority vote approves of such public hearing.\n       Senate Rules will govern all closed sessions convened by \n     the Subcommittee (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(b), Standing Rules of the \n     Senate).\n       2. Subpoenas for witnesses, as well as documents and \n     records, may be authorized and issued by the Chairman, or any \n     other Member of the Subcommittee designated by him, with \n     notice to the ranking minority Member. A written notice of \n     intent to issue a subpoena shall be provided to the Chairman \n     and ranking minority Member of the Committee, or staff \n     officers designated by them, by the Subcommittee Chairman or \n     a staff officer designated by him, immediately upon such \n     authorization, and no subpoena shall issue for at least 48 \n     hours, excluding Saturdays and Sundays, from delivery to the \n     appropriate offices, unless the Chairman and ranking minority \n     Member waive the 48 hour waiting period or unless the \n     Subcommittee Chairman certifies in writing to the Chairman \n     and ranking minority Member that, in his opinion, it is \n     necessary to issue a subpoena immediately.\n       3. The Chairman shall have the authority to call meetings \n     of the Subcommittee. This authority may be delegated by the \n     Chairman to any other Member of the Subcommittee when \n     necessary.\n       4. If at least three Members of the Subcommittee desire the \n     Chairman to call a special meeting, they may file in the \n     office of\n\n[[Page S4252]]\n\n     the Subcommittee, a written request therefor, addressed to \n     the Chairman. Immediately thereafter, the clerk of the \n     Subcommittee shall notify the Chairman of such request. If, \n     within 3 calendar days after the filing of such request, the \n     Chairman fails to call the requested special meeting, which \n     is to be held within 7 calendar days after the filing of such \n     request, a majority of the Subcommittee Members may file \n     in the office of the Subcommittee their written notice \n     that a special Subcommittee meeting will be held, \n     specifying the date and hour thereof, and the Subcommittee \n     shall meet on that date and hour. Immediately upon the \n     filing of such notice, the Subcommittee clerk shall notify \n     all Subcommittee Members that such special meeting will be \n     held and inform them of its dates and hour. If the \n     Chairman is not present at any regular, additional or \n     special meeting, the ranking majority Member present shall \n     preside.\n       5. For public or executive sessions, one Member of the \n     Subcommittee shall constitute a quorum for the administering \n     of oaths and the taking of testimony in any given case or \n     subject matter.\n       Five (5) Members of the Subcommittee shall constitute a \n     quorum for the transaction of Subcommittee business other \n     than the administering of oaths and the taking of testimony.\n       6. All witnesses at public or executive hearings who \n     testify to matters of fact shall be sworn.\n       7. If, during public or executive sessions, a witness, his \n     counsel, or any spectator conducts himself in such a manner \n     as to prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct, or interfere with \n     the orderly administration of such hearing, the Chairman or \n     presiding Member of the Subcommittee present during such \n     hearing may request the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate, his \n     representative or any law enforcement official to eject said \n     person from the hearing room.\n       8. Counsel retained by any witness and accompanying such \n     witness shall be permitted to be present during the testimony \n     of such witness at any public or executive hearing, and to \n     advise such witness while he is testifying, of his legal \n     rights, Provided, however, that in the case of any witness \n     who is an officer or employee of the government, or of a \n     corporation or association, the Subcommittee Chairman may \n     rule that representation by counsel from the government, \n     corporation, or association, or by counsel representing other \n     witnesses, creates a conflict of interest, and that the \n     witness may only be represented during interrogation by staff \n     or during testimony before the Subcommittee by personal \n     counsel not from the government, corporation, or association, \n     or by personal counsel not representing other witnesses. This \n     rule shall not be construed to excuse a witness from \n     testifying in the event his counsel is ejected for conducting \n     himself in such a manner so as to prevent, impede, disrupt, \n     obstruct, or interfere with the orderly administration of the \n     hearings; nor shall this rule be construed as authorizing \n     counsel to coach the witness or answer for the witness. The \n     failure of any witness to secure counsel shall not excuse \n     such witness from complying with a subpoena or deposition \n     notice.\n       9. Depositions.\n       9.1  Notice. Notices for the taking of depositions in an \n     investigation authorized by the Subcommittee shall be \n     authorized and issued by the Chairman. The Chairman of the \n     full Committee and the ranking minority Member of the \n     Subcommittee shall be kept fully apprised of the \n     authorization for the taking of depositions. Such notices \n     shall specify a time and place of examination, and the \n     name of the Subcommittee Member or Members or staff \n     officer or officers who will take the deposition. The \n     deposition shall be in private. The Subcommittee shall not \n     initiate procedures leading to criminal or civil \n     enforcement proceedings for a witness' failure to appear \n     unless the deposition notice was accompanied by a \n     Subcommittee subpoena.\n       9. Counsel. Witnesses may be accompanied at a deposition by \n     counsel to advise them of their legal rights, subject to the \n     provisions of Rule 8.\n       9.3 Procedure. Witnesses shall be examined upon oath \n     administered by an individual authorized by local law to \n     administer oaths. Questions shall be propounded orally by \n     Subcommittee Members or staff. Objections by the witness as \n     to the form of questions shall be noted for the record. If a \n     witness objects to a question and refuses to testify on the \n     basis of relevance or privilege, the Subcommittee Members or \n     staff may proceed with the deposition, or may, at that time \n     or at a subsequent time, seek a ruling by telephone or \n     otherwise on the objection from the Chairman or such \n     Subcommittee Member as designated by him. If the Chairman or \n     designated Member overrules the objection, he may refer the \n     matter to the Subcommittee or he may order and direct the \n     witness to answer the question, but the Subcommittee shall \n     not initiate procedures leading to civil or criminal \n     enforcement unless the witness refuses to testify after he \n     has been ordered and directed to answer by a Member of the \n     Subcommittee.\n       9.4 Filing. The Subcommittee staff shall see that the \n     testimony is transcribed or electronically recorded. If it is \n     transcribed, the witness shall be furnished with a copy for \n     review pursuant to the provisions of Rule 12. The individual \n     administering the oath shall certify on the transcript that \n     the witness was duly sworn in his presence, the transcriber \n     shall certify that the transcript is a true record of the \n     testimony, and the transcript shall then be filed with the \n     Subcommittee clerk. Subcommittee staff may stipulate with the \n     witness to changes in this procedure; deviations from this \n     procedure which do not substantially impair the reliability \n     of the record shall not relieve the witness from his \n     obligation to testify truthfully.\n       10. Any witness desiring to read a prepared or written \n     statement in executive or public hearings shall file a copy \n     of such statement with the Chief Counsel or Chairman of the \n     Subcommittee 48 hours in advance of the hearings at which the \n     statement is to be presented unless the Chairman and the \n     ranking minority Member waive this requirement. The \n     Subcommittee shall determine whether such statement may be \n     read or placed in the record of the hearing.\n       11. A witness may request, on grounds of distraction, \n     harassment, personal safety, or physical discomfort, that \n     during the testimony, television, motion picture, and other \n     cameras and lights shall not be directed at him.
