Amendment No. 336\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized to \nspeak on her amendment for up to 50 minutes.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield myself such time \nas I may require.\n  Before I start, I ask unanimous consent Senator Baucus be added as a \ncosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I am going to yield to my \ncolleagues from Massachusetts and Minnesota in a moment to speak on \nthis. But I would just like to pick up the debate where we left off \nlast evening.\n  This is the amendment to begin to repair America's crumbling schools \nand to help provide an environment suitable for learning to the 14 \nmillion children who attend school every day in this country, schools \nwith leaky roofs, with crumbling walls, with sewage backing up in the \nbasement, with insufficient electrical equipment to plug in computers, \nchildren who attend schools in our country that are not suitable \nenvironments for learning. Mr. President, I believe we can do better.\n  There has been a great deal of debate about who should pay for the \ncrumbling schools. As we know, it is traditional in this country that \nState and local governments pay for elementary and secondary education. \nIn fact, the Federal Government only supports elementary and secondary \neducation nationwide at about a 7 percent level, so we are barely \nengaged in the funding formula. But as it is no doubt apparent, and I \nknow it is apparent to everybody in this room, we are facing a crisis \nof national proportions because the formula for funding elementary and \nsecondary education just does not work in ways that are adequate to \nmeet the needs of our children. It does not work because the property \ntax base of elementary and secondary funding has been so inelastic as \nnot to provide for the repair, construction, and maintenance of schools \nover time. So we are faced with a crisis of monumental national \nproportions.\n  The General Accounting Office tells us it will take $112 billion to \nrepair our schools, to just bring them up to a level of adequacy--code \nviolations removed, where students can actually learn--without even \ngetting to putting in new technologies. It is pretty clear children \ncannot learn if their schools are falling down around them. They cannot \nuse computers if there are no electrical systems to plug them into. \nUnless we engage as a national community to provide local districts and \nto provide States with some assistance in meeting this huge challenge, \nthe challenge will continue to go unmet and we will hamstring an entire \ngeneration and make them less capable of competing in this global \neconomy, this technological age.\n  We can do better. Our parents turned over to us schools that were \nadequate to our needs. The public schools were not in this condition. \nIn fact, if anything, most of the schools that most American children \nattend were built for our generation. We have an obligation to help \nprovide some financial assistance to States and to local districts to \nrepair their crumbling schools.\n  I wanted to put it on a light note before I turned it over to my \ncolleagues. I thought this was a perfect picture to talk about where we \nare. This is a cartoon. As a matter of fact, I have two cartoons. The \nfirst one says, ``A computer in class opens a whole new world\n\n[[Page S4927]]\n\nfor us.'' And the little girl says, ``Look, a picture of a school with \nno leaking roof, no peeling paint, with textbooks for everyone. . . .''\n  ``A whole new world for us'' because this is the real world. It is \nthe crumbling schools, the broken plaster in the walls, the lack of \nelectrical connections, broken plumbing, code violations, lead paint in \nthe walls, asbestos--that is the environment to which we send our \nchildren to schools. The new one would be one with no leaking roof, no \npeeling paint, and with textbooks for everyone. This one, \nunfortunately, is the reality.\n  The second cartoon speaks to the reality again as well. Again, these \nare issues that everybody knows to be true. That is why it is almost \nsurprising to even have to say these things. All you have to do is go \nout in your State, and you will see schools in this kind of condition. \nThis is Peppermint Patty. Peppermint Patty's crumbling school. \nPeppermint Patty, in the first few panels, talks about how the roof is \nleaking again. And then Marcie says, ``Sir, the roof is leaking again \nand you are getting all wet.''\n  ``I don't like to complain, Marcie.''\n  ``Then I'll do it for you. We were just wondering, ma'am, if \nperchance you might have noticed . . . the roof is leaking.''\n  And then the custodian, of course, goes up, falls off the roof, and \nthen, ``How about that, Marcie, I think they fixed the leak in the \nroof. Let's just hope there aren't some other places where . . .'' and \nthat's when the rain starts coming down on Marcie herself.\n  As we talk about the importance of education, of a college education, \nof national standards and goals and the like for education--it is \nconversation. It is just conversation if we don't give the youngsters \nan environment in which to learn. They clearly cannot learn if the \nenvironment, the setting, is such that it impedes their ability to \naccess the technology, it diminishes their ability to focus in on what \nit is we are trying to communicate to them.\n  This last panel which I wanted to bring to your attention, really, I \nthought, points out the problem altogether. That is, infrastructure, \nfacilities, the environment, the structure have been forgotten. It is \neverybody pointing fingers at everybody else. It's this unit of \ngovernment's job, it's that unit of government's job, it is not our \nresponsibility; turning our backs, pointing fingers, and forgetting \naltogether about the basics. We are talking about computers, but we \nhaven't remembered that you have to have electrical systems to use \nthem. So this last one says, ``This is how it is, Mr. Principal. Half \nthe kids in our class can't read and half can't multiply 6 by 8. None \nof them ever heard of Bosnia and couldn't tell you who wrote Hamlet.''\n  ``I talked to the principal, sir.''\n  ``What did he say about the leaking roof?'' says Peppermint Patty, \nwho is under a rainstorm.\n  And Marcie says, ``I forgot to mention it.''\n  Well, we have been forgetting to mention it. We have been neglecting \ninfrastructure and we have been letting the problem get worse and \nworse. As with any maintenance issue, if you let it go, it doesn't get \nbetter, it just gets worse. So this amendment, this $5 billion, is just \na start to try to reach the level of the $112 billion that the General \nAccounting Office tells us is needed.\n  Here is reality. I have been showing cartoons, but this is reality. \nThis is a chemistry lab, built probably when I was in high school, if \nnot before--probably when my parents were in high school. Clearly, this \nis not suitable to teach any youngster chemistry in these times. There \nis no equipment. It is falling down. You can see this is just age; this \nis not kids trashing the school. That's just old, outdated--I would \nimagine, from the type of construction, since I like to do \nconstruction, this is probably close to the 1920's, if not earlier.\n  Here is another. Desks that you and I probably used that have been \nrecycled, Mr. President, with peeling paint. One of the problems the \nGAO found is a lot of the paint peeling has lead in it, and we know \nfrom other research what lead does to youngsters.\n  Here's another one. The kids may have trashed the lockers, but at the \nsame time the lockers seem to me to have gone a long way toward being \ntrashed before the kids got there. You can't use these things.\n  But this is the condition of the schools.\n  Here is another lab. Look at that. What do we tell our children about \nthe value of education? What do we tell them about what we think about \nthem, sending them into conditions like this?\n  Before I conclude, I want to point out something that may be \ncounterintuitive about this whole issue but that is reality; that is, \ncrumbling schools is not just an inner city problem. Crumbling schools \nare not just problems in poor communities. Crumbling schools happen all \nover our country. In fact, the GAO tells us the central cities \nexperience crumbling schools at a rate of 38 percent; the suburban \ncommunities at a rate of 29 percent; the rural communities at a rate of \n30 percent. Add to that that it is a nationwide problem--in fact, if \nanything, the West has this problem more than the Midwest, and the East \nhas it more than the Midwest. So it is a problem that is national and \nis in every kind of community and affects 14 million children every \nday.\n\n  It is shameful to me that we did not have this already in the budget \nas part of the budget agreement. I was very distressed about that part. \nBut I hope the Members of this Chamber will recognize that this is \nreality, that we have to have a partnership. We need to help States and \nlocal governments meet this need. We are not looking to take anything \nover. This will maintain local control of the schools, local control of \nthe decisionmaking about what schools get fixed and what features get \naddressed. But, surely, surely, with a $112 billion national problem, \nhere at the national level we can find $5 billion to help our school \ndistricts and our States repair the crumbling schools in which we \nexpect our children to learn.\n  Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join my colleague and friend from \nIllinois, Senator Moseley-Braun, and commend her for bringing this \nmatter to the U.S. Senate. Her amendment addresses basic and \nfundamental needs to help children get a good education, and to offset \nthat by closing some of the tax loopholes.\n  In reviewing the agreements that were made in the balanced budget \namendment, it is clear that almost every program is going to bear the \nbrunt of belt tightening--with the exception of tax expenditures. There \nare over $430 billion in tax expenditures this current year, and that \nnumber will increase as we move to enact the tax breaks. We have still \nnot closed the billionaire's tax loophole that permits Americans who \nhave accumulated large amounts of wealth to renounce their citizenship \nand take their wealth overseas. I think we can afford to close that \nparticular loophole and pay for this particular amendment. There are \nothers that are just as outrageous that, with any fair evaluation of \nthose loopholes, would clearly be closed.\n  It is entirely appropriate that we give favorable consideration to \nthis measure.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment by Senator Moseley-\nBraun to provide the $5 billion for improving America's school \nfacilities.\n  Good education begins with decent places to learn. Yet, in too many \npublic schools across the Nation, children have to run an obstacle \ncourse to learn, and that is wrong.\n  Schools across the country are facing enormous problems with \ncrumbling facilities. Fourteen million children in one-third of the \nschools are learning in substandard school buildings. Over half of all \nschools report at least one major building in disrepair, with cracked \nfoundations, leaking roofs and other major problems.\n  Yet, student enrollments are at an all-time high and will continue to \nrise, causing even greater overcrowding in many schools. We cannot \ntolerate a situation in which facilities deteriorate while enrollments \nescalate.\n  Massachusetts is no exception. Forty-one percent of Massachusetts \nschools report that at least one building needs extensive repair or \nshould be replaced; 75 percent report serious problems, such as \nplumbing or heating defects; 80 percent have at least one \nunsatisfactory environmental factor.\n\n[[Page S4928]]\n\n  Faulty boilers and leaky pipes are responsible for sewage leaks and \nbackups at many schools in Springfield. Sixty percent of Springfield \nschools do not have power outlets and electric wiring needed to \naccommodate computers and multimedia equipment.\n  At the Washington School in Springfield, windows are falling out, so \nthey cannot keep the school well heated. At Chestnut school, an entire \nfloor was closed due to disrepair and has not been reopened. To add to \nthe problem, enrollment in Springfield schools has increased by 1,500 \nstudents, or 6 percent, over the past 2 years. Facilities are not large \nenough to accommodate the number of students in the schools, forcing \nteachers to hold classes in storage rooms, large closets and basements.\n  In Boston, nearly half the schools need major upgrades in their \nventilation systems to meet current air quality standards.\n  It is interesting, Mr. President, that over half of the schools in my \nhome city of Boston are still not handicapped accessible.\n  Schools in the city cannot keep their heating systems functioning \nproperly. On a given day, 15 to 30 schools report that their heating \nsystems are not working. Of Boston's 120 school buildings, 90 do not \nhave adequate power outlets and wiring to accommodate today's \ntechnology. Roofs are crumbling at the Dearborn School, Hyde Park High \nSchool, Dickerman High School, and the Trotter School.\n  Of the 50 public schools in Worcester, 10 schools need new boilers \nfor their heating systems. Almost every school needs windows replaced. \nHalf of Worcester's schools are not equipped with the wiring and \ninfrastructure to handle new technology, and the vocational high school \nrisks losing its certification because the building is in such poor \ncondition. Its outdated electrical wiring is especially dangerous.\n  Worcester's schools are also becoming overcrowded. Forest Grove \nMiddle School is at its full capacity of 750 students. They expect 150 \nadditional students to enroll next year, forcing them to rent rooms at \na local church to offset the overcrowding.\n  At Holt School in Whitman, the foundation is cracked. Water damage \nhas loosened the ceiling tiles in the cafeteria, and the ceiling of the \nboiler room is collapsing.\n  At the Toy Town Elementary School in Winchendon, the roofs in the \ngymnasium are leaking, the window caulking is deteriorating, and there \nis asbestos in the cafeteria ceiling and floor tiles.\n  It is difficult to teach or learn in dilapidated buildings and \novercrowded classrooms. That is why this amendment is so important. It \nwould provide $5 billion in funding over the next 5 years to help \nschool districts meet their priorities for repair, renovation and \nmodernization of their facilities, and it is fully offset by closing \nthe tax loopholes and corporate subsidies in the budget resolution. The \namendment does not bind anyone to one specific plan of how to provide \nsupport for school facilities. Those details will be worked out later. \nWhat the amendment does do is put priority on addressing the urgent \nneeds of schools and the children who learn in them.\n  It is preposterous to pretend that we can prepare students for the \n21st century in dilapidated 19th century classrooms. I urge my \ncolleagues to support Senator Moseley-Braun's amendment.\n  This chart indicates, Mr. President, exactly what the conditions are, \nas pointed out by the Senator from Illinois: Fourteen million children \nin substandard schools; 7 million attend schools with asbestos and lead \npaint. This provides for mental retardation and slow developmental \nlearning; radon in the ceilings and wall; 12 million children go to \nschools under leaking roofs; and one-third of American children study \nin classrooms without enough panel outlets and electrical wiring to \naccommodate computer and multimedia equipment.\n  We are going to spend $7.2 million in the title I program to help \nchildren to get the basic math and reading skills they need. But if \nthose children are in dilapidated buildings, we are not spending that \nmoney wisely. We are going to be spending about $491 million in Goals \n2000, to help States and local communities establish standards so that \nthey can measure the progress that children are making. If the Nation's \nclassrooms are falling apart, When you have the kind of classrooms like \nthis, how can we expect children to meet high academic standards?\n  As the Senator from Illinois pointed out, we are going to be spending \n$1.8 billion for computers, electronics, and Internet access in the \nschools over the next 5 years. If you do not have the electrical \noutlets in which to plug in the computers, what difference will our \ntechnology investment make? We will spend hundreds of millions of \ndollars in upgrading professional training for teachers, but forcing \nthem to teach in crumbling schools. So we are willing to get computers \ninto the classroom, upgrade teaching, provide additional funding for \nliteracy, and provide the additional funding for early interventions, \nbut are going to ignore the deterioration of our schools? This is a \nnational problem that must be addressed. GAO estimates that communities \nneed $112 billion nationwide to repair their schools. It's a problem \nacross the country--in urban areas, rural areas, and suburban areas. \nThe places I talked about reflect a broad range of Massachusetts \nschools. Communities in every part of Massachusetts and across the \ncountry are facing urgent needs to repair dilapidated schools. You can \ngo all over this Nation and find out this is true, and it is affecting \nthe children of this Nation.\n\n  So, Mr. President, this is not the first time that Senator Moseley-\nBraun has championed this issue in the Senate. She is not a member of \nthe Labor and Human Resources Committee, but she made her case to us on \nthis issue, and we addressed it.\n  In 1994, we authorized a grant program in the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. In appropriations, we were able to appropriate \n$100 million in fiscal year 1995 for the program. But, when the \nrescissions came, the School Infrastructure Improvement Act was one of \nthe first targets of the Republican leadership--they rescinded 100 \npercent of the funding. Then we saw her amendment included in the \ninitial budget agreement because individuals--Republicans and Democrats \nalike--understood the urgent need to repair the Nation's schools. Then \novernight, it suddenly disappeared. It was in that proposal initially, \nand it should have been in it in the final agreement too. Now the good \nSenator is trying to just put back what was already in the initial \ndraft to make a downpayment on helping to repair the Nation's schools.\n  This very modest program will help school districts to develop \nfunding mechanisms so that they can go ahead and meet this challenge \nthemselves. There will be some help and assistance communities to \nsubsidize some of the interest rates on bonds so that they can afford \nto repair their schools. We do not propose to have the Federal \nGovernment repair local schools. We propose to let the Federal \nGovernment lend a helping hand to those local communities that are hard \npressed to do it themselves, to create decent, safe school buildings \nfor their children.\n  This is a national issue, Mr. President. I am strongly committed, and \nI know my other colleagues are too, to improving the quality of \neducation of young people in this country. It starts right in the \nclassroom and it starts by having a safe, modern classroom where a \nchild can learn. Senator Moseley-Braun's amendment will move us in that \ndirection. I commend her, and I hope the Senate will support her \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I thank the \nSenator from Massachusetts for his eloquence and for his support.\n  I want to yield some time to the Senator from Minnesota, but first I \nwant to point out a couple of things.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts talked about the classroom. It is a \nfact that in America, the rungs of the ladder of opportunity are still \ncrafted in the classroom, and we now know that classrooms all across \nthis country are falling apart and crumbling. The General Accounting \nOffice told us in this report, ``Condition of America's Schools,'' that \nit is going to take $112 billion nationally to even bring our schools \nup to code. So this is no mistake, Mr. President. This is something \nthat is documented by an exhaustive\n\n[[Page S4929]]\n\nstudy by the General Accounting Office.\n  They also then went on to tell us that in addition, ``America's \nSchools Are Not Designed or Equipped for the 21st Century.'' So they \nwent on to tell us what these charts say and pictures say and all of us \nknow: That you cannot use computers in a classroom with a broken \nwindow, with falling ceilings, with peeling paint with lead in it, with \nno electrical system. This has been confirmed by the General Accounting \nOffice.\n  Then they went on to tell us, with ``Profiles of School Conditions by \nState,'' that this is a national problem. This is not just Illinois or \nMassachusetts or Minnesota, this is all over America, and each State \nhas this problem.\n  Then they went on to tell us, ``States' Financial and Technical \nSupport Varies,'' that ``America's Schools Report Differing \nConditions,'' and that ``State Efforts to Reduce Funding Gaps Between \nPoor and Wealthy Districts'' are poor and inadequate.\n  I submit to you, Mr. President, that if all the States and cities, \nthe local school districts, the rural communities all did their best in \nterms of property tax support for rebuilding our crumbling schools, \nthey would have a hard time coming up with $112 billion without some \nassistance.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for two questions?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Is the Senator saying that the Finance Committee ought \nto be able to find that $5 billion over 5 years out of $2.3 trillion--\n$2.3 trillion--in tax expenditures, which include the billionaire's tax \nloophole and other egregious violations? Does the Senator think we \nought to be able to find $5 billion out of $2.3 trillion in tax \nexpenditures over the next 5 years?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his \nquestion, and he is exactly on the point. I absolutely agree. In fact, \nthis is the cookbook; this is the book with the loopholes. It is called \na loophole book instead of a cookbook. Here are the loopholes. The \npeople who are billionaires can leave the country, renounce their U.S. \ncitizenship and not pay a dime of taxes. In fact, they do it so they \nwill not have to pay taxes on their money, and that represents more \nthan we are asking for to rebuild our crumbling schools, and yet that \nis not taken out.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Am I correct that this is not a partisan issue? Senator \nMcCain has been a leader in trying to close down some of the tax \nloopholes. So the idea of closing them is not just something put forth \nby the Senator from Illinois. This has been recognized across partisan \nlines that we ought to be able to close some of the tax loopholes in \nthe interest of the American taxpayers.\n  Finally, I ask the Senator this question, and she touched on it so \neloquently earlier: What is the message that we send to school children \nif we do not pass this amendment? We have been talking about the \ncollapsing roofs, inadequate boilers, windows that have fallen out and \nhaven't been replaced, schools in Boston whose heating systems \nfrequently fail. But what does this say to the schoolchildren of this \ncountry about our commitment to them when we are trying to, either as \nparents or as community leaders, say that continued education, the \nquality of schoolteachers, and homework is important; that we want \nyoung people to apply themselves and develop their own skills to \nenhance their educational opportunities so that they will have good \njobs in the future? What do we say when we impress on them that what \nthe learn is what they are going to earn in the future? What message \ndoes it say to them every single day when they go to school to learn in \ndilapidated classrooms?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for the \nquestion. And I think the message that it sends is that we are a bunch \nof hypocrites. I think the message that it sends is that everybody \ntalks about education. We have an ``education everything.'' You can \nfind probably an education dogcatcher somewhere in America that ran on \na platform: I'm going to fix the schools. But we never seem to be able \nto get there.\n  And so after a while the children become cynical and begin to believe \nthat we do not believe education is important, that we do not really \nput our money where our mouth is, that we are prepared to send them \ninto classrooms that suggest a diminished support or diminished \nimportance of what they do.\n  We send our children to classrooms every day in conditions that we \nwould allow no worker to work in. We send our children to classrooms \nevery day that we would not for a moment tolerate in our homes. And so \nif that is the case, then we say, well, we want you to go to learn \nsomewhere that looks like this, that looks like the charts I have had. \nAnd we expect you to learn in that environment. What that says is \nlearning is not really important.\n  As we stand up and make our pious speeches about the globalization of \nour economy and the information age and the brave new world--again, \nthat is why I thought this cartoon was so funny. ``A computer in class \nopens a whole new world for us!'' ``Look! A picture of a school with no \nleaking roof, no peeling paint, with textbooks for everyone * * *.'' \nThat is a whole new world, because the world we give them is one with \npeeling paint and leaking roofs and no textbooks. I think it is just \noutrageous and shameful.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Finally, how does the Senator address the question that \nthis is going to be a budget buster, a deal breaker? We fully offset \nthe amendment through corporate tax loopholes. If we pass this \namendment of $5 billion with an offset of $5 billion, therefore making \nit revenue neutral, is it challenging to find $5 billion out of $2.3 \ntrillion in tax expenditures to spend on the renovation and repair of \nthe Nation's crumbling schools? That looking out for the children of \nthis country is a deal breaker? I do not find that as a very persuasive \nargument.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. That is right. Out of $2.3 trillion, $5 billion \npales in comparison. It is just a start. It is not a budget buster by \nany means. In fact, if anything, it keeps the bottom line constant and \njust says we are going to give out a little less in tax breaks, we are \njust going to do a little less on the tax side, we are going to be a \nlittle more moderate in how many chickens we try to put in every pot \nand instead focus on our priorities and provide our youngsters with an \nopportunity to learn. That is all it does, I say to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I hope that the Senator's amendment is approved.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  I want to pick up with one other point the Senator made. And that is, \nthere is no reason why this should be a partisan issue. Politics should \nstop at the schoolroom door. There ought to be Republican legislators \nand Democratic legislators alike standing up saying, we are prepared to \nhelp our States and local governments fix our crumbling schools.\n  This should not come down to being: The Republicans are for crumbling \nschools and the Democrats want to fix them. This should not come down \nto being: Republicans do not care about their States having to meet 112 \nbillion dollars' worth of need that the General Accounting Office has \ndocumented State by State.\n  And I suggest to my colleagues, I know your staffs all have them, but \nwe have sent around copies of a State-by-State analysis. Take a look at \nwhat your State has in terms of the cost of bringing the schools just \nup to code.\n  We are not talking about bells and whistles here. We are not talking \nabout putting computers in the classrooms here. We are not talking \nabout curtains. We are not even talking about new paint jobs. We are \ntalking about taking care of the foundation, the electrical wiring, the \nplumbing, the roof, the windows, the basics, the floors.\n\n  There was a school in the southern part of our country where the roof \ncaved in altogether, a few minutes after the children had left the \nclassroom; a school in my State where the track team had to use the \nprison because the gymnasium was so rotted away. It is an outrage and a \nshame, and we have an opportunity to address this problem on a \nbipartisan basis this morning.\n  The Senator from Minnesota has been kind enough to wait here.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n\n[[Page S4930]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me also thank Senator Moseley-Braun \nfor bringing this amendment to the floor of the Senate. And I am very \nproud to support her and be an original cosponsor.\n  Mr. President, I am just going to build on a few remarks that have \nbeen made. There are 14 million children learning in substandard \nschools; and 7 million children attending schools with asbestos, lead \npaint, or radon in the ceilings or walls.\n  Mr. President, this really is a scandal. This is really \nunconscionable. And this amendment goes to the heart of the question of \npriorities. What this amendment says is that rather than continuing to \nspend the hundreds of billions of dollars in a variety of different \nloopholes and deductions, billionaire tax breaks and all, transfer $5 \nbillion over 5 years and put that into investing to rebuild our schools \nthat are crumbling all across America.\n  I suggest to my colleague from Illinois, Senator Moseley-Braun, or \nSenator Durbin, that I really believe that in many ways this is the \npriority vote. I really do, because it is just too dear a price to pay \nto refuse to go after some of these loopholes and deductions, never \nmind the fact that behind the loopholes and deductions are the heavy \nhitters and the people who are connected and the people who have the \nclout.\n  This is all about who gets represented in the Senate. It is too dear \na price to pay to not ask for a little bit of sacrifice over here and \nplug some of these loopholes or deductions and not make this \ninvestment.\n  As I look at this budget agreement right now--I will be speaking \nabout it more this afternoon with an amendment that I have on the floor \nof the Senate; so I want to stay within the framework of Senator \nMoseley-Braun's amendment--I just ask the question, where are the funds \nto rebuild schools that are crumbling all across our Nation? There is \nnot one penny.\n  Where are the funds--we went through this yesterday--to get health \ncare coverage to every child who lacks it? We are still not willing to \ndo that.\n  And I say that any budget that does not provide at least some funds \nto begin to rebuild some of the schools in our country, schools that \nare crumbling all across the Nation, is hardly a budget that represents \na bridge to the next century. This is not a budget that represents a \nbridge to the next century. Not one penny is invested in our crumbling \nschools.\n  Mr. President, this is wrong. I wish we could just do an \ninstantaneous poll and get the results in, because I know that people \nin the country would say it is wrong that 14 million children learn in \nsubstandard schools, it is wrong that 12 million children go to school \nunder leaky roofs, it is wrong that 7 million children attend schools \nwith asbestos, lead paint.\n  How well could we do our jobs if we were here and the toilets did not \nwork and the heating systems did not work or the air-conditioning did \nnot work, and we were cold during the winter, hot during the summer, if \nthere was asbestos or lead paint, the ceilings and the walls were \ndecrepit?\n  It is not that way here. This is splendor. And thank God that it is. \nThis is the Nation's Capitol. Can't we have some of this splendor for \nchildren in America?\n  In all due respect, we are getting way ahead of the curve with $35 \nbillion that goes to tax credits, deductions for college. I was a \ncollege teacher. Fine. But we have to get our children to the point \nwhere they are able to attend higher education. That does not happen \nunless we make this investment.\n\n  This is the amendment. Do we continue to just fork out lavish \nsubsidies to billionaires and large multinational corporations that do \nnot need them or do we at least begin to make the investment in the \nschools that are crumbling all across this country?\n  This speaks to the very issue of justice and fairness. This is a \ncritically important amendment. I hope we will pass it.\n  I thank the Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Senator from Minnesota for his \neloquence and for his passion and support as well.\n  To the Senator from Florida, Senator Graham, I yield----\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Five minutes.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to rise on behalf of the \namendment that is being offered by our distinguished colleague from \nIllinois.\n  Frankly, my own criticism of her proposal is that I think it is too \nmodest in relationship to the challenge that we face as a Nation. As \nshe has pointed out, our own General Accounting Office has indicated \nthat there is a need in this Nation to bring existing schools up to a \nstandard of basic safety, health, and educational adequacy of over $100 \nbillion. What is not included in that number, Mr. President, is what is \nrequired to build the new classrooms for the exploding student \npopulation.\n  If I could use my own State as an example, Mr. President. Last year \nwe had over 55,000 new students enrolled at the public schools in the \nState of Florida. That number will continue, in terms of angle rate of \ngrowth, for the foreseeable future.\n  Similar numbers are true in States across America, as the baby boom \npopulation is now having babies and those babies are reaching school \nage. So we have a crisis not only in terms of rebuilding our older \nschools, but also in assuring new schools in order to avoid overcrowded \nclassrooms.\n  If I could tell a personal story, my own daughter was a kindergarten \nteacher in Dade County, FL. Her last year teaching in a brand new \nelementary school she had 38 5-year-olds in her kindergarten class. My \ndaughter is a wonderful teacher. I would defy anyone to truly educate \n38 5-year-olds in one classroom.\n  I might say, she went on from that experience. She was married, she \ntaught for a brief period in Virginia, and now is a mother. In fact she \nis not only a mother, she is a mother of triplets. And so she said she \nwas the only mother of triplets who ended up with 35 fewer children to \ndeal with.\n  Mr. President, that personal story underscores what is happening in \ntoo many classrooms to too many of our young Americans. And that is, \nthat because we have fallen so woefully behind in maintenance as well \nas new construction, we are not providing the educational facilities \nthat students need.\n  The question is asked, ``Well, that's a State and local \nresponsibility. Why are you here in Washington talking about this? You, \na former State legislator, a former Governor, you certainly understand \nwhere the responsibility for education lies.'' Absolutely.\n  I would defend the right and the importance of maintaining our \ntradition that States and local communities especially be responsible \nfor those things that happen inside the classroom, curriculum, \npersonnel policy, teacher relationships. But, Mr. President, there is a \nrole for the Federal Government in the physical facilities of schools.\n  We have demonstrated this for a long time in higher education. There \nis probably not a major college or university in America that cannot \npoint to a substantial number of its physical facilities having been \nbuilt with totally or in part Federal funds. We have recognized that \ndistinction of concrete and steel from what happens inside the \nclassroom and the appropriateness of a Federal role in meeting those \nfacilities challenges.\n\n  If we are serious about the proposition that the key to a competitive \nAmerica in the 21st century is going to be how well our Americans are \neducated, and how well they will be able to compete in the increasingly \nglobalized economy, certainly the Federal Government has a role in \nseeing that the physical places in which that preparation is going to \ntake place meet acceptable standards. They do not meet those standards \nin too many communities in America today.\n  And we, Mr. President, are about to exacerbate that situation. One of \nthe reasons that we have 55,000-plus new students in the Florida public \nschools is because of Federal immigration policy.\n  The Federal Government has adopted policies which have resulted in \ntens of\n\n[[Page S4931]]\n\nthousands of young people who were not born in the United States now \nbeing in the United States and being educated in our public schools. I \nthink the Federal Government has a moral responsibility to assist when \nit is the precipitator of a significant amount of the challenge that \nschool districts face.\n  We are about to consider some substantial enhancements in the \nopportunity for young people to go to college through credits and \ndeductions toward that tuition. Mr. President, that could have a \nsignificant effect on college tuition.\n  I have a letter from the Assistant Deputy Secretary of the Treasury \nwhich indicates that the estimate of enrollment which will increase \nsubstantially in higher education as a result of the proposal for \ncredits and deductions for college tuition is between 120,000 and 1.4 \nmillion. So we are about to consider a proposal which has the potential \nnot only of creating a substantial surge in additional enrollment in \nhigher education but would have a spillover effect in terms of the \nnumber of students and the kinds of educational opportunities that \nwould be expected, particularly within our secondary schools.\n  Mr. President, the Federal Government has a second responsibility \nbecause we are a significant part of the policies which are causing the \ndemands that are occurring on the physical facilities of our public \nschools.\n  Finally, one of the reasons that the reports are as dire as the \nGeneral Accounting Office report states is so many States and local \nschool districts are against the wall in their capacity to finance the \nmaintenance of their schools and new construction. It has not been \npeople at the local level that are indefinite, it is not that they are \nblind to the problem, it is that they are in many cases out of options \nas to how to deal with the problem, either because of statutory or \neconomic limitations.\n  I believe there is an appropriate Federal role to be a partner, and I \nunderscore the word partner, with States and local school districts in \nmeeting their school construction needs. This proposal is a beginning \ntoward that new very important relationship.\n  I commend the Senator from Illinois for her leadership in this \nmatter. I hope her voice will be heard by our colleagues. I can tell \nyou it is being heard out in America. They understand the importance of \nthis issue. They understand the need to have Washington respond in a \nmeaningful and tangible way. The question is whether we hear those \nvoices here in this Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time allotted to the Senator from Florida \nhas expired.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. The Senator from Florida raises a very good point \nthat I did not touch on but I think it is important to mention and that \nis that we at the national level do not even pay for the Federal \nmandates. We are not even paying or giving the States and local \ngovernments the assistance they need to pay for the things we have told \nthem to do.\n  Small wonder that the resources get diverted, and so we wind up with \ncrumbling roofs and classrooms that look like this. Small wonder. We \nput this burden on them, and now we are saying in terms of what you \nneed to do, we are not going to help.\n  Well, I hope that is not the message this morning. I hope that \nRepublicans and Democrats alike will come together on behalf of giving \nour children a decent environment in which they need to learn.\n  Less than 1 percent of this budget, less than 1 percent goes to \nsupport elementary and secondary education. Less than 1 percent. So we \nstand up and we have education this, that, and the other--the education \nSenator, the education President, the education Governors, the \neducation mayors, and less than 1 percent of this budget goes to \neducation. None goes to fix our crumbling schools unless we pass this \namendment.\n  (At the request of Ms. Moseley-Braun, the following statement was \nordered to be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as the Bible says, ``To every thing \nthere is a season, a time to break down and a time to build up.''\n  The unfortunate truth is that too many of our Nation's schools have \nbroken down. It is long past the time for us to build our schools back \nup--literally.\n  You have heard my colleague from Illinois cite some of the details--\n$112 billion is needed across this country to rebuild, repair and \nrenovate schools. Some 14 million children attend school daily in \nfacilities that are unsafe and inadequate. To put this in some \nperspective, this is almost five times the population of the entire \nState of Iowa.\n  This as a national problem and needs a national response. A Federal \nprogram to assist needy communities in rebuilding schools will not and \nshould not circumvent the primary local and State control of education. \nHowever, I firmly believe the Federal Government needs to become a \nbetter partner for States and local communities with respect to \neducation, in general, and construction of school facilities, in \nparticular.\n  Senator Mosely-Braun has done a good job talking about the need \nnationally. I want to take a few moments to talk about the state of \nschool facilities in my State.\n  Iowans take great pride in education. Our State has a long tradition \nof placing a high value on education. In fact, Iowa students often lead \nthe Nation in performance on national and even international \nassessments. This is a tribute to the teachers, families, school \nboards, administrators, and State policymakers who have made education \na top priority for decades. I applaud the commitment that Iowa has made \nto education. However, we still have much to do.\n  The General Accounting Office report found that 79 percent of Iowa \nschools report a need to repair or upgrade buildings to bring them up \nto overall good condition.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I frequently visit schools in my State. I \nam often struck by the fact that many schools have not changed much \nsince I was a student. We won't talk about how long ago that was.\n  However, our homes, offices, shopping centers, cars and just about \nevery thing else has changed radically. However, reinvestment and \nrenovations have not been made to our Nation's schools. As a result, we \nare trying to prepare our children for the 21st century in facilities \nthat hardly make the grade in the last one. We can certainly do better \nthan that.\n  In 1994, Senator Mosely-Braun secured legislation to authorize \nfunding for school infrastructure. At that time, I served as chairman \nof the education appropriations subcommittee and provided $100 million \nfor new school infrastructure. I was very disappointed when that modest \ndownpayment was rescinded the following year.\n  A problem that was a critical need then, has gotten even worse. In \n1995, Iowa State University conducted a comprehensive survey about the \ncondition of school buildings in the state and estimated that $3.4 \nbillion is needed to repair and rebuild these facilities. This survey \nwas updated a few months ago and the tab has risen to $4 billion.\n  This is a problem that gets worse by the day and the impact on high \nquality learning is significant. It is long past time for the Federal \nGovernment to step up to the plate and help remedy this problem.\n  The amendment I am offering with the Senator from Illinois is a very \nimportant response to this urgent national concern. We believe that \nchildren in a nation as rich as ours should not have to attend schools \nthat look more like they belong in the third world. We implore our \ncolleagues to help us provide a modest sum to rebuild our crumbling \nschools.\n  Mr. President, I am fully aware that many of my colleagues will say \nthat this problem is just too big for the Federal Government to handle. \nOur critics will point out that the need is enormous--$112 billion and \nwe are proposing a $5 billion solution. However, this plan will \ngenerate $20 billion in newschool construction. To provide this \nadditional funding we simply call for closing additional tax loopholes.\n  Our amendment continues to build on the positive aspects of this \nbudget. The underlying legislation increases funding for activities \nrelated to education and training by 13 percent over the next 5 years \nby calling for expanded access to Head Start and increased funding for \nPell grants. In addition, the budget makes changes to the Tax Code to \nhelp Americans pay for college by providing tuition tax credits and \ndeductions for postsecondary education. These investments are vital to\n\n[[Page S4932]]\n\nthe future of the United States and our ability to remain competitive \nin the international marketplace.\n  The problems facing school facilities across our Nation are enormous \nand will not be solved overnight. However, as they say, Rome wasn't \nbuilt in a day. Further, if we had that attitude in the 1950's we would \nnot have built the Interstate Highway system or put a man on the Moon \nin 1969. As we know, every journey begins with one step.\n  This is a very important step for us to take. One that will help \nprovide safe, sound learning environments for millions of children. I \nurge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to support the amendment \noffered by my colleague, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, to help rebuild \nour Nation's schools.\n  This amendment would ensure that any budget agreement that we reach \nwill include funding for school construction. I believe that we must \nensure that we meet the needs of our local communities to help them \nupgrade the Nation's schools.\n  I am an original cosponsor of S. 456, the Partnership to Rebuild \nAmerica's Schools Act. This bill would provide $5 billion over 4 years \nto subsidize up to 50 percent of the interest or other financing costs \nfor school construction.\n  These funds would help States and localities leverage scarce \nresources to help upgrade, repair, and build new schools.\n  In my State of Maryland, school enrollment is at an all time high. \nMany of the counties in Maryland like Prince Georges and Montgomery are \nrapidly expanding and the school districts are struggling to keep pace.\n  I hear from parents, students, and teachers about the need to upgrade \nthe schools. Our children must be in environments which are conducive \nto learning. Over one-third of the schools in Maryland are in desperate \nneed of repair.\n  Under S. 456, Maryland would receive approximately $57.9 million in \nFederal funds to support $231.6 million for school construction. \nBaltimore public schools would receive $31.4 million.\n  I believe that funding school construction has to be a priority for \nour Nation. Children cannot learn in schools with leaky roofs, poor \nventilation, crumbling walls, and other problems. This problem is \nespecially acute in rural areas and inner cities. Many of these schools \nfail to meet even minimum local health and safety codes.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Our Nation's school \nchildren deserve no less.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in strong support of \nthe amendment offered by Senator Moseley-Braun to begin a vital \nundertaking--the rebuilding of America's crumbling schools.\n  Mr. President, we all talk a good game here about children. We say \ntime and time again that America's children are at the center of our \nefforts--be it education, job training, or tax policy. However, this \namendment asks us to support more than rhetoric, it asks us to support \nthe actual foundations of our schools.\n  Unfortunately, our schools are in desperate need of help in this \narea. In the richest Nation in the world, we have schools without \nadequate heat or plumbing and leaky roofs. One-third of all students in \nthis country go to school in buildings that are considered inadequate, \nand 60 percent of American students attend school in buildings that are \nin need of repair. There are schools just minutes from us here today, \nwhere whole sections of the school are unusable because they are too \ndangerous for children to be in. Beyond basic repairs, schools are also \nlacking electrical and telephone capabilities necessary to install \ncomputers in the classrooms.\n  These problems are everywhere, but here are a few examples from my \nState. Seventy-seven percent of Connecticut's schools report a need to \nupgrade or repair on-site buildings to reach a good overall condition. \nSixty-eight percent of schools report at least one unsatisfactory \nenvironmental factor, 32 percent inadequate roofs, 23 percent \ninadequate exterior walls or windows, and 29 percent inadequate \nelectrical systems. One of the stated goals of our national education \npolicy is to connect every school in the country to the Internet and \nteach every student to use the Internet by the age of 12. Well, I have \nheard from principals in my State who can only dream of computers in \nthe classroom, and they simply hope to obtain a few telephones with \nvoice mail capacity to improve communications with parents.\n  Mr. President, this is a national travesty. We expect children to be \nready for the 21st century, and we encourage them to stay in school, go \nto college, and work hard. But we are not keeping up our side of the \nbargain. Schools with no heat, plumbing that doesn't work, windows that \ndon't open, and no capacity for technology--these are schools that fall \nshort of anyone's expectations, particularly the expectations of our \nstudents.\n  The amendment we are debating here today takes a modest step to begin \nto address this serious challenge. The General Accounting Office has \nestimated that over $110 billion is needed to repair our schools. This \namendment would dedicate an additional $5 billion that would be \nsignificantly leveraged at the State and local level to $20 billion to \nbegin this task and lead the way in this effort. I am pleased to be an \noriginal cosponsor of this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to join \nme in supporting it.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to support the amendment \noffered by my colleague, Senator Moseley-Braun. I want to thank her for \nher tireless efforts to educate the Senate and the American people \nabout the tremendous problems in our nation's school facilities.\n  People talk about the role of the Federal Government in local school \npolicy. By championing this issue, Senator Moseley-Braun has pointed \nout quite accurately that the Federal Government does have a role in K-\n12 education in this country. That role is not in passing down \ncurriculum or trying to tell teachers how to teach. The role is \nguaranteeing certain minimum standards for health, safety, and \nquality--and that is what this proposal is all about.\n  There are schools in our Nation that are rundown, have falling \nplaster or open holes in floors or ceilings, schools with water leaks \nor no air-conditioning in hot climates. There are schools, like Lewis \nand Clark High School in Spokane, WA, an 85-year-old urban high school, \nthat are badly in need of improvements. There are school districts in \nplaces like the small town of Raymond, WA, which the General Accounting \nOffice has previously identified as needing help with school \nconstruction funding--which cannot renovate all their schools due to \nlocal economic factors. This amendment could have as much as a $40 \nmillion cumulative impact on my State.\n  This amendment is absolutely critical to the students, parents, and \nfamilies in our country who think education is of primary national \npriority. How can we say that we truly care about public education, \nwhen our school rooms smell of mildew, or are far too cold or hot or \ncrowded? How can we say that we care about students learning that all \nAmericans are equal under law, if their track meet across town is at a \nmuch nicer school?\n  Senator Moseley-Braun showed a cartoon on the Senate floor, in which \nstudents were using computers to look at other student's much nicer \nschool buildings. This problem is symbolic. Students in this country \ndeserve decent places to learn. We must make sure that the Moseley-\nBraun school construction amendment is included in this budget.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I will reserve the remainder of my \ntime. I understand that Senators Torricelli and Durbin will speak with \ntime yielded from the budget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry. What hour are we supposed to \nvote on the amendment of the Senator from Illinois?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would observe that there is no \nagreed upon time to vote. The Senator from New Mexico has 9 minutes and \n43 seconds, the Senator from Illinois has 5 minutes and 30 seconds, and \nthe vote will occur after that time expires pending any other \nagreements reached on the Senate floor.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n\n[[Page S4933]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would very much appreciate it and I \nwill do the same for you if we could keep the debate on amendments to a \nminimum--not taking away the prerogatives but not adding to the time. I \nassume that you all could live with that.\n  If you need, on this particular amendment, an extra 5 minutes off the \nbill--but after that we ought to try and stick to a limited amount.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I agree, Senator Domenici, that we have to start \nconstraining time because the list is long and unless we get after it \nwe will not have a chance for everybody to be heard on the amendments \nthat they care about.\n  I suggest, however, we give 5 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey \nand after that, 5 minutes to the Senator from Illinois, who has \nrequested time, as well, and we will try to button it up. I know the \nsponsor of the amendment has a few minutes that she will complete.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time, then, would the Senator desire?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has 5 minutes and 30 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So that means three Senators with essentially 5 minutes \neach, and then you are finished on your side.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Five minutes each from the resolution.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. She will use hers off of the bill. She has 5 minutes \nleft.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will that be enough time to finish your remarks, the \n5 minutes you have remaining?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Yes, it will.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first of all, there is no precedent for \nFederal involvement in the construction of elementary and secondary \ninstitutions except the Education Infrastructure Act of 1994.\n  It has an interesting history. The program had a total appropriation \nof $100 million and that was rescinded in 1995, no funding was provided \nin 1996, and no funding was requested by the President of the United \nStates in his 1997 budget. No funding was provided in 1997. In fact, it \nis very interesting, the President, in his fiscal year 1996 Department \nof Education budget said the following: ``The construction and \nrenovation of school facilities has traditionally been the \nresponsibility of State and local governments financed primarily by \nlocal taxpayers. We are opposed to the creation of a new Federal grant \nprogram for school construction.'' That was the President of the United \nStates speaking not too long ago.\n  The justification for this initiative is a 1995 GAO report which was \nbased on a national sample of schools and school officials who were \nsurveyed about construction and renovation needs. These schools \nestimated the Nation needed about $112 billion to repair and upgrade \nAmerica's schools. The GAO concluded that if that is the case, if that \nis their conclusion, I say this money will not even make a ripple of \npositive effect on the horizon on the difficulties that are out there.\n  Scarce resources would be better spent on clear-cut Federal \npriorities, clear-cut education priorities, clear-cut issues like \nchildren with disabilities. This budget resolution assumes $5 billion \nincrease for special education and for programs which there is a very \nclear Federal role.\n  Now, from what I understand of this amendment, the amendment would be \npaid for by, once again, reducing the level of net tax reductions \nallowable for the American people. It seems to me that every time we \nturn around somebody wants to say, ``We want to give the American \npeople less of a tax cut.'' We have this great need for something so we \nwill just take it out of the tax-cut package that was going to \nAmericans, including a $500 child care credit to American families who \nare raising children and having a difficult time getting them through \nschool.\n\n  So when the time is up, while I laud my colleague for her efforts \nhere on the floor, I will move to table this amendment. I hope there \nwould be broad support to go along with the conclusions which the \nPresident of the United States so brilliantly stated in 1996 when he \nsaid that the Federal Government should not be involved in the \nconstruction and repair of public school facilities, that that was the \nresponsibility of local government. I paraphrase, but nonetheless I do \nstate accurately what the President of the United States thought just \nabout 18 months ago.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank my colleague for yielding me the time.\n  Mr. President, in my brief tenure in this institution I have never \nfelt more motivated on an individual amendment and in addressing a \nhigher national priority than endorsing and speaking today on the \namendment of Carol Moseley-Braun regarding school finance. She has made \nan enormous contribution to this institution.\n  Mr. President, like every Member of this Senate, I share the priority \nof balancing the Federal budget. It is due, it is required, and it is \nessential.\n  We do no service to the country, however, if in our desire to balance \nthe Federal budget we also lose sight of all other Federal priorities. \nBalancing the Federal budget is important, but it is not the only \nbusiness of this country. It is noteworthy that the principle \ncontribution in reducing the Federal debt in recent years has come from \nneither reducing spending nor raising taxes. It is the unmistakable \nresult of a growing, expanding economy.\n  The amendment before the Senate is relevant and not an obstacle to \nreducing the debt of the U.S. Government because education is the \nfoundation of an expanding economy. My goal is not simply to see us \nbalance the Federal budget for the next few years but for the next \ngeneration. That is unachievable in a Nation with a $100 billion \ninventory of crumbling schools, schools which cannot teach modern \ntechnology, where children cannot even sit safely in a classroom.\n  The GAO has reported that 14 million of our own children are in \nschools with extensive need of repair or requiring total replacement. \nHalf of our schools are unable to take advantage of the latest \ntechnology because of inadequate wiring. Mr. President, 74 percent have \noutlived their usefulness.\n  Recently, I toured some of the most troubled schools of my own State \nof New Jersey. In Perth Amboy, Newark, Jersey City, and Paterson, I saw \nstudents sitting in classrooms trying to learn the latest of \nmathematics and science with buckets next to their desk to collect the \nrain, classrooms that were being held in school corridors because \nscience classes were not safe, gymnasiums used for lecture halls \nbecause of inadequate space.\n  It may be that what we do today involving the Federal Government and \nthe rebuilding of our schools is a precedent. So be it. There was a \ntime when the Federal Government had no role in the building of roads. \nIt was local. Then we built a national economy. There was a time the \nFederal Government was not involved in transportation. Then we saw the \nneed for expanded interstate commerce.\n  Today there can be no misstating that this country will go no further \nand no farther in the education of our children and their preparation \nfor the future.\n  I respect my colleagues who may have a different view. But I would \nask this: If you believe that this is not a crisis, that there is no \nFederal role, and that we can build a modern economy, pay our bills and \nbalance our budget into the future without rebuilding these schools, \ncome to New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Newark, or Camden and stand in \nthose schools. Look those children in the eyes. Tell them they have a \nfuture and they can play a role in expanding the American economy \ncompetitive with other students around the world without rebuilding \nthese schools. Tell them and convince yourselves that there is a strong \nand stable American economy without this effort.\n  Mr. President, only a few months ago the President of the United \nStates came to this Congress with a single new domestic initiative. He \ntoo recognized that we live in times of limits. The budget must be \nbalanced. He provided the leadership that got us to this\n\n[[Page S4934]]\n\nday in sight of a balanced budget. But his single new initiative, his \nsingle promise to this country for the next year, was the rebuilding of \nthese schools.\n  There is a $5 billion program represented today by the Senator from \nIllinois that will allow $20 billion worth of construction across \nAmerica by reducing the local costs of borrowing; $20 billion will not \nsolve the problem with a $100 billion inventory. But it is a real \ncontribution. It is a real beginning by having this country address \nthis extraordinary and deep problem.\n  Mr. President, I, too, support the tax cut provisions of the balanced \nbudget plan. I do not want to see it lessened or diminished in any way. \nThat is why it is significant.\n  The provisions by the Senator from Illinois will allow the Finance \nCommittee to either eliminate some tax loopholes or provisions of \ncorporate welfare to compensate so that we can reach a balanced budget \nand keep the current tax reduction plan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has spoken for 5 minutes. The time \nallotted to the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Thank you, very much. I urge support for Carol \nMoseley-Braun's amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to myself to speak in \nbehalf of the Moseley-Braun amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, yesterday we had a vote that was very \nimportant about health care for children. I thought it was a watershed \nvote, because it is an issue which very few American families would \nquarrel with. Children were not insured. They weren't receiving \nadequate health care. A suggestion was made by Senators Hatch and \nKennedy that we have a bipartisan response and raise the cigarette tax, \ntake the money and ensure the children. We lost. We called it for a \nvote and we lost. Health care for children failed yesterday.\n  So we start this morning with another challenge. If you won't provide \nhealth care for children, how about education? Let's test that question \nbefore the U.S. Senate. Have we provided in this great Nation the \nresources for education for our children?\n  Senator Moseley-Braun of Illinois brings that challenge to the floor \nthis morning. She says to the U.S. Senate, let's test this theory. If \nwe are committed as a nation to education, are we committed enough to \ncut tax loopholes that some of wealthiest Americans enjoy, take the \nmoney and put it into building our crumbling schools? She is not \ntalking about carpeting schools in America. Senator Moseley-Braun is \nnot talking about air conditioning for every school in America. She is \ntalking about the basics: safety in the schools and a learning \nenvironment so that our children can walk into a clean classroom, \nheated in the winter, cool in the hot days of summer, and have the \nability to learn.\n  If you go to your State, whatever it is, and look around, you know \nwhat you are going to find. The Government is spending money today for \nthat very type of room: A clean, comfortable room for young people. Is \nit a classroom? No. It is a prison cell. It is a juvenile detention \ncenter. We are building them in Illinois at a record pace. And I will \nbet you that in every State of the country you will find the same is \ntrue.\n\n  As juvenile crime increases, we are building more boot camps, more \ndetention centers and more prisons. If you visit them, many of them are \nnot luxurious. But they are a heck of a lot better than the school \nbuilding just a few blocks away.\n  Should we have clean and adequate facilities for the detention of \nyoung people? Of course. But think about it for a second. We drive past \na high school that is falling down, a junior high school that is \ntotally inadequate, an elementary school where they don't have heating, \nwhere the windows are busted out and the ceilings are falling down, \nand, a few blocks beyond that, see a detention center all brand new and \nshiny and modern. What is the lesson there for the children, or for us \nas taxpayers? Where is the priority? Wouldn't we say that we would have \nat least as high a priority in providing a school building that is good \nfor children? That is what Senator Carol Moseley-Braun has proposed.\n  Let me add another element that is very important as far as I am \nconcerned. In the old days, a school building opened up at 7:30 or 8 \no'clock in the morning and closed up at 2:30 or 3 in the afternoon, and \nthat was it. Kids went home to mom and dad in the ``Ozzie and Harriet'' \nsetting of cookies and milk, or ``The Partridge Family,'' whatever, you \nname it--good, old American values. That isn't what the American family \nlooks like today. Those kids coming home at 2:30 or 3 in the afternoon \nare lucky to find anybody at home. The parent or parents are usually \nout working. And they sit around for 2 or 3 hours waiting for an adult \nto show up. Their choices in life at that point are television or \ntrouble. Sad choices.\n  So we are expanding the concept of schools beyond just learning, to \nbe community centers so that at the end of the ordinary schoolday the \nkids stay there in a safe learning environment. They would stay there \nuntil the parents were home in the evening, and they would have a \npositive experience.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If we are going to use our schools so that kids have a \nbetter chance in life, don't we want them to be decent, safe buildings? \nHonest to goodness, if we fail, if these kids go out in the street, get \nin trouble at the malls, or wherever it happens to be, and get \narrested, they are going to head off to a public facility that is \nbetter than the school they left. Does that make sense? What does it \nsay about America?\n  So, today, we are going to test a new premise. If we cannot afford, \nas America, health care for children, which we voted yesterday, we will \nhave a chance today on Senator Carol Moseley-Braun's amendment to see \nwhether or not we can afford adequate schools for our children.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time--hopefully, within the \nappropriated time by the Chair?\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. How much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes and 30 seconds \nremaining.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I reserve my time until 5 minutes of 11.\n  Is the vote scheduled to start at 11 o'clock?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would observe that the Senator does \nnot have a right to specify the time in regard to 5 minutes and 30 \nseconds. The time will run equally between the two managers of the \nbill. But the Senator from Illinois does have 5 minutes and 30 seconds \nremaining on her time.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time will count equally between the \nmanagers of the bill.\n\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to know why the Senator wants to do this. \nThis is not the normal way. She has to get consent from the Senate. Her \ntime is running right now. As soon as I sit down, it is running. I \ndon't understand.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I yielded the floor. And my time is not running if \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wanted to ask, why does the Senator want to break up \nthe time? We don't break up time. People use their hour. I am asking. \nIt isn't normal.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. At the outset, I ask: Is this conversation on my \ntime or not?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let the Senator speak on my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is being utilized by the Senator from \nNew Mexico.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I say to the Senator from New Mexico that I would \njust as soon have a slot at the close of the debate. Is my \nunderstanding that the vote was scheduled at 11 o'clock? If we can use \nthe intervening time--you have not. No? I would like at the moment to \nconsult with the Senator from\n\n[[Page S4935]]\n\nNew Mexico, because it is my understanding the vote was scheduled for \n11.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am so sorry. We had a misunderstanding. There is no \ntime set. So we will vote as soon as the time of the Senator from \nIllinois has been used.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. That is wonderful. Then I would like to do that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If the Senator would let us to do something for about 2 \nminutes, then we will get back to her and the Senator can use her time, \nI will use mine, and then I will move to table.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. And then we will vote. Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 355\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, last night Senator Boxer introduced an \namendment. We agreed that we would accept that amendment without a \nrollcall vote.\n  I would like to ask unanimous consent that the Moseley-Braun \namendment be set aside temporarily while we move back to the Boxer \namendment, at which time Senator Durbin would like to speak for a \ncouple of minutes, and then we will accept it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question pending is Boxer amendment No. 355.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am happy to sponsor this amendment with \nSenator Boxer. I am happy that the chairman of the committee has agreed \nto accept the amendment and make it part of this budget resolution. I \nwould like to speak for a very brief period about this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor of \namendment No. 355, and that Senator Kennedy be added as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. This amendment, so it is understood by the membership, is \nvery straightforward. I can read it in two sentences and describe it as \nwell with these words.\n  ``A substantial majority of the tax cut benefits provided in the tax \nreconciliation bill''--which is a part of this agreement--``will go to \nmiddle-class working families earning less than approximately $100,000 \nper year, and the tax cuts in the tax reconciliation bill will not \ncause revenue losses to increase significantly in years after 2007.''\n  Senator Boxer and I are trying to establish as basic principles that \nthe tax cut package that will emerge from this budget agreement will do \none thing and avoid another. The thing that it will do is to gear more \nthan a majority--a substantial majority--of the benefits to middle-\nincome families. We think, if this ends up becoming a tax cut for \nwealthy people, that it is not in the best interests of sparking this \neconomy and helping working families cope with the expenses of life \nthat they face every day.\n\n  Second, we want to make certain in this resolution that we make it \nclear that any tax cut package will be measured not only to the year \n2002, when we hope the budget will be in balance, and 5 years beyond to \n2007. We have great fear and concern by reports that have come out \nrecently from the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities that some of \nthe tax cut provisions that are being debated will literally explode in \ncost in the outyears, causing great dislocation in terms of the Federal \nbudget and a great burden to Federal taxpayers.\n  Let us make sure these tax cuts are affordable and they are targeted \nto families that need them. Then, I think we can say to the American \npeople that we have not only balanced the budget, but we have given you \na tax cut that is responsible for the future of our economy.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield any time that I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the Boxer amendment \nis agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 355) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. COATS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 336\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we are going to return quickly to \nSenator Moseley-Braun for her wrap-up. I have a couple of minutes, then \nwe are going to ask Senator Warner--we are notifying him now--if he \nwould be ready for his highway bill. That would occur after the vote. \nObviously, if the motion to table is not agreed to, then Senator Warner \nwill have a little more of a wait. But, other than that, that is the \nsequence we have asked for.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question recurs on amendment 336.\n  The Senator from Illinois has 5 minutes remaining on her time and is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to respond at the \noutset to my friend, the Senator from New Mexico, who says this is the \nfirst time we have ever been involved in trying to repair our Nation's \nschools, that it is a new initiative, that we have never done this \nbefore. In fact, between 1933 and 1939, the Federal Government aided 70 \npercent of all new school construction. Mr. President, a lot of our \nchildren are attending those very same schools.\n  In fact, in America today, 74 percent of the schools are over 25 \nyears old and a third of the schools are over 50 years old. So there is \nno question that if you do not repair a 50-year-old building, it is \ngoing to begin to look like this. This is one of the reasons why we \nhave the troubled-school phenomenon.\n  The second issue that has been raised has to do with the \ncontributions of State and local governments. Again, I would point out \nthis is not looking to take over anything. We just want to have a \npartnership to help State and local governments meet the $112 billion \namount it is going to take to repair their crumbling schools.\n  The President did, in fact, support this in his State of the Union \nAddress. He said our children cannot raise themselves up in schools \nthat are literally falling down around them. Similarly, the Department \nof Education has a long letter talking about the leveraging and the \nfinancing assistance that we will give the States should this amendment \nbe approved.\n  But let me say to my colleague, in the final analysis, really, this \nmodest contribution is not about setting a precedent. It is about \nwhether or not we will allow for elementary and secondary education to \nget up to 1 percent of our total budget we are voting on here to help \nbegin to tackle 112 billion dollars' worth of rot in our schools. We \nare asking that it come out of the tax breaks that we are giving in \nthis budget, in some instances to the very wealthy.\n  I thought it was kind of ironic; in yesterday's New York Times there \nwas a headline talking about ``Tax Breaks Costly for Schools in \nCleveland.'' I want to point out that tax breaks are going to be costly \nfor schools all over America because we are giving tax breaks at a time \nwhen we are saying we do not have the wherewithal to provide a modest \namount to help States and help local communities meet the challenge of \nrepairing their crumbling schools.\n  I hope that on both sides of this Chamber, Republicans and Democrats \nalike will send a message that we are willing to help, we are willing \nto help States and local communities provide an environment that is \nsuitable for learning by our children. They are, after all, the \nchildren of all. They are America's children. Just as the generation \nbefore us stepped up to build new schools and provide environments for \nlearning for our time, I believe our generation has an obligation to \nstep up to the plate to assist in meeting this $112 billion challenge \nand help rebuild the crumbling schools which we ask our children to \nattend.\n  I have already made the point it is a national issue. It is in every \nkind of community--urban, suburban and rural. It is all over America. \nMr. President, $5 billion is just a contribution, a contribution to the \nStates and local governments so they can borrow the money they need to \nmeet what is a national challenge.\n  Senator Durbin actually hit the nail on the head when he made the \nanalogy to our roads. If we just built roads based on what a local \ncommunity could do, you could not get from one end of this great Nation \nto the other. But we cooperate and collaborate with each\n\n[[Page S4936]]\n\nother to build a highway system so that we can have transportation that \nserves our national interests.\n  Mr. President, crumbling schools are not in our national interest. \nCrumbling schools hurt our country. Crumbling schools hurt our \nchildren. If we are going to give our country the ability to be \ncompetitive in this global economy, if we are going to give our \nchildren the capacity to command information technologies that are so \nmuch a part of their time, we cannot expect them to learn in \nenvironments like this.\n  We can make this modest contribution, recognizing that it is an \nappropriate Federal role to provide this kind of support and help. I \nhope that when this vote happens, we do have bipartisan support; that \nthis does not become a matter of Republicans saying they are not \nwilling to provide this assistance to State and local governments to \nhelp provide children, our children, with an environment suitable for \ntheir education. I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwill see that this is something we can do within the context of this \nbudget; that we can do this without causing harm to anyone. We ought to \nbe able to close a few tax loopholes so we can provide modest support \nfor our children and for State and local government efforts to repair \nour crumbling schools.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair. I yield 4 minutes to Senator Nickles \nof Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, with great respect for my colleague from \nIllinois, I urge our colleagues to vote no on this amendment.\n  This amendment basically says, taxpayers, you pay $5 billion more in \ntaxes and now we are going to have a new Federal program designed to \nbuild new schools or to renovate schools.\n  Is that really a Federal responsibility? I do not think so. We \nalready have the Federal Government involved in education in many \nareas; as a matter of fact, a lot more than I was quite aware of. I \nasked my staff to find out, and they told me. I heard originally the \nHouse said there were 760 programs. We find out now there are 788 \nprograms. I asked my staff, how much does it cost? And they said about \n$100 billion, and I sent them an E-mail and said, ``That can't be \nright.''\n  It is right. I will insert it into the Record. It is $96.8 billion \nthat we spend on these 788 programs. We have a little program for \nconstruction. The total cost of it is $627 million, I might mention. I \nam going to guess that is for military schools and Indian schools, and \nso on. But this says, well, let us have a $5 billion education building \nprogram, a new program, one that would have to comply with Federal \nrules, like Davis-Bacon. In other words, if a school is going to be \nbuilt in South Dakota--they may have to build a new school in South \nDakota because of the floods--they would have to build according to \nFederal rules, and that includes Davis-Bacon. That means the Federal \nGovernment is going to determine what the wage rates are. In all \nlikelihood the wage rates might be 30 percent more than they are in \nSouth Dakota. So you get a lot less school built for the same amount of \nmoney.\n  My point is that this really is not a Federal responsibility, and $5 \nbillion cannot come close to scratching the surface of the need. I do \nnot doubt that you could have a lot of pictures of dilapidated school \nbuildings. Is that really the Federal Government's responsibility? I do \nnot think it is. Even if we had a surplus, I do not think that is a \nFederal Government responsibility.\n  How in the world could we in Washington, DC, decide which State, \nwhich school, which local area should have their schools fixed or \nrenovated? If we made this available, I could see just for the District \nof Columbia or just for any State--New Mexico, Oklahoma, Illinois, any \nState--a lot of schools. A lot of cities have real needs. Are we going \nto be the superintendent? Are we going to be deciding who should get \nthe renovation and who should not? We will not come close; $5 billion \nwould not scratch the surface. I am sure $5 billion could not take care \nof all the public school needs in the State of Illinois or in the State \nof New York.\n  So, my point being this is not a Federal responsibility. It is not a \nFederal obligation, and I think it would be a serious mistake for us to \nstart down this line of new spending which would have an ever-growing \ndemand that we would never be able to fill, so I urge my colleagues to \nvote no on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could I just make an announcement off the bill because \nI want to discuss something with the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. A short while ago, when the Senator wanted to reserve \nthe time until 11, I said there is no agreement to vote at 11, and \nthere is none. But I have understood now that the Republican leadership \nhad agreed with the Democratic leadership that because of a conflict on \nthe other side we would not vote until 11. So we have about 3 minutes \nof a hiatus here. I was speaking what I knew and the Senator was \nspeaking about something she had understood, and I apologize for \nwhatever discomfort I might have caused.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Senator from New Mexico. It is very \nnice of him to mention that, but I was prepared to take his word that \nhe knew what the agreement would be.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator. I will use time off the amendment \nwhich I understand is just a couple minutes. I want to quote--yes, \nSenator Nickles.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask unanimous consent a couple of charts be inserted \nin the Record accompanying my statement.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Reserving the right to object, charts having to do \nwith this issue?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am going to insert a couple documents in conjunction \nwith my statement.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I think that is inappropriate if we have not seen \nthem. I think it is appropriate for us to see them, and obviously, \nthen, there would not be an objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Chair asks that the Senators \naddress the Chair.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield further, I \nwould like to ask unanimous-consent three pieces of paper, a chart \nshowing the 788 Federal school programs, and the $98.1 billion that we \ncurrently spend on educational programs, be inserted in the Record \naccompanying my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. No objection.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 FEDERAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS BY CATEGORY

Did you get that resolved, Mr. President?\n  Mr. President, I just want to end this debate by saying that the \nPresident's thinking in 1996 was much better than his thinking in 1997, \nbecause in 1996 in submitting his budget, the President made the \nfollowing statement:\n\n       The construction and renovation of school facilities has \n     traditionally been the responsibility of State and local \n     governments financed primarily by local taxpayers. We are \n     opposed--\n\n  Continues the President in 1996--\n\n     to the creation of a new Federal grant program for school \n     construction.\n\n  Now, I understand the President has the right to change his mind in \n12 months, but I submit his thinking was much, much better in 1996.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I only have 30 seconds remaining.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Is it not a fact that that statement was \nassociated with the rescissions of the appropriation for a grant \nprogram, whereas this amendment relates to a leveraging approach to \ngive States and school districts assistance--different approaches to \nthe issue?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It is obvious that it is about a different program, but \nI am merely mentioning that the President was firm of mind in 1996 when \nhe quite appropriately said that this is not a responsibility of the \nFederal Government, and I just quoted the President. Now, he has a \nright to change his mind about another way to help build schools, but I \nsubmit that we also should share with the American people that that \nchange occurred over a 12-month period and, frankly, I believe we ought \nto agree with the President in 1996, not the President in 1997.\n  Now, having said that, has my time been used up?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority managers' time is 50 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Since we have until 11 to vote and time is finished on \nthis amendment, my colleague from New Mexico desires to speak, if \nSenator Lautenberg would concur, for the remainder of the time until 11 \no'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask that I be permitted to speak for \nup to 4 minutes, if that is possible, the time yielded off the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me first say that I am an original \ncosponsor of the amendment by the Senator from Illinois for funding for \nschool construction. There is a great need in this country for this. In \nmy view, one failure, one defect of the budget resolution before us is \nthat we give great emphasis to higher education and very little \nemphasize to elementary and secondary education. The needs are great in \nmy State for school construction funding, and I think this is a \nbeginning. I grant it is a modest beginning, but it is a step in the \nright direction. I commend the Senator from Illinois for offering this \namendment, and I intend to support it.\n  I rise as an original cosponsor of the Mosely-Braun amendment to \nrestore funding for school construction to the resolution.\n  The lack of school construction funding is one of the many ways that \nthis resolution reveals its strong emphasis on higher education rather \nthan improving elementary and secondary schools.\n  In fact, the lack of funding for the repair and construction of \nschools is perhaps the most obvious and compelling gap in this \nresolution.\n  I believe this is especially true since New Mexico is facing such a \nserious problem with its schools:\n  As of 1994, 94 percent of our schools needed to upgrade or repair \nonsite buildings, and 29 percent had crumbling roofs.\n  In 1996, 44 percent of districts in New Mexico had at least one \nbuilding in need of serious repair or replacement--much higher than the \n33-percent average nationwide.\n  Over 70 percent of high school students in my State attend schools of \n900 or more students, a size that is too large to be an effective \nlearning environment, some studies say.\n  There is a $475 million backlog in school construction and repair for \nBIA schools, of which there are 45 in New Mexico.\n  Meeting the demand to repair and build schools is difficult because \nNew Mexico is one of the fastest growing States in the Nation, and 47 \npercent of its student population attends school in rural areas.\n  Small and isolated communities such as these simply cannot generate \nsufficient funding to pay for repairing and building new schools \nrequired by skyrocketing enrollments.\n  Over the last 10 years, student enrollment in New Mexico has jumped \nby 57,000 students, 23.7 percent.\n  In just 3 years, enrollment will grow by another 20,000 students--the \nsame number of students as are in Las Cruces, the State's second \nlargest district.\n  Having visited and heard about schools that are crumbling, incapable \nof handling modern computers, and overcrowded, I know\n  Let me also say on the resolution more generally that clearly a \nbalanced budget is an important component of the fiscal health for the \nNation. It is very important that we pursue this. I do believe, \nhowever, that before we complete the process, before we complete a \nreconciliation bill and tax legislation, we need to look at the details \nas they will impact on the lives of average citizens in our country.\n  Obviously, in my State, we have a very high rate of poverty, a high \nrate of inadequate health care coverage, great needs in education, \ngreat problems with unemployment. I want to be sure that the \nimplementing legislation, particularly the tax provisions that we wind \nup adopting, is consistent with the needs of average citizens in my \nState.\n  I intend to support passage of the budget resolution. I do believe it \nis extremely important that we are closing in on a balanced budget. \nThat has been a goal that many have pursued, myself included, for a \nlong time here in the Congress, and we need that type of fiscal \nresponsibility. But I am concerned that when we get into implementing \nlegislation, if we are not careful, we could adopt some tax provisions \nwhich would institutionalize in the next century, in the first and \nsecond decades of the next century, a new and increasing disparity \nbetween what we raise and what we spend.\n  I pledge my best efforts to work with the leadership here in the \nCongress and in the Senate to see that that implementing legislation is \nacceptable and is fairly balanced. I hope that is the case, and I hope \nI am able to support the reconciliation bill as I intend to support \nthis budget resolution.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I thank the managers for the \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to table the pending amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs now on the motion to table \nthe amendment (No. 336) offered by the Senator from Illinois. The yeas \nand nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from Iowa \n[Mr. Harkin] would vote ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The result was announced, yeas 56, nays 43, as follows:\n\n[[Page S4938]]\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 79 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--56\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--43\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Conrad\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Specter\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Harkin\n       \n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 336) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Can we have order?\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have talked with Senator Lautenberg \nabout this. I ask unanimous consent that we permit Senator Coats of \nIndiana to proceed for 10 minutes to speak on the bill. He has a \nconflict this evening and would like to explain that to us, along with \nhis words about the effort. Then, if Senator Lautenberg has a Senator \nwho wants to speak on the bill rather than on an amendment, if they are \nhere before the end of that 10 minutes, that they be allowed up to 10 \nminutes, and then at the expiration of that, we proceed to the Warner \namendment immediately thereafter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, with reference to the Warner amendment, \nSenator Warner has agreed that the time that we use on his amendment \nwill be 1 hour equally divided. He will control the time on his side, \nand I will control the time in opposition.\n  Mr. WARNER. I wish to thank the distinguished chairman and the \ndistinguished ranking member. This is an amendment on behalf of the \ndistinguished Senator from Montana and myself. While the control will \nbe under the Senator from Virginia, it will be jointly shared with the \ndistinguished Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus]. We will control 30 \nminutes under our time jointly. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, thank you, and I thank the Senator from New \nMexico for his courtesy.\n  I regret that I probably will not likely be in the Chamber when the \nfinal vote comes on the resolution, though the schedule has been \nchanged so much, I do not think anybody is sure when that vote will \ncome. If I am not, it is because of a priority of mine, the only \npriority I think, that would exceed voting for something as important \nas the budget resolution.\n  My good wife, who has supported my efforts in Congress for 17 years \nnow, who has missed many events, and has done a lot of waiting for me \nto vote and to come home, is graduating this evening with a master's \ndegree from Johns Hopkins University. It is the result of 3 years of \nstrenuous effort. She is a star student. It is something that I very \nmuch want to attend.\n  I had thought and had been told that we would be finalizing the \nbudget agreement last evening. We were not able to do that, and it \nlooks like action on the resolution will go through the day.\n  This is a priority I want to keep, and I think that, as important as \nthe budget agreement is, I want to be there and honor this important \ndate, and celebrate her achievement. As I said, she has done a lot of \nwaiting around for me, made many sacrifices, and missed a lot of things \nbecause of our uncertain schedule here. There are times, however, when \nI think we have to establish priorities in life, and this is a \npriority.\n  [Applause.]\n  Mr. WARNER. Hear, hear.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I also want to use this opportunity to \nexplain why I would have, if I am to miss the vote, opposed the budget \nresolution. I have examined this very, very carefully. In fact, I have \ntried to come up with sufficient reasons to support the budget.\n  I know that the leader, Senator Lott, the leadership of our Congress, \nof the Senate, the work of Senator Domenici has been honest, it has \nbeen an honest effort at finding a true balanced budget. They have \ntoiled for hours. There have been compromises that have had to be made \nas a consequence of not controlling the executive branch and the \nturmoil that will result for the rest of the year if a budget agreement \nis not reached. This budget clearly makes some important steps in the \nright direction, and there is much to commend about the efforts of \nthose who have put this together.\n\n  However, I have been here since 1981, and there have been a lot of \npromises about balancing the budget. When I first ran for Congress, one \nof my top three priorities was to balance the budget. I felt that it \nwas unconscionable, immoral to pass on to future generations a debt \nburden so that this present generation could enjoy benefits without \nhaving to pay for them. I have toiled now for 17 years to attempt to \nachieve a balanced budget in the Congress and have not been able to do \nso.\n  My greatest disappointment is, probably, our failure on two occasions \nby one vote to pass a constitutional amendment in this body and send it \nto the people of the United States to let them determine whether or not \nthey think we should be held constitutionally responsible for balancing \nthe budget. We were not able to do that.\n  This budget, like all the previous six budgets, promises a balanced \nbudget in 5 years. I have gone home after the passage of these budgets, \nspoken to my constituents and said, ``We balanced the budget.''\n  And they said, ``We're skeptical of that.''\n  ``No, no, no, we have put in place a mechanism to balance the \nbudget.''\n  Well, six times we promised that, and six times we failed. This is \nthe seventh. Our Policy Committee, which I support, tries to put the \nbest light on this budget. I have here a report published by the \ncommittee, it says, ``Balanced Honestly by 2002, First Time Balance \nWill Be Achieved Since 1969.'' I have seen that phrase written over and \nover again. I have uttered it myself. It has not come true. It will not \ncome true this time.\n  People need to understand that 5-year, 7-year agreements really only \ncommit us to the first year, and even with that, with supplementals, \nfailure to enact rescissions, contingencies that come up--in fact, we \nhave already seen a proliferation of attempts to change this budget, to \nadd money to this budget, to change the spending priorities--Congress \nhas the right to waive this agreement any time it chooses.\n  We actually increase the deficit in this budget in the next 2 years \nfrom the current level estimated at $67 to $90 billion in fiscal year \n1998 and 1999, and like all of our budget gimmicks in the past, all of \nthe deficit reduction comes in the outyears, in 2001 and 2002.\n  All of the tough decisions come after the next midyear election, \nafter the next Presidential election. I have announced my resignation, \nso I will not be here. I will not be here to protest that ``Here we are \nagain. Remember back in 1997 when we promised a balanced budget?''\n  Here we are at 2001 putting together the next promised balanced \nbudget which pushes us out now to 2006 or 2007.\n  All the rosy scenarios about the assumptions of no economic decline \nin the next 6 years, I hope and pray it happens. I doubt very much that \nit will.\n\n[[Page S4939]]\n\n  The other thing that distresses me is that in this budget we had the \nopportunity for meaningful entitlement reform and we once again took a \npass on it. It seemed to me that everything was lined up in order for \nus to do this.\n  We had a Republican Congress that had gone on record as supporting \nmeaningful structural changes in entitlements, changes that we know we \nare going to have to face for if we don't, we are going to find \nourselves in severe economic distress in the future. We had a President \nwho had just been re-elected and was not going to run again. He did not \nhave to worry about getting reelected or pleasing certain \nconstituencies. And we thought he would step forward and provide real \nleadership on this. And he took a pass.\n  Congress took a pass because somehow we materialized some additional \nrevenue because of the economy, not because of anything we have done to \nhold down spending, but because of the good economy that we have in \nthis country. And revenues were flowing in. And at the last minute we \ncame up with $250 billion and said we can take a pass again.\n  So when we say we have averted the crisis of Medicare's imminent \nbankruptcy until 2007, yeah, we have done that. We have done that with \na gimmick of shifting home health care from part A to part B and \napplying more revenues to cover the deficit that is coming instead of \nimplementing reform and giving the windfall in revenues back to the \nAmerican people to whom it belongs.\n  We have had to narrow our tax cut because we have not exercised the \ndiscipline on spending. I can go on and on. But I am going to \nabbreviate my remarks here so we can keep moving on this.\n  It is worth pointing out that, rather than taking the $255 billion in \nunanticipated revenues and using it for deficit reduction or tax \nreduction, we have used it to increase spending. Rather than capitalize \non the momentum that we had for meaningful entitlement reform, we used \nbudget gimmicks and price controls to delay the crisis and postpone the \ntough decisions once again. Rather than reduce the size of the \nGovernment, baseline budget tactics are used, tactics which Republicans \nused to criticize--assuming automatic increases in the baseline and \nthen making reductions in that baseline and calling it a cut when it is \nnot a cut, it is an increase. This deceptive practice is continued in \nthis resolution, and now Republicans have bought into that practice.\n  In the end, this resolution simply postpones deficit reduction into \nthe next millennium and lets everybody off the hook on tough decisions \nthat ought to be made now.\n  As stated in an article in the May 10 issue of the National Journal \ncalled ``The Easy Way Out'':\n\n       Historic the deal may be, but not so much because of what \n     it includes as because of what fell out: just about anything \n     unpleasant for incumbents of either party. From a political \n     point of view, it may indeed be a triumph; certainly, at a \n     minimum, it is clever. From a reformer's point of view, \n     however, it is a washout.\n\n  We need reformer practices. We have said that; many have, since I \nhave been here. I am now in my 17th year. We have not used reformer \npractices. Once again, we have used tricks and unexpected revenues to \npostpone the tough decisions.\n  I have said from the beginning, and will continue to say it, we will \nnot make the tough decisions until we are constitutionally forced to do \nso. We will not achieve meaningful reform in our budget until we are \nconstitutionally required, by raising our hand and pledging to support \nthat Constitution, that we will honestly balance the budget and not \ncreate deficits and not pass on debt to future generations.\n  I am ashamed of the fact that during my watch, while I was here, the \nnational debt has grown from less than $1 trillion to approaching $6 \ntrillion. That is a national disgrace. And it has happened on my watch. \nI tried everything I could to keep that from happening. I think my \nvoting record indicates that. Nevertheless, it happened on my watch.\n  So for me, someone who will not be here to protest in future years, I \ncannot in good conscience support this budget. Is it an improvement? \nYes. Is it probably everything that the Budget chairman could have \nachieved under the circumstances? With divided Government and an \nadministration bent on spending more and making a mockery of their \nstatement that the era of big Government is over, I think the Budget \nchairman did everything he could under the circumstances. I commend him \nfor his work and commend the leadership for their work.\n  But let us not pretend. Let us not pretend. And let us not pass on to \nthe American people that we are giving them an honest balanced budget \nby the year 2002. I do not believe that is going to happen any more \nthan the previous six promises on balanced budgets in the last 15 years \nhave proven to be true to the American people.\n  I regret that I have to vote against this, but I, in all honesty, \ncannot support this budget resolution.\n  The most glaring problem with this budget resolution is that the \ndeficit actually increases dramatically next year, from an estimated \n$67 billion for fiscal year 1997 to over $90 billion in fiscal year \n1998, and does not begin to come down until 2001. The deficit then \ndrops precipitously by nearly $84 billion between 2001 and the end of \n2002.\n  This rosy scenario is hard to believe. In fact, the only years that \nreally count in this budget agreement are the next 2, when Members and \nthe President can be held accountable to abide by their commitment. The \nheavy work of deficit reduction is postponed, and becomes someone \nelse's problem. Even then, 97 percent of deficit reduction included in \nthis package is based upon economic assumptions that seem implausible \nat best. They are based on sustaining the current state of the economy \nfor another 6 years.\n  This resolution fails to address the looming crisis in entitlements. \nRather, it delays dealing with the issue through budget gimmickry.\n  The resolution purports to secure $115 billion in Medicare savings. \nHowever, the overwhelming majority of this savings is secured through \nprice control gimmicks that have failed in the past. Even then, the \npreponderant majority of this savings comes after the year 2000, when \nthere is no guarantee of enforcement.\n  The plan calls for further reducing payments to health care \nproviders. We have tried this many times before with no success. In \nfact, costs have continued to rise while the quality of health care for \nour seniors has continued to be diminished.\n  In addition, the current proposal shifts the Home Health Care \nProgram, the fastest growing Medicare program, from the Medicare part A \nfund, to part B. This trick postpones the collapse of the Medicare \ntrust fund from 2001 to around 2008, and serves to delay having to \nconfront the long-term Medicare crisis.\n  Failure to implement meaningful reform in Medicare represents the \ngreatest single missed opportunity in a budget proposal rife with \ndeferment and missed opportunity. In fact, the resolution creates a $16 \nbillion health care entitlement for low-income children. It is \nimportant to note that this entitlement goes beyond covering poor \nchildren already covered under Medicaid.\n  The key to busting the logjam in negotiations on this budget \nagreement was a midnight-hour $255 billion windfall from the \nCongressional Budget Office. This money came from larger than \nanticipated revenues from a robust economy. However, rather than using \nthis money to both reduce the deficit and reduce the tax burden on the \nAmerican people, negotiators went on a spending binge.\n  The result of this is that the budget resolution actually increases, \nnot decreases the size of the Government. For fiscal year 1998, \nspending is increased over fiscal year 1997 projected spending levels \nby an estimated 4.32 percent, or $70 billion above the freeze. This is \nthe largest increase of the Clinton Presidency, $5 billion more than \nthe President requested in his original budget proposal, and outpaces \ninflation by nearly 1.5 percent.\n  This dramatic increase in domestic spending is based upon the concept \nthat spending on these programs has been limited in recent years. In \nfact, according to economist Stephen Moore, over the past 10 years, \n1988-97, Federal domestic spending has soared from $622 billion to \n$1.116 trillion. After adjustments for inflation, this is an increase\n\n[[Page S4940]]\n\nof 40 percent. And now, under this agreement, we will be increasing \nthis spending by a rate of 1.5 percent above inflation.\n  There are no spending reductions in the budget. The savings are \nactually reductions in projected baseline spending. This type of \nbaseline gimmickry is something that conservatives have long rejected. \nHowever now, for political expediency, this plan is based entirely upon \nit.\n  James Glassman writes in his column entitled ``Bad for Everyone'': \n``The reason that the Federal deficit is projected at zero under the \nnew budget is not that Government will be smaller, but that revenues \nfrom taxpayers will be larger--much larger.'' Mr. Glassman goes on to \npoint out: ``According to the President's February budget, the Treasury \nwas expected to collect $1.5 trillion from citizens and businesses in \n1997. According to the new bipartisan budget, that figure will rise to \n$1.9 trillion in 2002. Meanwhile, spending will rise from $1.6 trillion \nto $1.9 trillion. And there you have it: A balanced budget.''\n  Is this what reform is all about? Rather than use windfall tax \nrevenues as an opportunity to decrease spending and accelerate the path \nto a balanced budget, this resolution gobbles up taxpayer money with \nsubstantial spending increases and postpones the tough decisions for \nanother day.\n  If there is anything hopeful in this budget resolution, it is some \nprogress toward tax reduction. There is roughly $135 billion set aside \nfor tax cuts. However, $50 billion of that number is offset by tax \nincreases elsewhere in the budget, leaving a beginning net tax cut of \n$85 billion. This represents just 1 percent of the $8.5 trillion in \nestimated tax revenues over the next 5 years.\n  Even then, the President's tax priorities for education, totaling $35 \nbillion, is locked in, leaving Congress to spread the remaining benefit \nbetween a $500 child tax credit, capital gains reduction, expanded \nIRAs, and estate tax relief. The $85 billion net tax cut comprises \nabout one-third of the money needed to offset all of these tax cuts \nfully. In fact, the Heritage Foundation estimates that the full cost of \nthe $500 dollar-per-child tax credit alone is $105 billion over 5 \nyears.\n  However, the game doesn't stop there. A key aspect of the agreement \nis the assumption that the Bureau of Labor Statistics will adjust the \nCPI downward by approximately .3 percent. The result would be a hike in \nincome taxes by approximately $6 billion dollars. Thus, the real total \nnet tax cut under the agreement is $79 billion or less. Again, \naccording to Heritage Foundation estimates, Americans will receive a \ngrand total of 67 cents in tax relief for every new dollar of spending \non Government programs contained in the agreement, or less than one \ncent on every tax dollar sent to the Federal Government.\n  In fact, the entire net tax cut contained in the Resolution is less \nthan one-fifth of this $255 billion dollar windfall discovered by CBO, \nand used to blow the ceiling on spending. The result is that much \nneeded tax relief will have to be phased in, with the bulk of it \nfalling, once again, in the out years. The child tax credit, touted as \nmiddle class tax relief, will likely have to be limited to low income \nfamilies.\n  Already, discussions regarding a capital gains tax cut have gone from \nan early 50 percent reduction proposal, to a cut of 10 percent, and is \nnow moving toward a limited maximum rate of 21 percent. This is hardly \nthe type of capital gains tax cut needed to free the hundreds of \nbillions of dollars in encumbered capital in our economy.\n  I do not believe that this is what the American people have in mind. \nAnd I have no confidence that future Congresses, faced with the \nskyrocketing spending and rosy economic assumptions contained in this \nagreement, will follow through on fully implementing tax relief.\n  This budget is full of missed opportunities. Rather than taking the \n$255 billion in unanticipated revenues and using it for direct deficit \nand tax reductions, it has been used to increase spending. Rather than \ncapitalize on momentum for meaningful entitlement reform, budget \ngimmicks and price controls are used to delay the crisis and postpone \nthe tough decisions. Rather than reduce the size of Government, \nbaseline budget tactics are used to simulate smaller Government.\n  In the end, this resolution simply postpones any deficit reduction \ninto the next millennium and lets everyone off the hook on the tough \ndecisions. As stated in the May 10 National Journal article entitled, \n``The Easy Way Out'':\n\n       Historic the deal may be, but not so much because of what \n     it includes as because of what fell out: just about anything \n     unpleasant for incumbents of either party. From a political \n     point of view, it may indeed be a triumph; certainly, at a \n     minimum, it is clever. From a reformer's point of view, \n     however, it is a washout.\n\n  I thank the chairman of the Budget Committee for allowing me this \nopportunity to speak. I regret that I might not be here this evening. \nBut I think I identified the right priority in my life. And I am \nlooking forward to being, for once, not the person in the limelight in \nour family but the person applauding the one that is in the limelight, \nwhich is my wife who will be receiving the degree which she worked so \nhard for.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. KERREY. Pursuant to the previous unanimous-consent request, I ask \nunanimous consent that 10 minutes be taken off the resolution so I can \nspeak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, before I talk about the resolution itself, \nwhat it does, what it does not do, I do want to go back to 1993, as \nmany of my colleagues have done, and discuss the Deficit-Reduction Act \nof 1993.\n  Since I only have 10 minutes, I will not go into detail about the one \nthat happened in 1990 under President Bush's watch. Both of those were \nvery unpopular budget resolutions. I noticed when I went home, in both \ncases, there was substantial criticism from people who did not like \nvarious aspects of it.\n  One of the unique things about this particular budget resolution \ncompared to those is that I do not expect to find a similar sort of \noutcry against it. I think it tells us a lot about what is in this one \nas well as the progress that we have made toward reduction over the \nlast 4 years.\n  That resolution, Mr. President, that act, OBRA, 1993, brought the \ndeficit down by 77 percent, a substantial reduction in the deficit. It \noccurred, it must be said, as a consequence of the economic recovery \nthat had begun in 1992. It did not produce all of the growth by any \nmeasure. I do not argue that the economy turned around as a result of \nthat Deficit-Reduction Act, but there is no question that we had \ndemonstrated in 1993 that there was a connection between growth and \ndeficit reduction, that it is possible for us to take action with our \nbudget to produce good things out in the private sector.\n  I would argue that the greatest victor in this Deficit-Reduction Act \nof 1997, the Deficit Elimination Act of 1997, the greatest victor is \neconomic growth. Four percent real growth in the first quarter is what \nhas really enabled us relatively easily to take the last step.\n  There were a lot of terrible things that were said were going to \nhappen as a result of the 1993 OBRA. People said it would result in \nlost jobs. We stood here on the floor and said, if we voted for OBRA \n1993 there were going to be higher deficits and there was going to be \nhigher national debt, so on and so on. About the only dire prediction \nthat turned out to be true was that people who voted for it were not \nreelected because, as I said, it was very unpopular. It was very \ndifficult deficit reduction, very substantial deficit reduction.\n  We have evidence, in short, that if we are willing to cast a tough \nvote, if we are willing to reduce spending and reduce our deficit, that \nnot only is there economic gain coming as a consequence, but that that \npolitical risk can pay off long term. We can stand and say that though \nwe have asked people to take a bit less, there will be benefits coming \nas a consequence of this reduction in the rate of growth of spending \nthat is contained in this budget resolution.\n  So I stand here today to say, where do we go from here? And I have to \nconfess, there is a part of me, Mr. President, that says, ``Well, now \nthat we've gone from a Democratic majority to Republican majority,'' in \npart, if not in large part, as a result of the unpopularity of the 1993 \nDeficit-Reduction Act, ``maybe we ought to hold our\n\n[[Page S4941]]\n\nbreath on this side and let you all figure it out on the other side, \nlet the distinguished occupant of the chair and the other guys on that \nside of the aisle, let you all address it and cast the tough votes this \ntime around.'' I do not think that would be responsible of us, Mr. \nPresident.\n\n  There is a lot I do not like in the budget resolution. There is a lot \nI did not like in 1993 and in 1990. But given the benefits that occur \nas a consequence, I do not think that it is good for the country for me \nto stand here in a petulant fashion and say I am not going to \nparticipate as a consequence of what happened politically in November \n1994.\n  I do believe that the budget resolution in front of us today will, on \nbalance, produce economic growth, and I do believe that it will balance \nthe budget in the year 2002, if Congress keeps its eye on the ball and \nkeeps its attention focused on what is going on outside of these Halls, \nand that is to say what is going on in the private sector, and what is \ngoing on with our economy.\n  If our tax, our regulatory, and spending policies produce economic \ngrowth, all the rest of it gets relatively easy, as we are learning \nindeed with OBRA 1997.\n  We need to start thinking about economic growth. We need to start \nasking ourselves the question, what do we do, not only to produce the \ngrowth, but when is the growth good for us and when are we willing to \nstep in and say the growth is not good?\n  I mean, all of us, I suspect, universally would say, I do not care if \nit does produce jobs, I am not in favor of pornography, and I am not in \nfavor of spoiling our environment, and I am not in favor of making our \nstreets unsafe. There are lots of examples where we would step in and \nput a law in place even though it might prevent somebody freely from \nbeing able to produce jobs. We will say that those particular jobs are \nnot good for us and thus we are going to put a law in place to prevent \nthat activity from happening.\n  There is a larger problem as well, Mr. President. I do think, though, \ngrowth lifts all boats, that a rising tide will tend to lift all boats. \nAs we have seen with the dramatic narrowing of economic inequality and \nincome inequality that has occurred in the last 4 years, that there is \nstill going to be large sectors of our economy, large sectors of our \npopulation, individuals and their families that are going to be left \nout of the benefit of that growth.\n  That is especially true if you take the position, as I do, that we \nought to put in place laws that say the United States of America is \ngoing to lead the effort to lower trade barriers, that we believe that \ngenerally speaking we are better off competing in a global economy. In \nthat global economy with technology, with immigration, with the \nwelfare-to-work programs that are going on, people at the lower end of \nthe wage scale are going to suffer. They are going to be under a lot of \npressure.\n  People making $5.15 an hour, $6, $7, $8, $9, $10 an hour are going to \nbe under a great deal of pressure. They are going to be working more \nthan one job. They are going to be paying child care. They are going to \nhave lots of other problems they are going to face.\n  It is important for us to pay attention to our capacity to give them \nthe opportunity to get a good education, get retrained, go to college, \nif they choose to. We have to look at those sorts of things, and keep \nour eyes open to special problems that exist today that did not exist \n30 years ago.\n  Perhaps the most dramatic difference is that in the 1990's the amount \nof debt accumulated to go to college exceeds all the debt that was \naccumulated in the 1980's, 1970's, 1960's combined. By the end of the \ncentury $50 billion of new debt will be acquired by American youth who \nare trying to go to college; graduating today with an average of \n$10,000 debt, growing by some 14 percent a year.\n  The President's response to try to direct some additional resources \nfor education, I believe, is good. I also think it is important for us \nto try to come up with mechanisms and enable Americans, using the laws \nof the land, to acquire the wealth that they need to make those kinds \nof purchases not just for education, but for retirement as well.\n\n  This balanced budget will produce, in short, economic growth. But I \ndo not believe that this balanced budget will take us in every single \ninstance in directions that we need to go.\n  I think that we are still going to have problems with our schools. I \nthink we still have problems with fighting the war on drugs. I think we \nstill have problems in a number of other areas where our current \npolicies are inadequate to the task. They are going to require us to \nreach down and look for different ways of doing things if we want to \nchange our future.\n  The three areas that I would like to address here this morning, Mr. \nPresident, where this law does not change our future adequately is the \npercentage of our budget that is going for entitlements versus \ndiscretionary, the amount of wealth that individuals have in order to \nbe able to plan for their retirement, and, Mr. President, I also \nbelieve we need to look at the mix of people over the age of 65 versus \nunder the age of 20. I still do not believe we adequately adjusted to \nthe problem that we are going to face when that baby-boom generation \nbegins to retire.\n  I would like, Mr. President, just to run through a couple of charts \nhere very quickly. You all probably have seen them before. It is what \neverybody wants to do--look at another chart here on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  This is a line that shows the births in the United States from 1910 \nthrough 1920. I bring this to the floor because it is a demographic \nproblem that we face, not a problem that was caused by Ronald Reagan or \nGeorge McGovern or Phyllis Schlafly, or secular humanists. This is a \nproblem that was created as a consequence of 77 million Americans who \nwere born between the years of 1945 and 1965. And then the birthrate \ndropped for about 15 years afterward.\n  Thus, what that has produced is a relatively small number of people \nwho will be supporting a much larger number of people who will be \nretired out there in the future.\n  This is a dramatic change, Mr. President, that Congress needs to \nfactor into our thinking because this is our future. This is where we \nare going. As I said, I am confident 5 years from now, 1997, we will \nhave a balanced budget, but we have not addressed this problem. This is \nthe future for America:\n  In 1997, 29 percent of our population is under the age of 20; 13 \npercent is over the age of 65; 79 million in one group, 34 million in \nthe other group. In 2030--all the speeches we give about children, 4 \nmillion babies born in America this year, those babies will be 33 years \nof age in 2030, and all of us understand how quickly 33 years go by. In \n2030, when those babies are now out there working, there will be 24 \npercent of our population, down from 29 percent, under the age of 20. \nThe under-20 population will only have grown by 4 million. But the \nover-65 population, Mr. President, will have doubled, going from 34 \nmillion to 68 million. If you look at the number of workers per \nretirees, it is even more dramatic, a doubling of the population over \nthe age of 65 and a 20 percent increase in the size of the American \nwork force.\n  Mr. President, we have simply got to address this problem. The only \nway for us to do it, in my judgment, is to look at the mix of our \nbudget that is going to mandatory versus discretionary. In 1963, 30 \npercent of our budget went to mandatory spending, 70 percent went to \ndiscretionary spending. At the end of this budget resolution it will be \nexactly reversed, 70 percent mandatory, 30 percent discretionary. Mr. \nPresident, in about 10 or 12 years after that it will be 100 percent \nmandatory and 30 percent discretionary.\n  A much bigger and more difficult problem for us to face as a Congress \nthan balancing the budget is balancing the mix of mandatory and \ndiscretionary spending. It is not a mathematical formula, Mr. \nPresident. If we do not take action on this, people who will retire 15, \n20 years from now--and again, this is a problem for the baby-boom \ngeneration; this is not a problem for the current generation. There are \nenough workers in the workplace today to support current retirees. But \nthose people who will be retiring out in the future, Mr. President, \nthey are not going to like that future as a consequence of the kinds of \nchoices that will be forced upon them later, unless we take action \nearlier to accommodate.\n  Mr. President, I would like to see this budget resolution changed. I \nam hopeful we can build some bipartisan\n\n[[Page S4942]]\n\nconsensus to change it. Senator Lieberman and I, Senator Breaux, and a \nnumber of others have been working on a proposal called Kids Save that \nwould alter the child care credit in this resolution that would enable \nus to help working families acquire wealth. Unless you expect to hit \nthe lottery, unless you expect to inherit the wealth, the only and the \nbest and most reliable way to generate wealth is to save a little bit \nof money over a long period of time. Kids Save enables us to do that. \nIt enables working families to have that wealth. If they want to use it \nfor education, if they want to use it, preferably, for retirement, they \nwill have it when they get there.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, Senator Warner of \nVirginia is recognized at this time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 311\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I call up an amendment at the desk by the \nSenator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for himself and Mr. \n     Baucus, proposes an amendment numbered 311.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is located in the Record of May 21, 1997.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we ask now for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator from Virginia, throughout my \ncareer in the U.S. Senate, has fought for the balanced budget as hard \nas anyone. I say that with humility. I am sure the distinguished \nSenator from Montana has a like record and a like commitment.\n  We are also entrusted with the responsibility, in my case as chairman \nand the Senator from Montana as the ranking member of the Subcommittee \non Public Works and Environment, to see that our Nation's \ninfrastructure of highways, and to a certain extent mass transit--\nalthough that is primarily in another committee--constantly is \nadministered in such a way as to promote growth in this country.\n  Talk about a balanced budget. That balanced budget is dependent on \nthe ability of Americans to get to their place of work, to return \nsafely, to provide for their families, and every Member of this body \nknows that we are falling behind every minute in our ability to keep in \nplace the infrastructure of roads and bridges, much less modernize it \nto make it safer and more efficient. We are steadily falling behind. \nBut as we fall behind in providing the necessary dollars, the dollars \nthat they are paying in the tank are accumulating in the Treasury in an \naccount called the highway trust fund.\n  Now, Mr. President, I like to do homework. I learned it as a child \nunder the supervision of two good, strong parents. So I went back to \n1955 when in this very Chamber resonated the voices of the chairman of \nthe Environment Committee, Mr. Chavez, and incidentally, the chairman \nof the subcommittee, Albert Gore, Sr., the father of our distinguished \nVice President. When they came forth with the legislation to establish \nthe highway trust fund, they picked the name ``trust.'' They could have \ncalled it the highway fund. They could have said there is a line in the \nTreasury for just where to put the tax dollars, but they called it a \ntrust fund.\n  Today the Congress, together with the executive branch, are using it \nas an escrow account--not a trust fund, but an escrow account--to hold \nthese dollars almost as if they were poker chips to play with them as \nwe see fit, not in keeping with the intention of the founders of this \npiece of legislation.\n  I read from the 1955 Congressional Record, page 6716, of May 20--is \nthat not interesting, May 20, coincidental in time, Mr. President, 42 \nyears ago--in which Senator Gore concluded by saying, ``Had the \ncommittee thought it advisable to recommend a more vigorous program \nthan that which is contained in S. 1048, I am sure it would have done \nso. The sentiment in the committee, if I interpret it correctly, was to \nact as fast and as energetically as we could while still ensuring that \nthe taxpayer received a dollar's worth of road for his [and I insert \nher] tax dollars.'' There it is, a commitment by the U.S. Senate, right \nin this Chamber, the origin of that legislation, and we are breaking \nthat trust, that fiduciary relationship today.\n  Mr. President, 18.3 cents is paid by every American and all those \nusing petroleum at the local gas station; 4.3 is taken out for the \ndeficit. That is another argument. We are not dealing with that today. \nFourteen cents remains, of which 12 cents is for the highway and 2 \ncents for mass transit.\n  We have another piece of legislation under the auspices of Senator \nBond and Senator Chafee, which I support, saying a dollar in, a dollar \nout. That is what this does. This amendment is designed to put every \nMember of this body on record when he or she goes back home that, ``I \nfought to see that your tax dollars that you pay are returned to you \nand you can apply them to improve that infrastructure to strengthen \nAmerica's economy.''\n  Critics say, well, Senator Warner and Senator Baucus, you did not \nprovide offsets. Well, we did not have to provide offsets, I say to my \ncolleagues, because the offset is there in the word ``trust.'' That is \nwhat it means--trust means exactly that. The people of this country \ntrust the Congress of the United States, and in this instance, more \nspecifically, the Senate, trust them to find the necessary means to \nbalance the budget without a breach of trust to those who contribute at \nthe gas tank, consistent for 42 years, given by the U.S. Senate.\n\n  I say to my colleagues, weigh heavily when you cast this vote. Put \nthis amendment on. Let it go to conference. Let the distinguished \nchairman and the distinguished ranking member in the context of a \nconference decide how to continue the preservation of the balanced \nbudget but at the same time keeping trust with the American people to \nreturn their dollars, their hard-earned dollars, submitted at the gas \ntank.\n  I yield such time as my distinguished colleague desires with the \ncaveat that I would like to reserve for the Senator from Virginia 2 \nminutes at the end and 2 minutes for the distinguished Senator from \nMontana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to first commend the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, the ranking member, the President, and \nnegotiators for putting together a bipartisan agreement. I know it was \nnot easy. It was difficult. But I think the American people are very \ngratified that the President and the Congress put together the outlines \nof a budget agreement which brings the budget deficit down to zero.\n  One of the provisions in that agreement is the amount we will spend \non highways and transit for the next 5 years. Under the budget \nagreement, the highway and transit programs will receive funding levels \nequal to the estimated revenue collected each year.\n  But Mr. President, I would suggest we need to do better.\n  That is why the Senator from Virginia and myself are offering this \nvery simple amendment. Under the amendment, whatever comes into the \ntrust fund through gasoline taxes and diesel fuels, et cetera, plus \ninterest on what is earned on the balances in the trust fund, is \navailable to be spent. In otherwords, whatever revenue comes in, will \ngo out. This is truth in budgeting. It is a very modest amendment.\n  Mr. President, current balances in the highway account of the highway \ntrust fund is $14.3 billion. If you look at this chart, you will see \nthat the balances in the highway account will almost double by the end \nof the 5 years covered by the budget resolution. Under the resolution, \nthe balance in the highway trust fund will grow to almost $27 billion. \nIt just seems to me, Mr. President, and to all of us who are concerned \nabout the balances in the highway trust fund, that it is wrong for that \nbalance to continue to grow or double when those are dollars being \ncontributed by motorists who expect to see transportation benefits.\n  I might add, Mr. President, that motorists are already paying 4.3 \ncents a gallon which goes to deficit reduction. Over the 5 years of the \nbudget resolution will amount to about $35 billion.\n  If our amendment does not pass, there are serious consequences. If \nour amendment does not pass, I must tell\n\n[[Page S4943]]\n\nSenators that they are not going to receive funding levels close to the \nhighway funds or the mass transit funds that their States expect. That \nis what is shown in this chart. I apologize for the small print on this \nchart, but we have after all 50 States and it is difficult to get every \nState on the single chart.\n  This chart shows what will happen to a State's anticipated funding \nunder the various highway bills that have been introduced, such as \nSTARS 2000, STEP 21, NEXTEA and ISTEA Works. Senators have signed onto \nthose bills anticipating certain funding levels. If the Warner-Baucus \namendment does not pass, each State will receive a reduction in \nfunding.\n  I look at the Presiding Officer. New Hampshire--as an example, New \nHampshire signed up for the ISTEA reauthorization bill. If New \nHampshire thinks it is going to get $142 million a year, that is wrong. \nIf my amendment does not pass, New Hampshire is going to receive $30 \nmillion less. If my amendment passes, New Hampshire will get the $142 \nmillion.\n  That same example holds for every single State.\n  So it is very clear that Senators are not going to get the money they \nthink they are going to get if this amendment does not pass.\n  I want to also add that there are other reasons to increase \ntransportation spending.\n  Our Department of Transportation says that we need about $50 billion \ndollars annually to maintain our highway system. The $26 billion \nprovided for under this amendment is a little more than half of that. \nThat is all.\n  Think of the competition in the world. The Japanese spend four times \nwhat we do as a percentage of GDP than the United States. The European \nUnion, spends twice as much.\n  We are hurting ourselves in not keeping our transportation system up \nto snuff.\n  In addition, if the budget resolution becomes the law, areas that are \nexperiencing growth or areas with an aging infrastructure will not get \nthe money they need. And programs that mean a lot to Members, such as \nthe Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality program, or enhancements and \nbike trails, will not have the money they need.\n  Our proposal is very simple: That we pass this amendment, which will \nincrease the deficit in the last year from a $1 billion surplus to \nabout a $2 billion deficit. That is all. Over all 5 years, $12 billion. \nIt does not go to the core of the agreement. It does not touch Medicare \nor Medicaid and does not touch taxes. It does not touch any of the \nprovisions that Senators have been arguing about over the past few \nmonths as to what should or should not be in the bipartisan agreement. \nIt doesn't touch those at all. It just says let's spend the interest, \nplus what comes into the trust fund as revenue each year. That way we \ncan prevent further deterioration of our highways and bridges.\n  If this amendment should pass,--the Senator from Virginia and I will \nwork with the managers of the Budget Committee and with the \nadministration to try to find some way to accommodate this $12 billion \nincrease in conference.\n  I want a balanced budget. I think every Senator wants a balanced \nbudget. Fifty-seven Senators have written the Budget Committee asking \nfor more money in transportation. In fact, what they asked for was a \nfull $26 billion every year for 5 years. We are only asking for a ramp \nup to the $26 billion level over the 5 years. This is very modest and \nnowhere close to the request made by 57 Senators who have asked for a \nfull $26 billion to be included in transportation for every year.\n  This is a very small change in the agreement which the budget and \nadministration negotiators put together. It can very easily be \naccommodated in conference.\n  I might add, to those Senators from the Northeast who are concerned \nabout mass transit, this amendment also--the $12 billion increase in \noutlays I mentioned--includes increases in mass transit.\n  So, Mr. President, it is really very simple. I grant that it is \ntechnically an increase in the deficit by $12 billion. I am also saying \nthat we as Senators should not be caught in a box. We should not be \nrigid. We should not be knee-jerked. We are elected to be thoughtful. \nWe are elected to do what is right. We are elected to be creative.\n  What do the American people think is right? First, balance the \nbudget; second, do it in a way which is fair to our country and our \ncountry's needs.\n  It is clear that we can balance the budget, including the framework \nagreed to by the budget negotiators, the administration, and the \nleadership, and still meet our States' infrastructure needs.\n  It is a very modest amendment. Again, it just says spend what comes \nin, plus interest, to the trust fund. In fact, even under our amendment \nwe end up with a $17 billion balance in the trust fund. So under our \namendment, we are not spending anywhere near the amounts the trust fund \ncould sustain. But the Senator from Virginia and I are trying to be \nmodest.\n  So, I again urge Senators, just go the extra mile. Vote for this. We \nwill all work together to balance the budget in a way which also does \nnot hurt the core provisions of the agreement but addresses the very \nserious transportation needs of this country.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first, I commend my distinguished \ncolleague. We worked together as a team on this. He has spent a good \ndeal of his career in the U.S. Senate fighting to improve America's \ninfrastructure and transportation.\n  I am going to place at the desk at the time of the vote a letter \nsigned by 66 Members of this body supporting precisely what it is we \nhave before them today in this amendment, together with letters from \neach of the Governors. All 50 Governors support a higher level of \nfunding for our highways.\n  Senator Baucus and I, as we worked on this amendment, decided not to \ntake the top dollar. As Senator Baucus clearly said, $17 billion \nremains in the trust fund. We tried to take a reasonable amount of \nincrease.\n  This chart shows the green line of what this budget resolution does \nin terms of highways--flat. Our amendment takes this up at a gradual \nincrease to where we reach the $26 billion, that figure subscribed to \nby 66 Senators, that figure subscribed to by all 50 Governors.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we \ntemporarily set aside the amendment that is pending and permit Senator \nPat Roberts to speak for up to 10 minutes on the bill, after which we \nreturn to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Reserving the right to object. I am sorry. I did not hear \nthe request.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I had checked with Senator Lautenberg. All we did was \nask that the Senator set aside his amendment for 10 minutes and return \nimmediately to it after Pat Roberts speaks for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. How much time is remaining on the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-nine minutes on Senator Domenici's side \nand 12 minutes on Senator Warner's side.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Thank you. No objection.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise on a point of personal privilege.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent to be allowed 2 minutes to count \nagainst either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/22/senate-section/article/S4925-6", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4943-S4944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CLARIFICATION OF PRESS REPORT\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I was shocked a little bit this morning to \nread in the Washington Times a story by Ralph Hallow in which he quotes \na statement that was supposedly attributed to me by Mr. Paul Weyrich. I \nwould like to read it.\n\n  Hallow writes that:\n\n       Mr. Weyrich said that at his regular Tuesday meeting for \n     conservative leaders, Senator James Inhofe, Oklahoma \n     Republican,\n\n[[Page S4944]]\n\n     accused Mr. Lott of having ``betrayed the national-security \n     interests of the country.''\n\n  I have to tell you, Mr. President, that I don't think anything like \nthis has ever happened to me. Even though I don't have thin skin--I \nhave been beat up by the liberal media quite often--this is not the \ncase. I never made such a statement.\n  I even checked the tape of a TV show that I had with the gentleman, \nMr. Weyrich recently, and I find nothing but compliments which I made \nabout Mr. Lott. I did say on a couple of occasions that I disagreed \nwith him on the chemical weapons stand. I disagreed with him on his \nsuggestion in terms of potential punishment for Lt. Flynn. However, I \nwas very complimentary of him.\n  Just a few minutes ago I received a memo from Paul Weyrich which \nclarifies the matter. I want to read into the Record the first half of \nthat memo, dated this morning.\n\n       Once again Ralph Hallow has caused a problem. He called me \n     on my private line and asked my views on Lott and Lt. Flynn, \n     which I was happy to give. He asked me about the rest of the \n     movement, and I told him that at the Wednesday lunch we gave \n     Senator Inhofe a message to take back to the Steering \n     Committee which was supported almost unanimously by the 65 or \n     so in attendance. I then quoted Frank Gaffney as saying that \n     twice in a month Senator Lott had betrayed the security \n     interests of the United States. Instead, he attributes this \n     quote to Senator Inhofe, who refrained from criticizing Lott \n     even though he disagrees with him. Believe me, Hallow did not \n     misunderstand what I told him because he even called me back \n     and said he had interviewed Inhofe and he--Inhofe--refused to \n     be critical of Lott.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/22/senate-section/article/S4943-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4944-S4994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the concurrent \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Chair. I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe Budget Committee.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the overall balanced budget plan \nand rise expressing some reservations in regard to many of the \namendments that we are considering, the pending amendments; some 45 of \nthem, as a matter of fact.\n  If nothing else, I wanted to pay a personal tribute in behalf of the \ntaxpayers of Kansas and thank the chairman of the Budget Committee for \nhis leadership, his perseverance, his patience. He has the patience of \nJob. I must confess, having come from the lower body, as described by \nSenator Byrd, and being the chairman of the House Agriculture \nCommittee, I am not sure I had the patience of Senator Domenici. We now \nspell ``persevere'' D-o-m-e-n-i-c-i.\n  How many hours, I ask of the chairman, if he could respond, how many \ndays, even years, have been involved? Does he have any estimate in \nregard to the hours he has spent late, early--he and Chairman Kasich of \nthe House? If he gives me an estimate, what is it? 10,000?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. On this agreement itself, just this year, I would \nestimate 1,000 hours.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. 1,000 hours. I said hours and minutes; even years.\n  This has been the third year on this particular budget plan. This is \nthe culmination of 3 years of hard work that the Senator from New \nMexico has put in, all members of the Budget Committee, as well as the \nstaff. This has been a Lonesome Dove Trail ride. I hope we get through \nthe tall grass and balanced budget with all of our body parts intact. \nIf we do, the chairman will get most of the credit.\n\n  In the last session of the Congress we had two balanced budgets. We \nworked very hard and very diligently. They were vetoed by the \nPresident. We even came to a Government shutdown. Nobody wants to \nrepeat that. I understand that when you are doing a budget for the U.S. \nGovernment, you have many, many strong differences of opinion. After \nall, for better or worse, the Congress of the United States reflects \nthe diversity we have in this country and the strong difference of \nopinions. Goodness knows, we have good diversity and strong differences \nof opinion. The House, the other body, just the other night stayed \nuntil 3 a.m., and, finally, by a two-vote margin, succeeded in \ndefeating an amendment that was a deal breaker. It involved highways. \nAs a matter of fact, it involved transportation, the very issue we are \ndiscussing on the floor at this very moment other than my comments. Two \nvotes was the difference. Goodness knows, everybody in the House of the \nRepresentatives, everybody in the Senate cares about transportation and \ncares about highways and the infrastructure.\n  We came within five votes of a deal breaker on the floor of the \nSenate. I think it was five votes in regard to health care for \nchildren. Who can be opposed to additional funds for health care for \nchildren? As a matter of fact, the chairman has worked very hard to \nprovide $16 billion in regard to that goal.\n  So we had highways, health care, and we had a situation in regard to \nthe construction of our schools, to fix the infrastructure of the \nNation's schools--$5 billion--with a $100 billion price tag, which set \na very unique precedent.\n  I don't question the intent. I don't question the purpose nor the \nintegrity of any Senator, nor, for that matter, anyone who would like \nto propose an amendment or a better idea in regard to the budget. But I \nwould suggest that the high road of humility and responsibility is not \nbothered by heavy traffic in this instance.\n  Most of the amendments--I have them all here. Here is the stack, 45 \nof them. Most of the pending amendments right here are either sense of \nthe Senate or they have been rejected outright as deal breakers.\n  Sense of the Senate means it is the sense of the Senate. It has no \nlegal standing, has no legislative standing. It is just a Senator \nsaying this would be a good idea in terms of my intent, my purpose, \nwhat I think we ought to do. And there are a few that are agreed to \nthat obviously will be very helpful.\n  But here are the 45. Most of them are simply not going anywhere but \nraises the point. I took a little counting here. There are 8 Democrats \nand 11 Republicans--11 Republicans who have decided that they will take \nthe time of the Senate, take the time of the American people, take the \ntime of the chairman of the Budget Committee and staff and go over and \nrepeat their priority concerns in regard to the budget.\n  There is nothing wrong with that. I understand that. Each Senator is \nan island in terms of their own ideas and their own purpose and their \nintegrity. I do not really question that but in terms of time, I mean \nafter 3 years of debate, after hours and hours and hours of careful \ndeliberation between the President and the Republican leadership and 45 \npending amendments.\n  I have my own amendments. I have my own amendments. I should have had \nsome sense of the Senate amendments. I feel a bit left out. I thought \nwe had a budget deal. I thought we were going to vote on it. I thought \nthat we were going to conclude. And then during the regular \nappropriations process, during the regular order, if you will, of the \nrest of the session, why, perhaps we could address these things that I \ncare very deeply about.\n  Maybe we ought to have a sense-of-the-Senate resolution introduced by \nSenator Roberts that all wheat in Kansas should be sold at $6. That is \na little facetious, to say the least, but I do have concerns about crop \ninsurance, a child care bill I have introduced, along with a capital \ngains bill, capital gains and estate tax. I think capital gains should \nbe across the board. I think estate tax should be at least $1 million. \nI want a sense-of-the-Senate resolution or amendment declaring that. Or \nmaybe an amendment--I tell you what we ought to have, if the chairman \nwould agree. I think you ought to make a unanimous consent request to \nconsider an amendment that all Senators who offer an amendment on the \nbudget process must be required to serve 6 months on the Budget \nCommittee. Why not? Perhaps in the interest of time, since all of the \ntime that is being spent by the 11 Republicans and the 8 Democrats--oh, \nI forgot my sense-of-the-Senate resolution on defense. I do not think \nwe have enough money committed to our national defense with the \nobligations we hear from the Secretary of State, the Secretary of \nDefense, the administration and everything else. So add that one in \nRoberts' sense of the Senate.\n  Maybe we ought to have a unanimous consent request, to save time, to \nget\n\n[[Page S4945]]\n\nthis business done, to accept the responsibility for the budget, I \ncould just ask unanimous consent that all amendments pending be laid on \nthe table and considered en bloc and ask for the yeas and nays and we \ncould get the budget deal and go home. I have not made that unanimous \nconsent request. That would be untoward. That is the mildest word I \ncould use for it because it would violate agreements the distinguished \nchairman has made with other Senators.\n  So let me say this to all the Senators who introduced all these \nsense-of-the-Senate amendments, fell asleep, issued a lot of press \nreleases back home and got a lot of credit. And I laud their intent, \nlaud their purpose. What about breaking the deal? What about the law of \nunintended or intended effects? What about the responsibility of \ndelaying the Senate and possibly delaying 3 years of work, 3 years of \nwork to get to a balanced budget?\n  As you can see by the tone of my remarks, perhaps my patience as a \nnew Member of the Senate is not near the patience of Chairman Job, \nChairman Job Domenici, in regard to the Budget Committee.\n  Now, I had intended on reading the names of all the Senators, their \namendments and lauding their intent in behalf of all the things that we \nwould like to see done. As I say, I have them all here. They range from \neverything from highways to education to defense to making sure that we \nhave proper tax relief across the board. I will not do that. But I \nwould at least ask my colleagues in the Senate to consider the job and \nthe mission and what our distinguished chairman and members of the \nBudget Committee have brought to the floor of the Senate. And if we \ncould, if we could plead for a little bit of expeditious consideration, \nbecause you know what is going to happen. Time will run out and then we \nwill engage in what the Senate calls a votearama, and the votearama is \nlike ``Jeopardy'' or any other game you play on television. You will \nnot even hear what the amendment is. We will just hear an amendment by \nX, Y, or Z, Senator X, Y, or Z and then we will vote on it and \nobviously that will make a good statement back home and we can consider \nthat very serious bill, that serious legislative intent during the \nregular order which should have been considered that way from the \nfirst.\n\n  Again, I thank the chairman so much.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I will be delighted to yield.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I appreciate the Senator's remarks. When the Senator \nholds the stack of amendments, is he suggesting there should be no \namendments or is he just focused on sense-of-the-Senate amendments?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I think if I could further clarify that, of the 45 \namendments there are about 6 deal breakers, if my conversation with the \nchairman is correct. Most of them are sense of Senate. And there are \nothers that have been agreed to. But my basic premise is--and goodness \nknows, this new Member of the Senate is not about to say that we should \nchange the process of the Senate. And this Member of the Senate is not \nabout to preclude any Member from offering any amendment.\n  The point that I am trying to make is that every amendment, every \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment, every deal-breaking amendment also to \nsome degree interferes with the process and the conclusion of a \nbalanced budget which has taken us 3 years. And I know because I have \nbeen sitting in the chair presiding, listening to the same speeches \nthat are made today in the Chamber during morning business, and people \ncan make them in their districts; they can make them on the steps of \nthe Capitol; they can make them here, and that is quite proper of the \nSenate and is advisable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Could I have an additional minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator seeks an additional minute. Who \nyields him time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time does the Senator desire?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. One additional minute.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield it.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I find it rather untoward or awkward after talking 10 \nminutes and expressing concern of the time here I would go on and on \nabout this. I think the point is well taken. I know the Senator from \nMissouri has a very laudable amendment in regards to something I would \nagree with and I would not deny him that opportunity. But can we not \nget on with it after 3 years?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 311\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me make it very clear to everyone in \nthe Senate, first of all, I have nothing but the highest respect and \nadmiration for both the sponsors of this amendment, the distinguished \nSenator from Virginia, who has worked diligently to try to create the \ntransportation programs in the committee he serves and do it in the \nbest interests of our whole country, and believe you me, he has had a \ntough job, and so has Senator Baucus in doing a great job, whether \nworking on the committee or with transportation infrastructure.\n  Their job is very difficult because they have to balance frequently \nthe interests of all 50 States or those that are rural versus those \nthat are very dense in terms of population and thus roadway needs are \nvery different in his State or mine as compared with New Jersey, if you \njust take into account how much gasoline tax is taken in because we are \nsmall, with small populations, but we cannot get from one place to \nanother without roads, so we are in a different category. And over the \ndecades we have all worked very hard to figure out how to do that \nbalancing act. And then it turns out when it is all finished, the House \ndoes it differently than the Senate because the Senate is represented \ntwo Senators to each State. So Senator Baucus and his co-Senator \nrepresent a very small population but they are two. In the House, they \nalways load the bills with the heavy populated States and over here we \ntry to do it with a little more fairness, more fair play.\n  They have had to be referees over that. In fact, I might tell the \nSenators, they probably do not remember, but I was a referee on that \nonce as a conferee, and that was pretty interesting, how we found a \nformula that year.\n  I might say, in spite of these accolades, this is a very, very \nstrange amendment, to say the least. Here we have been for all these \ndays discussing a balanced budget, and as a matter of fact even those \nwho would break this budget did not unbalance the budget. Or even those \nwho had deal breakers because they would take the principal components \nof the budget and change them, as our leader said yesterday, pulling \nthe wheels out from under the cart so it would break down. This \namendment makes no effort to try to offset the $12 billion that they \nadd to this budget.\n  In other words, Mr. President and fellow Senators, this amendment is \nbold enough to say it just does not matter about a balanced budget. We \njust want to put in $12 billion more for highways. Frankly, I am sorry \nwe do not have the money in this budget for that. But we did in fact, \nwe did in fact increase the President's proposal by $10.4 billion. That \nis $10.4 billion more than the President had in mind, and we balanced \nthe budget. We offset it somewhere or in some way reduced the amount of \ntax cut we were going to have in the overall sense of putting the \npackage together.\n\n  But this amendment just comes along and says, well, we just want this \nadditional money spent on highways, and we will wait until another day \nto worry about the balance. Frankly, we had a very meager surplus in \nthe year 2002. This particular amendment costs $4.5 billion in the year \n2002, and that will bring us out of balance by over $2.5 billion.\n  So I urge the Senators who want to support this amendment or this \nconcept, they ought to come down to the floor and cut $12 billion out \nof this budget so it is still in balance. Then we would understand what \nwould be hit--education and everything else we have been trying to \nfund.\n  So I must say on this one the administration supports us. We were not \nso\n\n[[Page S4946]]\n\nsure yesterday morning, I say to my good friend from Kentucky, but they \nsupport us. They sent a letter up here saying they do not support this \namendment. They support our efforts to see that it does not pass.\n  Frankly, I would be less than honest and less than fair with the \ncosponsors--it is clear we are going to have to do something when the \nISTEA Program comes along in the not too distant future. We are going \nto have to make some serious, serious adjustments. And I think those \nare going to happen. Perhaps the Senators will help expedite that a bit \ntoday by calling to the attention of the Senate the situation as you \nsee it.\n  But essentially, we have many trust funds in the United States, many \ntrust funds. I used to know how many. But I think it is probably fair \nto say we have 100 trust funds. I think that is low by 50. I think we \nhave 150. But let us just say we have 100 of them.\n  Frankly, we do not spend every penny that comes into those trust \nfunds every year, nor do we take them and set them out on the side and \nsay whatever comes in goes out. We have put them in the unified budget. \nI am not sure--people argue on both sides of that concept. Should you \nbreak Government up into 150 pieces and then find some more pieces and \nhave no central government running things, no unified budget, I should \nsay. Forget who runs it, just a budget representing them all. And I \nhave come down on the side of putting them all in and leaving them in, \nand if there is surpluses take credit for the surpluses. As a matter of \nfact, it is pretty clear that at some point we are going to have to \nchange the way we are doing business, not perhaps spend more. But I \nwould urge Senators not to vote for this amendment today. I will move \nto table it. I think it breaks the budget. It unbalances the budget. \nThe intentions are very, very good, but this is not quite the way to do \nit.\n  Now I yield to Senator Lautenberg--\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Of course.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank him for the courtesy. Let's clarify a little bit \njust how the Senator as chairman of the Budget Committee--and certainly \nwe commend him for the hard work he has done. What is the meaning of a \ntrust fund?\n  Let's be honest. You are keeping $26 billion, according to my \ncalculation, holding it back, of the revenues paid at the gas tank, as \nif it were poker chips to play where you so desire elsewhere in the \nbudget. We specifically did not put in offsets because the offset is \nthere in a trust fund established 42 years ago with a legislative \nhistory which clearly said that it belongs to the people and should be \nreturned to the people. That is why we did not have an offset. The \noffset is there in the form of the money in the highway trust fund. \nShall we rename that budget deficit fund?\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, you will be writing the new ISTEA law. If you \nwill care to rename it, it will be renamed under your direction, not \nunder mine. But I would say, from what I can find out, this $26 billion \ntrust fund surplus--we spend about $20 billion each year and they have \ndone that for a long time. This $26 billion that is referred to is made \nup of two things: $20.6 billion of it is compounded interest, and $5.9 \nis committed to projects. Frankly, that does not mean we have an awful \nlot of money to spend. As a matter of fact, we probably do not have \nvery much. But, from my standpoint, this trust fund balance is a very \nreasonable balance to keep in the fund. If at some point we can get to \na better plan and do it over a period of time, you are going to find \nthis Senator on your side.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Did Senator Lautenberg want to speak now?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I do.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 20 minutes \nleft; the other side has 12 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we all deeply appreciate the amount of \nwork the Senator from New Mexico has made to try to put this together. \nIt is an almost impossible task. He made an interesting statement, \nthough, that I would just like to follow up on a little bit. He turned \nto the Senator from Virginia a few minutes ago--if I heard you \ncorrectly; I do not want to put words in your mouth--and said something \nto the effect: Yes, you are right. At some future time when we take up \nISTEA we are going to have to deal with deficiencies that are otherwise \ngoing to be available to be spent on the highway bill, ISTEA.\n  If I heard him correctly, if that is what he meant, I would just like \nto explore with the chairman where we might find some of those \nadditional dollars if it's not in the context of this budget \nresolution.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, you did not quote me so incorrectly that I \nwould say you didn't quote me right. But, in essence I am just \nexpressing the notion that is pretty rampant, that outside of this \nbudget resolution, at a later date, that in various committees we will \nbe working on what do we do with this highway trust fund and what do we \ndo with the new formula, where there will be a new formula.\n  All I am suggesting is at some point that debate is going to occur, \nbut I don't believe it should occur here on the floor of the Senate, \ntaking $12 billion and just adding it to this budget and saying we are \njust going to go in the red because we have not figured out any other \nway. There is going to be another way to look at this situation.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. But again I ask you, at what time, at what point would we \nbegin to find the additional dollars that we all know we need for \ntransportation?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, look, the committees in the U.S. Senate are \nmarvelous institutions, and how you work out problems that are \ncomplicated and difficult and frequently of longstanding--the Senate is \nhistoric in its wise ways of doing this.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I understand.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. All I am suggesting is there is going to be a way.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I understand, but I bow to the mighty power of the Budget \nCommittee, when we see the limitations that otherwise are incumbent \nupon us--\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I might suggest, I served on that committee for a long \ntime, Senator Warner. In fact, I would have been chairman three times \nover with the longevity I would have if I would have been there.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we want the Senator where he is. Please \nstay. By the way, I volunteered three times to serve on the Budget \nCommittee, and my name will be on there one of these days.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. All right. Now, how much time do we have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 17 minutes \nleft.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wanted to yield to Senator Lautenberg, who is my ally \nhere on the floor on this issue, and then find a little time of mine \nout of it to yield to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am not going to take that much time, Mr. President. \nI think the chairman of the Budget Committee has fairly directly and \nsuccinctly made the arguments. The fact of the matter is that none of \nus are happy with the level of funding that we have for our investments \nin highways and our transportation needs. We are more deficient, in \nmany ways, than countries down the Third World list. I think we rank \nabout 55th in per capita spending for infrastructure.\n  So, one would not disagree with the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia or the distinguished Senator from Montana in terms of the \nneed, the need to correct the situation. But unfortunately, and it is \nunfortunate for me because I have long been an advocate of more \nspending on transportation in this country. I think it is common \nknowledge that the Senator from New Jersey has been an advocate of mass \ntransit, of rail transportation, improving our highway system, of \nfixing our deficient bridges, which number in the thousands. But we \nhave a proposal in hand that takes a priority, unfortunately, for the \nmoment. That is, to complete the work we started on a balanced budget. \nWe are committed to it.\n\n  Believe me, this is not a place I enjoy being, because I do not agree \nwith everything that is in the budget resolution. But I agree with it \nenough to say that there is a consensus that we fulfilled an obligation \nthat we talked about to children, children's health, to the senior \ncitizens, to try to make\n\n[[Page S4947]]\n\nMedicare solvent, to try to not further burden the impoverished in \nterms of Medicare, to try to take care of those who are in this country \nlegally and become disabled. We fulfilled those obligations.\n  The economy is moving along at a very good rate and we are still \nrunning the risk, in my view, with some of the tax cuts that have been \nproposed, of taking us away from the direction that we are moving in, \nwhich is to continue to reduce the budget deficit until the year 2002, \nwhen there will be none.\n  So we have an imperfect, but pretty good, solution in front us. And, \nnow what we are discussing, in terms of transportation--and this is \nlike me talking against motherhood--but the transportation funds that \nare there are inadequate because of the structure of our budgeting \nstructure, the budgeting arrangement that we have in our Government. \nThe fact is that we have unified budgets. If one wants to start, as has \nbeen claimed here several times, establishing truth in budgeting, under \nthat nomenclature I think one would have to start with Social Security.\n  Are we prepared today to say we are going to add $70 billion to our \ndeficit each year? We certainly are not. Yet I think, when you talk \nabout a trust fund, there is no more sanctified trust fund than Social \nSecurity, something people paid in, they are relying on for their \nfuture, for their ability to get along. But we nevertheless still have \nthe unified budget. That problem, I assure you, is going to get intense \nscrutiny over the next several years.\n  Senator Roberts said something--I don't know whether you were here, \nSenator Domenici, when he said: Everybody, in order to have the budget \nfully understood, every Senator should be sentenced to 6 months on the \nBudget Committee. I thought immediately, there is a constitutional \nprohibition against cruel and inhuman punishment, so we could not do \nthat, even if we wanted to. I am on the Budget Committee by a quirk of \ncircumstance. When I came here, a fellow I had known who was a Senator \nsaid that he would do me a favor and that he would vacate his seat on \nthe Budget Committee for me. And I will get even.\n  The fact of the matter is, we complain and we gripe, but the money is \nwhere the policy is, the money is where the direction is. We take this \nassignment with a degree of relish, because we want to do the right \nthing. None of us want to throw the taxpayers' money away. But we are \nwhere we are.\n  It is with reluctance that I am opposing this amendment because both \nSenators, Senator Warner and Senator Baucus, have been very actively \ninvolved in highway funding and highway legislation as a result of our \nmutual service on the Environment and Public Works Committee. But we \nare spending more than we did last year. We are spending more than the \nbudget resolution of just 2 years ago.\n\n  I was able, with a lot of hard work and with the support of the \nchairman of the committee, to get an $8.7 billion increase over the \nPresident's budget request for transportation. I had asked that \ntransportation be included as one of the top priorities in the budget. \nUnfortunately it is not there. But there is a plan, that we expect to \nbe fulfilled, to have a reserve fund that would allow significantly \nmore funding for some of the transportation needs.\n  But I want to point out one thing about the trust fund. That is, \nthere is a slow payout in highway projects. I think everybody is aware \nof that--5, 7 years on many of these things. If we shut down the \nrevenue source now, interest alone would not carry the obligations that \nare already out there. The obligation ceiling as contrasted with the \ncontract authority are quite different things. We have these \nobligations that have to be fulfilled, they are there and one day must \nbe met. The balances in the fund, I think, will start coming down with \nthe adjustments that are expected to occur in ISTEA. We have the \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee on the floor. \nThat will be opportunity to make some of the changes that are being \ncontemplated here.\n  I just think it is a terrible time to say we ought to burden the \nbudget deficit by $12 billion, roughly, right now, when everybody has \nworked so hard, and this budget has been scrubbed, reviewed, rewashed, \nrehashed--you name it. We are where we are, in a fairly delicate \nbalance, I point out to my colleagues. There are very delicate \nopportunities that will, I think, upset the balance that has been \nachieved. So, again, I repeat myself when I say with reluctance I am \ngoing to vote against it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will my colleague yield for a brief question?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Sure.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator, a member of our \ncommittee, Environment and Public Works, is, according to my records, a \ncosponsor of a piece of legislation called ISTEA--NEXTEA. Am I not \ncorrect?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. In that, it is interesting, there are three bills put in \nby Members of the Senate. I am coauthor--Senator Baucus, Senator Graham \nof Florida; STEP 21, Senator Baucus is 2000, you are with Senator \nChafee.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Right.\n  Mr. WARNER. ISTEA. Look into that bill. Right in there is a provision \nsaying we want $26 billion each year, far more than what the Senator \nfrom Virginia is asking. I build up to $26 billion in the fifth year. \nYou want it beginning this year. In other words, you are saying to the \nSenate, in a cosponsored piece of legislation together with the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee, you want $26 billion. Now you \nstand on this floor and talk in direct opposite. That is what leaves me \nat a loss. So the question is, you are a cosponsor and----\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, in response to the question, before \nthe speech, I would say this--yes, I sponsored that legislation.\n  My heart is in more funding for transportation, and no one here can \nsay differently. The problem is that we are in a different point in \ntime, and if you want to take it out of highways and say forget the \nchildren's health care bill, if you want to take it out of highways and \nforget the pledge we made to the senior citizens, or take it out of \nthis bill and forget the pledge that we made to those who might be \ndisabled, let's do it, let's talk about that. Let's talk about \nbalancing the budget, because I know the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia has been a proponent of a balanced budget almost from the day \nthe words were invented around here.\n  So now we have a different occasion. We are not talking about \ntransportation; we all agree that transportation is definitely \nunderfunded. What we are talking about is at what price do we make this \nchange, and the price is at, again, children's health or otherwise, \nbecause we are committed to balancing this budget. And this is strange \ntalk for a fellow like me.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think it is right on, and I hope you make it about \nfive or six times in the remaining couple hours. I look forward to \nhearing it more times than one.\n  Mr. President, I wonder, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 7 minutes; the \nSenator from Virginia has 10 minutes, almost 11 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Rhode Island, the chairman of the full Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works, Senator Chafee.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished manager of the \nbill.\n  I rise in opposition today to the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Virginia and the Senator from Montana. I might say, these are two \nSenators for whom I have tremendous respect. I have worked with them. \nThe Senator from Virginia, I think we first started our association in \n1969, and the Senator from Montana, I started working with him the \nfirst year he came to the Senate, which I think was 1978, 1979, and we \nhave been closely associated ever since.\n  However, this amendment, which would increase outlays for \ntransportation spending above the levels provided in the resolution \nbefore us, I find to be inconsistent with the achievement of a balanced \nbudget by the year 2002.\n  The Senator from Virginia just said it went beyond the bill, the so-\ncalled NEXTEA bill that goes beyond this, and that is absolutely right, \nbut that was before we had a target from the Budget Committee. I \nbelieve strongly in the budgetary process we have set up. I voted for \nit, and I support it.\n\n[[Page S4948]]\n\n  I think we all can agree that the Nation's roads and bridges are in \nneed of repair. No one argues with that. Transportation plays a \ncritical role in our Nation's economy. We recognize that. In the United \nStates, more than 12 million people, more than 11 percent of the gross \nnational product, is involved in transportation.\n  Earlier this year, I cosponsored a measure to increase, within the \ncontext of a unified budget, the level of transportation spending from \nthe highway trust fund. I am pleased that the budget agreement, crafted \nby the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from New Jersey, \nincreases the spending levels implicit in that proposal, the so-\ncalled Bond-Chafee proposal. It is $13 billion over a freeze baseline. \nThat is pretty good.\n\n  Would we like more? Sure we would. But I think it is terribly \nimportant to recognize that any proposal that boosts highway spending \nor transportation spending without corresponding offsets is something I \npersonally cannot support. So, I agree with Senators Warner and Baucus \nthat transportation spending should be increased, but not in a manner \nthat would undermine the careful agreement reached by the Budget \nCommittee.\n  Do we like everything in this budget? No, but it is the best we can \nget. I am supporting that agreement. It seems to me we simply cannot \nafford to retreat from our efforts to eliminate the Federal deficit.\n  So that, Mr. President, is the reason I cannot support this amendment \nthat is before us today. I thank the Chair and thank the manager and \nthank the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee that deals with \nthese matters. He has worked on them, and I know his heart is in this. \nAs always, he argues his case with vigor and considerable force.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, might I ask a question on my time of my \ndistinguished chairman?\n  There are three bills pending before the Senate relating to the \nreauthorization of ISTEA. I mentioned that. Seventy-four colleagues \nhave signed one of those three bills. Each one of those bills has the \nhigher level of $26 billion. I say to my colleague, he also is a \ncosponsor of the Bond-Chafee/Chafee-Bond legislation. The principle \nthat Senator Baucus and I are arguing today precisely is the Chafee-\nBond bill. I ask the Senator, does he feel there is any difference in \nprinciple?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes. First of all, I am pleased to call it the Chafee-\nBond proposal.\n  Mr. WARNER. Call it what you want.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. We call it that in Rhode Island. What the Chafee-Bond \nproposal does is it says that what came in in the previous year--we do \nnot deal with the interest, we do not deal with----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I do not need an explanation. In \nprinciple, pay it in, take it out, isn't that right, in simple English?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. That's right.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine, that's all I need to say.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. What comes in this year goes out next year, and that \nprinciple is in this budget.\n  Mr. WARNER. That principle is in this amendment. I thank the \ndistinguished Senator. That is all we are asking. But it is interesting \nwe are asking for less than what is paid in to come out, recognizing \nthe challenge before the Budget Committee.\n  So I say, once again, 74 colleagues have signed on to legislation. We \nare going to have to answer to our constituents, Mr. President, on this \nvote. You say one thing in sponsoring the bills, and we will see how \nconsistent you are. I will put a letter on the desk signed by 56 \nSenators as to how they spoke to this. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator from Virginia yield for a few minutes?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield all but a minute and a half, 2 \nminutes I have reserved.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we heard today from both the chairman and \nthe ranking member of the Budget Committee that we need to address this \nproblem; the problem that there is a deficiency in highway-mass \ntransit-infrastructure spending that must be dealt with at sometime. \nBut they are also saying they feel constrained to say they cannot deal \nwith it here because they feel constrained by the budget resolution, a \nresolution agreed to principally between the White House and the \nleadership.\n  They talk about an $8 billion increase. That does not include \ninterest. And because the country is growing, because of additional \nneeds we have and the crumbling bridges, if this resolution is adopted, \nSenators should know that they will receive less in dollars than they \nwill need for their State's infrastructure.\n  The Senators, the chairman and ranking member, say, ``Well, we will \ndeal with it in the future at sometime,'' acknowledging that there is a \nproblem and we need more transportation dollars. I must remind Senators \nthat we have a difficult problem ahead of us. When we in the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee in the coming weeks write a bill \ndealing with CMAQ, dealing with formulas, donor States, donee States, \nso on and so forth, what do we look at? We look at the number that the \nBudget Committee sends to us. We are constrained by that number. We \nmust then write a 5- or 6-year bill which locks in the spending limits \nthat the Budget Committee prescribes for us. We are locked in for 5 or \n6 years.\n  Those lower levels cannot be changed next year by a new budget \nresolution, cannot be changed until or unless this Congress writes a \nnew highway bill. I am not so sure this Congress is going to want to \nwrite a new highway bill every year. So I am saying that this is the \ntime to deal with this problem. It is now. Otherwise, we are locked in \nfor 6 years to inadequate numbers.\n  We want to make an adjustment of less than one-tenth of 1 percent of \nour Federal budget, less than one-tenth of 1 percent of our Federal \nbudget, which I am fully confident can be dealt with in conference. It \nis critical that this amendment be adopted so that we are not locked in \nover the next 6 years to inadequate numbers. We will be locked into \nthese numbers if this resolution is adopted. We can make adjustments in \nall the other accounts and still maintain the core provisions of the \nbipartisan agreement.\n  So I urge Senators to, therefore, vote for this so we can do what we \nknow is right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair notes 2 minutes remain for the \nSenator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, is that all the time that is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. The Senator from New Mexico \nhas 2 minutes; the Senator from Virginia has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend my distinguished colleague. He, \nin his concluding remarks, gave the clarion call: When we cast the \nvote, we simply cast a vote to say to the Budget Committee, ``Go back \nand look for that very small fraction so we can avoid this flat green \nline which is correctly represented on this chart, and allow our \nseveral States to build that infrastructure necessary to compete in \nthis world market.''\n  What we have left out, my distinguished colleague and myself, are \npages and pages of added requests by our colleagues. I totaled over $7 \nbillion in addition to what is to be allocated under the formulation \nfor superb programs that are badly needed by the country: Appalachian \nhighway system; for the Indian reservation roads; for expansion of the \nintelligent transportation system; for innovative financing \ninitiatives; for new funding to meet infrastructure--on and on it goes.\n  We want to, Senator Baucus and I together with other members of our \nsubcommittee and full committee, try and do this, but those we haven't \neven discussed today. We will never get to one nickel of this unless we \nare given some additional flexibility.\n  So we say, with all due respect, we are simply asking a voice mandate \nin support of our constituents to the Budget Committee, ``Go back and \nreexamine the desperate need of America for these dollars.''\n  I thank the Chair. I yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Do I have 2 minutes and that is it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me suggest, again, to Senators who \nmight be listening or those who might be listening in their stead, in \nthis budget, we\n\n[[Page S4949]]\n\nhave tried to do many things. We have tried to cut taxes for the \nAmerican people; we have tried to cover little children who are \nuninsured with $16 billion; we have tried to cover the National \nInstitutes of Health with a 3.5-percent increase.\n  We heard from people what America had to be doing, and, in each \ninstance, we had to get rid of something. In fact, I have not said it \nyet, but the President gave up 50 percent of his initiatives in the \ncompromise that was made, and every time we did it, we said, ``Let's \nbalance the budget; let's balance the budget.'' We would come back and \nsay, ``Well, we want to add this, what do we take out?'' And we would \ntake something out. What we have here today is $12 billion as if it \njust flopped out of the sky; no effort to balance the budget, no effort \nto offset it with expenditures so we can all see where do you pick up \nthe $12 billion that is needed for highways?\n  Everybody understands that highways are very much needed in America, \nbut this budget, for the first time, will permit us to spend every cent \nof new taxes that comes into that fund every single year. We are moving \nin the right direction. Every cent of new gasoline tax that goes into \nthis fund under this budget agreement will be spent in that year that \nit comes in, obligated during that year. That is a giant stride in the \ndirection that we have been asked to go by many people in our country.\n  Frankly, every Governor in America sends a letter in. They want more \nmoney. And then some of them get up and criticize that we do not \nbalance the budget right. The lead Governor in America, the head of the \nassociation, he wants every penny of highway funds, but this budget \nresolution just does not get the job done right.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). All time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield back the balance of my time, and move to table \nthe amendment, and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table the amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 51, nays 49, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 80 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--51\n\n     Allard\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     Domenici\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hutchison\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thompson\n\n                                NAYS--49\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Coats\n     Conrad\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Faircloth\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Grams\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Sarbanes\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Specter\n     Thomas\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 311) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. History was made with this vote, by two votes, and two \nvotes in the House--that resonates all across this land. It is a wake-\nup call to all those entrusted with the responsibility of keeping \nAmerica's infrastructure modernized and safe so we can compete in this \none-world market. This is but the first of a series of battles that \nwill be waged on this floor on behalf of America's transportation \nsystem. It is my privilege to be a part of that team.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes. I want to \ncompliment those who offered the amendment for the way they have \nhandled matters and to tell the same American people that were \nlistening to the distinguished Senator from Virginia that there will be \nadditional highway funding in years to come, there is no doubt about \nit, but it will not be done at the expense of unbalancing the budget. \nIt will not be done at the expense of just saying we will spend some \nmoney even if the deficit goes up. I look forward to the day we do it \nin such a way that it is balanced and that, as a matter of fact, if we \nincrease, we cut some things to make up for the difference so we stay \nin balance.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 2 minutes to Senator Stevens.\n  Mr. STEVENS. As chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I want to \ntell the Senate that those of us who are voting against some of these \namendments are doing it because there is no money to fund these sense-\nof-the-Senate resolutions. I say to any of you that want to offer \namendments that change this budget, that authorize additional funds--\nshow me the money. Show me where the money is when you offer amendments \nthat change the budget plan agreed to with the President.\n  I have discussed this with the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia. We will have the obligation to allot money within the budget \namong 13 subcommittees. A sense-of-the-Senate resolution does not give \nus any more money but it gives us the problem that you have sent a \nmessage to America that there is money in this budget to do something \nthe Senate votes for in a sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  When the budget resolution, just before, was voted I asked for a \nchance to come to the floor again, and I ask for you to reserve some \ntime and we will show where a commitment has been made by the Senate to \nfund items where there is no money. I urge the Senate to wake up. We \nare voting against these matters not because we are against highways or \naid for children who need insurance. We are voting--the Senators from \nNew Mexico and New Jersey have brought us a resolution. We had a budget \nthat has been worked out with the President and we have a chance to \nvote for a balanced budget. I do not want to be accused of being a \ntightwad when we allocate the money under 602(b) of the budget act and \nthen we do not cover the sense-of-the-Senate Resolutions.\n  Again, if anyone is going to accuse us of being tightwads and not \nfollowing the sense of the Senate, I tell you, if you vote for one of \nthese things, you show us where the money is and we will allocate it. \nWe will not be misled by these attempts to gain publicity and to gain \nsome credit at home on a bill like this. This is a very serious bill. \nThe two of us are going to have a horrendous job trying to meet our \nduties even within this budget, so do not give us any more of this \nfunny money. You show me real money and I will allocate it to your \nfunction.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself in considerable \nmeasure with the distinguished Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens]. We \nhave been voting for a lot of sense-of-the-Senate resolutions. I think \nwe had one yesterday, 99-0. We know it is not going to be paid for.\n  On this business about infrastructure, we hear it said that there is \nno money. I am from a State that needs infrastructure. We say there is \nno money. I shall state why I supported the Warner-Baucus amendment. We \ndo not need a tax cut in this country right now. We do not need a tax \ncut. I say that with respect to the Republican tax cut and with respect \nto the tax cut that is supported by the Administration. We do not need \na tax cut. When we see what we are doing in this budget resolution with \nrespect to cutting taxes--cutting taxes at a time when we are within \nreach of balancing the budget, if we were to use that money that is \ngoing for the tax cut, we would balance this budget much earlier than \nit is expected to be balanced now and we could also use some of that \nmoney for infrastructure. If we want to know where we\n\n[[Page S4950]]\n\ncan get the money, that is where it can be found. Let's vote against \nthe tax cut.\n  I am going to vote against this resolution if we have the tax cut \ntied with it.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield myself 2 minutes off the resolution.\n  Mr. President, I don't like being put in the position that appears to \nbe developing here, that I am against investment in infrastructure. I \nstand on my record of having fought as hard as anyone in this body to \ninvest more money in highways, in mass transit, in rail and aviation, \nwhatever was called for. I never met a transportation project I didn't \nlike if it was a well-founded and well-thought-out project. But the \ninsinuation by our distinguished friend from Virginia to caution us and \nto lay down the scare that we will be counted upon or we will be looked \nupon by the Record and by the voters, I want to say this: The Senator \nfrom Virginia took the liberty yesterday of voting against the funds \nfor crumbling schools, against schools that are tattered and falling \napart, where children can't possibly learn. That was OK to vote \nagainst. And the appeal wasn't made, and there was no threat that if \nyou vote against this, you are committing those kids to an even more \ndifficult assignment to try and lift themselves up.\n  I have defended investments in transportation as chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Transportation of the Appropriations Committee. Without \nfail, I have defended investing more. But the onerous comparison is \nthat we neglected our responsibility. It is almost as if you are \nunpatriotic.\n  I don't really like everything in this budget resolution. But I am \ncommitted by my constitutional responsibilities. If I take the \nassignment, I have to work on it. We negotiated in good faith, and I \ndon't like some of the tax concessions we have in there. But I think \nmiddle-class people in this country are entitled to some tax relief. I \nthink those who want to send their kids to college are entitled to some \nhelp to get them the first step up on the economic ladder.\n  No, I don't like it all. But I have my duty to do, and I did it. It \nwasn't pleasant. It wasn't pleasant when I went into the Army in World \nWar II, either, but I did it. And the insinuation that somehow or other \nI have deserted my responsibility is one that really offends me.\n  We did what we thought was best, each one of us, whatever the vote \nwas.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is my understanding that I was to be \nable to call up an amendment at this time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That is in the order. That is true.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, before I use any of that time, just as a \nmatter of courtesy and parliamentary process, my distinguished \ncolleague is also standing for recognition.\n  If I could ask the Chair what the Senator's intent might be, we might \nbe able to work out an arrangement.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my intention, having talked to the ranking \nMember, was to seek 10 minutes for debate on the resolution. Whatever \nfits with the schedule of the Senator from Massachusetts will be fine \nwith me.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. It is a commitment that was made, I say to the \nSenator from North Dakota. But the Senator from Massachusetts did have \na priority and was on record as being next in line. If an accommodation \ncan be made between the two--if not, the Senator from Massachusetts has \nan opportunity to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom North Dakota be permitted to proceed for 10 minutes, and \nsubsequently, when he completes, that I be recognized for the purposes \nof calling up my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \nhis courtesy. I wanted to speak for a couple of minutes on the \nresolution itself that is brought to the floor of the Senate. I want to \ntalk just for a moment about what it is and what it is not.\n  This piece of legislation is a budget agreement that I intend to vote \nfor on final passage. I think a substantial amount of work has been \ndone by the chairman of the Budget Committee, the ranking member, and \nmany others in the House and the Senate and in the White House. They \nhave negotiated in very difficult circumstances the terms of a budget \nagreement. But, as I said, I want to talk about what this is and what \nit is not.\n  This is a budget agreement that provides a balanced budget of the \nunified budget. Is that something that has merit? Yes, it is. Is that \nsomething that moves in the right direction? Yes, it does. But it is \nnot a balanced budget amendment that balances the budget without the \nuse of trust funds, such as the Social Security fund. I want everybody \nto be clear about that.\n  On page 4 of this budget resolution, which is on the desks of all \nSenators, it says ``deficit.'' On line 24, it says ``deficit'' in the \nyear 2002, ``$108 billion.'' Why does it say that?\n  It says that because this piece of legislation balances what is \ncalled the unified budget. Many of us believe there is another step to \nbe taken after that. That is to balance the budget without the use of \ntrust funds, especially without the use of Social Security trust funds.\n  For that reason, I voted for the initiative offered yesterday by the \nSenator from South Carolina. It got very few votes, I might say. But he \nsaid, let us balance the budget and not do tax cuts and not do added \ninvestments at the start so that we balance the budget completely \nwithout using the trust fund, and then, as the economy strengthens and \nas we have extra money, let us provide for the tax cuts and let us \nprovide for the added investments. Obviously, that proposal failed.\n  I will vote for this budget agreement. But it is not truly a balanced \nbudget. It moves in the direction, and it moves the right way. But it \nwill leave this country, still, with a deficit. That must be the next \nstep following action on this document.\n  There are several steps here in climbing a flight of stairs to get to \nthe point where we make real progress. One step we took in 1993. I was \none who voted for the budget in 1993. I am glad I did. I said at the \ntime it was a very controversial vote. It passed by one vote in the \nU.S. Senate--a budget agreement to substantially reduce the Federal \nbudget deficit. It passed by one vote, the vote of the Vice President \nof the United States.\n  Some paid a very heavy price for that vote because it was \ncontroversial. It cut spending. And, yes, it raised some taxes. But \nwhat was the result of that vote in 1993? The result was a dramatically \nreduced budget deficit.\n  In that year, the unified budget deficit was close to $290 billion. \nAgain, using the unified budget, the Congressional Budget Office now \nsays the unified budget deficit is going to be, at the end of year, $67 \nbillion.\n  What has caused all of that? Well, a good economy and a 1993 budget \nact that a lot of people here had the courage to vote for, that passed \nby one vote, that says, let's put us moving in the right direction; \nlet's move us in the right direction to substantially reduce the budget \ndeficit. And only with that vote, and only with the progress that came \nfrom that vote, are we now able to take another very large step in \nmoving toward a balanced budget.\n  What was the result of that vote? It was interesting. We had people \nin 1993 on the floor of the Senate who said, if you cast a ``yes'' vote \nand pass this budget, the economy will collapse; the country will go \ninto a recession; it means higher deficits and a higher debt; it means \nthe economy goes into a tailspin.\n  It passed with my vote--and, yes, the votes of some of my colleagues \nwho decided to say to this country that we are serious, that we are \ngoing to move this country in the right direction even if the choice is \npainful for us to cast this vote.\n  What happened? What happened was 4 years of sustained economic \ngrowth, inflation coming down, down, down, and down, and unemployment \ncoming down and down for 4 years in a row. We have more people working. \nThis country now has 12 million more people on\n\n[[Page S4951]]\n\nthe payrolls that we did in 1993. We have an economy that is moving \nahead, a deficit that is moving down, and inflation that is at a 30-\nyear low.\n  I wonder if those who predicted doom from that vote now won't join us \nand say, ``You did the right thing. It wasn't easy to do. But because \nyou did it, we stand here today now able to take the next step.'' The \nnext step is a step in which we now try to choose priorities.\n  What do we make investments on in our country, and where do we cut \nreal levels of spending?\n  That is what this document is about. It is a compromise between \nRepublicans and Democrats, between a President and Congress, that tries \nto establish priorities. Frankly, while it reduces spending in some \nareas, it cuts out entire classes of spending in others. It also \nincreases some investment in spending in yet other areas.\n  What are those? Education: It makes a lot of sense for us even as we \nattempt to move toward solving this country's fiscal problems to say \nthat we don't solve the problems of the future by retreating on things \nlike educating our kids.\n  So this piece of legislation says education is a priority--more Pell \ngrants, more Head Start, more investing in education, from young kids \nto college age and beyond. It says we are going to invest in education.\n  Then it says the environment and health care. It says these areas are \npriorities. They are areas that make this country strong, and we will \ncontinue to invest in those areas even as we move to reconcile our \nbooks so that we are not spending more than we take in.\n  That is why this is important, and it is why it is successful. I am \npleased, frankly, after all of these years, to be on the floor of the \nSenate saying this is something that is bipartisan. Finally, \nRepublicans and Democrats, rather than exerting all of their energy to \nfight each other and beat each other, are deciding there are ways that \nwe can join each other and pass a piece of legislation that moves this \ncountry in the right direction. I think the American people probably \nthink it is a pretty good thing that bipartisanship comes to the floor \nof the Senate in the form of this budget resolution.\n  I started by saying I would talk about what this is and what it \nisn't. I am going to vote for this. It moves this country in the right \ndirection. It preserves priorities that are important to preserve, and \ninvestment in this country's future. It represents a compromise. Many \nof us would have written it differently. We didn't get all we wanted. \nBut it moves this country in the right direction while preserving the \nkinds of things most of us think are important as investments in our \ncountry's future.\n  This is not a balanced budget, not truly a balanced budget. It \nbalances something called the unified budget. But it is a major step in \nthe right direction. I hope we will take the next step beyond this to \nsay that, on page 4 of the next budget resolution, line 24, we will say \n``zero'' in a future year. That is when we will truly have completed \nthe job.\n  But the choices here are not always choices we would like. The choice \nthat we now ask ourselves is, does this move us in the right direction \nwith respect to the things I care a great deal about--one, fiscal \ndiscipline; a more deficit reduction; investment in education, health \ncare, the environment--things that make this country a better place? \nThe answer, unequivocally, is yes. This moves America in the right \ndirection.\n  Is it an exercise between the President and Congress, between \nDemocrats and Republicans, that will give this country some confidence \nthat the past is over, that the reckless, the irresponsible fiscal \npolicy of saying let's spend money we don't have on things we don't \nneed and run up trillions and trillions of dollars of debt for our kids \nand our grandkids to assume? Is it a message to the American people \nthat we are beyond that period and have moved on to a new day of \nbipartisanship to decide together we can plot a better course and move \nthis country toward a brighter future? The answer to that is yes.\n  If the past is any experience, since 1993, the vote we took then to \nput us on the road to balancing this budget is a proud vote and one \nthat I am glad I cast. I will be glad I cast this vote as well, because \nthis is the next major segment of the journey to do what the American \npeople want us to do on their behalf and on behalf of so many children \nwho will inherit this country. They will inherit a better country \nbecause of what we will have done in this Chamber this week.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we have under \nnormal regular order an amount of time at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has no time. The Senator hasn't \ncalled up his amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 309\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I call up amendment No. 309.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry], for himself, \n     Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Kohl, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mr. Wellstone, \n     Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Bingaman, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 309.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record of May 21, 1997.)\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I now yield to the Senator from Minnesota 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. President, before I yield let me just take 1 minute to explain. \nThis is an amendment to hold out a possibility--I yield myself such \ntime as I may use--to hold out the possibility that when we come back \nin the appropriating process, we may be able to find some money to deal \nwith the issue of early child development. We do not spend money now. \nWe do not trade money. We do not have an offset. We do not spend. We \nsimply want to be able to reserve the capacity to come back at a later \ntime to deal with this issue. I will explain why I feel that is so \nimportant, as do the other Senators joining me. This is an amendment \nthat is cosponsored by Senators Kohl, Moseley-Braun, Wellstone, \nRockefeller, Mikulski, Murray, and Bingaman.\n  I now yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will be very brief.\n  I see the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to yield\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time is the Senator going to use in total? I \nam trying to be accommodating. Use as much time as you like. Do we have \nany idea?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I cannot tell the Senator precisely, but I \ncan absolutely tell you I am going to yield back time. I think it will \nbe somewhere in the vicinity of a half-hour.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. My problem is, Mr. President, I have to go to an \nimportant meeting with the minority and the majority leaders, and I \nhave not had a chance to speak to the Senator about this amendment. I \nwant to speak to him about it. I am wondering, if the Senator does use \nhis whole half-hour, could we then get another amendment ready and call \nit up and set the amendment aside?\n  Mr. KERRY. I will be delighted to set this aside for whatever period \nof time the manager would like. I do want to engage in a dialog on it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator agree when he is finished----\n  Mr. KERRY. I will agree to request that this be set aside.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. When the Senator is finished, will he suggest the \nabsence of a quorum and I will return as soon as I can?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will be happy to agree with the Senator \nfrom New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Then I ask unanimous consent that when they are \nfinished with the argument, the quorum call be called for and I will \nthen attend the meeting and return as quickly as I can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We cannot do that. We all understand.\n\n[[Page S4952]]\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will have an opportunity to have an \namendment and speak on it a little later this afternoon, so let me be \nvery brief.\n  I rise to support this amendment that Senator Kerry has introduced. I \nthink more than anything else it is an amendment that almost asks us to \nengage in some reflection. It does not call for spending any additional \nmoney. It asks us to pause and think deeply about our priorities and at \nleast consider the possibility that we might eventually be able as we \ngo through this reconciliation process to make some significant \ninvestment in these very critical and very important early years.\n  As a former college teacher, and I think more importantly as a parent \nand grandparent, I am absolutely convinced from my own experience and \nfrom spending time in a school in Minnesota about every 2 or 3 weeks \nduring the school year we have to get to the point where every child \nwho comes to kindergarten has been read to widely, that we have to get \nto the point where every child who comes to kindergarten knows the \nalphabet and knows how to spell his or her name, knows colors, shapes, \nand sizes. And we have to get to the point where every child who comes \nto kindergarten comes with that sort of wonderful readiness to learn.\n  The critical challenge for all of us, which kind of speaks to what we \nare really about, speaks to what our goodness is, is to make sure that \neach and every child enters kindergarten with this wonderful readiness \nto learn. The problem is that for all too many children this does not \nhappen. I am sure that Senator Kerry has referenced so much the \nneuroscience evidence that is coming out now. I think we know what to \ndo. I do not think it is true we do not know what to do. And we just \nhave to get it right. There is sort of an interconnection of the \nnutrition part and the health care part and the intellectual \ndevelopment and child care part and we have to do much better for \nchildren in this country.\n  Hopefully this amendment will be an amendment that will generate \nbipartisan support. I think it is a plea. I think it is a call upon all \nof us to reflect. It is an effort to say to all of us, think deeply and \nlet us, at least, hold out the possibility as we move through this \nreconciliation process we can invest in these children and their \nopportunities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota not just \nfor his support for this but especially for his long-term commitment to \nit and his enormous understanding as a former teacher of how important \nthese ingredients are.\n  Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. President, I rise today as a supporter of this budget and as a \ncosponsor of the Kerry amendment.\n  This budget deserves the support of the Senate for several reasons. \nIt is bipartisan and it is centrist. It funds priorities like education \nand child health that transcend party lines. It includes reasonable tax \nrelief targeted toward families and economic growth. It balances the \nbudget by the year 2002 and it produces surpluses to reduce the debt in \nthe years after that.\n  This good deal will be made better by adopting the Kerry amendment \nwhich makes clear the Senate's commitment to very young children. A \ncompelling amount of research on the brain has confirmed what \nscientists have long talked about for years, that the most significant \nperiod in a child's development is between the years of zero to 3. \nUnfortunately, the Federal commitment to early childhood education has \nnot caught up with our understanding of how important the first 3 years \nof life are. Early education and child care receive fewer resources for \nteacher training, salary, and even respect than the rest of the \neducation system.\n  According to data compiled by the Rand Corp., while 90 percent of \nhuman brain growth occurs by the age of 3, public spending on children \nin that age range equals only 8 percent of spending on all children.\n  And so, Mr. President, we are clearly missing a unique opportunity. A \nlook at the current Department of Education budget shows the stark \nfunding disparity against early childhood education. Of $29.4 billion \nin current estimated education expenditures, only $1.5 billion or 5 \npercent is spent on children from birth to age 5. A new commitment to \nquality child care is a necessary response to the fact that children \nbetween the ages of zero and 3 are spending more time in care away from \ntheir homes. Almost 60 percent of women in the work force have children \nunder the age of 3 requiring care. Many of these working families will \nnot be able to find quality child care for their young children. And \nwhile Federal, State, and local governments have helped build a strong \neducation system for 5- to 25-year-olds, care and education for zero to \n5-year-olds is largely unstructured, undervalued, and scarce. Resolving \nthis inequity will require solutions through the public and private \nsector.\n  I proposed legislation to encourage the private sector to invest in \nchild care for their employees through a new tax credit. I intend to \nwork with Senator Hatch who is the primary cosponsor of my bill to see \nto it that this important child care incentive is included in the \noverall tax provisions of the budget.\n  The amendment before us now would give us the opportunity under this \nbudget to enhance innovative early childhood programs focused on the \neducational needs of children in the zero to 3 age group. This \ninitiative does not earmark a specific amount of money. It does not \ncreate any new bureaucracy and it does not threaten this budget. So, \nMr. President, a solid and sensible commitment to early childhood \neducation specifically focused on children from zero to age 3 is long \noverdue. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am particularly grateful to the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin for his support because as a supporter of the budget--\nand he has long been an advocate of balancing the budget and reducing \nthe deficit--he has taken some tough votes in the Senate in an effort \nto do that, sometimes separating himself from colleagues on this side \nof the fence, but he is supportive of this amendment.\n  My hope is that colleagues on the other side of the aisle will not \nsee this amendment as a threat but, rather, see it as an opportunity \nfor us to simply reserve the possibility that as we go into the process \nof reconciliation we may find that revenue expectations are better or \nthat we are in a better position to take money from some other program \nthat people have thought differently about and invest some of it in \nearly childhood development and education.\n  I have been working to try to develop a way to do that with Senator \nCoats from Indiana, Senator McCain, Senator Bond, and Senator DeWine. \nWe have not yet resolved exactly the methodology by which we would want \nto do it, but I think it would be a mistake were the Senate to preclude \nthe opportunity, to have potential points of order and all kinds of \nparliamentary gobbledygook restrain us from coming back to this if \nSenators on both sides of the aisle can find a good means of coming \ntogether on this. I think there are enough people on both sides of the \naisle who recognize why this is important and why we ought to do it, \nbut my principal objection to this current budget that is in front of \nus is the absence of a sufficient commitment to our children.\n  We hear an enormous amount of talk in and out of the Senate, all \naround the country, properly so, about the implosion of family, about \nthe absence of family values, the absence of community in many cases in \nour life.\n  If you look at the statistics with respect to the increase of \njuvenile violence and you look at the statistics with respect to the \ncondition of some of our education system and schools, if you look at \nthe absence of after-school programs, the absence of sufficient drug \ntreatment and other problems, it is clear that in many ways what we are \ndoing is running a national farm system for the trouble spots. We are \nrunning a national farm system for young people to move up the ladder \nof difficulty, ultimately to become $50,000- or $80,000-a-year wards of \nthe State.\n\n[[Page S4953]]\n\n  Now, that is not an exaggeration. That is a reality that is \ndocumented by facts, implacable facts that none of us can deny. The \ntruth is that since 1969, the gross domestic product of the United \nStates has doubled, but in that same span of time child poverty has \nincreased in the United States of America by 50 percent. As I stand \nhere today in this Chamber, all of us know that there is a huge problem \nin America with births out of wedlock. Some people may say all right, \nwhat does that have to do with this budget and where we are heading?\n  We are living in an age where 33 percent of all the children in \nAmerica are born out of wedlock. One-third of America's children are \nborn into a single parenting situation. And in a world where 60 percent \nof the mothers of children from 6 on down are at work in the workplace, \nwe have got to stop and think about what is the availability of \nsurrogate parenting, of care for those children when they are away. \nWhat you know is that if 33 percent of your children are being born out \nof wedlock without even measuring the difficulty that many two-parent \nfamilies have, you know that the vast majority of that one-third are \nborn into a state of crisis, a very difficult structure for parents to \nadequately be able to teach and adequately be able to instill those \nchildren with the values we talk about.\n  Now, some people may say, well, that is going to happen \nautomatically. The fact is it does not happen automatically. I just \nshare with you the results of that.\n  In our country, while the stock market is at the rate of 7,290 or so \npoints, while chief executives of our corporations are earning a record \n200-plus times the average worker, while we have a record level of \nemployment and a record level of control of inflation at least for some \n30 years, we find that an American child drops out of school every 8 \nseconds; an American child is reported neglected or abused every 10 \nseconds, is arrested every 15 seconds, is born with a low birthweight \nevery 2 minutes, born into poverty every 34 seconds, is killed by \ngunfire--an American child is killed by gunfire every hour and a half \nand commits suicide every 4 hours.\n  The costs to our society of these children who are being raised \nwithout adequate supervision, without adequate input, are simply \nenormous. Business Week estimated, in a study that it released \nrecently, that we are spending $425 billion a year annually on crime in \nthe United States. The total annual economic cost to society of drug \nabuse is $67 billion. So we are just losing $67 billion out the door as \nthe cost of people who wind up being part of the drug culture, largely \nas a consequence of their lack of capacity to make a better choice.\n  We have learned a lot in the last years. I used to be a prosecutor \nand I spent a lot of time, and I still spend a lot of time, talking to \nyoung kids, 14 and 15 years old, or 16 years old, who are in trouble. \nAlmost every kid I have ever talked to, once they finally get into some \nkind of mentoring program, once they finally have some kind of adult \nsupervision in their lives, has said to me: Senator, this is the first \ntime in my life that somebody has provided a structure for me. This is \nthe first time in my life that somebody has told me I am valuable. This \nis the first time in my life somebody said I can be somebody, I can do \nsomething. It is the first time in my life I had to get up in the \nmorning and do chores and be responsible for myself.\n  Inevitably, anybody of good sense is going to stand back from that \nand say, wait a minute, why are we waiting until they are 15 or 16 \nyears old for kids to be able to say this is the first time these \nexperiences, which hopefully most normal kids get all through their \nlives, are experienced?\n  I have sat with my friends on the other side of the aisle and we talk \nabout this. We talk about, what do you do if 33 percent of your kids \nare born into a situation where it is almost predictable that they are \ngoing to have trouble? I respectfully suggest it is not enough to \nsimply say, oh, it's individual responsibility. Oh, it's up to the \nparents. Because, obviously, these are situations where the parents \nhave already failed and where there is no individual capacity to make a \ndifference.\n  The question for all of us here is, who is going to make a \ndifference? Or, are we going to be so blind, and even sometimes so \nstupid, that all we are going to do is wait until they come down that \ntrack, get into trouble, and we are finally going to make great \nspeeches and say, throw the book at them, send them away.\n  We have learned a lot in the last years about the science of brain \ndevelopment and of children. It is not altogether new to all of us, \nbecause the fact is that pediatricians and people of good sense, child \npsychologists and others, have been telling us a lot of this for a long \nperiod of time. But what we now know scientifically is that the brain \nof a baby develops almost fully in the first 3 years--almost fully. The \nbrain of a child, when it is born, has about 100 billion neurons in it \nand those neurons are rushing around, making the connections that \nempower that brain to be able ultimately to create the capacity to \nrelate to people, to do certain tasks, to learn.\n  Mr. President, this is a CAT scan of two brains. These brains were \noriginally shown to doctors and the doctors were asked, ``What do you \nsee there?'' The doctors said, ``Well, those are the two brains; one is \nan adult's brain fully developed, and the other is the brain of an \nadult with Alzheimer's disease.''\n  They were wrong. These are both the CAT scans of 3-year-old brains, \nboth of them. One is the 3-year-old brain fully developed, with the \narea of red, yellow and green which represents the full development of \nthat brain. Here in the dark areas of this brain there is nothing. It \nis blank. The scientists now tell us that the brain of a 3-year-old, \nproperly stimulated so those neurons properly make connections, will be \n25- to 30-percent larger than the brain of a child that does not \nreceive that kind of stimulation.\n  I want to read to you what that is all about. This is from \n``Nightline.'' Ted Koppel did an interview with the doctors who were \ninvolved in this. I want to share with you what Dr. Stanley Greenspan \nat George Washington University says. He said:\n\n       Well, what we've learned is that a lot of commonsense makes \n     common sense, but we've added a few little twists onto \n     common sense. For example, we've identified the six kinds \n     of experiences in the early years that will help promote \n     not just our intelligence, but our morality and our sense \n     of self. It starts with a baby learning to pay attention. \n     We figured out that babies attend differently. Some babies \n     like high pitched sounds, some low pitched sounds, some \n     bright lights, some dull lights. So now we can cater the \n     experiences to the baby's senses.\n       We've also learned that babies fall in love, the second \n     step, differently. Some babies need to be wooed. We need to \n     pull them in. We need to smile a lot. Other babies reach \n     right out and charm us.\n       The third step in the building of our intelligence and our \n     morality and sense of self, learning to be logical. By eight \n     months, babies are capable of give and take games with smiles \n     and smirks and head nods and back and forth, but some babies \n     we need to woo into these interactions.\n\n  He goes on to say that, later on, at toddler stage, babies learn to \nbe problem solvers and that one can develop the intelligence much \nfurther by encouraging that child in that problem solving, and so \nforth.\n  Unfortunately, when so many of our children are born into this state \nof crisis, when so many of our children are even the sons and daughters \nof children, of 15- and 16- and 17-year-olds, they do not have a clue \nabout these interactions. They don't understand what parenting is at \nthat stage.\n  And if we are not going to inherit a significant number of those \nchildren as children with learning disabilities, children with health \nproblems, children with sociopathic problems, with the inability to \nadjust, the inability to relate--then somehow, if we are going to come \nback from this precipice, I respectfully suggest to my colleagues we \nneed intervention in the place of that incapacitated parent. In the \nabsence of the parent, who is going to provide the structure for that \nchild to have the values that all of us want that child to have?\n  I am not here to suggest it should be the Government. I don't want \nthe Government to do it. We've learned a lot about the downside of \nthat. I am not here to suggest that it ought to be another big Federal \nprogram. We've learned a lot about that. I am here to suggest that we \nhave to create a new model, a new way to think about this.\n  I think Senator Coats and Congressman Kasich and some others have\n\n[[Page S4954]]\n\nthought about that a lot. But I do not happen to agree with their \nmethodology of how they get the resources for it. I do agree with the \nnotion that there are thousands of efforts out there in this country, \nBoys Clubs, Girls Clubs, YWCA, YMCA, the Youth Build, the ABC mentor \nprograms, Success by Six, Smart Start--North Carolina, by Governor \nHunt--a host of efforts that are proving their capacity to provide \ngrassroots, local, home-grown efforts that make a difference in the \nlives of these children.\n  But every single one of them is drowning in the demand, and there \nisn't a sufficient supply. I was in an early infant toddler care center \nin Boston the other day, the Castle Square Child Development Center. \nThere are about 67 children in there, early infant toddlers, getting \nthis kind of input. But for the 67 that are in there, there are 400 on \nthe waiting list. And those 400 will never cross the threshold of that \nplace because they will be 6 years old before there is room for them.\n  What I am respectfully suggesting is that there is an ability for us \nto reduce these costs that we are spending on drug abuse, on \nimprisonment, on the violence in our streets, on the back end, and \nrescue a whole generation from this problem of lack of sufficient input \nat the early stage, if we would think about how to empower those local \nentities directly; not with big Federal bureaucracy, but directly.\n  Mr. President, in the last 10 years, we have taken our prison \npopulation in America from about 450,000 to 1.5 million. So we are \nfilling up our prisons, and we are building more prisons. There has \nbeen, I think it is, a 248-percent increase in prison spending in the \nlast few years. I want to show you the spending on children, because it \nis absolutely inverse.\n  This blue line represents the line of brain development. It goes up, \nobviously, dramatically in the first 3 years. It grows a little bit as \nyou go on from there, and when you reach about 14 years old, it \nflattens out, regrettably, and then for all of us who are getting \nolder, at the back end, it starts to tail down.\n  Mr. President, a 15-year-old's brain versus the brain of a child, a \nbaby, the brain of the baby is growing 1,000 times faster than the 15-\nyear-old. The brain of a baby is growing 10,000 times faster than the \nbrain of a 50-year-old.\n  Here is the line of expenditure of the United States. We are spending \nexactly inversely to the most important years of brain development. We \nspend the most money at the very tail end; we spend the least amount of \nmoney up front.\n  I want to underscore what we are trying to do here. This is not \ncoming to the floor with a specific program. It is not coming to the \nfloor saying money will go to early Head Start or money will go to the \ncharitable institutions I talked about, although I would like to see \nthat happen. We are merely trying to reserve the capacity to be able to \nagree in the course of the next months that we will do something to \naddress this vital issue. I am confident that we will be able to find a \nbipartisan place to begin in order to be able to focus on what really \nworks.\n  I would like to see us at least have some pilot projects that invest \nin the capacity to put some leverage directly into those charitable \ninstitutions so we can see the grassroots do a better job at the local \nlevel of being able to reach out and intervene. It is my hope that \ncolleagues will recognize the wisdom of at least reserving a place in \nline so that we can argue about this at a later time.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer and I \nthank the Senator from Massachusetts. I was listening to his speech. It \nwas very interesting.\n  Mr. President, I should say at the beginning, I am an original \ncosponsor, of Senator Kerry's bill, and proud to be the second on a \ndistinguished list. I think there is a tendency in this body, when we \ndo something for children--let's say we do a tax credit or we do \nsomething in Head Start or where we do something in health care--to say \nthat we made a dent and we can go on the next issue in the next year. I \nthink of all the areas of life that we deal with in the Senate, that is \nthe most inaccurate assessment and approach. When it comes to what our \nchildren need to prepare for their futures and what they are going to \nbe like as adults, we need to follow through. And we must begin in the \nearliest years.\n  I spent a number of years in Japan. In Japan, when a baby is born, \nand while the baby is growing to a certain age, they do not have cribs. \nThey do not have cribs, because in Japan the baby sleeps between the \nmother and the father. Why is that so? That is so because they, as a \nmatter of culture and history and instinct, know that bonding has to \nstart at the beginning. That is about the clearest form of bonding that \nthere can be.\n  But even before that, there is a Japanese word called taikeo, in \nwhich the pregnant mother talks to--and this is standard in Japan--they \ntalk to the baby in the womb on a regular basis. That would make a \nfairly strange sight, I guess, walking down the streets of Washington, \nDC, or West Virginia. But the Japanese understand something that \nSenator Kerry showed with his graphics there about the two brains, that \nwe clearly don't. They understand when you are looking at the raising \nof children and their future, you have to take a holistic approach. You \nhave to start with early childhood development. You have to follow \nthrough, and keep providing the support, education and development \nsupport. And you must keep at it. That is both enormously frustrating, \nbut, in a nation which purports to care about its children, it is \nabsolutely essential that we understand that helping children and \nstrengthening families is an unending job. The work on behalf of \nchildren is never finished, no matter how much we do. In the private \nsector, as individual parents, it is not good enough. No matter what we \ndo in the public sector, there will be more that could and should be \ndone if we are serious about the real definition of children's future--\nand we must be for their sake, and the sake of our society.\n  I spent, as I have said before, as this Senator said before on this \nfloor, 4 years as the chairman of the National Commission on Children. \nWe took a comprehensive look at children's needs--income security, \nhealth care, education, values, and the effects of media. We did \neverything, and we came out of it with a unanimous report. I picked the \nname for the publication that we put out. I liked it. It was called \nBeyond Rhetoric. That is what we have to come to terms with in this \nbody, that we are very good at the rhetoric. In fact, on children--our \nrhetoric tends to be more bipartisan than other subjects which is good. \nAnd we actually do some good things, insofar as the public has any role \nin that, as apart from parental responsibility and even children's \nresponsibility to themselves.\n  But we are in a huge new world of responsibilities as parents, which \nI am as a private citizen and concerned father. I am also public \ncitizen and a Member of the Senate. I have obligations to children as \nboth a private citizen and member of my community, and as a public \nofficial as well. We are just not going to get off easily if we accept \nthe challenge to move beyond rhetoric and really do something for \nchildren.\n  So I think on this floor, we are going to have to start thinking \nabout those graphs, about those two brains. They are studies of \ncontrasts--both kids' brains, one kid getting attention, one kid not \ngetting attention. What a difference it makes.\n  I will say another final thing. We do not purport or believe that we \nare doing everything for the future now with this amendment. What we \nare trying to do here is a reserve clause to capture the attention of \nthe people. An argument that gets used here often, but not very \neffectively, is extremely compelling in this case--we need to take \naction because of the children, but we also need to act to save money \nfor the taxpayers in the future.\n  We hear that a lot. People discount it. They say, ``That's nice that \nfor Head Start, you save $10 for every dollar you put in now.'' But, we \nhave to spend the money now, to save the long-term costs of neglecting \nour children's early development. That is what our problem is. We are \nin a budget resolution here.\n  But in the case of children, we are talking about spending billions \nand billions of dollars more on crime and remedial education, if we do \nnot do the right thing in the early years for children.\n  Senator Kerry has focused on the zero-through-6 period. He is doing \nthat\n\n[[Page S4955]]\n\nwith an intensity, with a passion which is absolutely unmatched and \nwhich attracted me. I tend to be a Member who votes against amendments \non this floor to protect the integrity of this budget deal, which I \nthink we have to adopt. But I feel so strongly that he is on the right \ntrack and he is doing the right thing and that I support the Kerry \namendment. We have to learn to discipline ourselves to exempt children \nfrom the way we ordinarily look at problems: Pass legislation, get the \nprivate sector to do something, and then go on to the next thing. \nChildren, their problems, their growth, their development are vital and \nwith us forever. The time to start thinking about children and their \nfutures is right now.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am particularly grateful to the Senator \nfrom West Virginia. His work as the head of the National Commission on \nChildren was absolutely extraordinary. It was way ahead of its time. I \nam very honored to have him working as part of this effort.\n  I just say to him that the example about Japan that he raised, that \nin 1965, when Pat Moynihan first talked about 27 percent then known as \nillegitimacy in America, the rate of illegitimacy in Japan was 1 \npercent. It is now 33 percent overall in America; that is up from 27 \npercent. He was referencing only African-Americans. It is now 69 \npercent among African-Americans in America; 49 percent among the \nHispanics; and 27 percent among the whites. It is still 1 percent in \nJapan--1 percent.\n  What is interesting is the Japanese have an adage that the Senator is \nobviously familiar with. They say that the soul of a 3-year-old will be \nwith you for 100 years. They have been way ahead of us; they have \nunderstood that. I am particularly grateful to Senator Rockefeller for \nhis participation and effort in this.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to speak on a topic which \nsignificantly affects every citizen in America. An issue that has \nconsequences for every child and parent, and tremendous bearing on our \nNation's economic status and welfare--early childhood development.\n  Recent research has proven that an infant's brain initially holds \napproximately 100 billion neurons. However, without the proper care, \nnurturing, love, stimulation, and involvement of adults--which most of \nus were lucky enough to receive--these neurons will not make \nconnections essential for healthy development. The amount of brain \ndevelopment which occurs between the ages of zero and 3 has enormous \nconsequences later in a child's life. Children who are rarely touched \ndevelop brains 20 to 30 percent smaller than normal for their age. The \n2-year-old girl whose mother is too preoccupied with her job to provide \nthe proper care will not be as likely to develop to her potential. This \nchild might feel deprived and angry. The good news is that if parents \nare given up-to-date information on how to promote brain development, \nthey will be able to raise healthy children. The result will be more \nproductive young adults.\n  Clearly, we must do something as a nation to provide help when help \nis needed. The most practical, ethical, and cost-effective way to solve \nsuch problems as a nation is to increase funding for early childhood \ndevelopment.\n  Mr. President, a person's brain develops the most rapidly between the \nages of zero and 3, by 350 percent. Ironically, we spend the least \namount of Federal money on children during this period, only 20 percent \nof the public expenditures from which they will benefit prior to \nadulthood. Between the ages of 3 and 18, however, while the brain \ndevelops by another 50 percent, public spending on children increases \nby 800 percent. We need to change this discrepancy. Parents need more \nand better information about how to best care for their infants. They \nneed the tools to provide this care most easily.\n  With greater attention to early childhood development, we will spend \nless money on children later in their lives. National studies have \nfound increased violence and crime among youth when they do not receive \nadequate developmental care as young children. Furthermore, greater \nattention to early childhood development will help children avoid \nfalling through the cracks. It will help them succeed. They will make \nimportant contributions to our country--instead of possibly ending up \nin jail, institutions, or on welfare. The Early Childhood Development \nAct makes investments now that will benefit our society later by saving \nmoney, keeping us competitive, and preventing needless suffering.\n  I personally know that this is a worthwhile investment. As a \npreschool teacher 15 years ago, I saw children in need of nurturing. \nFor some children, I was their only source of such care. I knew that my \nassistance was helping these 2- and 3-year-olds to lead productive \nadult lives. As a parent educator, I had information to give parents \nthe tools they needed to provide the best possible environment for \ntheir children. All parents have something to gain from learning these \nskills--we just need to make the tools available to everybody.\n\n  Senator Kerry's early childhood development amendment puts us on the \nroad toward this goal. The amendment gives grants to States to \nestablish State Early Learning Coordinating Boards. These boards give \ngrant funds to community projects for child care improvement, including \nparent education and involvement in schools. The amendment establishes \nforgiveable loans for child care workers, who earn a degree in early \nchildhood development and agree to work in early childhood development \nfor 2 years. This will not only increase general awareness for early \nchild care, but it will empower individuals to access quality care. \nThis amendment also expands currently successful programs. The Family \nand Medical Leave Act is expanded to grant parents time to become \ninvolved with school. Early Head Start will also have increased \nfunding, which will improve health and nutrition services for low-\nincome infants and toddlers. In addition, this amendment will fully \nfund WIC, ensuring that every mother has adequate nutrition--and a \nhealthy baby. This will save taxpayers tremendous amounts of money in \nhealth care expenditures avoided.\n  A child learns more from its experiences in the first 3 years of life \nthan at any other time, and the dollars we invest in early childhood \nnow save billions later in welfare, emergency room, and court costs. I \nhave seen a tremendous amount of commitment to children, by many caring \nadults, in my own experiences teaching preschool. But in order to make \na real difference, we need a widespread sense of commitment to improve \nearly childhood development services everywhere. We need a national \nstrategy for informing parents, so they can send their children to the \nright child care providers, and take an active role in their \ndevelopment.\n  This amendment is a catalyst for all of these desperately-needed \nimprovements. As policymakers, we must encourage and allow America's \nchildren to grow into healthy adults. We need to positively influence \nthe lives of young people right now. Let us change the message we are \nsending to children, by investing in their futures.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be charged equally off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment \nbe temporarily set aside and that the time remain as it is on both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S4956]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 331\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 331.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 331.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record of May 21, 1997.)\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple, and I will \nnot belabor the Senate's time. It will just take me 4 or 5 minutes to \nexplain it.\n  I have two amendments, incidentally, 331 and 332. I hope we can \ndispose of both of them right now.\n  Under this budget agreement, we assume $135 billion in tax cuts over \nthe first 5 years of this budget. And of that $135 billion, $115 \nbillion is in Medicare cuts.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished floor manager.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to Senator Bumpers, I \ninadvertently made a mistake. Our understanding was that we would just \nconsider a Democratic amendment, and Senator Specter from the \nRepublican side was entitled to make the next amendment, and then \nSenator Bumpers was next. I think we knew that. It has been very \ndifficult. Senator Specter has waited around a long time. I wonder if \nyou would consider----\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Certainly I will accommodate the Senator any way I can.\n  Is Senator Specter here ready to go?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will send out word that if Senator Specter is ready, \nhe should come down.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I hope to dispose of mine before he even gets here.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Maybe we can do that.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I will proceed. If he comes, I will lay my amendment \naside.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. So anyway, Mr. President, the budget resolution calls \nfor a $115 billion cut in Medicare, ostensibly to provide some solvency \nin the Medicare trust fund.\n  The Finance Committee, in my opinion--in my opinion, we should not go \nforward with this budget and allow the people in this country who \ndepend on Medicare for their very lives, we should not allow them to \nbelieve, as they have a perfect right to believe, that we are cutting \n$115 billion out of Medicare and, make no mistake about it, they will \nsuffer.\n  We say we are going to take it out of providers', hospitals', and \ndoctors' hides. They are going to take it out of the patients' hides \nand the patients are going to get fewer services.\n\n  So I do not want to go home and face my constituents and have them \nsay, ``You cut $115 billion out of Medicare, and that's all laudable as \nlong as it goes into the trust fund to make the thing more solvent. But \ndid you do that, did you put this on the deficit?'' ``No.'' ``Did you \nput it on child health care?'' ``No.'' ``Did you put it into \neducation?'' ``No.'' ``What did you do with it?'' ``We gave it to the \nwealthiest people in America in tax cuts.''\n  That is the accusation that every Senator should be prepared to face \nup to when he goes home this fall and in the election year next year.\n  So what I am saying is, it is a laudable thing to try to make the \nMedicare trust fund solvent, but what we are doing here is using that \n$115 billion to provide $135 billion in tax cuts. We say, ``Well, we're \ngoing to make up $50 billion of that; the net tax cuts will only be $85 \nbillion.'' What I am saying in my amendment is we require the Finance \nCommittee to come up with a total of $115 billion in offsets to offset \nwhat we are cutting Social Security by. Otherwise, we stand fairly \naccused of using Medicare funds to cut taxes for the wealthiest people \nin America.\n  Look at this chart. Here is the Medicare savings--$115 billion. That \nis the cut in Medicare. What we are going to do is we are going to use \nthat as an offset to accommodate $135 billion in tax cuts. That is \nundeniable, unarguable, unassailable. We are using $115 billion of \nMedicare cuts to provide tax cuts.\n  So what I am saying is, let us instruct the Finance Committee not \njust to put the airline ticket tax in at $32 billion over the next 5 \nyears, but come up with enough additional offsets to offset the entire \n$115 billion in Medicare savings. That is not hard to understand, Mr. \nPresident. I hope my colleagues will support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. If nobody wishes to debate that amendment further, I \nwould like to call up amendment No. 330. I do not want to do this while \nthe chairman's attention is diverted.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am sorry, I say to the Senator.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I say to Senator Domenici, I will follow up with my \nother amendment and debate it right now unless you wish to speak on the \none I just offered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator wants to offer another one?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does the Senator reserve any time on the one he \noffered?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I will be happy to have 10 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. On this one?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I am finished on this one.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You must have great confidence in it.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I am hoping we can get back home and tell people how \ngreat it is.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. When Senator Specter comes, we will call on him.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we further set aside both the Kerry \namendment and the Bumpers amendment No. 331 while Senator Bumpers \noffers his second amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 330\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 330.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record of May 21, 1997.)\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, my second amendment is one I feel \nstrongly about--both of these--but I want you to listen to this.\n  It would delay the tax cuts that are provided in this budget \nresolution. We are going to face all of this later on in the \nreconciliation bill. I know that. But what we ought to do is delay the \ntax cuts until the year 2002. All I do in this amendment is I strike \nthe first $63.3 billion of tax cuts over the years 1998 to 2001.\n  You know what that does, Mr. President? It does not balance the \nbudget in the year 2002. It balances the budget in the year 2001. Now, \nwhy would we not, after reading the paper this morning and seeing that \nthe Treasury Department reaped a gold mine in April--the surplus in \nApril of income versus expenditures was $97 billion.\n  CBO has now said that the deficit could be as low as $65 billion come \nSeptember 30. That is a remarkable achievement.\n  On this floor in August 1993, we passed a bill called the Omnibus \nBudget Reconciliation Act of 1993. I regret, Mr. President, not one \nsingle Republican voted for it. You know what the effect of that was? I \ntold the President as far as I am concerned that is going to be his \nlegacy. All these other things he is trying to accomplish, they are all \nlaudable. I have no quarrel with them. But 5 solid straight years of \nreal budget deficit reduction is going to be his legacy.\n  But I will tell you how that legacy can be destroyed. That is to \nproceed with a budget that we have right here which cuts taxes by $135 \nbillion for the wealthiest people in America, and revenues go down \nevery single year--every single year. If we were to postpone these tax \ncuts until the year 2002, we could balance the budget in the year 2001.\n  Let me tell you something else. If we do not strike while the iron is \nhot, we are going to regret it. I promise you, the assumptions in this \nbill that our economy is going to be as hot as these assumptions say it \nwill be over the next 5 years is a very dicey situation. We have \nalready had an unbelievable prosperity for the past 6 years. Nothing \nlooks like it since Eisenhower was President. To assume it is going to \ncontinue another 5 years is the height of folly. You cannot depend on \nthis budget to balance anything unless you agree with those economic \nassumptions, and I do not.\n\n[[Page S4957]]\n\n  I have spent 22 years in the Senate standing in this aisle, screaming \nmy head off about budget deficits. In 1981, when Ronald Reagan was \nriding the crest the likes of which has never been seen since Franklin \nRoosevelt, the herd instinct swept through this body and all my \nscreaming was for naught. It did not do a bit of good.\n  I said--and I will send anybody a copy of the speech that would like \nto see it--you pass this budget and you are going to create deficits \nbig enough to choke a mule. You cannot cut taxes, increase defense \nspending and balance the budget any more than you can lose weight on \nfive chocolate sundaes a day. That is the five-chocolate-sundaes-a-day \ndiet. And that is exactly what we are coming back to.\n\n  What does it take to educate this body? If you do not learn from past \nexperiences, what are you going to learn from? When Ronald Reagan left \noffice 8 years later, the national debt--which at that time was $1 \ntrillion and took 200 years to get to $1 trillion--when he left, all \nhis 8 years later, it was $3 trillion. He had tripled the national debt \nbecause of the folly, the political folly, the political herd instinct \nthat swept across this body in 1981.\n  I am proud to tell you, Mr. President--a little self-serving--I did \nnot vote for it. There are only 11 Senators who voted against the tax \ncuts. There were only three Senators who voted against the tax cuts and \nfor the spending cuts. We could have balanced the budget by 1985 easily \nif everybody had voted the way those three Senators voted.\n  So here we are, back at the same old stand: It did not work before, \nbut it'll sure work this time. We will cut taxes, are going to cut \ntaxes, going to increase spending, and bring you a balanced budget.\n  While the deficit goes from $67 billion anticipated this fall, the \nfifth straight year, from $290 billion in 1992--$290 billion--to $67 \nbillion this year, 5 straight years of deficit reduction, what does \nthis budget do? Why, it takes it back up to $97 billion next year and \n$97 billion the following year and $83 billion the following year and \n$50 billion the following year. Then the following year a $1 billion \nsurplus.\n  I have some great land in the Everglades I would like to sell you if \nyou believe that is going to happen.\n  Mr. President, all we have to do is vote very simply to postpone the \ntax cuts. I am not saying do not ever cut taxes. But you are either for \ncutting taxes or for balancing the budget, but you cannot be for both \nand be economically sound in the process.\n  So I am asking my colleagues to say, postpone the tax cuts until the \nyear 2001 and balance the budget at the soonest possible date. Then you \ncan argue all the other economic nonsense. But our first priority is to \nbalance the budget. You are not going to do it with this budget. If you \nassume that the economy is going to stay like it is right now for the \nnext 5 years--I do not know whether I will be here or not. I would just \nlike to be around at the end of 5 years so I can say, I told you so. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to Senator Bumpers, I wonder if we could ask how \nmuch time the Senator used, and I would use the same amount of time, \nand then there would be no more time used.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I will be happy to reserve 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Two minutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Of additional time.\n  If I may, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add the Senator \nfrom Virginia [Mr. Robb], as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, while I am having a great deal of \ndifficulty discerning the difference between the two amendments, let me \ntell the Senate what I believe the sum total of the two amendments are.\n  The distinguished Senator from the State of Arkansas does not believe \nin tax cuts. It is just that simple. When you go to work on a budget, \nyou ask the American people to let you reform some programs that are \nout of control, and you save some money.\n  When you ask the American people to let you reduce spending in some \nother areas, or at least keep it intact, when you do that, you come up \nwith a surplus, and you say, we want to give that back to the American \npeople. You know that is a tax cut.\n  We do not have any other way to give back to the American people what \nis theirs. We give the American people a lot of programs. But when you \nreduce taxes, you are giving them back what is theirs. They already \nearned it.\n  No matter how you cut it, both of these amendments--one says in this \nbudget resolution you are permanently prohibited from giving any tax \ncuts. That is plain and simple. That is one of them. Now maybe my \nfriend will explain it with relation to other things, but that is, \nplain and simple, what it is.\n\n  What we have done in the overall budget, we have restrained \nGovernment such that there is sufficient funding to give the American \npeople a modest tax cut, a net of $85 billion out of a tax take in the \ntrillions. It is not like we are giving them a huge tax cut. Well, let \nus give them something. Balance the budget and give them some kind of \nbalance. What is the use of having a balanced budget if there is \nnothing in it for the people?\n  We are trying to get the economy running better, and to do that we \nwant to get a balanced budget and to make sure the American people feel \nbetter about their day's work and their taking a chance on investing. \nYou want to give them some back. To those mothers and fathers raising \nkids under 18 years of age, we would like to say to them, we understand \nyour problem and we have enough savings in this budget we will give you \na tax break. It is not pie in the sky.\n  The economic assumptions, and I know we are not supposed to talk \nabout technicalities, but the distinguished Senator said he would not \nrely on any of these assumptions. Mr. President, let me tell you, there \nare literally thousands of American businesses who do economic \nplanning, thousands of them, and the biggest of them in America rely on \nmore generous economic assumptions than are in this budget resolution. \nThe Office of Management and Budget has more generous economic \nassumptions. We have the most conservative set of economic assumptions \nyou will find from any major institution or business in America. We did \nthat because that is a way of saying if you should have a downturn, if \nyou should have a downturn you have taken that into consideration by \nusing very, very conservative economic assumptions. Nobody does it any \ndifferently. Nobody comes along and says, well, let's write a 5-year \nbudget and in the third year, let's have a recession and plug it in. \nFirst, nobody wants to do that because they are frightened to death of \nsuch a concept, but what economists do is build in low economic \nassumptions. That is what we did.\n  Frankly, I do not want to be on the side that says there is no room \nin the Federal budget to balance it and give the American taxpayers a \nbreak. I believe there is. In fact, I believe, absent some untoward \nhappening, something untoward happening, I believe we will be balanced \nahead of 2002 because I believe the economic assumptions are so low \nthat we will do better for at least 2 out of the next 4 years than are \nestimated here. I did not choose to put that in. I choose to use \nmodest, conservative economic assumptions.\n  Now, the Bumpers amendment that tries to allude to Medicare has \nnothing to do with Medicare. The President of the United States joined \nwith Democrats and Republicans and said to the senior citizens of \nAmerica, we want to do something for you in this budget that is \npositive and good. Lo and behold, what we have done is make the \nMedicare trust fund solvent for 10 years. That is not bad. It is \nbankrupt in about 3 years if we do not do that. That is No. 1 on the \npositive side, we made it solvent for 10 years. We told the providers \nin America that they will get paid differently, and for the most part \npaid less. We told the Medicare people that run the program, give the \nseniors all kinds of options because there are options to get better \nservice at cheaper rates. We also moved part of home health care out of \nthe trust fund and said we will take care of it under a more generous \nprogram, all of which contributes to the senior citizens of America in \na very mighty way.\n\n[[Page S4958]]\n\n  Now nobody can kid anybody anymore. The tax cuts have nothing to do \nwith that. Let me tell you, you wipe out the tax cuts--let's just do \nthat. We will think it out here, take out the tax cuts. But also if you \nthink through Senator Bumpers's proposal--maybe we ought to wipe out \nall those reform measures that save money for the Medicare fund, or \nwhat I am saying in another way is that all of the savings for the \nMedicare goes back to Medicare. All of the savings for Medicare go back \nto Medicare. They do not go to taxpayers, they go back to making that \nprogram solvent. That is pretty logical, it seems to me, when you have \ndone that, and balanced the budget and found room for a tax break.\n  We relish the idea of voting on these two amendments today. We \nRepublicans want to vote on them. We hope a lot of people vote against \nit, but not a single Republican should. I hope they do not. Because \nwhat we are saying is, the modest tax cut in this budget resolution \nought to be carried out, and it ought to be carried out in a manner \nprescribed in this budget resolution.\n  If I have additional time on the amendment, I reserve it but I do not \nthink I will speak more than 1 minute on either of the two amendments. \nIf Senator Bumpers wants to use 2 minutes, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I remember a great lesson when I was a boy about Joseph \nhaving a dream. Everybody in this body knows the rest of the story. \nJoseph dreamed there was going to be 7 years of plenty and 7 years of \nstarvation. So he told the King of Egypt, if you want to survive, you \nbetter start saving everything you can the first 7 years.\n\n  I want to relay that to every Senator in the U.S. Senate. I am \ntelling you, if you have the 5 years, if you have the 5 years you are \ntalking about here, do not assume that the deficit will continue to go \ndown and we will start paying on the national debt, because we have \nnever had prosperity for that length of time.\n  I give you Joseph's admonition: Strike while the iron is hot and \nwhile the economy is hot.\n  The Senator from New Mexico said I do not believe in tax cuts. I do \nnot believe in using Medicare for tax cuts from the most vulnerable \npeople in America, our elderly, who go to bed petrified every night \nfearing what their medical bills might be. I do not believe in using \nMedicare and I do not believe in tax cuts at the expense of balancing \nthe budget.\n  Every poll I have seen has shown overwhelmingly that people will take \na balanced budget to tax cuts, and that is the option. As far as my \nliking taxes or not liking taxes, the present small business exemption \nfor people who invest in small businesses, which the President endorsed \nin 1993, was mine. I am the author of it, trying to help small \nbusiness.\n  Right now, I have a bill up here in case we cut capital gains, and we \nare going to, to 19.8 percent--I reduced the capital gains on small \nbusiness investments to half that, 9.8 percent.\n  Mr. President, I used to have a little dachshund, a female dachshund. \nBetty and I worshipped that little dog, but we had a problem. We could \nnot train her, could not train her to go outside. The only perfect \nanalogy to that is the U.S. Senate. We cannot seem to train the U.S. \nSenate that you cannot cut taxes and balance the budget. I do not care \nhow many times we do it. We did it in 1981 and paid a disastrous price, \nand we are about to do it again, and we will probably pay another \ndisastrous price. We cannot resist the siren song of tax cuts. \nPolitically, it is wonderful to go home and say, ``Oh, yes, oh yes, I \nvoted to cut your taxes, you bet.''\n  ``How did you do it?''\n  And then you start obfuscating and trying to confuse the issue. You \ndo not want to tell them you did it at the expense of a balanced \nbudget.\n  Mr. President, this amendment makes eminent good sense and there is \nnot a Senator in the U.S. Senate--I take that back, there might be a \nfew --who does not know that what I am talking about is pure common \nsense. It makes common sense in your life. It makes economic sense for \nthe Nation to save up and to balance the budget, something the people \nin this country have been yearning for as long as anybody can remember.\n  I have not announced whether I will run again or not. I do not mind \ntelling you that two things that sort of make me want to be around here \nthe next few years are that I would like to be here after investing 22 \nyears in trying to balance the budget. I would like to be here when it \nhappens. And the other thing I would like to be here for is when we \nchange the way we finance campaigns. Why in the name of all that is \ngood and holy we continue to cherish this absolutely outrageous system \nfor raising money for campaigns, when every time you take a vote they \nrush and see whether somebody gave you money last year or the last time \nyou ran, and how that affected your vote. Why would we not want to get \nrid of a system like that?\n  If anybody believes this great Nation, the greatest democracy on \nEarth, with the oldest Constitution on Earth, can continue to survive \nwhen the people we elect and the laws we pass depend on how much money \nwe put in it, is daydreaming. It cannot last forever. Those are two \nthings that I would give anything in the world to see happen before I \nleave the U.S. Senate.\n  So I plead with my colleagues, I plead with you, vote for common \nsense and vote to postpone these tax cuts and balance the budget in the \nyear 2001. What is sacred about 2002? I have been hearing 2002 for I do \nnot know how long. What is sacred about 2002? If you have a chance to \ndo it in 2001, do it. That is what I am asking you to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Has the time of Senator Bumpers elapsed on the \namendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No formal consent----\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I am prepared to yield. I wish Senator Specter was here \nso we could get something going.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will be going, do not worry. We will be ready \nshortly.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 332 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I have an additional amendment at the desk, I think 332, \nand I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to withdraw that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 332) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The list is down to 70 amendments, I guess. I am just \nkidding.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield to Senator Lautenberg.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 330\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, far be it for me to seek an argument \nwith our distinguished colleague from Arkansas. I cannot argue the \nother side very effectively.\n  Tax cuts at this point in time, I do not think, are the best idea. \nWhat I think are some good ideas are the facts that we will, by virtue \nof this tax cut, we will be saving the middle-class families, those in \nmore modest income circumstance. This will help pay for the insurance \nof your children. If they choose not to go to a 4-year college there is \na program in here that will give them $1,500 worth of tax relief if \ntheir child wants to go to a 2-year college or a vocational school.\n  I find it hard to disagree totally with my friend from Arkansas. I do \nwant to say this, and this may not be the appropriate defense, but I \nhave to look at it as a member of the Budget Committee and also as a \nmember of the Appropriations Committee as an advance toward something \nthat we want to do. We would like to be able to pay down our deficit, \nand I think that one day in the not-too-distant future, half a dozen \nyears, which is not much in the lifetime of a country, that we will be \nable to start paying down our debt, starting to relieve ourselves of \nthe biggest costs we will soon have in the budget which is the interest \non the debt. That will happen and it happens because there is a \ncompromise that has been fashioned, and as usual, the compromise is a \nconsensus of minds but not a consensus of hearts.\n  I do not really like everything that I am supporting here but there \nare things that I really love that I am supporting. I love the fact we \nwill take care of 5 million children's health needs, and I love the \nfact we are not saying to those that are here legally if some accident \nor sickness befalls you that renders you disabled you will not be \nkicked off the rolls, which was an intent here for some time.\n\n[[Page S4959]]\n\n  There is going to be some relief for the impoverished, up to 150 \npercent, approximately, of the poverty level for any increases in the \npart B premium necessary as a result of the switch from part A to part \nB of home health care. That will help make that part A more solvent. I \nthink that is a worthwhile objective.\n  Meanwhile, we see that the economy is boiling, as you suggested, and \nthat there is some hope that it will continue, and the economic \nassumptions, I think, are relatively conservative. So there is room to \nachieve the objectives that we want to without simply saying that the \ntax cuts are the thing that are driving this. That is not the case. The \ntax cuts are part of it. I do not approve of the tax cuts, either, but \nI voted for this bill because I think it is an essential part of \ngetting our books in balance and working our way out of debt and not \nleaving our children with ever larger debts to pay off.\n  So while I agree with the Senator in principle, the fact of the \nmatter is that I think we have a job to do here that robs us of some of \nthe things we would like to see. I voted against investments in \ntransportation. That was really painful for me. I voted against \nexpanding programs for children. That was painful to me. I do not like \ndoing those things, but I like doing the job here as conscientiously as \nI can, which is to say at some point we want to reduce our debt, we \nwant to reduce our deficits, we want to invest in our society, but we \ndo not want to continue to pay the incredible interest rates that we \nare forced to pay, something around $250 billion a year.\n  It is an outrageous thing for us to have to be subjected to. But we \nare trying to fix it. That is what this is about.\n  I hope that the Senator will try at another opportunity to make the \nadjustments that he is talking about.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we are still on our side expecting \nSenator Specter to arrive. I assume Senator Bumpers will not mind if we \nstack some votes, if we have him present his, and in due course we will \nget to his. Then I will have a chance to discuss further with the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts his pending amendment.\n  I want to close now on this note. I truly wish Senator Bumpers would \nnot have tied Medicare to this tax cut.\n  First of all, Mr. President and fellow senior citizens--I can say \n``fellow senior citizens.'' I just turned 65 a few days ago. But the \ntruth of the matter is we have far more savings from other accounts \nthan the reforms in Medicare to pay for tax cuts. In fact, there are \nalmost three times as many savings in the first 5 years from other \nsources--two times from other sources, and from the reform measures \nthat are part of Medicare.\n  My last remarks are: If you wipe the tax cuts out of here, you still \nhave to do all those things for Medicare to keep it solvent. You have \nto do those kinds of things or raise taxes, which nobody has suggested \nwe do.\n  So, I close by saying I opt for a balanced budget that includes some \ntax relief. I am comfortable and confident we can do both this time. We \nhave done much in moderation in this budget, which has caused some of \nour friends who want to do much more, both in cutting the budget and \ncutting taxes, to opt out of this agreement, not wanting us to pass it. \nBut I think we have had a moderate approach to both sides. I for one \nhope both of these amendments get defeated overwhelmingly to show the \nAmerican people that they deserve a tax break along with this balanced \nbudget.\n  I am prepared now to move on to another amendment.\n  Did Senator Bond want to proceed?\n  Mr. BOND. I am ready.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am not aware that the Senator is next in line.\n  Is there any commitment on the part of the Senator that he is next in \nline?\n  Mr. BOND. That was my understanding.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think the Senator from Missouri was supposed to be \nafter Senator Specter and after Senator Ashcroft. But Senator Specter \nis not here.\n  How much time does the Senator want on his amendment?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, there are a couple of people who want to \nspeak. I think 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Which amendment is the Senator calling up?\n  Mr. BOND. Disproportionate share of hospital payments, sense of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I hope that the Senator will take less time. We will \naccept the amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. We would like very much to have a vote on it. If they were \nstacked, that would be acceptable. But this one is a very serious \nmatter to the States of Missouri, Texas, and Washington.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I, once again, have put myself between a rock and a \nhard place because I thought Senator Specter would be next. We do not \nknow who will follow him. I told Senator Ashcroft he would be next.\n  Let's do it this way. I believe Senator Specter will be awhile \narriving. So will the Senator let us go with Senator Ashcroft, and then \nthe senior Senator from Missouri would go next?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes. I yield to the senior Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \ntemporarily set aside so that we can proceed to Senator Bond's \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman. I know \nthat this is an extremely difficult time. The analogy of loading frogs \nin a wheelbarrow is very apt when dealing with scheduling budget \nproceedings. The chairman has done an outstanding job.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 324\n\n  Mr. BOND. I call up amendment No. 324.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], for himself, Mrs. \n     Murray, Mr. Gorton, and Mr. Ashcroft, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 324.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record of May 21, 1997.)\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 324, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk and ask \nunanimous consent that the modification be included.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 324), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE PROTECTION OF \n                   CHILDREN'S HEALTH.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Today's children and the next generation of children \n     are the prime beneficiaries of a balanced Federal budget. \n     Without a balanced budget, today's children will bear the \n     increasing burden of the Federal debt. Continued deficit \n     spending would doom future generations to slower economic \n     growth, higher taxes, and lower living standards.\n       (2) The health of children is essential to the future \n     economic and social well-being of the Nation.\n       (3) The medicaid program provides health coverage for over \n     17,000,000 children, or 1 out of every 4 children.\n       (4) While children represent \\1/2\\ of all individuals \n     eligible for medicaid, children account for less than 25 \n     percent of expenditures under the medicaid program.\n       (5) Disproportionate share hospital (DSH) funding under the \n     medicaid program has allowed States to provide health care \n     services to thousands of uninsured pregnant women and \n     children. DSH funding under the medicaid program is critical \n     for these populations.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that the health \n     care needs of low-income pregnant women and children should \n     be a top priority. Careful study must be made of the impact \n     of medicaid disproportionate share hospital (DSH) reform \n     proposals on children's health and on vital sources of care, \n     including children's hospitals. Any restrictions on DSH \n     funding under the medicaid program should not harm State \n     medicaid coverage of children and pregnant women.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, in addition, I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Hutchison of Texas be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I rise to discuss a sense of the \nSenate amendment on behalf of myself, Senators Murray, Gorton, \nAshcroft, and Hutchison, which simply states that ``careful study must \nbe made of the impact of Medicaid disproportionate share hospital, or \nDSH, reform proposals on children's health and on vital sources of care \nincluding children's hospitals.''\n\n[[Page S4960]]\n\n  It is our strong belief, and the sense of the Senate indicates, that \nany restrictions on DSH funding should not harm Medicaid coverage of \nchildren and pregnant women.\n  While I recognize and strongly support the need to control Federal \nspending, I am deeply concerned about the impact of billions of dollars \nin new Medicaid DSH spending reductions.\n  I know that my colleague, the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, can point to some States in which there may be disagreements \nabout how the DSH payments were used. I don't say that there has been \nthe same kind of usage of Medicaid disproportionate share payments in \nother States as there has been in Missouri.\n  But I do know from our standpoint that since 1981 the Medicaid DSH \nProgram has enabled hospitals who provide care to a disproportionate \nshare of low-income people to serve as a safety net for those with \nlittle or no access to health care.\n  In Missouri, the DSH Program has been a key variable in expanding \nhealth care coverage to thousands of pregnant women and children. More \nthan a quarter of a million, more than 250,000, people have been served \nas a result of the DSH payments.\n  These payments have enabled my home State to successfully reduce the \nnumber of uninsured Missourians by enrolling them. It has improved \naccess to health care services for those who remain uninsured.\n  In addition to using DSH funds appropriately, our State of Missouri \nalso uses them efficiently.\n  For Federal Medicaid benefits plus DSH payments per beneficiary: The \nnational average is $2,454; in Missouri the figure is $2,288 versus the \nnational average of $2,454.\n  Overall Medicaid spending in Missouri is also below the national \naverage. A recent report by the Kaiser Commission illustrates the \nefficiency of the Missouri program. Missouri spends $3,190 annually per \nMedicaid enrollee compared to the national average of $3,290.\n  Yet, reductions in the Federal DSH payments would be devastating for \nMissouri, a State which has used its Federal DSH dollars in an \nefficient, effective, and appropriate manner.\n  Anywhere from 56,000 to 348,000 Medicaid beneficiaries in Missouri \ncould lose health coverage if the DSH reforms that have been publicized \nare enacted, and there is no compensating source of revenue funding for \nthem.\n  President Clinton's proposal specifically would eliminate Medicaid \nbenefits for 162,000 Missourians.\n  This is simply the wrong approach. Reducing DSH payments does not \nfocus on cutting the fat in the Medicaid Program. Instead, it cuts \ncrucial health care benefits for low-income pregnant women and children \nwhose lives depend upon this critical coverage.\n  Yes, Congress should increase State Medicaid flexibility, as this \nbudget resolution calls for. But we should not target DSH funding--\nfunding which has allowed many States to expand health care coverage to \nour Nation's most vulnerable population.\n  Again, I reiterate that this resolution fully recognizes and supports \nthe need for a balanced Federal budget. At the same time it guarantees \nthat when working out the details of achieving Medicaid savings, \nCongress will have sufficient information to ensure that reforms in \ndisproportionate share payments will not threaten low-income pregnant \nwomen and children, as well as providers of health care such as \nchildren's hospitals, public hospitals, and other safety net hospitals.\n  I look forward to working with the Finance Committee in the coming \nmonths regarding this issue, and I am confident that we can structure a \nplan that takes into consideration the health of our most vulnerable \ncitizens.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several statements in support of this \namendment be printed in the Record. I ask unanimous consent that \nstatements by Lawrence McAndrews, president and CEO of the National \nAssociation of Children's Hospitals; Governor Met Carnahan of the State \nof Missouri; Douglas Reis, president of Cardinal Glennon Children's \nHospital in St. Louis; Ted Frey, president of St. Louis Children's \nHospital; and Randall O'Donnell, president and CEO of Children's Mercy \nHospital in Kansas City be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Statement by Lawrence A. McAndrews, President and CEO, National \n                  Association of Children's Hospitals\n\n       The National Association of Children's Hospitals strongly \n     supports Senator Kit Bond's resolution on children's health \n     and Medicaid.\n       He is absolutely right on all three counts. A balanced \n     budget is very important to children. Medicaid is very \n     important to children. And Medicaid disproportionate share \n     payments are very important to children, especially the \n     patients of children's hospitals and other safety net \n     hospitals.\n       Medicaid is far more significant to children's health than \n     most of us realize. It pays for the health care of one in \n     every four children and one in three infants.\n       Medicaid and Medicaid disproportionate share hospital \n     payments are far more important to children's hospitals than \n     most of us realize. On average, children's hospitals devote \n     nearly half of their care to children who are covered by \n     Medicaid or are uninsured.\n       If it weren't for Medicaid disproportionate share payments, \n     some children's hospitals could be in jeopardy. Even with \n     such payments, Medicaid often does not pay enough to cover \n     the full cost of children's health care.\n       For example, even with these extra payments, children's \n     hospitals still average only about 80 cents from Medicaid for \n     every dollar of health care they provide. Without them, they \n     would receive closer to 70 cents for every dollar of care.\n       As a former CEO of Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas \n     City, I know just how important Medicaid and disproportionate \n     share payments were to our ability to serve all of the \n     children of our community, no matter how poor or sick.\n       Senator Bond's resolution fully supports the balanced \n     budget. It simply makes sure that in working out the details \n     of changes in Medicaid spending, Congress will have the \n     information it needs to ensure that changes in \n     disproportionate share payments will not jeopardize children \n     or other safety net hospitals.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                 Executive Office,\n\n\n                                            State of Missouri,\n\n                                 Jefferson City, MO, May 19, 1997.\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Kit: I write to inform you of my serious concern about \n     the Medicaid provisions in the budget resolution.\n       As you know, the resolution calls for savings of around $17 \n     billion over five years from the Medicaid program. It is \n     presumed that this savings level would be achieved primarily \n     through reductions in disproportionate share (DSH) payments \n     to states. Such a plan could have a devastating impact on \n     Missouri's Medicaid program, and more importantly, on the \n     citizens of our State who rely on Medicaid to meet their \n     health care needs.\n       Missouri runs a very well-managed and fiscally responsible \n     Medicaid program. Our spending is frugal and already below \n     most other states. In fact, Missouri's per capita spending on \n     Medicaid for adults is the lowest in the nation. We are \n     willing to swallow hard and do our share to balance the \n     federal budget. But to disproportionately reduce the DSH \n     program to achieve Medicaid savings, the federal government \n     would merely be using DSH cuts to subsidize the cost of \n     Medicaid in other states, many of which have chosen to \n     develop overly generous and costly programs.\n       Medicaid has already made a massive contribution to deficit \n     reduction. In February, the Congressional Budget Office \n     lowered its baseline projections of future Medicaid spending \n     by $86 billion. States are achieving these savings through \n     implementation of a number of innovative measures such as \n     Missouri's Medicaid managed care program, MC+. At the same \n     time, we are considering expanding Medicaid to cover more \n     uninsured. We want to continue making this progress, but we \n     may be unable to do so if our Medicaid funding base is eroded \n     through extensive reductions in the DSH program.\n       It is my understanding that a portion of the Medicaid \n     savings called for in the budget resolution may also be \n     achieved through a package of state flexibility initiatives. \n     We will be working with the House Commerce Committee and \n     Senate Finance Committee over the next couple of weeks in \n     hope that they will craft a package of Medicaid savings that \n     is both fair and responsible, and one that does not \n     disproportionately harm the DSH program. I hope you will do \n     all in your power to assist us in this regard.\n       Thank you for your attention to this extremely important \n     issue for the State of Missouri. If I can provide you with \n     further information, please don't hesitate to let me know.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                     Mel Carnahan,\n     Governor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                       Cardinal Glennon Children's\n\n\n                                                     Hospital,\n\n                                      St. Louis, MO, May 21, 1997.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: The officers and staff of Cardinal \n     Glennon Children's Hospital support your amendment to express \n     the sense of\n\n[[Page S4961]]\n\n     the Senate regarding the protection of children's health.\n       As a provider of tertiary health services to a broad \n     geographic region including metropolitan St. Louis, Missouri \n     and Illinois, the disproportionate share funding under \n     Medicaid is critical to our mission. Your efforts and those \n     of your colleagues to sustain momentum in providing health \n     care coverage to uninsured pregnant women and children is \n     directly dependent on the expanded use of disproportionate \n     share funding.\n       Thank you for your continued support for this important \n     funding source.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Douglas A. Ries, FACHE,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                St. Louis Children's Hospital,\n\n                                      St. Louis, MO, May 21, 1997.\n     Hon. Christopher ``Kit'' Bond,\n     U.S. Senator\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: Thank you for supporting fair and \n     adequate Medicaid payments for disproportionate share \n     hospitals (DSH). As you know, St. Louis Children's Hospital \n     serves a patient population which consists of approximately \n     50 percent Medicaid patients. We have qualified as a DSH \n     provider ever since the Medicaid program recognized the need \n     for additional funding to those hospitals serving an \n     extraordinary Medicaid and uninsured patient load.\n       We certainly agree with the Senate's observations regarding \n     the high priority which should be placed on the health care \n     needs of low income pregnant women and children. In Missouri, \n     restrictions on Medicaid DSH funding would seriously impair \n     our Federal Reimbursement Allowance (FRA) program. The FRA \n     targets DSH payments to hospitals serving a high volume of \n     Medicaid and low income patients. As Governor Carnahan points \n     out in his May 19 letter, Missouri has made significant \n     progress expanding Medicaid eligibility in recent years and \n     we would hate to see our program threatened by proposals \n     which may not have been carefully evaluated in terms of \n     impact.\n       Please contact me if there is anything I can do to help and \n     thank you again for your continued leadership on behalf of \n     all children.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Ted W. Frey,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n\n                                The Children's Mercy Hospital,\n\n                                    Kansas City, MO, May 21, 1997.\n     Hon. Kit Bond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Kit: On behalf of The Children's Mercy Hospital in \n     Kansas City, Missouri, I wish to thank you for your \n     resolution on children's health and Medicaid. The Children's \n     Mercy Hospital recognizes the need to control federal \n     spending, but we are deeply concerned about the impact of \n     billions of dollars in new spending reductions in Medicaid, \n     which would come on top of major savings states already have \n     begun to achieve.\n       Never has the Medicaid safety net for children been more \n     important than now. Without the Medicaid safety net, the \n     numbers of uninsured children would increase dramatically. It \n     is of paramount importance that any Medicaid proposal \n     preserve a base-year formula that includes all \n     ``disproportionate share hospital (DSH)'' payments in order \n     to continue to serve all of the children in our community.\n       We applaud your dedication to children and the betterment \n     of their lives. Your efforts will not only benefit the \n     children of Missouri, but the children of the entire country \n     for generations to come. Thank you for your continued \n     support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                       Randall L. O'Donnell, Ph.D.\n                                President/Chief Executive Officer.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder \nof my time.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Bond has not yielded his time. Has he reserved?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have reserved time. I see one of the \ncosponsors of the amendment on the floor. When she finishes, I would be \nwilling to have this set aside to accommodate the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  May I ask the Senator from Washington how much time she requires?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I will only take 30 seconds.\n  Mr. BOND. I yield 1 minute.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before we yield to Senator Murray, let \nme once again ask my friend, Senator Bond.\n  You know, we are reaching a deadline here with an awful lot of things \nthat haven't been handled. From my standpoint, the way the Senator has \naccommodated his amendment in working with us is acceptable. I urge \nthat he let us accept it at some point and not insist on a rollcall \nvote. I assume the rollcall vote will probably be 100 percent. But I \ndon't think that helps the Senator any more. I am trying to tell him as \nclearly as I can that is not going to help him any more than if he lets \nus accept it. It is going to a conference which is on an expedited \nprocess. I want to help him. I am doing everything I can. I don't know \nif I want to go through a rollcall and then, you know, be very helpful \nafter that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate the good advice from my very \nwise leader on the Budget Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague \nfrom Missouri in offering this amendment. I have been extremely \nconcerned about the impact of a $14 billion reduction in the \ndisproportionate share hospital payments.\n\n  The Bond/Murray amendment sends a strong message to the authorizers \nthat the health care needs of low-income pregnant women and children \nremain a priority in developing any DSH reform legislation. I am not \nopposed to reforming the program to ensure that payments are being \ntargeted to those most in need, but we cannot allow reform efforts to \nthreaten the delivery of care to our most vulnerable populations.\n  Massive changes in DSH implemented in order to be a deficit reduction \ntarget could jeopardize the ability of many hospitals, especially \nchildren's hospitals to serve low-income children, pregnant women, and \nthe disabled. For many hospitals, DSH payments are the difference \nbetween solvency and bankruptcy.\n  As we all know, few States would be in a position to off set the loss \nof Federal DSH payments. Meaning that hospitals would have little \nchoice but to eliminate or reduce services for the most vulnerable in \nour society. Without the flexibility of DSH, States cannot hope to \nexpand Medicaid coverage for uninsured children or pregnant women. In \naddition, any efforts to expand Medicaid for HIV positive individuals \nin order to prevent the onset of full blown AIDS, could be impossible.\n  I am hopeful that the authorizers will carefully craft a reform \nproposal drive by policy, not just numbers. DSH is too important to \nallow simple numbers to be the guiding influence.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to send an important \nmessage that DSH reform should not result in the loss of health care \ncoverage for children, the disabled and low income pregnant women. We \nneed to use extreme caution to prevent any further eroding of health \nsecurity for these vulnerable populations.\n  I thank Senator Bond for his efforts in bringing this amendment to \nthe floor and I look forward to working with the authorizing committee \nin developing a fair and equitable DSH reform legislation.\n  Mr. DeWine. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senator Bond's \nresolution, the sense of the Senate regarding the protection of \nchildren's health. While I believe that our children will be best \nserved by a balanced budget, we also must ensure that this agreement \nsends a strong message that we must preserve the access of low-income \nchildren to quality health care.\n  May children's hospitals are designated as disproportionate share \nhospitals or DSH hospitals because they serve a disproportionate share \nof low-income children. DSH payments make a vital difference in the \nability of hospitals to serve this population. They are a critical part \nof the health care safety net for vulnerable children.\n\n  For example, two of the largest children's hospitals in Ohio have \ninformed me that approximately 40 percent of the children they serve \nare covered by Medicaid. Without the additional DSH payments, the \nability of these hospitals to serve low-income children would be \nseriously impaired.\n  DSH payments are even more important to independent children's \nteaching hospitals that do not receive Medicare support for graduate \nmedical education, known as DSH dollars. In fact, I'm working on a \nletter to the Finance Committee about this GME inequity now.\n  But my point here is that if DSH funds are cut from children's \nhospitals--that already are not receiving dsh funds--then these \nhospitals will\n\n[[Page S4962]]\n\nfind it very difficult to provide quality care for poor children. \nAlthough we must balance the Federal budget, we also want this balanced \nbudget to make children's health and well-being a top priority.\n  Senator Bond's resolution is consistent with that message. It \nrecognizes how important a balanced budget is, and it recognizes that \nsome changes in DSH payments may well be necessary. But, it also \nrecognizes how important--within such a budget--DSH is to children's \nhealth. I strongly support the Bond resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I do not want to get myself into another \nsituation where I am confused. Senator Bond has a lot of time. Has he \nyielded his time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I had several other cosponsors who wished to \nspeak. I would like to reserve 5 minutes for them to speak and yield \nback the remainder of the time. In the meantime, until they come to the \nfloor, I would be happy to ask unanimous consent to have the amendment \ntemporarily set aside so I can confer with the chairman and give an \nopportunity for the cosponsors to speak.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could we establish this, however? Either before we \naccept the amendment, if that is the approach, or before we vote on it, \nif that is the approach, the Senator from Missouri would use 5 minutes \nimmediately prior thereto.\n  Mr. BOND. I would be agreeable with that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that that be the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand that we could temporarily set aside the \npending amendments and proceed now to Senator Specter, the Senator from \nPennsylvania, for one of his three amendments. I understand that the \nSenator from Pennsylvania has agreed that the other two will not be \ncalled up.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the distinguished manager articulates it \ncorrectly. I will offer one amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you, very much.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 340\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 340.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 340.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record of May 21, 1997.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment adds $1.1 billion to \nfunction 550, which is the health function, for fiscal year 1998, with \nan offsetting $1.1 billion reduction in nondefense discretionary \nfunctions, which would hold Federal agency administrative costs to 96 \npercent of the estimated 1998 level.\n  The offset constitutes a reduction in nondefense spending of four-\ntenths of 1 percent. This four-tenths of 1 percent could be \naccommodated by reducing administrative costs only 4 percent, so that \nthe net effect would be to have Federal administrative costs reduced by \n4 percent to 96 percent of the estimated 1998 level.\n  This amendment is being offered, Mr. President, because the Senate \nyesterday adopted, by a vote of 98 to nothing, a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution to increase spending for the National Institutes of Health \nby $2 billion. And while that sounds good, to those who are unaware of \nthe inner workings of the Senate, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution does \nnot have any real effect but just says what we would like to have \noccur. This amendment will be directed toward having hard dollars \nplaced in the budget resolution for the National Institutes of Health. \nI am offering this amendment on behalf of Senator Harkin, Senator Mack, \nSenator D'Amato, Senator Jeffords, Senator Inouye, Senator Collins, \nSenator Hutchison, Senator Feinstein, and Senator Reid.\n  Mr. President, there is a general acceptance that the National \nInstitutes of Health has been one of the real treasures of the U.S. \nGovernment, making enormous advances in the most dreaded diseases which \nwe face today. There have been enormous advances in cancer, breast \ncancer, prostate cancer, enormous advances in Alzheimer's disease, \ncystic fibrosis, more recently in schizophrenia; a new generation of \nAIDS drugs are reducing the presence of the AIDS virus and HIV-infected \npersons to nearly undetectable levels, and the phenomenal work being \ndone by the National Institutes of Health has led to a consistent rise \nin funding for that agency.\n  Since becoming chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and \nHuman Services and Education, we have raised the funding for NIH by \nsome $643 million in fiscal year 1996. We have raised the funding for \nthe National Institutes of Health by $820 million in fiscal year 1997, \nbut this year we are faced with a reduction in the health account. So \nthat if this budget goes forward, and this budget signifies what \nfunding will be available for NIH, there will be a cut in all health \naccounts and accordingly, on a pro rata basis, a cut on the National \nInstitutes of Health.\n  The total allocation and funding for the health account, account 550, \nwas frozen from last year at $25 billion, and in this budget it is in \nat $24.9 billion, or, as I say, a cut of some $100 million.\n  This is $400 million short of what the President's original budget \nmark was for 1998, and over $3 billion short for the 5-year budget \nperiod. The budget would cut the health account by some $2.2 billion \nthrough the year 2002. But, most importantly, from the point of view of \nwhat we are doing here today, we have the President coming forward with \na budget increase of some $400 million, and this account is now cut by \n$100 million.\n  If this is left to stand, Mr. President, we will have the anomalous, \nor hard-to-understand situation where the Senate has said we ought to \nincrease the National Institutes of Health by $2 billion, and then when \nit comes to my committee where I chair and have the responsibility for \nestablishing the mark, suddenly we will find not only no money for an \nincrease, but the account is cut by $100 million. So, on a pro rata \nbasis, there would have to be a decrease.\n  We find this at a time when other accounts have increases in \nspending. Defense spending rises by $3.2 billion in fiscal year 1998; \ninternational affairs rises by $900 million in fiscal year 1998; energy \nrises by $400 million in fiscal year 1998; natural resources and \nenvironment rises by $1.3 billion for this year; commerce and housing \ngoes up $300 million; education and training goes up $4.3 billion; \nadministration of justice up by $1.4 billion, the general Government \nrises by some $800 million. But no one has come to the floor on any of \nthese lines and has said there ought to be a $2 billion increase. The \nonly line in the items which I have just spoken about would be defense. \nBut for the National Institutes of Health, yesterday we had a spirited \npresentation with many speakers saying NIH ought to go up by $2 \nbillion. The reality is it is all Confederate money unless there is \nsome allocation which is more than a sense-of-the-Senate or our very \nbest wishes but a specific amount which has a specific offset.\n\n  That is, in itself, somewhat of an oversimplification, but that is \nvery close to the reality. The whole budget resolution, in a sense, is \nan expression by the Senate, by the Congress of what we ought to have \ndone, contrasted with the specific appropriations bills which are then \nlegislated and then ultimately signed by the President.\n  I conferred with the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee after talking this over with the distinguished chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, and Senator Domenici said, well, you better see \nhow Senator Stevens is going to respond to it. And Senator Stevens says \nwe need to have the hard dollars through the budget process. So that if \nthe National Institutes of Health is to avoid having a cut, this \namendment is going to have to be adopted.\n  It goes without saying that as one Senator who chairs a certain \nsubcommittee, I am bound by the will of the Senate. If the Senate says \nin this vote that the National Institutes of Health is not to have an \nincrease but, in fact, is supposed to have a decrease, to the various \ninterest groups who want breast cancer to be funded, who want prostate \ncancer to be funded, who want Alzheimer's to be funded, who want heart \ndisease to be funded, who\n\n[[Page S4963]]\n\nwant AIDS to be funded, then I can say I went to the floor and I laid \nthe case on the line--and I am not totally without experience as an \nadvocate--and the Senate said, no, we are not going to increase the \nfunding for the National Institutes of Health. I have a specific \noffset, and that is administrative costs that go down 4 cents on the \ndollar. I think that administratively you can cut 4 percent. It is \nfour-tenths of 1 percent across all discretionary nondefense budgets, \nbut it comes out of, could come out of 4 cents on the dollar on \nadministrative costs.\n  If the Senate says that on Wednesday night we said put it up $2 \nbillion, that is what we would like to see, but when the Senate faces \nthe hard choice and has to put its money where its mouth is, a sense-\nof-the-Senate amendment is where the Senate's mouth is. This budget \nresolution is where the money is. If the Senate says we are not going \nto put our money where our mouth is, that is on the record. And when \npeople say NIH did not get an increase, it is because the Senate turned \nit down.\n  So this is an opportunity for the Senate, bluntly speaking, to put \nits mouth where its money is. Mr. President, we have only 1 in 4 \napproved grants funded, and we have people dying as we speak from \ncancer, dying as we speak from heart disease, dying as we speak from \nmany, many ailments. The National Institutes of Health has been our \nvery best capital investment in the health of the American people.\n  That, in effect, lays it on the line in just a very few moments. So \nat this point I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be temporarily set aside so that I might present an \namendment, which will only take 5 minutes, and then we can go back to \nthe amendment, unless the Senator just wants to wait for someone else \nto speak.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have no objection to my distinguished \ncolleague proceeding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest? If not, who yields time to the Senator from Texas?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield--how much time, I ask the \nSenator?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Five minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Five minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 320, as modified\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I send to the desk a modification to \namendment No. 320. I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  If the Senator will withhold, the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm], for himself and Mr. \n     Bond, proposes an amendment numbered 320, as modified.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . DEPOSIT OF ALL FEDERAL GASOLINE TAXES INTO THE \n                   HIGHWAY TRUST FUND.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since 1956, federal gasoline excise tax revenues have \n     generally been deposits in the Highway Trust Fund and \n     reserved for transportation uses.\n       (2) In 1993, Congress and the President enacted the first \n     permanent increase in the federal gasoline excise tax which \n     was dedicated to general revenues, not the Highway Trust \n     Fund.\n       (3) Over the next five years, approximately $7 billion per \n     year in federal gasoline excise tax revenues will be \n     deposited in the general fund of the Treasury, rather than \n     the Highway Trust Fund.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions in this resolution assume that the \n     Congress should in the extension of the Budget Enforcement \n     Act, ISTEA reauthorization, appropriations acts, and in any \n     revenue bills, that all revenues from federal gasoline excise \n     taxes, including amounts dedicated to general revenues in \n     1993, should be dedicated to the Highway Trust Fund so that \n     such taxes may be used for the purpose to which they have \n     historically been dedicated, promoting transportation \n     infrastructure and building roads.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Byrd \nbe added as a cosponsor to amendment No. 320 with a modification in its \nstated purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we set up the highway trust fund in 1956, \nand from 1956 until 1993, every time we had a permanent gasoline tax, \nthat gasoline tax as a user fee for use of the highways was deposited \nin a highway trust fund that was spent largely for highway \nconstruction, though in recent years some portions of it have been \ndedicated to other purposes like mass transit. But from 1956 to 1993, \nwhen somebody went to the filling station and stuck that nozzle in \ntheir gasoline tank and filled up their car or truck, they were paying \na tax on gasoline that was used to build the roads that they would \ndrive over using that car or truck.\n  In 1993, in the budget and subsequent tax bill that flowed from it, \nfor the first time in American history since the adoption of the \nhighway trust fund, we had a permanent gasoline tax of 4.3 cents a \ngallon that went not into the highway trust fund but into general \nrevenues, so that for the first time since we set up the trust fund we \nhad a gasoline tax that was adopted for the purpose of paying for \ngeneral Government and not building highways.\n  We know from the vote in the House on the Shuster amendment, we know \nfrom the vote in the Senate on the Warner amendment that there is a \nstrong belief that money collected on gasoline taxes ought to be used \nto build roads and it should not be taken to fund other programs of \nAmerican Government.\n  I have put together and sent to the desk in my modification to \namendment No. 320 a very strong sense-of-the-Senate resolution that \nsimply makes note of the fact that this 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on \ngasoline, which has been diverted for the first time ever from the \nhighway trust fund, should be returned to the highway trust fund, and \nthat as we move on to consider our Budget Enforcement Act, as we \nconsider ISTEA reauthorization, as we consider appropriations acts, and \nas we consider other revenue bills, all revenues coming from a gasoline \nexcise tax, including the 4.3 cents a gallon that currently goes to \ngeneral revenues, should be deposited in the highway trust fund and \nshould be used for the purposes that the trust fund has been \nhistorically dedicated to: building roads and paying for other modes of \ntransportation. This is the first of many amendments that we will have, \naimed at moving the 4.3-cent a gallon tax on gasoline out of general \nrevenue, where it funds general Government, into the highway trust fund \nso that this roughly $7 billion a year can go for the purpose that the \ngasoline tax was collected. I know this is a controversial amendment in \nsome areas, but I believe there is a strong consensus in Congress that \nwe need to move in this direction. I do believe that later this year, \nwhen we do a tax bill, that this will be done. So my purpose here is \nsimply to begin the process of putting the Senate on record.\n\n  Let me also say, and I discussed this with Senator Domenici, and I \nfeel a little sheepish about doing it, but when we had so many people \nwho felt so strongly about this issue, one of the things that I \npromised them was that they were going to get an opportunity to vote on \nit. So, what I would like to do is simply ask that this be put with \nanother amendment, possibly a unanimous consent that this be a 10-\nminute vote following some other vote that we would have, so we might \nactually give people a chance to be on record on this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I cannot agree to the unanimous-consent \nrequest regarding the 10 minutes. Would the Senator leave that up to us \nas we schedule it? Does the Senator want to get the yeas and nays?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent it be in order we get the yeas \nand nays.\n\n[[Page S4964]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator from Texas. I intend to support his \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 340\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask Senator Santorum be added as \noriginal cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Who \nyields time on the pending amendment?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the pending amendment?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I will suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to inquire parliamentary wise, \nhow much time does Senator Specter have remaining on his amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 50 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five-zero, 50 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time did he have for the amendment? I thought \nhe had an hour. He only spoke 10 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am sorry. I thought he spoke much longer than 10 \nminutes.\n  Would the Senator agree to reduce his time to 30 and we will take 15 \non our side?\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I so propose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I might inquire, the sequence has been \nsomewhat misunderstood, but I think we are close to an agreement. If \nSenator Ashcroft, from the State of Missouri, can agree to 30 minutes \non his, then I would proceed to ask that he go next, and then Senator \nWellstone go next; but in the event Senator Wellstone is inconvenienced \nfor 5 or 6 minutes, that we do other business but not deny him the next \namendment to be called up to be his, after Senator Ashcroft.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, might I just inquire of the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, I believe my colleague from Missouri is planning to \ntake the full half-hour?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. That is correct.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from New Mexico, I think I will \nbe here. I thank him for his courtesy. If I am not, a 1-minute quorum \ncall will do the job and I will be ready to go.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will send out word for you and we will give you a \nlittle time, because you accommodated us and I appreciate it.\n  Does the Chair have an inquiry of the Senator?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields the floor?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I inquire of my distinguished colleague \nfrom Iowa, how much time he would like? The distinguished ranking \nmember of the subcommittee on Labor, Health, Human Services and \nEducation, former chairman of the subcommittee?\n  Mr. HARKIN. And the proud cosponsor of your amendment, I might add. \nHow much time do we have?\n  Mr. SPECTER. We have 20 minutes left. Parliamentary inquiry, how much \ntime does remain on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the understanding of the Chair that the \nrequest was for 30 minutes, equally divided.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No, that was not our intention. I asked the Senator if \nhe would agree with a total of 30 minutes, and then I would agree to 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is correct. That was my understanding.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And that is the consent. He has, whatever time he has \nused, the total he is going to get is 30 minutes on the amendment and I \nhave agreed to reduce my time from an hour to 15 minutes in rebuttal. \nIs there something wrong with this that makes it complicated? I thought \nit is very, very simple.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. So the Senator from Pennsylvania has 15 \nminutes?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I have 20 minutes. Mr. President, the statement was made \nthat I had spoken 10 minutes. Senator Domenici asked a few moments ago \nhow much time remained on my account: 50 minutes, 5-0. I spoke for 10 \nminutes. I have agreed to speak for 30. So 10 from 30 would leave 20. \nSenator Domenici has agreed to accept 15 minutes. So the total time \nremaining would be 20 minutes on my side and 15 minutes on Senator \nDomenici's side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Then that will be the order.\n  Mr. HARKIN. May I have 10 minutes?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield 10 minutes to Senator Harkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, the \nchairman, Senator Specter, to support this important amendment. \nYesterday the Senate went on record in support of doubling research at \nNIH with the adoption of the Mack sense-of-the-Senate amendment, a \nunanimous vote last time. This amendment that Senator Spector is \noffering is a modest first step toward making good on that commitment.\n  Senator Specter said the amendment would add $1.1 billion to the \nhealth account to restore, first of all, the $100 million cut contained \nin the resolution and additional moneys to enable our subcommittee to \nprovide adequate funding for NIH and other health programs. Without our \namendment, it will be virtually impossible to provide even an inflation \nadjustment for medical research in the year 1998.\n\n  Mr. President, the resolution before us, despite the other merits, \nis, to put it kindly, extremely shortsighted when it comes to support \nfor finding cures and more cost-effective treatment and prevention for \nthe many diseases and disabilities that affect us. In so doing, it \nshortchanges our future, shortchanges Americans' health, and \nshortchanges efforts to control health care costs and keep Medicare \nsolvent in the long run. At the same time we are shortchanging basic \ninvestments in health care, the Pentagon gets another multibillion-\ndollar increase. Here is a chart right here that will show you. Here is \nthe shifting priorities. This is our budget agreement versus last \nyear's spending.\n  Defense gets $3.2 billion more; health gets $100 million cut. Wrong \npriorities.\n  Another way of looking at it is to see what is happening with our \nspending on discretionary health funding. The President's budget had \n$25.3 billion; the 1997 budget was $25 billion; the budget agreement is \n$24.9 billion. That is where that missing $100 million is. We are going \nin the wrong direction in spending for basic research in this country.\n  Let me just give a couple of examples to show the folly of what we \nare doing. Last year, the federally supported research on Alzheimer's \ndisease totaled about $300 million. Yet it is estimated that we spend \nabout $90 billion annually caring for people with Alzheimer's. In other \nwords, for every $100 we spend caring for people with Alzheimer's we \nare spending about 3 pennies on research for Alzheimer's. Supported \nresearch on diabetes is about $290 million a year, yet it is estimated \nwe spend over $25 billion on diabetes care. Mental health, research is \nabout $613 million a year, estimated $130 billion a year spent annually \non mental health care.\n  So, these penny-wise and pound-foolish statistics are even more \nillogical\n\n[[Page S4965]]\n\ntoday. We are at a time of great promise. Just about every day we read \nabout new discoveries and new breakthroughs, new therapies and new \ntreatment strategies. We are making progress. But, while we aren't \nsuffering from a shortfall of ideas, we are suffering from a shortfall \nof resources. I have often made this analogy, when it comes to medical \nresearch. It is like we have 10 doors and they are all closed. We want \nto find out what is behind those doors. If you look behind one door, \nthe odds are 10 to 1 you are not going to find what you are looking \nfor. Right now, we are funding less than 25 percent of the peer \nreviewed, accepted grant proposals at NIH. That means we may be looking \nbehind door No. 1, but doors 2, 3, and 4 are still closed.\n  That is the odds. They are not good odds we are going to find the \nright treatments, strategies, cures, interventions. ``Let's Make A \nDeal'' had better odds than that. Maybe there is a cure for breast \ncancer behind door 3, or Alzheimer's behind door No. 4, or Parkinson's \nbehind door No. 2, but we don't know because we aren't committing the \nresources to unlock those doors.\n  There is another impact that lack of medical research funding has. \nYoung people, maybe looking ahead, thinking about pursuing a career in \nmedical research, yet they see the resources are not there to let them \ndo long-term research. So the doors are locked to the cures but so are \nthe doors to careers.\n  Our lack of investment in research is discouraging people from \npursuing careers in medical research. Here is a figure. The number of \npeople under the age of 36 applying for NIH grants dropped by 54 \npercent between 1985 and 1993.\n  I know there are a lot of factors, but we believe that the lower \nsuccess rate among all applicants is making biomedical research less \nand less attractive to young people. This amendment, by Senator \nSpecter, provides a very modest downpayment on what is needed. It \nbegins to put us on the right path, the path that we committed to last \nnight unanimously by adopting the Mack amendment. This amendment today \nwill have a real impact on efforts to support medical research. But let \nme be clear, even with adoption of this amendment we can't get the job \ndone. The budget resolution before us makes it clear that the only way \nwe can devote the resources we need to help research, to help health \nresearch and stop robbing Peter to pay Paul is by going outside of the \nregular discretionary spending process.\n\n  This resolution calls for $24.2 billion in discretionary health \nspending by the year 2002. That includes NIH, CDC, Community Health \nCenters, Older Americans Act, health professional training, maternal \nand child health care, and on and on. To double funding for NIH, as \nthis body committed to do last night, would cost over $26 billion by \nthe year 2002. That is $2 billion more than the entire health function \nis allotted by the year 2002.\n  So even if you eliminated all funding for breast cancer screening, \nMeals on Wheels for seniors, drug treatment, Older Americans Act, \ncommunity health centers, and on and on, if you eliminated all of that, \nthis budget resolution would still not enable us to meet the goal that \nwe said last night by a vote of 98 to 0 that we wanted to meet by the \nyear 2002, which is to double NIH funding.\n  The only way we are going to get this is through another mechanism. I \nbelieve the best other mechanism is called for in S. 441, National Fund \nfor Health Research Act, that Senator Specter and I introduced. \nBasically, what this trust fund says is, look, we spend about $650 \nbillion a year in health plans--Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Aetna, HMO's, \non and on. All we are asking is that 1 percent, 1 penny out of every \ndollar that we spend on health care in this country, be remitted to a \ntrust fund, just like a highway trust fund. Every time you buy a gallon \nof gas, you put money into the highway trust fund. It is like an \nairline ticket tax; you put money in to keep the airports going.\n  What we are saying is, it is unconscionable that we spend all this \nmoney in health care in America and we put nothing from that health \ncare budget into research.\n  The bill Senator Specter and I have introduced, S. 441, will do that. \nIt will take 1 penny out of $1 to put into a research trust fund, \nbecause if we do not do it, then all we did last night were just words, \nso much hot air. Ninety-eight Senators last night said they want to \ndouble funding for NIH by the year 2002. Let's put our resources where \nour mouths are.\n  The first step toward that is adopting the Specter amendment to at \nleast meet the needs next year to make sure that we do not have this \n$100 million cut in health spending, and to make sure that we have \nhigher-than-inflation-spending resources for the National Institutes of \nHealth.\n  Mr. President, expanding our commitment to research will promote \nhealth care, control health costs, create jobs and strengthen our \neconomy and competitive position in the global marketplace. This \namendment is an investment in our future.\n  I urge the adoption of the Specter amendment so that we can meet--\nstart to meet--what we said we were going to do last night when we \nadopted the Mack resolution.\n  I yield back whatever time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. When I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum, how is that time charged?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is charged to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. And when no one speaks and the Senate is in session, \nthere is no quorum call, how is that time charged?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is charged equally between both sides.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do not suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 9 minutes, \n36 seconds; the Senator from New Mexico has 15 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will not yield time but await response, if any, from \nthe distinguished Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to make sure my friend, Senator \nGramm, has 4 or 5 minutes, so will you remind me when I have used 5 \nminutes, and then I will yield as much time Senator Lautenberg needs \nand then withhold a few minutes for the Senator from Texas. If not, I \nwill take it off the resolution.\n  First of all, let me say it is with great regret that I cannot \nsupport this amendment. It does not make any difference what the U.S. \nSenate said last night in a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. They \nexpressed a wish, a hope. The truth of the matter is that we cannot \nafford this amendment, nor will it work as proposed by the proponents \nof the amendment.\n  First of all, it is without saying, that no matter what we do to try \nto add money to the function of Government that the two Senators who \nare proposing this control in the appropriations process, that the \nallocation of the moneys will be done by the chairman of the Committee \non Appropriations. So, in a sense, we are going through an exercise as \nif we are really increasing NIH when we really are not. There is no \ndoubt in my mind that if this amendment were to be adopted, that \nSenator Stevens would not have any chance of being fair to all the rest \nof the parts of Government and take $1.2 billion and add it to this \nfunction of Government.\n  The second point is, just to be absolutely frank and honest, even if \nwe did it and the chairman of the Appropriations Committee did not \nagree and did not put any money in, there is plenty of money in the \nsubcommittee to increase NIH by $1.1 billion if the chairman and \nranking member chose to do so. They will just have to do what all the \nother committees do; they will\n\n[[Page S4966]]\n\nhave to reduce a lot of other spending within their committee to make \nan addition of $1.1 billion to NIH.\n  So, in a sense, this is like expressing a desire, but in this one, we \nactually change the numbers and presume that this is going to be what \nis going to be carried out. I do not think we ought to do that.\n  For Senators who would like to know what the effect of it is, because \nthere is nothing free, you take $1.1 billion out of the rest of the \nfunctions of Government and here is what I assume: First, I assume that \nthe agreement between the President of the United States and the \nleadership, with reference to preferential accounts, will hold, and \nthat in the subcommittees, we will fund those items that are preferred. \nThe distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania has a huge amount of money \nfor these protected items, most of them in education, but I assume they \nare the largest number of protected accounts wherein more money is put \nin the subcommittee than any other subcommittee.\n\n  Having said that, I am going to assume in this explanation to the \nSenate that we protect all the other accounts we have agreed to \nprotect, which are considerable. This small amount of money that they \nare talking about cutting, on that assumption, would yield cuts like \nthis: Veterans, $190 million; WIC, $38 million; LIHEAP, which many \naround here worry about, emergency energy, $14 million; Social Security \nadministrative expenses, $36 million.\n  Frankly, I do not think we ought to be doing that here today. I have \nthe greatest admiration for the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania, and, yes, indeed, he has done a marvelous job in seeing \nto it that he can push NIH up as much as possible, for which we are all \ngrateful. And, yes, I will say he has been very helpful to the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, and I hope this debate on the floor will never change \nthat. But I just cannot, in good conscience, let the Senate take $1.1 \nbillion, which I assume is going to come from the unprotected accounts \nof this Government, and put them into the function that is called 550, \nwhere it could be spent for anything in that function. There is nothing \nwe are going to do here today which says you put it in and it must be \nspent for NIH. The good judgment of the chairman and ranking manager \nwill be what controls it. They could put more in education if they like \nand nobody could stop them.\n  Until the chairman of the Appropriations Committee looks at all the \nmoney available in the nonprotected accounts and determines how much he \nwants to give this subcommittee, we are not going to know how much the \nsubcommittee has to spend, and I regret that, but I believe that is the \ncase.\n  I do not think we ought to do this to the rest of the budget. \nYesterday evening, when we debated the desire of the institution, \ncalled the U.S. Senate, to do more for NIH, you did not hear the \nSenator from New Mexico say, ``And that assures you in this budget we \nare going to change it by $1.1 billion,'' and had anybody asked me, I \nwould have said it does not assure you of that. This budget is \nfinished. That wish is in the future, and I think the proponent of that \namendment knows we are not going to get there very easily doubling NIH. \nIt is just we want to shoot for the stars when it comes to science \nresearch, especially biomedical research.\n  I yield the floor and yield whatever time Senator Lautenberg wants, \nand if we have a few minutes left, I will yield to Senator Gramm.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Once again, Mr. President, I find myself on the \nopposite side of an amendment that, frankly, I would not mind \nsupporting. I do not think we do enough to combat the diseases that \nplague our society, things that we could ultimately save, I think, a \nfortune with if we could develop some of the programs that are now kind \nof just showing up with a light at the end of the tunnel.\n  I met with a group of drug executives last week in New Jersey, and \nwhen they laid out the programs that are near completion--some of those \nare in testing now in FDA--and the prospect of saving costs for long-\nterm diseases, whether it is Alzheimer's or osteoporosis and so many \nother things, it is a great advantage for us, both financially and \nfunctionally, as a society.\n  Because we are in this bind where the funds would come from functions \nlike education, environment, crimefighting, frankly, I am going to have \nto oppose it. It is one of the tasks we inherit when we take on an \nassignment like budget, which was declared earlier in this Chamber to \nbe one of the least popular assignments in the place. As a matter of \nfact, one Senator suggested that every Senator ought to have a sentence \nof 6 months on the Budget Committee to understand what it is like. \nBudget committees are fun when there is lots of money. When there is \nnot much money, to put it mildly, it is a drag.\n  Mr. President, I yield back any time remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 6 minutes 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 4 minutes to Senator Gramm.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am in favor of doubling funding for NIH, \nand I am going to vote for it. When the appropriations bill comes to \nthe floor and we are shooting with real bullets, as I like to say, I am \ngoing to offer this amendment if nobody else does. I think we ought to \nvote on funding NIH, but I want to make it clear that we are not voting \nto fund NIH here. We are voting to give the Labor-HHS Subcommittee \nanother $1.1 billion, with no guarantee where that money is going to \ngo.\n  I would like to make this point: There is no program under their \njurisdiction that is more popular than the National Institutes of \nHealth. The National Institutes of Health is going to end up getting \nthis $1.1 billion no matter what we do here, but if we did transfer \nthis money and if the Appropriations Committee actually decided to do \nit, something we cannot mandate they do, what we are doing is larding \nthe very social programs that make up the biggest growth in this \nbudget.\n  The President of the United States said, in one of his most honest \nstatements, this budget provides the largest increase in social \nspending we have had since the 1960's. The point is, most of those \nprograms are under the jurisdiction of the Labor-HHS Subcommittee, \nchaired by the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania. All we are \nasking is that we not give that subcommittee more money; that they have \nto set priorities, and if we are for the National Institutes of Health, \nwe have to decide that there are other programs that are less important \nthan it is.\n  I remind my colleagues that the discretionary allocation alone to the \nLabor, Health and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee is going \nto be at least $60 billion.\n  The National Institutes of Health gets about $13 billion. So we could \nquadruple funding for the National Institutes of Health in 1 year if we \nwere willing to take it away from other programs.\n  So I am glad we are voting on this amendment now because when we have \nthis appropriation come to the floor of the Senate, if NIH does not \nhave this money and nobody else on the committee and no one who is on \nthe subcommittee offers an amendment to give it to them by taking it \naway from other social programs, I intend to offer the amendment to see \nthat NIH gets the $1.1 billion.\n  But let us not today give the fastest growing part of the domestic \nbudget, Labor, Health and Human Services, another $1.1 billion with no \nguarantee that we are protecting the National Institutes of Health but \nevery guarantee that we are larding programs that many of the Members \nof the Senate do not even support, much less do not support giving more \nmoney to.\n  So if you want to raise funding for NIH, vote for it when the \nappropriations bill is on the floor. But there is over $60 billion in \ndiscretionary funding under the jurisdiction of this subcommittee. If \nthey want to quadruple NIH next year, they can do it.\n  But they have to do it the way families make a decision about sending \ntheir child to Texas A University. They have to say, ``Well, look, I \nwanted to buy a new refrigerator. That was great. I wanted to go on \nvacation. That\n\n[[Page S4967]]\n\nwas even better. But I didn't do those things in order to send my child \nto college.''\n  If we want to fund NIH, let us fund it. And let us do it by giving \nless money to things that are less important. I think that basically is \nwhat this amendment is about. That is why I am going the oppose it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 9 minutes 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I will be interested to see when the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas offers his amendment during the \nappropriations process what his offsets will be. On my time, I am \ninterested to hear them now, if the Senator from Texas would care to \ngive us a preview.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Well, let me say that I do not have the listing before me, \nbut I can certainly tell you that it would be my intention to go \nthrough the list and to look at many of the areas where we are funding \nprograms that are of a lower priority than the National Institutes of \nHealth.\n  When a family decides they are not going to go on vacation, that is \nnot because it is not important. It is just because they have other \nthings that are more important.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I appreciate the answer from my \ndistinguished colleague from Texas. But I ask him if he would cut the \nSocial Security administrative costs which total some $6 billion or cut \nthe Medicare administration costs or if he would cut the job training \nprograms or student aid or Pell grants?\n  I understand that, in posing this question to the Senator from Texas, \nit is not possible for him to give a very meaningful answer without \nhaving the list before him, but I suggest at the same time that when he \nsays we could quadruple the accounts because we have $60 billion; we \nhad $74 billion last year and the funding was very, very short. And \ncontrary to what the distinguished Senator from New Mexico says, that \nwe are just talking about expressing a wish and a hope, that the \naccounts are going to be set by the appropriators, that really is not \nso.\n  When the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the full \ncommittee, sits down for the 602(b) allocations, what the Budget \nCommittee has done will be very, very important. When the Senator from \nNew Mexico says that we can make allocations, yet at the same time has \nstated that there are protected accounts on education that cannot be \nutilized for the health account, it is just a little bit inconceivable \nto this Senator how the Budget Committee comes up with the 550 account \nwhich is less than a freeze on last year's account. The reality is that \nthere will not be the funds for us to make an allocation for the \nNational Institutes of Health.\n\n  If this amendment passes, there will be a statement from the U.S. \nSenate to the Appropriations Committee that there ought to be an \nincrease by $1.1 billion, which will net out to about $1 billion for \nNIH, and that when you go through, as the Senator from New Mexico did, \nand specify what the costs will be other places, that it is doable to \nhave a cut of 4 percent in administrative costs. The administrative \ncosts are $25 billion today. Nobody can tell me that you cannot cut 4 \ncents out of a dollar on administrative costs.\n  What we did last night in talking about a $2 billion increase for NIH \nis ``talking about it.'' What we are doing now is putting our money \nwhere our mouths were last night.\n  If the Senate votes this down, then there is a ready answer that this \nSenator will have because I have the responsibility as chairman, \nSenator Harkin has the responsibility as ranking member, of saying what \nwe are doing. On this date of the record, it looks like there is going \nto be a $2 billion increase.\n  How does the American public, how do the people understand what the \nsense of the Senate is? You say it is the sense of the Senate. Is there \na sense? Yes, there is a Senate. Does the Senate have any sense? Well, \nnot really if you pass a sense-of-the-Senate resolution which does not \nmean anything; $2 billion. Does the Senate have any sense? Well, not if \nyou pass a sense-of-the-Senate resolution which is vacuous and \nmeaningless.\n  This is the money. Where is the money? It is in this amendment. If \nyou do not pass this amendment, fine. I have a way to tell the people \nwho want breast cancer to be financed, there is not the money. The \nSenate voted no. I have a way to say to the people who wanted money for \nmental health, there is no money to increase mental health.\n  The fact is that there has to be a pro rata cut. You have less in the \n550 health account. There is no way to have an increase for inflation. \nNow, if that is sense, then the Senate does not have any sense.\n  How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes thirty seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield 2 minutes to my distinguished colleague from \nIowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will try not to take more than a minute.\n  The Senator from Texas said, if I heard him correctly, that we can \ndouble in 1 year the funding for NIH if we would just set our \npriorities straight.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If the Senator will yield for 1 minute?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Sure.\n  Mr. SPECTER. He did not say, ``double.'' He said, ``quadruple.''\n  Mr. HARKIN. In 1 year?\n  Mr. SPECTER. In 1 year. That is what he said.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thought it was double.\n  We are spending about $13 billion a year at NIH.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Four times 13 is $52 billion, and we have $8 billion \nleft over according to the $60 billion figure. But we only have worker \nsafety and child care and education.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask if the Senator from Texas would amend his statement \nin the Record and provide us with a table. If the Senator from Texas \nsays we can quadruple spending for NIH, please tell us how. Please put \nin the Record for all to see what the Senator from Texas would like to \ncut in order to increase that kind of funding for NIH. If he does not, \nwell, then the words are just words; they do not mean anything.\n  So I challenge the Senator from Texas to back up his words with \nexamples of where we are going to get the money to quadruple in 1 year \nfunding for NIH.\n  Lastly, let me just say, again for the record, there has been some \ntalk we put the money there, but we don't know where it is going to go. \nWe offer the amendment as chairman and ranking member of the \nsubcommittee as cosponsors. We have the votes on his side and our side \nto make sure that is where the money goes, to NIH. There should be no \ndoubt in anyone's mind that that is where this money is going to go.\n\n  I thank the chairman for taking the lead on this.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, beyond the assurance as to where the \nmoney is going to go, there is money there, so that if there needs to \nbe a reallocation, there will be some funds that can be allocated.\n  The subcommittee has the responsibility for job training, student \naid, Pell grants, LIHEAP, the Center for Disease Control, child care, \nSocial Security administrative costs, Medicare, and a long list of \nitems which have very, very high priority. And when the Budget \nCommittee returns to the health account less money than it had last \nyear, obviously, there is no money for NIH because the other items have \nbeen cut to the bone as it is.\n  The last 2 years Senator Harkin and I consolidated or eliminated 134 \nprograms to save $1.5 billion to put into NIH and to put into \neducation. And the additional funds here are on projected programs.\n  So it is a very clear vote. It is a vote as to whether we want to put \nour money where we spoke so eloquently last night on $2 billion or \nwhether we want to have NIH unable to have an inflation rise and, in \nfact, have a pro rata cut.\n  How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 1 minute 22 \nseconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is the Senator finished?\n  I yield 2 minutes to Senator Gramm.\n\n[[Page S4968]]\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to go back to this issue a moment \nbecause I think it makes my point. I was thinking in terms of yesterday \nin talking about $60 billion for this subcommittee. They are now up to \n$74 billion. They blew through $60 billion in a hurry, and then another \n$14 billion.\n  My point is this--and I stand by the point--if they wanted to give \nthis project more money, they could do it. But the point is they have \ngot to take it away from somebody else. Actually, they could increase \nit fivefold. I was being overly conservative, as usual.\n  But let me just give you an example. I do not have the list in front \nof me. I will have to have the list when I offer the amendment on the \nfloor to provide this money. I will have to cut some.\n  Let me give you one example. $491 million for Goals 2000. Maybe local \neducation could do without Federal Government telling them how to run \nthe primary and secondary schools. Maybe we could sacrifice and not \nobligate that $491 million of budget authority. That would be about \nhalf of the way home toward meeting this goal.\n  So I just begin with that one example. I will start that out of the \nbidding process. You can have all $491 million of that project. My \nguess is with the list before me, in another 45 seconds I could \nprobably come up with the other funds it would be required to do this.\n  But the point is, not that it is easy, not that you want to do it, \nbut the point is, their argument is sort of like the parent saying, \n``Well, you know, I'd really like my child to go to college but, you \nknow, I've got to buy a new refrigerator. We have been planning to go \non vacation.'' The point is, families make those decisions; why cannot \nGovernment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if it were the old U.S.S.R., and Senator \nGramm were Premier Stalin, he could cut the $400 million for Goals \n2000. That happens to be one of the President's premier projects. Every \ntime you turn around within that item, there are matters which are \nvery, very important to someone.\n  But I will await the vote. I will abide by the will of the Senate. I \nwill be fascinated to see Senator Gramm's amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield back his remaining 50 \nseconds?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, not until I hear what Senator Domenici \nsays.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield myself 3 minutes. What I do not have I will \ntake it off the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I guess I would like to once again \ncompliment the sponsors and certainly indicate that I have great \nrespect for their desire to fund programs like NIH.\n  But I tell you, fellow Senators, to say you are going to go across \nthe entire budget of the United States and you are going to get rid of \nsome administrative costs and then you are going to take those \nadministrative costs and you are going to put them in this subcommittee \nso it can spend it on NIH is a pipe dream.\n  There is not going to be any 4-percent cut or 2 percent, whatever it \nis, in overhead unless it is made by each subcommittee who is doing \nthat. What this amounts to is deciding here on the floor of the Senate \nthat all of the other subcommittees of the U.S. Senate that handle \neverything from the Department of the Interior to Veterans--in fact, if \nI were the chairman of the Veterans' Subcommittee I would be here on \nthe floor and I would say, ``I don't think the U.S. Senate has given \nthe veterans enough.'' I would ask John Ashcroft, ``Will you help me? \nWhy don't we just say, let's cut overhead and give the veterans $5 \nbillion more? After all, they're preferred people in America.''\n  Boy what an amendment that would make up here at the desk. Who is \ngoing to turn it down? It does not cost you anything--does not cost \nyou. Of course it costs you something. Huge numbers of other programs \nare going to have to be cut. All I am suggesting is, we ought to wait \nfor the appropriators to make that decision.\n\n  I think I am glad we stopped the amendments and there are not any \nmore. I would look at very popular programs and send the subcommittee \nchairman over here and say, well, let's just cut 8 percent out of the \nSubcommittee on Health and Human Services, the one they are adding to, \nand just cut 8 percent out of overhead, and stand here and tell the \nSenate, well, we did not hurt anything in the subcommittee; we took 8 \npercent out of overhead and put it in the veterans.\n  Maybe you can think of a good one, or maybe you can think of a good \none. I gave you some ideas, but I do not want you to do that. I tell \nyou, that is what this amounts to. What we ought to do is leave it up \nto the appropriators as we have in the past.\n  It has been said that the Budget Committee's numbers are important as \nto how they allocate. Let me tell you, sometimes I am pretty puffed up \nabout this process. Other times I wonder what in the world am I doing \nworking so hard at this process. The truth of the matter is, in the \nlast 14 years, the appropriators have used the allocations of the \nBudget Committee how many times, would anybody think? Once. One time \nSenator Mark Hatfield said, ``I am brand new at this job as chairman, \nso I am just going to take your allocations and just accept them.'' \nBoy, that did not last very long. By the next year, they figured out \nwhat their allocations ought to be and that was the end of that, and \nthey probably departed from it by $5 billion. In other words, they \nmoved it from here to here but stayed with the total.\n  I think we ought to stay with the totals. Frankly, I hate to do this \nbecause I am a strong supporter of NIH. In fact, I may very well urge \nthat Ted Stevens put more money in NIH when we look through all the \naccounts of Government and see how we can fit it. I do not think it is \nfair to come here and say it is not going to cost anybody anything, it \nis a tiny bit of overhead. The other phrase we used to use is ``fraud \nand abuse.'' The best fraud and abuse salesman around here was Senator \nDennis DeConcini. He used to come down here at the end of the whole \nprocess and say, ``I am not spending anything. I just want to tell the \nGovernment to save $600 million on fraud and abuse,'' and he would \nwrite up an amendment, fraud and abuse, take the $6 million, put it in \nthe subcommittee, and say we will spend it there, and everybody went \nhome and he got a press release. The truth is, nobody found the $600 \nmillion or the $400 million in fraud and abuse, and so what happened, \nanother committee has to eat it.\n  That is what we are asking to do here. I do not think that is the way \nto do it. We will have a little more time spent on this amendment \nbefore we finish here today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am delighted I did not have an offset here on fraud \nand abuse. I have an offset on administrative costs.\n  As the distinguished chairman knows, there has to be an offset. I \nchose an offset which I think is realistic. When the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico says the appropriators are going to do whatever \nthey want to do, I wonder why we are here at all. Why have we been \nspending the last 2 days on a budget process that does not mean \nanything? The fact is that it does mean something.\n  When the Senator from New Mexico says, call on the subcommittee \nchairman of Veterans' Affairs, how about the chairman of Veterans' \nAffairs? I chair the Veterans' Affairs Committee. Let me tell you, it \nwould be a boon to that committee to have this researched.\n  Now the question is whether there is going to be any sense of the \nSenate at all, and if there is, this amendment will be adopted.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand this amendment will be stacked in the \nnormal manner that we are planning, or if we have not gotten that \nagreement, we have a number of amendments we will stack by unanimous \nconsent soon. But we have another amendment to call up, and I ask \nwhatever the pending amendment is, that it be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4969]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 322\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I call up an amendment numbered 322, and I ask \nunanimous consent that Senators McCain and Inhofe be added as original \ncosponsors, and Senator Gramm is now reflected as a cosponsor of the \namendment, but, if not, I ask his name be added.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft] for himself, Mr. \n     Gramm, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Abraham, Mr Helms, Mr. Faircloth, \n     Mr. McCain and Mr. Inhofe, proposes an amendment numbered \n     322.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record of May 21, 1977.)\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today with an open mind, for I \nhave not yet decided how to vote on the budget resolution before the \nSenate. I understand and I appreciate that we should not let the \nperfect become the enemy of the good. If I forget that, the leadership \nand the Senator from New Mexico will be quick to remind me, I am sure.\n  Having been a Governor, I understand that budgeting requires choices, \nchoices that will not satisfy everyone but should benefit everyone. \nLike Senator Bond, who served as Missouri Governor before me, I \nbalanced eight budgets in our State of Missouri, working with our State \nlegislature. The economic results were a strong, growing economy, more \njobs, low taxes, and the Nation's highest bond ratings. We developed a \nrecord of which we could be proud in balancing the budgets. We \ndeveloped a rainy day fund, several hundred million dollars in the \ncashflow operating reserve.\n  But the State law that we had equipped us with the necessary tools to \nbalance our budget. We had a constitutional provision and requirement \nthat we balance the budget. We had the line-item veto. We had the \nrequirement and the power to balance our budgets and then the tools to \nenforce our agreements. We worked with good people who had good \nintentions, and we reached good agreements. But we also had a good \nprocess to ensure that our agreements were kept.\n  I have only been in the Senate for a relatively short period of time, \nbut it seems to me there is no shortage of good people with good \nintentions here in Washington. What disturbs me is that here in \nWashington we do not have good processes in place to ensure that the \nbudget agreements we make 1 year will be kept the next year. \nParticularly, we lack the right kind of mechanical structural devices \nin Government to make sure that the budget agreements we make in one \nyear, like 1997, would be kept in the year 2002.\n  You can believe in and trust the people who reach disagreement in \ngood faith, and I do believe in them and I trust in them. But the \nhistory of failed budget agreements and the continuous deficit spending \nwithout enforcement measures makes a mockery of good people and it \nmakes a mockery of good intentions. We need more than good intentions \nand good people. We need good guarantees. We need strong enforcement \nprovisions. We need the limits contained in the agreement to make sure \nthat the agreement is not broken.\n  We have heard a lot on the floor of Senate that if you do this to the \nbudget, it will be a deal-breaker. Well, I want to make sure that we \nadd some enforcement so that we have a deal-keeper. I hope that there \nwill not be folks anywhere in this Chamber who say that because you \nhave an enforcer of this agreement that it is a deal-breaker. It would \nbe awfully difficult to hear people argue that anything that forces us \nto keep the agreement breaks the agreement. I think what we have here \nis the need for a deal-keeper and a deal-keeper cannot be a deal-\nbreaker.\n  Most of the people who are involved in the debate might not be in \noffice 5 years from now. The President certainly will not. So if we \nexpect to balance the budget, we need a principled process, we need the \nstructure of protection to be added to this agreement. We should not \ntrust the next generation's future to a handshake agreement between \npeople who will not even be around when the real crunch time comes. \nThat would be the triumph of hope over experience.\n  For me, a balanced budget in the year 2002 is worth voting for, but \ngood intentions are not enough to be worth voting for and good \nintentions alone will simply not protect us until we get there. The \nbudget resolution which we have before the Senate today claims to reach \nbalance by the year 2002. The American people will furnish every single \ndollar that is taxed and spent under this budget deal. I believe they \nare entitled to the very strongest possible guarantees, guarantees that \npromises made under this deal today will be promises kept tomorrow. \nPeople outside the Washington Beltway have a healthy skepticism of \npromises to stay on course for a balanced budget.\n  The amendment which I have introduced and which I am introducing with \nthose other Senators whose names have already been recited enforces the \nassurances that the leadership is promising under this plan. It does \nnot change the bipartisan agreement between the President and the \nconstitutional leadership. It simply adds additional enforcement \nmechanisms to ensure that the Nation actually reaches balancing its \nbudget by the year 2002.\n  Now, if we are truly committed to balancing the budget, we must have \nadequate enforcement mechanisms. This amendment ensures that any \nlegislation, any legislation would be out of order if it caused total \noutlays to exceed total receipts for the year 2002, or any fiscal year \nthereafter, unless three-fifths of the whole number of each House \nprovide for a specific excess of outlays over receipts by a rollcall \nvote. Under this amendment, any legislation would be out of order if it \ncaused an increase in the public debt above the levels in the fiscal \nyear 1998 budget resolution for fiscal year 1998 through 2002, \nremaining at the 2002 level thereafter unless three-fifths of the \nMembers of each House provided for such by rollcall vote. Under this \namendment, any legislation would be out of order if it caused an \nincrease in revenues unless approved by a majority of the whole number \nof each House by a rollcall vote. That is the requirement for an \nabsolute majority in the event of any increase in taxes.\n\n  Now, over the past 30 years Congress has not been very good at \nexercising self-control in budgetary matters. We need these enforcement \ntools to lock in our commitments to the American people to balance the \nbudget by the year 2002. Senators should recognize these concepts which \nI have just mentioned. The fact that it would be out of order to \nincrease the debt above the levels in the agreement, it would be out of \norder to have outlays that exceeded our income, it would be out of \norder to have tax increases without the whole of a majority of each \nwhole House in a rollcall vote, because these are the very provisions, \nthese are the very provisions which we all voted for, which 66 Members \nof this Senate voted for in the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution debate.\n  I say to the 66 Members who voted in favor of this, this should be \nthe structure we work in perpetuity, as long as this Nation exists. If \nit was good enough to put in the Constitution as long as America would \nexist, it ought to be good enough to put into this budget agreement for \nthe next 5 years. It is that simple.\n  Deficit spending has wrested power from the people it has deposited \nhere in Washington. We have inverted the Framers' will. They expected \nus not to spend the money of the next generation. This approach is to \ndo one thing, and one thing alone, and it is to curtail the deficit. It \nis to put enforcement and teeth into this agreement. It is to hold this \nagreement in place during the next 5 years. It is not to add spending \nto this agreement or take spending out of this agreement. It is simply \nto make this agreement an honest agreement for the people of the United \nStates of America.\n  Our ability to spend the money of the next generation is one of the \nskills we have refined to a very high level, and it is a skill we ought \nto curtail and guard against. This amendment would guard against it.\n  We have tried time and time again to deal with the dilemma of \nrecurring debt. We have not been able to deal with it. We simply have \nnot been able to summon the discipline. Well, I say put the discipline \nin this agreement. We should make part of this agreement the kind of \nguarantee that will make sure we keep our word. Put ``deal-keeper'' \ninto this agreement. Stop talking\n\n[[Page S4970]]\n\nabout deal-breakers. Make this a deal-keeper.\n  Chronic overspending does not simply result when one group decides \nthat it will try and stop it. We have to have the right structure in \nplace, and the amendment which I have offered today is the right \nstructure for doing that.\n  This budget agreement suggests that Congress will balance the budget \nby the year 2002. We must have the enforcement provisions necessary to \nensure that this goal is actually reached to place the very provisions \nin this agreement, the very provisions which were voted for \noverwhelmingly by this Senate when it sought to pass the balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution. Sixty-six Members voted for those \nitems. That makes good sense.\n\n  Incidentally, for those who didn't vote in favor of the balanced \nbudget amendment, the rest voted against it and almost universally said \ngive us a chance to vote for this as a statute.\n  We don't need to tamper with the Constitution. Here is that chance. \nThis is a chance to say, ``Yes. We agree that statutorily the very \nconditions which were so favorably received in the balanced budget \namendment proposal are available as statutory law here.'' I believe \nthis is an addition to the budget agreement, which won't be a deal \nbreaker but which would be a budget agreement keeper.\n  If the Senators believe that this budget deal will lead us to a \nbalanced budget by the year 2002, then they shouldn't fear adequate \nenforcement provisions that will make this a certainty. The American \npeople are rightly skeptical that this deal will lead to a balanced \nbudget. Firm enforcement would go a long way to assure the American \npeople of Congress' resolve to do the right thing and to keep its \npromise to balance the budget.\n  As I mentioned, 66 Senators voted to abide by the enforcement \nprovisions in this amendment when they voted for the balanced budget \nconstitutional amount.\n  I hope that they will join in support of these very items which would \nprovide an assurance that the conditions of this agreement would indeed \nbe met.\n  Senator Inhofe and I have combined forces on another amendment. I \nwanted to thank him for his cooperation in getting that done.\n  I yield the remaining time to Senator Inhofe.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I thank my colleague from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Perhaps I \ndidn't understand the Senator from Missouri. Was the Senator yielding \ntime to the Senator from Oklahoma to speak on the Ashcroft amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair understands that the Senator from \nMissouri yielded his remaining time to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If I could be recognized for a point of clarification, I \nbelieve that the Senator from Missouri was recognized for the purpose \nof explaining the provisions of the amendment 323, and inadvertently \nsaid ``322.''\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I had two amendments. The second amendment I was going \nto use at the same time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. We are going to ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I would like to ask for the yeas and nays on amendment \n322.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to congratulate our colleague from \nMissouri.\n  This is a very important amendment. Quite frankly, the only reason \nanybody would oppose this amendment is if they don't believe that this \nbudget agreement is going to produce a balanced budget. I think this \nbudget agreement is really short on enforcement. I think enforcement is \nvery important in a budget because you are talking about what you are \ngoing to do 5 years from now.\n  We all know the old adage: ``After all is said and done more is said \nthan done.'' And in politics that adage should grow by some multiple. \nIn fact, we have stood on the floor of the Senate on many occasions and \npounded our chests and said we balanced the Federal budget. It is not \nbalanced yet. And, in fact, we are a long way from the goal line.\n  As I pointed out yesterday, 97 cents out of every dollar of deficit \nreduction, as compared to current discretionary spending and current \nlaw, in this budget comes from assuming good things are going to happen \nin the future.\n  What the amendment of the Senator from Missouri does is say that is \njust great, but, if it doesn't happen, we are going to have an \nenforcement procedure that says you have to have a three-fifths vote to \nraise the debt to pay for this deficit, that you have to balance the \nbudget by the year 2002 unless 60 percent of the Senators vote to waive \nit. Obviously, they are going to be under political pressure to live up \nto their promise--and that you have to have a rollcall vote and a \nconstitutional majority on raising taxes.\n  These provisions weren't made up by the Senator from Missouri last \nnight. These provisions weren't simply dreamed up or written on the \nback of an envelope. We enshrined these agreements forever when 66 \nMembers of the Senate voted to make this part of the Constitution of \nthe United States of America. In fact, had two of our colleagues, who \nhad pledged to vote for it, not changed their votes it would be part of \nthe Constitution today, and this wouldn't even be needed.\n  If 66 Members of the Senate were willing to make this the \nConstitution, why couldn't 51 of them vote to make it part of this \nbudget agreement, that for the next 5 years as a part of this budget \nagreement we have the same enforcement procedures we would have had had \none more person voted for the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution?\n  So I want to congratulate our colleague from Missouri. I think this \nis a very important amendment. If you have any concerns that Congress \nmay not live up to what it said, if you have any reason to be \nsuspicious that all may not go well or as planned and you want to buy a \nlittle insurance policy that says there is something different about \nthis budget than all of the others that we have adopted, vote for this \namendment. I intend to vote for it. I think it is a very important \namendment. I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I thank our colleague for yielding me this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment, numbered \n323, to the desk, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A second-degree amendment is not in order \nuntil all time has expired on the amendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Does the Senator from Missouri yield back all his time on \n322?\n  Parliamentary inquiry: As I understand it, if the Senator from \nMissouri would yield back the remaining time on amendment No. 322, then \nit would be in order for me to send this to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator from Missouri and the Senators \nwho control the time yield all time, then the amendment would be in \norder.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I send a \nsecond-degree amendment to the desk and ask for its consideration and \nthat it be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma has the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield such time in opposition to the \namendment by the Senator from Missouri to the Senator from New Jersey \nas he may use.\n\n[[Page S4971]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair.\n  As we examine the amendment sent up by the Senator from Missouri, it \nkind of recalls some other debates that we have had here, and he so \naptly reminded us, that included the balanced budget debates and the \nsubsequent vote that took place. And it therefore seems to me to be out \nof range to attempt to do that on this budget resolution.\n  Frankly, in discussions that we have been having informally, it is my \nunderstanding that this amendment not only is opposed by me on behalf \nof the Democrats but also is opposed by the Republican management, and \nI certainly hope so because this is outside certainly the structure of \nthis budget resolution.\n  We are, Mr. President, working with a set of estimates. That is the \nbest that can be done. One cannot put this into concrete and say that \nabsolutely at the end of your fiscal year 1998 or even at the end of \nthe fiscal year 1997, which is relatively imminent, we are going to be \nable to precisely gauge exactly what the outcome is going to be. It \ncannot happen. So we are working with estimates.\n\n  But there is something else we are working with, and that is the good \nfaith of the institution. I have heard it said on this floor in recent \nmoments that the implication is that we in this body can't be trusted. \nAnd the words that were uttered came from a Member or Members of the \ninstitution.\n  I don't know who it is that can't be trusted. Is it everybody else \nexcept the speaker? Is it everybody on this side of the aisle? Is it \neverybody on that side of the aisle? The one thing I must tell you I \nfind difficult to comprehend--now, my background is business and I \nspent 30 years doing that. We didn't find everybody always meeting \ntheir word. But typically, if someone had a position of responsibility, \nyou gave them the benefit of trust. And if there was, sometimes, a \nmisunderstanding on an agreement, why, we chalked it up to a \nmisunderstanding, we chalked it up to a misinterpretation. But to \nsuggest that there is no trust in the U.S. Senate, sent here, 100 of \nus, by 260 million people--what fools those people are to send us here. \nWe can't be trusted. You hear it coming from those who work here, those \nwho have been sent here: Oh, no, we can't be trusted.\n  I will tell you this. I don't know anybody here--anybody here, on \neither side of the aisle, who can't be trusted. I may disagree with \ntheir point of view. I may disagree with their judgment. I wouldn't \nsay--I am trying to think of the instances where, perhaps, in my 15 \nyears here, that I have run into someone who you just can't trust. \nThere are rumors about a person here or there. But to suggest that the \nbody is not trustworthy and therefore we need special shackles, special \nhandcuffs, special rules, special procedures?\n  It is not enough to say, look, I was sent here by, I don't know, 2 \nmillion people in the voting booths, or that I represent a State with 8 \nmillion people, or this one represents a State with almost 50 million \npeople, or that one represents a State with 18 million, or that one \nrepresents a State with 350,000 people--to say those people are either \nnaive, stupid, don't know what is going on? They made a choice that \nsuits their intellect and suits their view of what life is about, what \nthey need to carry on their responsibilities. I don't think we need \nthese constraints.\n  I want to look at the record. I look at a record and if we get \npartisan about this, I look at a record of two parties, one Republican, \none Democrat. The Republicans came into power in full force in 1980. \nPresident Reagan was a popular President, among the most popular in the \nhistory of the country. He came in, made decisions about tax cuts, $2.8 \ntrillion worth of tax cuts--$2.8 trillion. By the way, in this budget, \nwe have $250 billion, and there is a fair amount of debate. I didn't \nhear a lot of people say, don't trust him. It was voted, it was part of \nthe law, and we succeeded in creating skyrocketing deficits, year after \nyear, growing more each year than the year before, until we were almost \nat our wit's end.\n  In 1992, a Democrat was elected President, a Democrat from the tax-\nand-spend party. That Democrat brought the budget deficit down from \n$290 billion to what is anticipated this year to be below $70 billion, \n1992-97, 5 years' worth. We have been doing pretty good. That, to me, \nlooks like we kept our word, all of us, because we have legislated. We \nhave been lucky, too. We have had a very good economy to bolster the \nrevenue side of things.\n  But Government is smaller than it was by a significant measure, over \na couple of hundred thousand people. We have tightened up in lots of \nways that needed tightening up, and the results are pretty good. We \nhave close to 12 million new jobs, unemployment is at its lowest point \nin 24 years, inflation at a steady rate, very low. There is not too \nmuch concern--a little worry, but it's not like it used to be. It's not \nlike it was when it finally worked its way up to 21-or-so percent some \nyears ago. It has been modest. Things have been happening.\n  Our tax-to-GDP ratio is the lowest among the industrialized nations. \nOur ratio of deficit to GDP, very low. Signs are pretty good. Is this \ngoing to last forever? I don't know. Neither does anybody else here. Is \nit going to get worse immediately? No one knows that here, either.\n  We look at the statistics. They look pretty good: PPI down, CPI down, \neverything in the right direction. That, again, does not mean it is \ngoing to last, but it does mean this is a heck of a time to, after \nstruggling, struggling to get a balanced budget amendment on the \nbooks--and we are this close, Mr. President, this close to a balanced \nbudget. It can be done in this body within hours from now, within \nhours, 4 or 5 hours; pass a balanced budget amendment--a balanced \nbudget. I am sorry. A balanced budget. That was a slip of the tongue. \nNot one I meant to make, I can tell you. Within 4 hours, we can have a \nbalanced budget, bipartisan--their side, my side.\n  I don't know that we are walking arm in arm, but as I said for the \nnewspaper the other day, at least we are not looking nose to nose, we \nare looking shoulder to shoulder, which I think is a better way to do \nit, and feeling pretty good about a lot of hard work.\n\n  I don't get paid overtime. I don't want to get paid overtime. I did \nit because I took the job I wanted to have. I am so privileged to serve \nin this body. So many times I go over to my desk and I lift the top \ndrawer--this is for the Senator from Missouri. I lift the top of my \ndesk. It is right back there. Underneath that top, it says, ``Truman, \nMissouri.'' There is only one Truman I know, who was the President of \nthe United States. I think his name was Harry--``Truman, Missouri.'' \nThe man who stood for don't pass the buck: ``The buck stops here.'' The \ndistinguished Senator from Missouri had served as Governor of that \nState. He is someone highly thought of. But I could not disagree with \nhim more on this resolution.\n  When I see things going as they are, and we have an opportunity for \nus to work in a bipartisan fashion, 6 weeks, roughly, of long days, \nlong nights of sitting across the table from one another--no growling, \nno grousing, no anger, no fits or bursts of temperament, walk out of \nthe room--none of that stuff. We disagreed. We discussed it. But nobody \ntried to put anything over on the other person. And we had the \nPresident's people in the room with us, three parties to the agreement.\n  And I tell you, talking for myself and for my colleagues over here, \nthere are things in here that we just don't like. I can be sure that \nthere are things over there that they just don't like. But in a \nconsensus arrangement--I have heard that even occurs sometimes in \nmarriage. Two people get along, have nice kids and all that. Sometimes \nthey disagree. Hard to believe?\n  In any event, here we are. We have worked together and we walked out \nof that room, that day, feeling pretty good, even though we had the \ndisagreements that followed on. We have worked, now, for these couple \nof days to try to get this agreement in place so it could go over to \nthe House, have a conference on it, get the President to sign it and \nsay to the American people--I hold my head high when I do it, in \nconscience. And my conscience--my name means a lot to me. It means a \nlot to me because whenever I am in here, I always remember that my \nparents were brought here as children by their parents from Europe--\npoor, hard-working people. They always said to me, ``Frank, get an \neducation. That's the\n\n[[Page S4972]]\n\nway up. That's the way you get out of this. That's the way you get out \nof the store,'' with my mother waiting on the tables, cleaning them off \nall day and all night.\n  So, my name means a lot to me. When I lent my support to this \nagreement, I did it feeling full well that I had done it with all the \nknowledge that I had available to me, that I did it in good conscience \nand that we were going to be able to get this agreement passed, out of \nthe way and passed, and that we would be working hard to make sure that \nwe met the objectives that are in here.\n  The budget amendment says--and I perhaps paraphrase here because I am \nnot reading from the amendment but I am reading from a summary. It \nrequires a three-fifths vote of the Members of each House to provide \nfor specific excess of outlays over receipts or to provide for such an \nincrease in the level of the public debt.\n  That is pretty significant. Normally, we operate with a majority, \nexcept in some special cases--veto override or supermajority that are \nrequired, sometimes, in budget affairs. But typically it is 51 votes \ntakes it all.\n  Here we say that, no, even though it is now in order, even though it \nis on paper, even though these are estimates, I once again say, and \neven though it was done with the best judgment that people could \nexercise, no, we are now going to go back to the debate on the balanced \nbudget amendment. That is essentially what this is. Because we saw it \ndefeated when it was presented here. It needed 67 votes. It got 66, as \nI remember. And one of the Senators on the floor before said that we \nwould have had a balanced budget amendment if a couple of people hadn't \nchanged their minds. We would have had it in place. It would have been \nattached to the Constitution.\n  Far be it. It took a lot of States. They had to make a lot of votes; \n50 of them had to vote to approve it before it got into place--not all \n50 of them, but three-quarters of them.\n  So it would not be in place. To now be doing a balanced budget \namendment when we have a balanced budget 5 years in duration, 10-year \nprojections, we don't expect--we could be wrong, but that's judgment. \nThat is why we were sent here. Use your judgment, make sure your \nconscience is clear in things that you do. We could be wrong, but it \nlooks in the 10 years, in the next 5-year cycle, that there will not be \nan explosion of growth in tax cuts, there won't be an explosion in the \nannual deficit, that we will be able to muster a surplus so we can \nstart paying down some of that debt and get rid of some of the interest \nwe have to pay every year. We have to pay more than a quarter of a \ntrillion dollars in interest every year that every citizen in this \ncountry pays for in one way or the other, that children, future \ngenerations, will be called upon to pay your debt. They didn't sign any \npapers to acquire that debt. But we are on the way to solving some of \nthose problems.\n  Now, when I look at this amendment, it says, further, that it waives \nthese provisions for any fiscal year in which a declaration of war is \nin effect, certainly, or the United States is engaged in a military \nconflict which causes an imminent and serious threat to national \nsecurity. Are there threats to our society other than war? Is \ninstability within our society a threat to this society? Is violence in \nthe street a threat to our society? Is constant tension and hostility \nbetween parts of our society, one with the other, classes in our \nsociety? I think that is a real threat to national security. But there \nare no provisions if we are all wrong and a recession starts; if, \nworse, a depression occurs. If we had the same rules in place today in \nthe early 1930's, then the Depression--everyone who knows anything \nabout business or economics, who studied the problem, will tell you the \nDepression would have been considerably ameliorated if we had \nunemployment insurance, if we had other protections for people during \nthat period of time.\n  I think, frankly, as we look at this amendment, demanding now a 60 \nperson vote in order to change things, to try and anticipate all the \nproblems you have, is a terrible mistake. I think it violates the \nstructure of the budget resolution. It will blow this agreement out of \nthe water absolutely, because I know that there are not enough people \nwho would vote to sustain a point of order if that is called upon. I \nexpect to do just that.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that we will leave well enough alone in \nthis case, get on with the business at hand, pass the balanced budget \nresolution, and let us start solving our problems and not create new \nones.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield such time on the amendment as I may use.\n  Mr. President, my colleague and ally from New Jersey a few moments \nago said of the amendment of the Senator from Missouri on this case I \ncould not disagree more. I must say I could not disagree less and still \ndisagree, but disagree I must do.\n  The reason I put it in that form is that the Senator from Missouri \nhas presented us with an amendment that is for all practical purposes \nin statutory form the constitutional amendment on the balanced budget \nthat was supported by almost but not quite two-thirds of the Members of \nthis body. It differs, of course, not just in being in budget \nresolution language but in being effective immediately rather than \nseveral years from now, and in dealing with declining budget deficits \nas if each of them was the triggering mechanism for the supermajority \nrequirements that are included within it.\n  It is, nevertheless, a theory with which this Senator and the manager \nof the bill, the Senator from New Mexico, agree. The point with which \nwe disagree, however, is the proposition that this philosophy should be \nadded to this budget resolution. The issue is an important one. It is \nan appropriate one to be debated.\n  I can remember personally a decade ago when I had serious enough \nreservations about a constitutional amendment on the balanced budget \nwhen I felt that this philosophy ought to be passed in the form of a \nstatute so that we could determine as a country whether or not it \nworked before we moved toward placing it in the Constitution. \nPersonally, I would still be willing to do that.\n  However, it is important enough, it is vital enough that it ought to \nbe debated independently of a budget resolution, which, as the Senator \nfrom New Jersey has said, marks the first time on which we have had a \nbudget resolution in the time that I have been here at least that was \nsupported largely by both sides of the aisle and in this case by the \nPresident of the United States.\n  And so while it is possible to argue, I suppose, that this amendment \ndoes not formally or technically breach the bipartisan agreement on the \nbudget, as did yesterday's amendment on a tobacco tax and several of \nthe other amendments that have been voted on here, it clearly breaches \nat the very least the spirit of this budget resolution agreement. It \nalso clearly represents a vitally important policy decision which \nshould not be debated for an hour or 2 hours as an amendment to this \nbill and then added to it.\n  It is for that reason, keeping what this Senator believes to be a \ncommitment to pass this budget resolutions essentially in the form in \nwhich it was presented to this body, that I regret to say it is not \nacceptable to the leadership on this side as it is not to the \nleadership on the other side.\n  Now, Mr. President, for the information of other Members of the \nSenate, when all time has been yielded back on this debate--and I \nintend to yield our time back in just a moment--the Senator from New \nJersey will raise a point of order against this amendment. I believe \nthat the Senator from Missouri will move that the point of order be \nwaived, will ask for a rollcall vote on that subject, and then we will \nstack that rollcall vote after the one previously ordered. We will go \non to a similar but not identical amendment that will be sponsored \njointly by the Senator from Missouri and the Senator from Oklahoma, and \nI suspect, although I cannot guarantee this, that when debate on that \nis completed we will probably have a series of votes, all of the votes \nthat have been stacked at that time, which might very possibly take \nplace at or around 6 o'clock.\n\n  With that, Mr. President, I am prepared to and I do yield back the \nremainder of my time on this amendment.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I yield back the remainder of my time on amendment 322.\n\n[[Page S4973]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the pending amendment is not germane \nand therefore I raise a point of order that violates section 305(b)(2) \nof the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I move to waive the point of ordered and \nI ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask that the amendment be temporarily \nset aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 323\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I call up amendment 323.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 323.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record of May 21, 1997.)\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I believe we are prepared to agree that \ndebate on this amendment be limited to 30 minutes in total.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would ask the Senator from Missouri \nif he would permit the exchange that we expected to have--the chairman \nof the Budget Committee is here--and that was that we would switch side \nto side. Now, we have had an amendment from Senator Gramm, from the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, one amendment from the Senator from \nMissouri. Meanwhile, a commitment was made to the Senator from \nMinnesota, who has been waiting virtually all day. We have not had a \nchance to deal with it and I think----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think unless Senator Wellstone and you want to yield \na second opportunity to our side, we have had three in a row. I did not \nknow Senator Ashcroft was going to offer two. I said let's have one. \nAnd if you do not want to yield to them, they will be next after \nSenator Wellstone.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, that would be my preference.\n  I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 313, as modified\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I call up amendment 313.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 313.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record of May 21, 1997.)\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 313, as Modified\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify my \namendment.\n  Mr. GORTON. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is made.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this is a typographical error. I \nbelieve we sent it to the staff earlier.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to work this out. We had given it to \nSenator Domenici's staff several hours ago.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. I inform the Senator from Minnesota there will be no \nobjection to his modifying his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk. I \nthank my colleague from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 3, line 3, increase the amount by $1,650,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 4, increase the amount by $2,190,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 5, increase the amount by $3,116,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 6, increase the amount by $4,396,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 7, increase the amount by $5,012,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 11, increase the amount by $1,650,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 12, increase the amount by $2,190,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 13, increase the amount by $3,116,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 14, increase the amount by $4,396,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 15, increase the amount by $5,012,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 4, increase the amount by $5,400,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 5, increase the amount by $1,601,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 6, increase the amount by $2,539,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 7, increase the amount by $4,141,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 8, increase the amount by $6,543,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 12, increase the amount by $1,650,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 13, increase the amount by $2,190,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 14, increase the amount by $3,116,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 15, increase the amount by $4,396,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 16, increase the amount by $5,012,000,000.\n       On page 21, line 25, increase the amount by $1,101,000,000.\n       On page 22, line 1, increase the amount by $1,690,000,000.\n       On page 22, line 8, increase the amount by $2,039,000,000.\n       On page 22, line 9, increase the amount by $2,616,000,000.\n       On page 22, line 16, increase the amount by $3,541,000,000.\n       On page 22, line 17, increase the amount by $3,796,000,000.\n       On page 22, line 24, increase the amount by $5,843,000,000.\n       On page 22, line 25, increase the amount by $4,312,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 6, increase the amount by $400,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 7, increase the amount by $400,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 14, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 15, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 22, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 23, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 5, increase the amount by $600,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 6, increase the amount by $600,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 13, increase the amount by $700,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 14, increase the amount by $700,000,000.\n       On page 38, line 14, decrease the amount by $700,000,000.\n       On page 38, line 15, decrease the amount by $2,700,000,000.\n       On page 40, line 17, decrease the amount by $5,000,000,000.\n       On page 41, line 7, decrease the amount by $5,012,000,000.\n       On page 41, line 8, decrease the amount by $16,364,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 21, increase the amount by $1,101,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 22, increase the amount by $44,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 24, increase the amount by $2,039,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 25, increase the amount by $1,366,000,000.\n       On page 44, line 2, increase the amount by $3,541,000,000.\n       On page 44, line 3, increase the amount by $2,546,000,000.\n       On page 44, line 5, increase the amount by $5,843,000,000.\n       On page 44, line 6, increase the amount by $4,312,000,000.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this amendment assumes increases in \nfunding for Head Start and early start, child nutrition programs, \nschool construction, and this additional funding will be paid for by \nreducing the tax benefits to the top 2 percent of income earners in the \nUnited States as well as by reducing tax benefits that are commonly \ncharacterized as corporate welfare tax loopholes.\n  Mr. President, it has been said about this budget--I might ask my \ncolleague from North Dakota, does he have an inquiry?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator will yield to me for a question.\n\n[[Page S4974]]\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the fact we are on a very important \namendment the Senator from Minnesota is offering. I am increasingly \nconcerned this afternoon. It is now 5:30 in the afternoon. As the \nSenator from Minnesota knows, a number of us in this Chamber have been \nworking on a disaster supplemental bill providing disaster relief in an \nappropriations bill for people who have been involved in disasters, and \nwe are nearing a point in time when time will run out on the passage of \nthe bill. And some say, well, maybe the disaster bill will not be \npassed before the Senate goes out for the Memorial Day recess. Some \nothers say, well, maybe not only will we not pass the emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill that we have been working on for \nweeks, but we will not pass the emergency portion of it.\n  I ask the Senator from Minnesota, is it not the case that in Grand \nForks and East Grand Forks we have 10,000, 15,000 people who are waking \nup not in their own beds because they are homeless and a disaster bill \nmust be passed? We cannot adjourn this session of Congress and take a \nrecess unless a disaster bill is passed that deals with these \ncritically needed funds. We have victims of floods and fires and \nblizzards out there who are waiting for a disaster bill to be passed. I \nam not suggesting here anyone is to blame for anything. I am just \nsaying in the waning hours, we need to find a way to bring a disaster \nbill to the floor of the Senate.\n  Is it not the case we have thousands of people homeless in your area, \nEast Grand Forks, and in Grand Forks who are awaiting some word about \nwhether a disaster bill is going to be passed?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from North \nDakota, I am pleased he raised this question. I certainly want to speak \nabout this amendment. I think it goes to the heart of the question of \nwhat the budget is about. But I think it is important to take a few \nmoments right now in the Chamber to speak about this. I say to the \nSenator from North Dakota I know how hard he has worked on this for \npeople in North Dakota. I know how hard Senator Conrad has worked. I \nknow how hard Senator Grams, the other Senator from Minnesota, has \nworked and Senator Johnson and Senator Daschle.\n  I just think that would be unconscionable. I hope this does not \nhappen, the House of Representatives going into recess without getting \nthe work done. Because in this particular case --it is quite one thing \nto say we want to get the work done, for example, on the budget, though \nthe truth of the matter is 10 days from now the budget could be done \nand it really would make no difference. In this particular piece of \nlegislation, we are talking about emergency assistance for people. This \nneeds to be done right away.\n  So I say to my colleague, we cannot adjourn. I mean there is no way \nwe can adjourn until this work is done. He is quite right in the \nquestion that he put to me.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator would yield for one additional question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Certainly.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the disasters that have occurred in our \ncountry that now result in a requirement to pass a disaster bill have \nbeen the most significant disasters that occurred in North Dakota \nstatehood: 3 years worth of snow in 3 months; a 500-year flood in the \nRed River; thousands and thousands of people homeless, still homeless.\n  I appreciate very much the cooperation that we have seen here in the \nU.S. Senate in trying to write a disaster bill. We got one out of \ncommittee and got into conference. I am a conferee. I know a lot of \nMembers of the Senate--the chairman of the committee, the ranking \nmember, and others--have been working hard to get this done.\n  I do not know what is happening on the other side, but I know this: \nIf the result of the coming hours will be that there are those who want \nto adjourn the Congress and go on a Memorial Day recess and decide that \nit is all right later to pass some kind of disaster relief bill, I will \nsay to them, it is not all right with this Senator and not all right \nwith a number of others, because people awaiting disaster relief are \ngoing to understand that this Senate has an obligation to do it.\n  We must not and cannot take a Memorial Day recess until we have \naddressed the disaster needs of victims who have suffered now for \nweeks.\n  In Grand Forks alone, nearly 15,000 of whom are still homeless, we do \nnot need those folks to be looking at the Congress and saying ``Why? \nWhy on Earth were we not able to get the help we were promised and help \nthat was needed?'' I want them at the end of this session to be able to \nsay thanks to Members of Congress who worked hard to say to them, \n``You're not alone. Here's some help. Here's some help to reconstruct \nand recover.'' I want them to say thanks for that.\n  But I just say to my colleagues, I do not quite know where we are. I \nworry about some of the things I am hearing in the last hour or so. At \nthe end of this process, we must have passed some kind of disaster \nrelief bill. This Congress cannot--cannot--possibly adjourn for the \nMemorial Day recess and leave the victims of those disasters wanting \nand needing help that will not come.\n  So I appreciate the Senator from Minnesota yielding.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, that is fine.\n  I want to go on with this amendment, but I see my other colleague \nfrom North Dakota on the floor. If he has an inquiry to put to me, I \nwould be pleased to hear from him.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank my colleague from Minnesota.\n  I just say, I talked to the mayor now of Grand Forks, our good, \nmutual friend, Mayor Owens. I am sure she is in contact with the mayor \nof East Grand Forks over in Minnesota, Mayor Stauss, your good friend. \nShe has said to me that, if Congress adjourns without taking action, it \nwill be a terrible blow, given the fact that this city that was \nentirely evacuated, nearly all 50,000 citizens had to leave their \nhomes. Many of them still have not been able to return.\n  The supplemental has been going through Congress with good, \nbipartisan cooperation, certainly an excellent effort here in the \nSenate, one which has been on both sides of the aisle very \naccommodating, very willing to help out.\n  I see our good friend, the Senator from New Jersey, who is the \nranking member on the Budget Committee, who personally came forward \nwith a very generous contribution to help the people in Grand Forks and \nEast Grand Forks, which we deeply appreciate. Now we are being told \nthat there is a view by some in the other body that they should just \nleave town without taking further action. That would be a disaster all \nof its own.\n  I say to my colleague, and I ask him, wouldn't that be a disaster in \nand of itself to say to those local officials, ``We can't tell you what \nresources you have available to rebuild because we've got to take a \nbreak''? I mean, we could understand if they cannot get the entire \ndisaster bill done, although that ought to be the first priority. But \nif they cannot get that done, they should at least be able to get the \nemergency measures in that disaster bill done so those towns are not \nleft in the lurch.\n  I ask my colleague from Minnesota, wouldn't it be a disaster, a \nsecond disaster--actually a third disaster--for the people of our \ncommunities if Congress decided just to leave town before taking action \nat least on the emergency measure?\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I respond to both my colleagues--and \nplease understand I think about what is happening to the people in \nGrand Forks. Everybody had to leave their homes. Those people were \nrefugees. I know the pain of the people in East Grand Forks and other \ncommunities of Minnesota.\n  I say to both my colleagues that this is a nightmare. I just--this is \na nightmare. I guess I never would have believed it, that we are on the \nfloor right now--this is away from the amendment. We will get back to \nit, I say to the Senator from New Jersey. But my colleagues come to the \nfloor and raise these questions.\n  This is a nightmare. I never would have dreamed that there would even \nbe any thought that we would go into recess without finally providing \nthis assistance to people. People need this. These people are trying to \nfigure out how to get back to their homes. People are homeless.\n  We cannot--we cannot--leave without doing this. I have heard that \nover in the House there is some discussion they are going to just \nadjourn.\n\n[[Page S4975]]\n\n  I just make a plea to Democrats, Republicans, and the independent in \nthe House, everybody, every breed of political person, regardless of \nyour point of view, please do not do this. I think from our point of \nview, it is just unacceptable.\n  I mean, I think all three of us are saying, we just cannot have a \nCongress going into recess without passing through at least this \nemergency assistance. What people do not agree on, I say to both my \ncolleagues, they can set aside; but what we cannot set aside is this \nemergency.\n  Let me emphasize that word again, ``emergency'' assistance that \npeople need. They need it now. It would be the worst possible thing for \nthis Congress to go into recess without providing this.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator would yield for one additional \nquestion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Minnesota, I \nappreciate your yielding to me.\n  The flood that occurred--let me take Grand Forks and East Grand Forks \nto discuss why we have the need for an emergency response here.\n  The Red River flood was a flood that became 150 miles by 40 miles \nnearly. You could not see a river; it became a huge lake in the Red \nRiver Valley. But the point of it all is this. When this flood came--\nlet me just use Grand Forks, ND, and East Grand Forks, MN, represented \nby Senator Grams and Senator Wellstone who worked so hard on this. Nine \nthousand people--when those dams broke and that water came rushing down \nthe streets, the people got out of their houses, in most cases with \nonly the clothes on their backs. They rushed to the end of the streets, \nwere pulled up by National Guard trucks and by other devices, and they \nlost their homes, lost their vehicles.\n  Then we saw them at a hangar, big aircraft hangar out at the Grand \nForks Air Force base sleeping on cots--4,000 of them from every other \nsmall town for 100 miles around.\n  In Grand Forks, 50,000 people, 90 percent of the town was flooded. I \nwas in a boat of the Coast Guard in the main street of Grand Forks, ND. \nYou would hit a car. You could not see the car. All you could see was 2 \ninches of the top of the radio antenna.\n  In the downtown, a major fire destroyed 11 of the huge buildings in \ndowntown Grand Forks in the historic district.\n  In the middle of all of this, with two cities evacuated, we had the \nhead of FEMA come to our region, James Lee Witt, and say, ``We're going \nto help you.'' We had the Vice President come to our region and say, \n``You're not alone.'' We had President Clinton in Air Force One fly \ninto Grand Forks and East Grand Forks and put his arm around some of \nthose victims living in that aircraft hangar, and he said, ``We're with \nyou. The rest of the country wants to extend a helping hand and say \nyou're not alone.''\n  We have had enormous cooperation from everybody. In this Chamber, the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee and the ranking member and the \nsubcommittees have done a remarkable job of saying to us, ``We want to \nhelp you.'' And they put in the disaster supplemental bill the \nresources that were needed. Congratulations to them. Every single one \nof them have come to us and said, ``We want to help you.'' And they \nprovided the resources in this bill here in the Senate that we then \nsent to conference.\n  What a remarkable effort by the Members of the Senate on a bipartisan \nbasis. Then we went to conference. In fact, all of the disaster issues \nthat are important to us to provide the necessary resources in \nconference are now agreed to. We do not have any outstanding issues. \nThey are agreed to.\n  Why is it important that this get done? Because in the cities of \nGrand Forks and East Grand Forks--the Red River runs in the middle of \nthose two cities--they have to establish a new floodway. When they \nestablish a new floodway, it means there will be hundreds and hundreds \nof homes that will no longer be able to be located there. Most of them \nare now destroyed anyway. In order to describe the new floodway and \nhave a buyout of those homes, those mayors need to have the resources \nto begin that process now.\n\n  Today, they do not have the resources, so those hundreds of \nfamilies--well over 1,000, incidentally, are near and in that \nfloodway--they now cannot be told by anyone, will their home be there \nor will it not be there? Will it be bought out or not? No one knows and \nno one can know until the resources are available to have that buyout. \nThat is why this is urgent. If it waits 1 week or 2 weeks, they cannot \nmake those decisions. Those folks can never move back into their homes. \nThey cannot move back into their homes.\n  So anybody who says, ``This is not urgent. It can wait. It can wait 1 \nweek or 2 weeks,'' let me give them the names of the young boys and the \nyoung girls who will sleep on cots, sleep in shelters, sleep in strange \nhomes during those 2 weeks, part of which Congress will have been in \nrecess. And then have them send them a letter to say, you know, we just \ncould not get this done.\n  Not getting it done is not acceptable. We have done our work. The \ndisaster supplemental is largely agreed to in all of these areas. We \nmust at a minimum take that out of the disaster supplemental, those \nresources that are necessary to help those people, and pass that on an \nemergency basis. The failure to do that--a decision, for example, by \nthe other body to say we will not do that, we are going to take a \nrecess, will be a devastating blow to people who do not deserve that, \nhaving been victimized by these disasters.\n  So the Senator from Minnesota has been generous in yielding for a \nquestion. I just make the point that this Congress cannot adjourn \nwithout addressing the emergency needs of this disaster.\n  Do I feel passionate about this? You're darn right I do. I am not \ngoing to let 15,000 people who are not yet back into their homes be \ntold that Congress took a break for Memorial Day and the people who are \nhomeless can wait a couple of weeks for a solution to this problem. I \nwill not be a part of that kind of decision.\n  So if there are those who think that any adjournment resolution will \npass by this Congress failing to pass an emergency bill dealing with \nthis disaster, it is going to be a long, long few days.\n  I ask for the cooperation of everyone. We have had wonderful \ncooperation of Republicans and Democrats, and I might say in the Senate \nI cannot feel prouder of all the people I have worked with on the \nAppropriations Committee. I will just encourage and urge everyone \ninvolved in this process to decide and determine that we must get this \ndone.\n  I appreciate very much the Senator yielding. I understand that you \nhave an important amendment and I apologize for intervening on that, \nbut I think this message must be understood. This is not an option. We \nmust pass a disaster relief bill.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank both my colleagues, and I \nappreciate their graciousness. I think that what both my colleagues are \ntrying to say is we have an emergency now, and, Mr. President, I just \ndo not think there is any way that this Congress can go into recess \nwithout passing this disaster relief bill. I mean, it is just too \nimportant. I mean, it truly is an emergency measure, and both my \ncolleagues were speaking to that. I have told them I am in complete \nagreement.\n  So let us hope that the House will be able to do the work. We have \nhad great cooperation over here on the Senate side.\n  Mr. President, the discussion about the budget, much of the \ndiscussion is about the balance, that this is a responsible budget, \nthis is the responsible thing to do.\n  Mr. President, let me just be really clear. I have some good friends \nwho believe that. I respect their work. I have tremendous respect for \ntheir work. But from my point of view, as a Senator from Minnesota, \nwhen you do not invest to rebuild schools that are crumbling across \nthis country--7 million children's schools with asbestos and lead--I do \nnot think that is the responsible thing to do.\n  When there are not the funds to assure that every child who now goes \nwithout health care still does not receive that health care, to me, \nthat is not responsible. And when there are not the funds and there is \nnot the investment to make sure that, in fact, there is a school \nbreakfast program for\n\n[[Page S4976]]\n\nchildren, for whom that really is their only nutritious meal in the \nmorning so that they are not going to school hungry, when there is not \nthe investment in nutrition programs to make sure children are not \nmalnourished in America--there are some 13 million children that are \nnow malnourished in America--that does not seem balanced or responsible \nto me.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Wellstone be \npermitted to follow the amendment he has with a second amendment that \nhe has pending and that there be 30 minutes available to the Senator \nfrom Minnesota on both amendments, and for the opposition on both \namendments that we have 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from New Mexico, and on my second \namendment I know I will be joined by Senator Reed from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. President, this amendment that is before the Senate right now \nessentially says this. We make sure that the tax cuts in this budget \nresolution do not go to the top 2 percent of the population. We look at \nsome of the loopholes and deductions, and what Senators have called \ncorporate welfare. There is several hundred billion dollars that fits \ninto this category.\n  Instead, we take the following steps, which seems so reasonable. \nFirst of all, since we cut child nutrition programs by roughly $3 \nbillion for 6 years, this amendment restores $2.7 billion. Let me \nrepeat that: Last year, we made cuts in child nutrition programs. This \namendment says, can we not take some of this out of corporate welfare? \nCan we not take it out of loopholes for billionaires? Can we not make \nsure that the tax cuts go to middle-income families and small business \npeople and not the top 1 percent and 2 percent? And instead, could we \nnot provide just a little bit, over 5 years, $2.7 billion, could we not \ninvest that in nutritional programs for some of the poorest and most \nvulnerable children in America? They do matter. They do count.\n  Mr. President, currently, there are 6.5 million children who \nparticipate in the school breakfast program. However, in many States, \nthis program reaches only 50 percent of those eligible. In the State of \nMinnesota, the school breakfast program, much like the national, \nreaches just under 50 percent of those students eligible.\n  Mr. President, what we are talking about is all across the country we \nhave schools who are not able to participate. The welfare bill last \nyear wiped out grants for schools to start up or expand school \nbreakfast programs, and we have 13 million malnourished children in \nAmerica. I do not know how my colleagues think some of these children \nwill do well in school when they come to school hungry. I have talked \nto kindergarten teachers in Minnesota, and every single Senator here, I \nthink, has had similar experiences with their teachers who surely say \nit breaks their heart to know some of the students in their class come \nto school hungry.\n  Mr. President, there is another food nutrition program, the summer \nfood service program. Many of my colleagues may not be aware of it, but \nI want you to be aware of it because these children, when they are not \nin school, are no longer able to receive school lunch or breakfast if \nthat program is not available now during the summer. What we try to do \nis serve meals at summer schools or recreational centers or other \nnonprofit groups--a lunch, a breakfast or a snack--some way of making \nsure that these children have at least one nutritious meal a day.\n  Over 14 million children, unfortunately, are low income enough to be \neligible, and only 2 million are served--only 2 million are served. In \nMinnesota, only 16 percent of low-income children who are served \nthroughout the school year are served during the summer.\n  Mr. President, is it too much to ask to take just a little bit from \nloopholes, deductions for billionaires, large multinational \ncorporations, and others that do not need it and invest a little bit in \nnutrition programs to make sure the children in our country have at \nleast one nutritious meal?\n  Mr. President, the Head Start Program has been discussed so there is \nno need for me to go into it in great detail but just to say one more \ntime, that the President, in his budget, in this budget proposal, \nintends to serve an additional 1 million children. That is fine until \nwe find out that that there are 2 million children who are eligible who \nare not participating. This does not even deal with Early Start, that \nis to say, age 2, age 1. So what this says is if we are serious about \ndoing well for all the children in this country, surely we will \ndramatically expand the number of children that can participate in Head \nStart. That is worth it. That is an investment, an investment all of us \ncan be proud of.\n\n  Mr. President, the final part, of school construction, and I do not \neven need to go into it, again, this amendment says invest the $5 \nbillion that was in the original agreement--at least that was being \nnegotiated; it was taken out. This is too painful a contrast. On the \none hand, tax cuts not targeted, going to be skewed to the very top of \nthe population; on the other hand, not a pittance when it comes to \ngoing after corporate welfare, but being unwilling to invest in \ncrumbling schools all across the country.\n  Mr. President, let me use this amendment for a final conclusion about \nthis budget. One more time, I have heard it said that this budget is \nbalanced, represents balanced values. I do not see the balance. I do \nnot see the balanced values when on the one hand the tax cuts are \nskewed to the top and on the other hand we do not invest in crumbling \nschools across the Nation. I do not see the balance when we cannot \ninvest in nutrition programs to make sure children are not hungry in \nAmerica. I do not see the balanced values when we talk about a \ncompelling problem of children going without adequate health care and \nwe are not willing to fully fund health care for those children.\n  I think this is a budget without a soul. It is interesting what is \nnot on the table. What is not on the table is the $12 billion more than \nthe Pentagon wanted. That is for defense. I would have thought we could \nhave used that for some of our investment. What is not on the table are \nthe tax preferences to special interests that are, quite candidly, a \nresult of those who make the large contributions and have the power. \nWhat is not on the table is the deterioration of public institutions \nwhich are supposed to be so important to the quality of our lives. If \nwe are going to rebuild a sense of community in America, Mr. President, \nthat means attending to this deterioration. We have fewer good schools, \nfewer good libraries, and too many hospitals and clinics that are \nunable to provide the best care. This budget does not build a bridge to \nthe next century. We do not invest in these critical areas of life.\n  Mr. President, what is not on the table, perhaps most of all, is a \nset of social arrangements that allows children to be the most poverty \nstricken group in America. There is no concept of justice or virtue \nthat justifies our willingness to allow millions of children to suffer \ninvoluntary poverty. What principle can we possibly invoke to absolve \nourselves of responsibility for the fate of children too young to \ncomprehend their expulsion from the American promise, denied the \npleasures of childhood, their natural capacity stifled, their mind and \nspirit under attack from birth? Their impoverishment is our disgrace \nand it is a betrayal of our Nation's heritage.\n  Mr. President, if this balanced budget agreement is to be the great \naccomplishment of 8 years of a Democratic Presidency, then history will \njudge us harshly. This agreement is a triumph of the past. This is not \na bridge to the century to come.\n  Mr. President, we have lost our way. I say this to the Democratic \nParty, to some of my colleagues I think we have lost our way. Our \nparty, from Jefferson to Jackson to Roosevelt to Kennedy was a party \nthat stood for justice, a party that expanded opportunities for \ncitizens. We have always been at our best when our party has been there \nfor people.\n  Mr. President, this budget does not represent the best of the \nDemocratic Party. This budgets turns our Nation's gaze away from too \nmuch of what is important about America--equality of opportunity, \njustice, the very essence\n\n[[Page S4977]]\n\nof our Nation. Mr. President, for that reason, I will vote against this \nbudget resolution.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 313, as Further Modified\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Mr. President, I call up amendment numbered 314.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], for himself, \n     Mr. Reed, Mr Bingaman, and Mr. Moynihan, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 314.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record of May 21, 1977.)\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent Senator Moynihan be added as a \ncosponsor, along with Senator Reed of Rhode Island and Senator \nBingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  I yield 10 minutes to my colleague from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I want to thank my colleague from Minnesota for yielding me \nthis time and also for sponsoring this amendment along with Senator \nBingaman and Senator Moynihan.\n  Today we are offering an amendment to increase the maximum Pell grant \nto $3,500. The Pell grant holds a very special meaning for me. In the \nlast 6 years as a Member of the other body I have worked to open up \nfurther access to higher education. The foundation of that access to \nhigher education is the Pell grant.\n  As you know it is probably the enduring legacy of my predecessor, \nSenator Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island. One of his most significant \naccomplishments was the creation of the basic educational opportunity \ngrant program in 1972 during the reauthorization of the Higher \nEducation Act. Later, this basic opportunity grant was named in his \nhonor and has become the famous Pell grant. Its purpose then and now is \nto assist low-income Americans to gain access to postsecondary \neducation, access which is critical not only to their future but to the \nfuture of this Nation.\n  Going back to the very beginning of the Pell grants, the avowed \npurpose was to ``in combination with reasonable family and student \ncontributions and other Federal grant aid meet at least 75 percent of \nthe student's costs of attendance.'' Sadly, we have not met that 75 \npercent, and we need, in fact, to raise the Pell grant so that we can \nbegin to recoup some of the original purpose and allow students to meet \nthe significant cost increases in higher education.\n  This program was premised on Senator Pell's belief, which is my \nbelief, and indeed I believe the belief of so many people in this \nChamber, that everyone who is qualified should have the opportunity to \npursue higher education. The Pell grant has been the cornerstone of \nthis effort for many, many years. Since its creation, over 60 million \nPell grants have been awarded, providing over $75 billion in aid to \nstudents across the Nation.\n  In the first year of the program, 1973-74 over 176,000 students \nreceived the Pell grants. By 1980-81, this total had grown to 2.7 \nmillion recipients. Today, over 3.6 million American students receive \nPell grants. In my home State of Rhode Island, that includes 16,000 \nrecipients.\n\n  This investment clearly assists our neediest students. In 1995-96, 54 \npercent of Pell grant recipients had income levels of less than \n$10,000. Only 9 percent of recipients had incomes over $30,000.\n  In 1992, during the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, I \nworked closely with Senator Pell to increase the authorization level of \nthe maximum Pell grant from $3,100 to $3,700 for the 1993-94 award \ncycle with increases thereafter of $200 a year with the hopes that by \n1997-98 that we would have a maximum Pell grant on the order of $4,500 \na year. But, as we are all aware, we have not come even close to that \nfigure. Indeed, this year the appropriated maximum Pell grant was only \n$2,700--too little to meet the needs of so many students across this \ncountry.\n  This lack of resources has had a dramatic impact on students \nstruggling to go to college. Indeed, as college costs have increased \nover the past two decades at an annual rate of between 5 percent and 6 \npercent, consistently outpacing inflation, there has been a decline in \nthe purchasing power of the Pell grant.\n  According to the College Board, for 4-year private institutions the \naverage tuition has gone up by over $14,000 between 1980 and 1996. In \nthat same period the maximum Pell grant has only increased by about \n$950, and the average Pell grant only by about $733. As a result, back \nin 1980 the maximum Pell grant covered 33 percent of the tuition costs \nof a 4-year private institution. Now it only covers 14 percent. The \naverage Pell grant covered 18 percent of costs of 4-year private \ncolleges in 1980 and now it only covers 9 percent.\n\n[[Page S4978]]\n\n  If you look at public institutions--those great institutions which we \nfeel have a special obligation to educate all of our citizens, \nparticularly those coming from disadvantaged backgrounds--the maximum \nPell grant back in 1980 covered 72 percent of a 4-year public college. \nToday it only covers 22 percent.\n  As I said before, the grant has not hardly kept up with inflation. If \nwe had simply paid the Pell grant at inflation we would today be \nlooking at not a $2,700 maximum grant but a $4,300 maximum grant.\n  So, before us we have the obligation to raise the maximum Pell grant. \nI am pleased to note that the proposal in the budget does increase it \nby $300. But that is not sufficient to keep up with the accelerating \ncosts that I have described. The Wellstone-Reed amendment builds on \nthis request within this budget--the President's request--by increasing \nthe maximum Pell grant from $2,700 to $3,500. This would be a $500 \nincrease above the President's proposal.\n  It calls for a $6 billion investment over five years by an offset of \nadditional reductions in corporate tax loopholes and corporate welfare \nto fund this increase. By increasing the Pell grant to $3,500 we would \nbe able to extend this grant to several hundred thousand more students. \nThe average Pell award among poorest students would increase by almost \na third.\n  And, Mr. President, we recognize--all of us--the absolute necessity \nof higher education. A college education really pays off. It pays off \nfor our country, and it pays off for individual graduates of college.\n  The National Bureau of Labor Statistics has estimated that 60 percent \nof all the new jobs between 1992 and the year 2005 will require an \neducation beyond high school. Without these skills, college and \npostsecondary technical school graduates will not be able to man the \neconomy of the 21st century. College education is also the key to \nhigher wages. And one thing that we have been talking about repeatedly \nhere is how do we raise the wages of Americans to give them a fair \nshare in the progress of our economy? Education is the answer--higher \neducation particularly. This translates dramatically.\n  It is estimated that college graduates earn 50 percent more than high \nschool graduates. In 40 years of expected work a college graduate is \nestimated to earn over a half-million dollars more than a high school \ngraduate. All of this points to the critical need to provide additional \naccess to higher education.\n\n  Indeed, in terms of the national well being there have been studies, \none of which is Trends in American Economic Growth, that point to the \nfact that 37 percent of our growth as a Nation from 1929 to 1982 was \nattributable to education, and particularly higher education.\n  So not to invest in Pell grants, not to invest in opportunities for \nAmericans to seek higher education, will I think undercut the goal we \nall have of growing and providing for an expanding and productive \neconomy.\n  So the amendment before us today is a step in the right direction, to \nprovide more access to higher education, to allow particularly students \nfrom low-income households to go to school, to learn skills, to work in \nthis economy, and to build strong communities so that we prosper not \nonly economically but as citizens in a community of other citizens.\n  If we shortchange the Pell grant and other educational programs, we \nwill be reaping a very short and very transparent economy, one that in \nthe clear light of day in the future will reveal itself to be not a \nsavings but a massive lack of investment in the potential of our people \nand the success of our economy.\n  I hope that we will all join together, as the distinguished Senator \nfrom Minnesota has done, to put forth this amendment and support this \namendment and to increase our contribution to the Pell grant. Doing so \nI think will prepare us well for the new economy we face, an economy \nwhich demands these skills. The world is changed. Technology is forging \nnew boundaries. Capital investment respects no boundaries. The only \ndeterminant I believe that we will have to ensure that we maintain our \nsuperiority as an economy is that we have the best educated people with \naccess to higher education being the key to that success.\n  This amendment will I hope take that strong step forward to \naccelerate the process of education for all of our citizens to ensure \nthat we meet these technological challenges, to ensure that we have the \nbest prepared work force, and that we also have people who respect and, \nindeed, appreciate the value of education because they benefited from \nit.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Let me thank my colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Reed. The Pell \ngrant program has been a huge success. It has sort of been the \nfoundation of opportunity in our country. I feel like my words are also \ndedicated to Senator Claiborne Pell.\n  Let me just highlight a few things that Senator Reed had to say. And, \nagain, Senator Bingaman and Senator Moynihan are also original \ncosponsors.\n  What we are really doing is saying that we are pleased to see the tax \ndeductions. And we are pleased to see the tax credits. But we want to \nmake sure that we also provide the support for students and families \nwith incomes under $20,000 a year who may very well fall between the \ncracks.\n  So what this amendment does is it says for $6 billion more over 5 \nyears we take it out of a variety of different loopholes and deductions \nthat are called corporate welfare. Instead, we would invest it in the \nPell grant program. We would increase the award up to $3,500.\n  My colleague is right. The President has brought it from $2,700 to \n$3,000, and that is a modest increase. But we are pleased to see that. \nBut if we brought it up to $3,500, then what you would see is that the \nPell program would be available to several hundred thousand new \nstudents and the average Pell grant among low-income students would \nincrease by about a third.\n  One of the things that I want to say to my colleagues is that I hope \nbefore you vote on this amendment that there will be a way that you can \nbe in touch, if you are not already, with the higher education \ncommunities in your States, because I think you will hear over and over \nagain from them that there is no more important program than the Pell \ngrant program, if we want to target this assistance to make sure those \nstudents and those families most in need of assistance are able to have \naccess to higher education.\n\n  There is a shameful statistic in our country. The best predictor of \nattending college is family income. And only 16 percent of college \nfreshmen come from households with incomes under $20,000 a year. Only \nhalf of them graduate by age 24.\n  So just think about that for a moment. Only 8 percent of those women \nand men coming from households with incomes under $20,000 a year are \nable to graduate. And we are now moving toward an economy where the \nbrainpower of women and men in industry is going to matter more and \nmore. Many of these companies, by the way, are going to be small \nbusinesses--not necessarily large companies. And the whole key to \nwhether or not our children and our grandchildren are going to be able \nto do well economically is to be able to have access to higher \neducation.\n  I mean this really speaks not only to the whole issue of opportunity \nbut also to national security. We do well as a Nation when we make sure \nthat women and men have access to higher education so that they can do \nwell for themselves and their families and they can do well for our \ncountry.\n  So, again, I just want to make it clear that this is the choice. We \njust simply take $6 billion. And believe me, you know, you are looking \nat hundreds of billions of dollars when you look at this whole area of \ntax expenditures. We say find some of those loopholes and deductions \nand plug them. Mr. President, $6 billion over 5 years is not too much \nto expand the Pell grant program up to $3,500 which would make a huge \ndifference.\n  Again, what we would be talking about is several thousand new \nstudents. The Pell grant award would increase. It would make a huge \ndifference to low- and moderate-income families. It would make a huge \ndifference to access to higher education.\n  And if we want to talk about priorities, I don't see any reason why \nthis\n\n[[Page S4979]]\n\namendment would not be an amendment that would carry on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate. There are a whole bunch of loopholes and deductions. \nRegular people are pretty angry about them. They don't think that those \npeople who already make millions of dollars should get these breaks. \nAnd I think it is an absolute priority for people to make sure that \nhigher education is affordable.\n  This would really make this budget a budget with a strong higher \neducation component. This would really make this budget a budget that I \nthink Senators could feel really proud of when it came to higher \neducation. Senator Reed and I are really trying to improve upon this.\n  So, Mr. President, I am hopeful that we will get very, very strong \nsupport.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes and 45 seconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if my colleague wants to comment, I \nwould like to preserve 2 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the remarks \nof the Senator from Minnesota. He has stated very well what is at \nstake--which is the future of the country through the future of \nindividual students who have the opportunity to pursue higher \neducation.\n  There is something else that I might add. This proposed increase in \nthe Pell grant compliments some of the other provisions in this bill \nwhere the President has proposed higher education tax credits and tax \ndeductions which will assist, I think, generally speaking middle- and \nupper-income Americans. This Pell proposal would be particularly \neffective in helping low-income working Americans, and also \nparticularly effective in helping a new and growing category of \nstudents--not recent high school graduates but those people who through \ncircumstance were forced in midlife to retrain themselves. And there \nare so many in this situation nowadays due to downsizing.\n  So for all of these reasons this is a very useful and critical step.\n  I thank again the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank again the Senator from Rhode Island. He comes \nfrom a State with a great tradition of commitment to higher education.\n  To my colleagues, there are two amendments. One of them is, if you \nwill, very precious.\n  It is all about making sure that we at least provide some more \nfunding for nutritional programs for many poor children who are \nmalnourished in America; that we invest in Head Start; and that we \ninvest in our schools, too many of which are crumbling across the \ncountry, and we take that out of tax cuts that are skewed to the very \ntop and we say target those to middle-income and small businesses, and \nwe take it out of corporate welfare.\n  The second amendment Senator Reed and I offered is a higher education \namendment. This makes all the sense in the world. With this additional \n$6 billion of outlays over 5 years, we would be talking about a \ndramatic increase in access to higher education for many, many families \nall across the country in our States.\n  Mr. President, those are the two amendments. I am going to finish on \na positive note, but with 30 seconds left, I will just say one thing on \na negative note. I gather that I will be meeting with my colleagues \nfrom North Dakota, Minnesota, and South Dakota. Apparently the House is \nnot going to finish the disaster relief bill. I have to say on the \nfloor of the Senate, I cannot believe that this is happening. I think \nit is just unconscionable. It is irresponsible. This is emergency \nassistance that people in our States have been waiting for.\n  We as Senators are going to have to figure out exactly what we do \nnext, but I can assure you, and I think I speak for my colleagues, we \nwill be as strong as we can be, and we will fight as hard as we can for \npeople in our States. That is not meant to be showman-like. It is very \nsincere.\n  Finally, I thank my colleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, for \nhis graciousness. We were able to get the two amendments in in the 30-\nminute limit, and I thank my colleague. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to my fellow Senators, I have the \ngreatest respect for the two Senators who spoke. I do not know the new \nSenator from Rhode Island as well as I know Senator Wellstone, but I am \ngrowing in understanding and knowledge and put him in the category of a \nSenator I respect.\n  Mr. President, I actually believed, as I listened to those arguments, \nthat we did not have a budget before us; that somehow or another, we \nhad not done anything in this budget.\n  Let me tell the American people and Senators what we did in this \nbudget. Did anybody happen to catch the President's press conference \nwhen he bragged about this budget resolution? Remember what he said \nabout education? ``We have done more to increase educational funding in \nthis budget than at any time in the last 30 years.'' He had in mind a \nfew things that the Senators are talking about in their amendments.\n  Let me just tell you a couple of them. A $2.7 billion increase over \nthe next 5 years in Head Start. Over the next 5 years, Head Start will \nreceive exactly what the President of the United States requested. It \nis interesting, when the President has to look at all of Government \nlike we do in the budget resolution, he gives Head Start a huge \nincrease, and we agree with him in this agreement, and we make it a \npriority item that is going to be hard not to fund. That program has \nenjoyed a 300-percent increase since 1990. Not very many programs \naround have done that.\n  I would have thought, if I were one listening here, that this \nPresident of the United States just denied these poor people Head \nStart, just sent them off saying, ``I don't want anything to do with \nit.'' It is the President who asked for this much money, and we did not \nchange it one penny.\n  Then, they were talking about Pell grants, and then I will return to \nanother issue. Of course, it would be wonderful for America if Pell \ngrants were $5,000. What did the President say about Pell grants? He \nsaid, we have the best increase in Pell grants in the last decade. How \nmuch? Three-hundred dollars for each Pell grant.\n  We conservatives did not say that. We are glad to do it. The \nPresident of the United States asked for that. He got every penny he \nasked for. It is very simple to come to the floor of the Senate, no \nmatter what you do in a budget, to have a new wish list and a new set \nof statistics about who needs something.\n  I have learned more from that side of the aisle about that than I \never dreamt in my life. I can get up after you put the President's \nbudget together, if we had given him everything he wanted, I learned \nfrom that side of the aisle that I could get up here and say we have 26 \nmillion people who do not have enough food, even if the President had \nput in a whole new nutrition program.\n  As a matter of fact, let's move from Pell grants to nutrition. Child \nnutrition program, isn't it interesting? The Federal Government spent \n$12.4 billion on those programs last year. Believe it or not, 70 \npercent of those programs, Mr. President, are what we call mandatory \nprograms. That means, if you qualify, you get them. There cannot be \nmuch more needed; if you qualify, you get them. That means everybody \nwho is poor qualifies for those programs, and we spend $12.4 billion.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You would have thought we did not even have a program \nfrom over there, and we did not even have an increase. Let me just \nfinish.\n  Believe it or not, the other 30 percent of the money that goes to \nchildren's nutrition programs is spent for programs like WIC, Women, \nInfants, and Children, one of the finest programs in terms of \neffectiveness we have in the Federal Government in this inventory. It \nhas wide bipartisan support. It enjoys an increase in this budget, and, \nas a matter of fact, the President is so confident that it will be \nfunded every year and funded appropriately that he did not even ask us \nto make it a priority program, because by doing so, we\n\n[[Page S4980]]\n\nare taking more and more of the budget and locking it in, because he \nknows we are going to fund it.\n  Mr. President, I do not know exactly how I will ultimately handle \nthese amendments, because no matter what you say, the argument is going \nto be that we are against nutrition programs, and it is a ready-made TV \nad.\n  On Pell grants, no matter if we gave the President every penny he \nwanted and we increased it $300 a year--it would be great if we had \nenough money to go to $10,000 a year, I guess, I am not sure. It does \nnot matter. Whoever votes with Domenici tonight is going to vote \nagainst Pell grants.\n  So I want to make sure the Senators understand that I have great \nrespect for them, and I admire them greatly, but we may have a second-\ndegree amendment to change the way this vote occurs, so we are voting \non something different for a change than your add-ons. I am not sure \nyet, but I am looking at it. So with that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a question or comment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I did not hear the Senator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a question or comment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Of course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from New Mexico, \nwho is really--we say a good friend--he really is a good friend. I want \nhim to know both of these amendments--and I am speaking for myself, not \nfor Senator Reed--do not have a darn thing to do with TV attack ads. I \ncannot stand them. I wish there was no such thing.\n  These amendments are offered out of a sense of sincerity, and, in all \ndue respect to my colleague, you can talk about what we are doing in \nthe area of, for example, nutrition for children, and it is, I guess, \nall a matter of how you see it. These amendments just say we can do \nbetter. The fact of the matter is that in the last Congress, we cut \ngrants for school districts to establish the School Breakfast Program \nand only 50 percent of the children who are eligible receive it. The \nfact of the matter is----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yielded for a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The fact of the matter is, the same thing can be said \nfor the Summer School Program. So, the question--I said actually a \ncomment, but I will put it in the form of a question. My question for \nthe Senator is, how can you even view this as some sort of potential TV \nattack ad when these amendments are so substantive and they speak to \nthe huge--I am sorry, I say to the Senator--disparity between children \nwho need this assistance and, quite frankly, a budget that does not get \nthem anywhere near close to it? How can that be viewed just as an \neffort to have an attack ad?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me answer the question. I would never suggest that \nany Senator who offers an amendment, with all of the concern that you \nhave in your heart and your mind when you offer these kinds of \namendments, I would never consider that they would ever be used to \ndisabuse somebody who voted against you improperly. But I am merely \nsuggesting that happens from time to time, and that is all I was \nthinking. I do not think it will be much of a defense to say that the \nPresident of the United States was given everything he asked for in \nthese areas. I do not think that will help much, if somebody wants to \nuse it for a contrary purpose.\n  I yield the floor, and I understand the next amendment is Senator \nInhofe's amendment, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes, 15 seconds \nremaining. Does he yield his time back? Does he wish to yield his time \nback?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If Senator Wellstone will wait, can we yield back our \ntime and get the yeas and nays on his two amendments?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, that will be fine. I yield back the \nremainder of our time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Could we not do that for \na moment and let him proceed and let me clarify something?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask to set aside temporarily the consideration of the \nWellstone amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 301\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask we turn to consideration of \namendment No. 301.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 301.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record of May 21, 1997.)\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I do not plan to take a long time. I would \nlike to make a couple comments about some of the things that have been \nsaid here.\n  I do not question the sincerity of any Member on this floor, but I \nthink it should be obvious to you, Mr. President, and anyone else who \nmay not be worn out right now, that there is a difference of philosophy \noften expressed on this floor. I think it goes back to the role of \nGovernment.\n  I not only remind my friend from Minnesota that every country that \nhas tried to take care of all these ills from a government perspective \nhas not made it. I wonder sometimes, all these people who come to \nschool supposedly that are hungry, how many of those parents perhaps \nare not able to feed them because they are overtaxed, or how many of \nthose parents might have fallen into this mentality that permeated the \n1960's that Government has the responsibility of taking care of all the \nhuman social ills?\n  I agree with one thing the distinguished Senator from Minnesota said \nwhen he said we have lost our way. I think we have. I think that is \nwhat this is all about, trying to find our way back.\n  I have to say, Mr. President, that I have not been supportive of this \ncompromise, but for a totally different reason than the Senator from \nMinnesota. I look at this, and I have to correct the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico about one thing that he said. He said we gave \nthe President everything he wanted in his social programs. We actually \ngave him more. This is $5 billion more than his request was last year. \nIt is not a matter of not having enough in this bill. I feel the \nspending is too high. I do not agree with all the assumptions, but I am \nvery confident that this is going to be adopted and going to be adopted \ntonight.\n  Also, I am not sure we are going to be able to accomplish all the tax \ndecreases that we have promised some of the people. I had occasion this \nmorning to talk to two large groups, both of whom are endorsing this, \nand they are endorsing this because they believe they are going to get \nan estate tax reduction; they believe they are going to get capital \ngains reductions. I do not believe there is going to be enough money to \ndo that. But that is not the point of standing here now.\n  What I would like to see happen with this, ultimately, in the year \n2002 is to accomplish the goal that many people believe in their hearts \nwe will accomplish with this. I am not that confident. I am going to \nassume that will happen and we will reach a balanced budget by the year \n2002.\n  I have offered amendment No. 301 because I think by just oversight, \nsomething was left out. Let's assume that everything we are trying to \naccomplish with the adoption of this budget agreement becomes a \nreality. Let's assume that the economic assumptions produced an \nadditional $225 billion. Let's assume that these spending programs are \ngoing to stay within the limits and that we are able to do the tax \ncuts. And let's assume that we find ourselves with a balanced budget.\n  Now, here is the problem that I have with this. One of the problems \nis, if we reach the year 2001 and we see, in fact, it is doing what we \nprojected it would do, doing what we told the American people it would \ndo, and that is balance the budget, eliminate the deficit, what happens \nin the next year? With that as a concern, I don't think there is anyone \nin this Chamber who is going to vote for this bill on the basis that \nthey want to balance the budget who does not also want to keep the \nbudget in balance in the years following that. So I have this very \nsimple resolution that I wouldn't think there would be any opposition \nto. That is, if this passes, and that becomes a reality--I am going to \nread the sentence from the bill. This is, in essence, my entire \namendment.\n\n\n[[Page S4981]]\n\n\n       It shall not be in order in the Senate to consider any \n     budget resolution or conference report on a budget resolution \n     for fiscal year 2002 and any fiscal year thereafter that \n     would cause a unified budget deficit for the budget year or \n     any of the four fiscal years following the budget year.\n\n  So, what we are saying is, once we get it in balance and we have \neliminated the deficit, I would like to go further and say, let's then \nstart spending down and paying down the debt. Instead of that, with \nthis, all we are saying is once we eliminate the deficit, let's keep it \neliminated. In the absence of this, all of this, that is on this plan, \nthis road map can become a reality in the year 2001. But if that \nhappens, then they can turn around and say, ``Good, that's over with, \nnow let's start raising deficits again.''\n  That is the essence of it. I am prepared to yield the remainder of my \ntime, but I understand the Senator from New Jersey wants to use some of \nhis time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Very briefly, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for \nremembering that I might disagree that we have a 60-person vote \nrequired after the year 2002. I understand that the Senator wants to \nmake sure that if we do achieve the objectives that we set out for \nourselves, that we can continue to do so. I believe the same thing. \nHowever, I do disagree that we require a supermajority.\n  The fact of the matter is, to project that far in advance--again, I \nsaid it earlier in a discussion, that we are working with estimates. We \nare looking at a particular point in time, the condition of our \neconomy, the condition of the revenue stream that we get from, really, \nan ebullient marketplace and high tax collection. That has given us \nrevenues that make the balanced budget a reality, to permit the tax \ncuts that have been established. Again, we each take a little bit of \ntime for editorial comment to say--with which I disagree. I do agree \nwith the portion that is devoted to the middle class and devoted to \neducation. But it cannot be only my way. I regret that, but that is \nlife and the reality.\n  Mr. President, I hope we will be able to defeat this amendment. I \nthink it does violate the agreement as we understand it. If we get to \n2002--we have deliberately had the projections extend for 10 years, so \nwe had some idea that we were not going to face a cataclysmic explosion \nwith deficits or with tax cuts, frankly, in that period of time. I hope \nwe will be able to defeat it. I do not see my colleague, the chairman \nof the Budget Committee here, but I assume he will agree with me and \nthat he will discuss it at an appropriate moment, if we have time.\n  Has the Senator yielded back all the time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. No, I was waiting until the Senator yielded his time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from New Jersey for the spirit in \nwhich he is addressing these things. I know there is a difference of \nopinion. But I would only say, in closing, that we have a list here of \n66 people, Democrats and Republicans--you were not one of them--that \nvoted for the balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Not.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I assume you don't want to change that vote today?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The record is closed.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would say it would be very difficult for me to \nunderstand how anyone could have voted for a balanced budget amendment \nto the Constitution and not support this. Because we are talking about, \nif you do not do this and you are saying, let's make the plan work, \ncome up to 5 years from now, and then let's start in again on deficits. \nAnd we do not want to do that.\n  With that, if the Senator from New Jersey would like to yield back \nhis time, I will do the same.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield our time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nask the time be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 335\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I have an amendment that is on the list. I \nam going to do this very briefly to accommodate our colleagues who are \nanticipating a series of upcoming votes. The distinguished chairman of \nthe committee has given me a couple of minutes to explain my amendment. \nIt is at the desk.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, you heard a couple minutes. A couple \nminutes is my interpretation of 3, that is what a couple is.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 335.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record of May 21, 1997.)\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, very briefly, let me explain, as I said when \nI offered an amendment earlier in the week, I intend to support this \nbudget resolution. I think it is a good resolution. I commend the \nleadership for putting it together. There is some disagreement around \nthe fringes.\n  Fundamentally, this is a good agreement. I am impressed with the \nbalance that is included in here. One of the ways this balance is \naccomplished is by limiting, of course, as we know, the size of tax \ncuts, both initially and in the latter years.\n  The agreement entered into by the President, the majority leader, my \ncolleague from Mississippi, Senator Lott, and Speaker Gingrich \nspecifies tax cuts should cost no more than $85 billion in the first 5 \nyears and no more than $250 billion over the 10-year period.\n  I read from the letter signed by our distinguished majority leader \nand the Speaker. I quote from the letter, Mr. President:\n\n       It was agreed that the net tax cut shall be $85 billion \n     through 2002 and not more than $250 billion through 2007.\n\n  As I said, this was signed by the majority leader and the Speaker. I \nwas surprised, however, Mr. President, to learn that this budget \nresolution does not fully conform in a sense because there is no \nreflection of the $250 billion over 10 years. It does include the $85 \nbillion over the first 5 years. There is no particular reason they \nshould not be included. It was part of the agreement.\n  In my view, the resolution ought to reflect the agreement. We do not \nspecify, obviously, what is to be done. That is up to the specific \ncommittees; in our case, the Finance Committee; in the House, the Ways \nand Means Committee. All it does is conform to the overall agreement of \ntax cuts should not exceed $250 billion over 10 years. The absence of \nthat reference in the resolution, I think, leaves open the question \nwhether or not we are going to meet those guidelines.\n  So, Mr. President, I offer this modification with reconciliation \ninstructions so that the tax cuts are not limited to $85 billion but \nalso be limited to $250 billion in 10 years. This language would be \nbinding, but not in the sense of how it is done. We are not out of the \nwoods, obviously, at the end of 10 years. There are reports we could \nhave a ballooning problem, as we did after the 1981 agreement. I think \nby including the $250 billion here, it does conform very explicitly, as \nI said, with the letter.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the distinguished \nmajority leader and the Speaker be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 15, 1997.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     President of the United States, The White House, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We would like to take this opportunity \n     to confirm important aspects of the Balanced Budget \n     Agreement. It was agreed that the net tax cut shall be $85 \n     billion through 2002 and not more than $250 billion through \n     2007. We believe these levels provide enough room for \n     important reforms, including broad-based permanent capital \n     gains tax reductions, significant death tax relief, $500 per \n     child tax credit and expansion of IRAs.\n       In the course of drafting the legislation to implement the \n     balanced budget plan, there\n\n[[Page S4982]]\n\n     are some additional areas that we want to be sure the \n     committees of jurisdiction consider. Specifically, we believe \n     the package must include tax relief of roughly $35 billion \n     over five years for education, including a deduction and a \n     tax credit. We believe this package should be consistent with \n     the objectives put forward in the HOPE scholarship and \n     tuition tax proposals contained in the Administration's FY \n     1998 budget to assist middle-class parents in paying and \n     saving for their children's education.\n       Additionally, the House and Senate Leadership will seek to \n     include various proposals in the Administration's FY 1998 \n     budget (e.g., the welfare-to-work tax credit, capital gains \n     tax relief for home sales, the Administration's EZ/EC \n     proposals, brownfields legislation, FSC software, and tax \n     incentives designed to spur economic growth in the District \n     of Columbia), as well as various pending congressional tax \n     proposals.\n       In this context, it should be noted the tax-writing \n     committees will be required to balance the interests and \n     desires of many parties in crafting tax legislation within \n     the context of the net tax reduction goals which have been \n     adopted, while at the same time protecting the interests of \n     taxpayers generally.\n       We stand to work with you toward these ends. Thank you very \n     much for your cooperation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Newt Gingrich,\n                                                          Speaker.\n     Trent Lott,\n                                           Senate Majority Leader.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, so my colleagues can appreciate this, this \nis not gamesmanship or trying to be cute about this in any way, but \nmerely to have our reconciliation instructions conform to what the \nletter says we do. I think that would certainly put everyone at ease \nabout the commitments we are all making to this resolution when it \ncomes to deficit reduction.\n  The great tragedy would be if we got to the end of 5 years and have \nno requirement that we try to limit it to $250 billion at the end of 10 \nyears, and you have deficit reduction and balance for 1 year, and then \nit will explode out of proportion after that period of time. That is \nthe reason for the amendment.\n  I appreciate, again, my colleague providing me these few minutes to \nexplain the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have no objection to the amendment, \nbut before we finish and wrap this up, I will be making sure that the \nrest of the agreement, as it pertains to cuts, has the same kind of \nspecificity to it, otherwise, I would not accept it. I am not sure we \ncan hold it in conference, as long as the Senator understands that.\n  Mr. DODD. I am sure the Senator from New Mexico will try. I say to my \ncolleague, I think the cuts are there. If not, I will join him in an \namendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection. I yield back the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 335) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Will the Senator withhold for a moment? Can I have the \nattention of the floor manager?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from New Mexico yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I question the distinguished Senator from \nNew Mexico, why can't we just start voting right now?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have five amendments which we are going to vote on \nand some other unanimous-consent requests that the leadership and the \nmanagers have. We will put it all in one UC and then start with the \namendment of the Senator from Arkansas. His is the lead-off one, and we \nshould not take more than another 5 minutes and then we will be ready.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. How many following mine?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Five in total, I believe. Yours and four others for a \ntotal of five. Then we will have some more language in the UC about the \nrest of the evening and the rest of the amendments.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I wonder if the Senator, while we are in this colloquy, \ncan tell us what to expect for the rest of the evening after these \nvotes, and tomorrow.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I can only tell you that the distinguished Democratic \nmanager and I are going to be here this evening, and we are going to \nuse all the time to take up amendments. Whether we will vote on them \ntonight or not, let's wait and see what the leadership proposes. The \ntime will run out sometime before too late, at least it will not be so \nlate that we cannot stand here on the floor and get it done. Amendments \nwill be worked on all evening. There may not be any votes, but it \ndepends on the unanimous-consent request.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator can inform the \nSenator how much time is left on the bill?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will ask--a little less than 5 hours.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. About roughly 5 hours.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. How much time is \nleft on the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A little less than 5 hours is left.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 328, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have an unprinted amendment on behalf \nof Senator John McCain. It is a modification to 328 which has \nheretofore been offered. It is a sense-of-the-Senate regarding Amtrak. \nI ask that it be considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified, and the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Mr. McCain, \n     proposes amendment numbered 328, as modified.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING ASSISTANCE TO AMTRAK.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Amtrak is in a financial crisis, with growing and \n     substantial debt obligations approaching $2 billion;\n       (2) Amtrak has not been authorized since 1994:\n       (3) the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation favorably reported legislation to reform \n     Amtrak during the last two Congresses, but no legislation was \n     enacted;\n       (4) the Finance Committee favorably reported legislation in \n     the last Congress that created a dedicated trust fund for \n     Amtrak, but no legislation was enacted;\n       (5) in 1997 Amtrak testified before the Congress that it \n     cannot survive beyond 1998 without comprehensive legislative \n     reforms and a dedicated source of capital funding; and\n       (6) Congress is obligated to invest Federal tax dollars \n     responsibly and to reduce waste and inefficiency in Federal \n     programs, including Amtrak.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the Sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that:\n       (1) Legislative reform is urgently needed to address \n     Amtrak's financial and operational problems.\n       (2) It is fiscally irresponsible for Congress to allocate \n     additional Federal dollars to Amtrak, and to distribute money \n     from a new trust fund, without providing reforms requested by \n     Amtrak to address its precarious financial situation.\n       (3) The distribution of money from any new fund to finance \n     an intercity rail passenger fund should be implemented in \n     conjunction with legislation to reauthorize and reform the \n     National Rail Passenger Corporation.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, my amendment states that if legislation is \nenacted to establish an intercity passenger rail fund, as this budget \nresolution would make room for, the distribution of any new money \nshould be in conjunction with legislation to reauthorize and reform the \nNational Rail Passenger Corporation, better known as Amtrak. Money \nalone, cannot fix all\n\n[[Page S4983]]\n\nof Amtrak's financial and operational problems.\n  This amendment does not attempt to kill Amtrak or block its funding. \nIt simply attempts to establish some level of fiscal accountability \nbefore the taxpayers are forced to pay $400 to $500 million more to \nfund Amtrak capital subsidies.\n  We have an obligation to the American public to invest our Federal \ndollars wisely. We should reduce waste and inefficiency and allow \nAmtrak to achieve greater fiscal accountability. Statutory reforms are \nnecessary if Amtrak is to increase efficiencies, reduce costs, and \nlessen its dependence on Federal assistance.\n  Earlier this week, I met with Delaware's Governor, Tom Carper, who \nserves on the Amtrak board of directors. Governor Carper articulated \nclearly to me Amtrak's plan to turn its financial condition around. He \ntalked about the need for capital investment and his support for \nestablishing a trust fund for Amtrak. He also talked about the \nimportance of legislative reforms.\n  I may not agree with Governor Carper's views on the role that the \nFederal Government should continue to play in supporting Amtrak. But, \nit was refreshing to hear from someone close to Amtrak's operations \ndiscuss the critical need for statutory reforms--including labor and \nliability reforms--and not just the need for more money.\n  Mr. President, Amtrak has not been authorized since 1994. The \nCommerce Committee has reported out reform legislation during the last \ntwo Congresses. But, instead of meeting our authorizing obligations, \nCongress has found it easier to just keep throwing good money at an \ninefficent operation. This fiscally irresponsible practice must stop.\n  Last week, Senator Hutchison, the chairman of the Surface \nTransportation and Merchant Marine Subcommittee, introduced S. 738, the \nAmtrak Reform and Accountability Act. That bill proposes to reauthorize \nAmtrak for 5 years and provide comprehensive reforms to allow Amtrak to \noperate more like a business. In short, it provides all the things \nAmtrak's president, Tom Downs, says are needed in order for Amtrak to \nmeet its glide path to zero Federal operating subsides by 2002.\n  The Commerce Committee is prepared to move Senator Hutchison's bill \nduring our very next executive session. We will be ready for floor \naction as soon as the leadership can agree on a schedule. Members can \noffer amendments and cast their votes. But we are committed to debate \nreform legislation on the Senate floor.\n  I cannot understand how any Member could seriously argue that reform \nlegislation should not be tied to any future ``pot of gold'' for \nAmtrak. Let me remind my colleagues that it is Amtrak that has \nsaid that money will not solve all its problems.\n\n  For the past several years, Amtrak's president, Tom Downs, has \ntestified before Congress explaining the three things needed to turn \nAmtrak around: Internal Restructuring; comprehensive legislative \nreforms; and a dedicated source of capital funding.\n  And, just yesterday morning, during a DOT oversight hearing of the \nCommerce Committee, the GAO and the Office of Inspector General \ntestified on the serious challenges Amtrak faces to achieving operating \nself-sufficiency.\n  Mr. President, since 1983 I have listened to Amtrak officials talk \nabout their plans to turn Amtrak into a viable operation. I imagine \nthey've talked about it for 26 years. Amtrak says they can operate more \nefficiently and reduce the need for Federal assistance if Congress \ngives them the tools they have requested. Therefore, it would be \nextremely irresponsible to give Amtrak a substantial increase in \nFederal assistance and not remove some of the statutory burdens that \nare the root cause of many of their financial woes today.\n  If Amtrak is given new money without reforms, I can hear them in the \nyear 2002. They'll try to convince me how Congress still should \ncontinue subsidizing Amtrak because Congress never gave them what they \nsaid they needed. Well, enough is enough. If Amtrak is going to receive \nFederal assistance, let's make sure they also have the ability to \nincrease efficiencies, reduce costs, and operate more like a business.\n  Amtrak is in a financial crisis. Without comprehensive legislative \nreforms, it is business as usual. And today, that business faces a debt \nload fast approaching $2 billion.\n  Mr. President, I do not support a never-ending drain on the Federal \ntaxpayers in funding a passenger rail system that serves only 500 \nlocations across the country. But, if the collective wisdom of Congress \nbelieves we should continue to invest billions of dollars in a \npassenger system that serves less than 1 percent of the traveling \npublic, I am going to do all I can to ensure such investment is as \nfiscally sound at possible. Turning on a new Amtrak funding spigot \nabsent comprehensive operational reforms would be wasteful and \ncareless.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I support Senator McCain's Sense of the \nSenate. I agree with my colleague from Arizona that Amtrak needs \nreforms. Amtrak must be able to operate more like a business. Senator \nHutchison has recently introduced a major reform package which I \nsupport. Amtrak needs these reforms and they must be enacted this year. \nIt is also very clear that Amtrak needs an adequate and reliable source \nof capital funding. Amtrak is currently borrowing to meet payroll and \nif additional capital funding is not provided, GAO and Amtrak have \ntestified that the company will not survive past mid-1998. The key to \nAmtrak's future is both a legislative reform package and a secure \nsource of capital funding.\n  Given the immediate financial crisis Amtrak is facing, Congress \ncannot wait a moment longer. To be viable Amtrak will need both a \nsecure source of capital funding and a reauthorization and reform bill \nthis year. It is my goal to see both bills enacted this year. I do not \ndoubt Senator McCain's ability to get the reform bill passed in the \nSenate and enacted this year. And, as I have stated on the floor many \ntimes, it is one of my priorities to give Amtrak a secure source of \ncapital funding this year. Both bills are essential and I believe both \nshould be implemented in conjunction with each other. We cannot lose \nour national passenger rail system. If something is not done to give \nAmtrak the capital funds and the reforms it needs, Amtrak will not \nsurvive. This is not an idle threat. GAO has testified before my \ncommittee that this is the case. Amtrak President Tom Downs has \ntestified that the company would not survive past 1998. Amtrak's \nfinancial report proves it. The question before us is whether or not we \nwant this country to have a national passenger rail system. If we want \na national system, we must give Amtrak a secure capital funding source \nto allow it to operate more like a business.\n  Let me take a few minutes to explain why I fought to include the \nAmtrak reserve fund in the budget resolution. And may I also say at \nthis time that Senators Domenici and Lautenburg have been extremely \nhelpful in securing this compromise language for me.\n  Senator Domenici and I have worked together to develop a compromise \non how to finance a secure source of funding for Amtrak. Out of these \ndiscussions we developed an Amtrak reserve fund which would allow for \nthe spending caps for Amtrak to be raised by the amount of revenue \nraised to finance this fund. It is the first step, and a very critical \nstep, for ensuring that Amtrak receives the capital funding it needs to \nsurvive.\n  Mr. President, all major modes of transportation have a dedicated \nsource of capital funding, except for intercity passenger rail. Amtrak \nneeds a similar capital funding source to bring its equipment, \nfacilities, and tracks into a state of good repair. Much of Amtrak's \nequipment and infrastructure has exceeded its projected useful life. \nThe costs of maintaining this aging fleet and the need to modernize and \noverhaul facilities through capital improvements to the system are \nserious financial challenges for Amtrak. This provision is the first \nstep in helping to reverse these problems and give Amtrak the resources \nnecessary to meet its capital investment needs.\n  I believe that it is time for Congress to reverse our current policy \nthat favors building more highways at the expense of alternative means \nof transportation, such as intercity passenger rail. Despite rail's \nproven safety, efficiency, and reliability in Europe, Japan, and\n\n[[Page S4984]]\n\nelsewhere, intercity passenger rail remains severely underfunded in the \nUnited States. In fact, over half of the Department of Transportation's \nspending authority is devoted to highways and another quarter to \naviation; rail still ranks last with roughly 3 percent of total \nspending authority.\n  If this Congress wants a national passenger rail system, we will have \nto properly fund the system. Amtrak has not been able to make \nsufficient capital investments in the past through annual, but \ninadequate appropriation. I am pleased that the Senate now recognizes \nthat a new funding mechanism is needed for Amtrak. Under this budget \nagreement, Amtrak would finally receive similar treatment as other \nmodes of transportation.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for \nhis efforts. I appreciate his leadership as full committee chairman \nbecause he makes it possible for members to move important legislation \nin a timely fashion, and I am pleased to hear his commitment to move S. \n738, Amtrak reauthorization and reform legislation, as soon as \npossible.\n  In particular, he is exercising great leadership on the issue of \nAmtrak. I know he personally has doubts about our current passenger \nrail policy but, as chairman, has not acted to impede the will of the \nCommerce Committee or Congress to continue the national passenger rail \nsystem. He does, however, insist these the policies and their \nimplementation be responsible. I commend him for that, appreciate the \nleadership it represents, and will work closely with him to that end.\n  I support this amendment because I believe Amtrak must have both \nreform and capital funding. I commend Senator Roth for his commitment \nto authorize a capital fund for Amtrak and will work with him to see \nthat it occurs. He is a cosponsor of my Amtrak reauthorization bill and \nam certain he will make a similar commitment to help achieve its \npassage.\n  I believe we agree that the passage of both of these bills is \nnecessary to sustain Amtrak. Increased Amtrak funding alone is not \nenough; nor are reforms without adequate funding. However, providing \nthe funding without the reforms not only shortchanges Amtrak, it \nshortchanges the taxpayer.\n  I fully share the sense of this Senate that appropriations from the \nnew intercity rail fund should go to a reformed and reauthorized \nAmtrak. I urge all of my colleagues to work with me to pass Amtrak \nreform legislation as soon as possible in fulfillment of this \nresolution.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have no objection to this and hope we \nwill adopt it here by voice vote.\n  But I yield to Senator Frank Lautenberg.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Very simply, Mr. President, I too approve of the \namendment. I have a deep interest in Amtrak and national passenger rail \nservice. And this refines a process. I am pleased to endorse it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield back all my time.\n  I yield back any time Senator McCain may have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 328), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have discussed this unanimous consent \nagreement we are about to enter with the Democratic leader. Therefore, \nI ask unanimous consent that at 7:15 today the Senate proceed to a \nseries of votes on or in relation to the following amendments in the \norder specified, and, further, prior to each vote there be 2 minutes \nfor debate equally divided in the usual form: Senator Bumpers, No. 330; \nSenator Bumpers, No. 331; Senator Bond, No. 324, which I understand \nwill be a voice vote; Senator Gramm, No. 320; Senator Ashcroft, No. \n322; Senator Ashcroft, No. 323; Senator Inhofe, No. 301.\n  Mr. President, I make that unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all votes after \nthe first vote be limited to 10 minutes in length, and, further, all \ntime consumed by the votes count against the overall time limitation, \nand, further, any remaining debate time under the statute be consumed \nthis evening, and, finally, beginning at 9:30 a.m., tomorrow morning \nthe Senate proceed to vote on any pending amendments, and following \ndisposition of all amendments, the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of calendar 56, House Concurrent Resolution 84, the House \ncompanion, and all after the enacting clause be stricken, and the text \nof Senate Concurrent Resolution 27 be inserted, and the Senate proceed \nto vote on adoption of the budget resolution, with no intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I further ask unanimous consent that following adoption of \nHouse Concurrent Resolution 84, the Senate insist on its amendment, \nrequest a conference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to \nappoint conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation for the \ncooperation from the chairman and ranking member and the Democratic \nleader for getting this agreement. This will, I think, be a fair way \nand expeditious way to complete our action. And we will then get all \namendments voted on and final passage beginning at 9:30 tomorrow \nmorning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished \nmajority leader for his assistance tonight.\n  I think this is a very fair way to handle matters. And we will be \ndiscussing further amendments that will come up this evening while \nthese votes take place.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I wonder if--I am sorry. The leader made \nthat request, and I was not paying close enough attention.\n  I would like to reverse my two amendments and bring up 331 first and \nthen 330 second. I ask unanimous consent that we do that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have no objection. Maybe we could proceed, I say to \nSenator Bumpers, to use up time that you have to--\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I am prepared to use my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If the Senator used his minute and I use my minute, we \nwill be ready to vote promptly at 7:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The order \nis so modified.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 331\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. My first amendment simply says that the Finance \nCommittee must come up with offsets of $115 billion to offset that \namount which is the cut in Medicare. I think it would be unseemly and \nextreme if we have to go home and tell our people that we cut Medicare \nby $115 billion to make the system more solvent and at the same time \ntell them the only way we could cut taxes under this budget agreement \nwas to cut Medicare by $115 billion.\n  So, Mr. President, I earnestly ask my colleagues to seriously \nconsider voting to simply say to the Finance Committee, do not force us \nto go home and tell our constituents that we cut Medicaid by $115 \nbillion and we used every dime of it--every dime of it--to offset all \nthese tax cuts, many of which go to the wealthiest people in America.\n  It is indefensible. It is inexcusable. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The problem is that what the Senator just described is \nnot the amendment. All the amendment does is take out all the tax cuts \nthe American people are to receive. It has nothing to do with Medicare.\n\n[[Page S4985]]\n\n  It is a forthright simple amendment. It says, take out all the tax \ncuts. It totally violates the agreement and, I repeat, has nothing to \ndo with Medicare, nothing.\n  Everything that we saved in Medicare went to make Medicare solvent. \nThere are plenty of other savings to cover these tax cuts if you had to \ncover them. But we have to make no apologies. We produced a balanced \nbudget, and in that we got $85 billion net new tax cuts available to \nthe American people.\n  Plain and simple, this amendment says, no tax cuts. That means anyone \nthat votes for it is against tax cuts. Simple, plain, nothing else.\n  I yield any time I have remaining.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, do I have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 47 seconds.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished chairman of the \nBudget Committee, and my colleagues, what kind of a tax cut will you \nhave if you do not use Medicare's $115 billion cut? The answer to that \nis, none, virtually none.\n  Make no mistake about it, the Medicare cut is being used to fund \nthese tax cuts. And without it there will be no tax cuts. It is just \nthat simple.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Do I have any time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is just not true. If that did not take 10 seconds, \nthat is enough.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table the amendment. They yeas and nays have been ordered. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 330\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 2 minutes of debate on the next \nBumpers amendment, 1 minute to each side.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this is an amendment which keeps the \ndeficit from soaring next year. This year's deficit is going to be $67 \nbillion. This budget takes the deficit next year to $97 billion. In the \nyear 2000 it is $97 billion. It starts coming down the last 2 years \nonly because of the economic assumptions.\n  You are assuming in this budget that the economy is going to stay as \nhot the next 5 years as it has been the last 5 years. And if that \nproves to be a false assumption you are going to see the deficit start \nsoaring.\n  I say strike while the iron is hot.\n  In 1981 we bought into this same proposition, and in 8 years had a $3 \ntrillion debt to show for it.\n  Here we are back at the same old stand--cutting taxes and balancing \nthe budget. That is the good old five-chocolate-sundae-a-day diet. It \ndidn't work in 1981. It isn't going to work now.\n  So I am saying balance the budget in the year 2001, not 2002. \nPostpone the tax cuts until 2002 and honor the American people who say \nthey want a balanced budget a lot worse than they want a tax cut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will not take very long.\n  Fellow Senators, what this amendment effectively does is takes away \nall the tax cuts except $20 billion--plain and simple. There can be all \nkinds of rationale. But at least $20 billion of the $835 billion in tax \ncuts, and the rest of the tax cuts are gone.\n  It seems to me that we have made a commitment that we are going to do \nboth--balance the budget and cut taxes for some Americans, including \nfamilies with children. This eliminates all of that, and I believe it \nought to be turned down overwhelmingly.\n  Indeed, it doesn't cut any spending. It just cuts out the tax cuts.\n  I yield my time.\n  I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from New Mexico to lay on the table the amendment of the \nSenator from Arkansas. On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

We will \nnow have debate on the Bond amendment No. 324, as modified; 2 minutes, \n1 minute per side.\n\n[[Page S4986]]\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I believe this amendment can be accepted. \nBasically it points out the fact that in the State of Missouri and \nother States, the disproportionate share of the hospital Medicaid \npayments is used to provide health care to the most vulnerable \npopulation, a quarter of a million pregnant women and children and, as \nwe look at it, when the Finance Committee addresses this DSH program, \nthey need to keep in mind that no harm must befall these very \nvulnerable people. We ask they consider use of the funds in the \nlegislation, other legislation that is being adopted. We urge the \nadoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield back my time. I am willing to \naccept the amendment without a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. No objection on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 324), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank my colleague for changing it into a sense of \nthe Senate. It is acceptable because of that.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 320\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on amendment No. 320.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What is the amendment following the Gramm amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Ashcroft amendment No. 322.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Ashcroft, would you mind going next and giving \nyour 1 minute? I ask consent we pass the Gramm amendment and proceed to \nthe Ashcroft amendment that is listed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 322\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We will have a 2-minute debate.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, much has been said about different \namendments, alleging that they were deal breakers. This is a deal \nkeeper. This is a set of enforcement provisions which would limit the \namount of debt that we could have each year to the amount that is \nspecified in the budget agreement. This is basically the balanced \nbudget amendment in statutory form, conformed to the balanced budget \nagreement. Those individuals who voted in favor of a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution were willing to put this kind of \ndiscipline into our culture for life. I think we ought to be willing to \nput it into this agreement for the next 5 years.\n  This is not a deal breaker. This is a deal keeper, and the American \npeople deserve to have the discipline of knowing that the debt will not \nexceed the limits specified.\n  The debt will not exceed the numbers of debt which are provided for \nin the agreement. This is just a way to provide discipline and \nenforcement of the agreement, as written.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this amendment would require a \nsupermajority, three-fifths of the Members in each House, to provide \nfor specific excess of outlays of receipts or to provide for such \nincrease in the level of public debt.\n  What we are doing here is we will be reviewing the balanced budget \namendment and voting for it here again. It does not fit in the scope of \nthings.\n  I have raised a point of order on this relative to germaneness. We \nshould defeat this. I think this is a very dangerous precedent, for us \nto get involved with this kind of legislation in this budget \nresolution.\n  I hope we will defeat it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Has the Senator's time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 seconds.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I urge Members of the Senate who voted \nfor a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution to do this \nimposition of a balanced budget amendment to the budget agreement. It \nprovides discipline and will ensure that we keep the agreement; that we \ndon't break it. The American people deserve no less.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, do I have any time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Around 20 seconds.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, 20 seconds? We will use the 20 \nseconds, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could we have order, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please come to order. The \nSenate will please come to order.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We will use the seconds preciously and quickly and \njust say that this doesn't even allow for any adjustments during a \nrecession, depression or that kind of thing. It says, ``other than \nnational security.'' That is a military reference. I think national \nsecurity includes a stable society, one that adjusts to the times. I \nhope we will again vote it down.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to the motion \nto waive the Budget Act in relation to amendment No. 322, offered by \nthe Senator from Missouri.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 320, as modified.\n  There are 2 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we established the highway trust fund in \n1956, and under that trust fund, when people paid taxes on gasoline, it \nwas a user fee to build roads and to build mass transit. In 1993, in \nthe tax bill, for the first time ever, we had a permanent tax increase \non gasoline that went to general revenues.\n  What this sense-of-the-Senate resolution says is that it is the sense \nof the Senate that on the budget reconciliation, on any appropriation, \nor any tax bill that we should put this 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on \ngasoline back into the highway trust fund so that it can be spent for \nthe purpose the tax is collected.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote for this amendment. We are going to \nhave an opportunity to vote on the real thing later this year, but this \nvote will put people on record.\n\n[[Page S4987]]\n\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am not in opposition.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I am in opposition.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield to Senator Chafee.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, what this does is it takes $40 billion \nover the 5 years that is now going into the General Treasury and puts \nit into the highway trust fund with, obviously, the assumption that it \nis going to be spent. In effect, what we are doing here is adding $40 \nbillion to the deficit of the United States.\n  I just don't think, when we are in this effort of trying to balance \nthe budget, that this is the right step to take. Do we all want to have \nmore highways? Of course, we do. Indeed, it falls under the very \ncommittee of which I am the chairman. I don't think at this time, when \nwe are making these efforts to balance the budget, that we want to take \n$40 billion over 5 years going into the General Treasury and spend it \nin this manner. So I hope the amendment will be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to explain \nmy vote on the Gramm sense-of-the-Senate amendment.\n  This sense-of-the-Senate amendment calls for the return of 4.3 cents \nof the Federal gas tax currently used for deficit reduction to the \nhighway trust fund.\n  I have long argued for the return of these revenues to transportation \nprograms--approximately $7 billion annually. In fact, I recently \nintroduced legislation to transfer the 4.3 cents to transportation \nprograms--3.8 cents to the highway account of the highway trust fund \nand 0.5 cents to be used to maintain this Nation's national passenger \nrail system or Amtrak.\n  While this sense-of-the-Senate amendment unfortunately does not \naddress Amtrak, I feel it is important for the Senate to express its \nsupport for redirecting the 4.3 cents to transportation purposes. That \nis why I have voted for this amendment.\n  As this sense-of-the-Senate amendment is nonbinding, it is important \nto ensure that the transfer of the 4.3 cents for transportation \nactually takes place. As a member of the Finance Committee, I want to \nmake it very clear to my colleagues that I intend to pursue my \nlegislation to make the transfer--again, 3.8 cents for the highway \naccount and 0.5 cents for Amtrak.\n  Transportation investments are the key to this Nation's economic \nfuture. Our ability to compete in today's global economy is tied to an \nefficient and safe intermodal transportation system--highways, transit, \nAmtrak, and other modes.\n  The Gramm amendment is the first step to reaching that outcome. By \nputting the Senate on record in support of transferring the 4.3 cents \nfor transportation purposes, we will be able to work during the \nreconciliation process and the reauthorization of ISTEA to see that \nadditional investments are made in our transportation system.\n  I look forward to working with the chairman of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Moynihan, and others to transfer these revenues as we develop \nreconciliation legislation.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 323, Withdrawn\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, we will proceed to \nconsider amendment No. 323 by the Senator from Missouri, Senator \nAshcroft.\n  There are 2 minutes of debate equally divided.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able \nto withdraw this amendment. This amendment was in large measure \nsubsumed in the prior amendment which I offered to the Senate. I ask \nunanimous consent that this amendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 323) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 301\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on amendment No. 301 \nby the Senator from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this is the last amendment of the evening. \nI would like to have your attention for a short period of time.\n  I have not been a strong supporter of this budget deal, the basis of \nthe assumptions and other things. But in the event it does come up with \na balanced budget in the year 2002, I see one frailty with this, and \nthat is, you can come into balance in the year 2002, only to find out \nthat in 2003 you come along and go back into deficits again.\n  So I am going to read one sentence very carefully. I would like to \nhave you listen to it.\n\n       [I]t shall not be in order in the Senate to consider any \n     budget resolution . . . for fiscal year 2002 and any fiscal \n     year thereafter . . . that would cause a unified budget \n     deficit for the budget year or any of the 4 fiscal years \n     following the budget year.\n\n  I would like to reserve the last 10 seconds of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this amendment talks to the years \n2000-plus. We heard it from the Senator from Oklahoma. We are not \nbalancing the budget for 10 years. We are balancing it for the first 5 \nyears to 2002. We project off into the years subsequent to that.\n  We believe that we will have the mechanism in place to control it. If \nnot, we ought to take it up at that time. And this budget amendment \ncreates a supermajority. So we are back to 60 votes in case you want to \nmake a change at that time.\n  I do not think we ought to be strapping ourselves now for something \nthat is going to happen after 2002. I hope that we will defeat this \namendment. I think that it is important that we do.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I believe I have 15 seconds remaining.\n  Let me just say that if it is the intent of anyone to vote for this \nin hopes it would achieve a balanced budget by the year 2002, and then \ncoming back and starting into deficits again, of course you want to \noppose it.\n  This is your last opportunity to say that we want to reach that \nbalanced budget by 2002, and then keep it in balance thereafter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the other side wish to yield back their \ntime?\n\n[[Page S4988]]\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to table the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Abraham], for himself, Mr. \n     Kyl, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr Sessions, and Mr. \n     Coverdell, proposes an amendment numbered 316.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record of May 21, 1997.)\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, it is not my intent tonight to keep the \nSenate here for a lengthy period of time on this amendment. I will \nspeak to my amendment for just a couple of minutes. If others wish to \ndebate it, I will stay here, but I am otherwise prepared to yield back \nmy time on this amendment after giving it a couple of minute's \ndescription.\n  Basically, Mr. President, this amendment tries to address a concern \nthat a number of my constituents, and I suspect constituents from other \nStates, have expressed in recent weeks with respect to the development \nof this budget. As the President and Members are aware near the end of \ndiscussions and deliberations that went into the development of this \nbudget agreement, the Congressional Budget Office informed the \nnegotiators at the last minute that they had underestimated the income \nshares, the revenue estimate, for the upcoming 5-year period by some \n$225 billion.\n  Obviously, a lot of questions have been raised. I am not here tonight \nto quarrel with or to raise questions about the basis on which those \nadjustments took place, but the fact is, Mr. President, based on these \nadjustments, we are moving forward with a budget that estimates certain \namounts of revenue.\n  Clearly, it is possible that sometime during the period that this \nbudget covers over the next 5 years we might find further adjustments \noccurring. My concern, Mr. President, is what happens if further \nadjustments based on the actual receipts to the Federal Government \nexceed what the estimates are that we are using as the basis for this \nbudget resolution. To that end, my constituents are basically telling \nme that if the actual revenues the Government produces exceed that \nwhich we are using here in this budget resolution, that those dollars \nought to be returned to taxpayers in the form of tax cuts or ought to \nbe used to reduce the deficit, for deficit reduction and debt reduction \npurposes.\n  Based on that, Mr. President, I am offering tonight--because of the \nnature of the resolution, I am not offering this as an amendment in the \nfullest sense--as a sense-of-the-Senate amendment that if, in fact, the \nrevenues which we receive during the pendency of this resolution exceed \nthe revenue estimates that have been used to formulate the resolution, \nthose dollars be, in effect, put in a lockbox and made available \nexclusively for reductions in the deficit or for further tax cuts.\n  I think this makes sense because if, in fact, the American taxpayers \nare sending more money to Washington than we expect them to it only \nmakes sense to me that the additional dollars ought to be returned to \nthe taxpayers or used to reduce the deficit as opposed to being used \nfor increased and additional Federal spending beyond that which we are \nincluding in this budget resolution.\n  Mr. President, I think that is the one way by which we can maintain \nsome integrity with respect to the taxpayers by assuring them that as a \nconsequence of the progrowth ideas we have for this budget resolution--\nwhich we hope will result in such things as a capital gains tax--as a \nconsequence we see the revenue come to the Federal Government beyond \nthat which we expect, that the only way we maintain some integrity here \nis guarantee the taxpayers that those additional dollars are either \ngoing to help us reduce the debt of this country, or we give it back to \nthe taxpayers in the form of additional tax cuts.\n  Virtually everybody in this Chamber could think of additional ways by \nwhich we might address some of the problems with the Internal Revenue \nCode, whether it is additional tax cuts for education for working \nfamilies or to a eliminate the marriage penalty or a variety of other \nthings.\n  We all know that there isn't embodied within this resolution adequate \nresources to address all of those objectives that we have as a group.\n  My feeling is that, if the taxpayers send us more money than we are \ncounting on, more money than we have asked them to, we might then use \nthose additional dollars to fund additional taxes or, alternatively, \nfor the purposes of deficit reduction.\n  So, for those reasons, I offer this amendment.\n  I also would like to say in closing here tonight that I want to offer \nmy praise particularly to Senator Domenici, whom we work with on the \nBudget Committee, for his unstinting efforts here. I have always been \nimpressed and amazed at his resilience as we go through amendment after \namendment. He leads us so well in that.\n  So, I thank Senator Domenici, both for in the committee and in the \nprior activities before we get to the committee, and then here on the \nfloor this week.\n  I offer my amendment. As I said, I am prepared, unless there is a \ndesire to debate the amendment, to yield the remainder of the time \ntonight. I guess we will vote tomorrow on this.\n  At this point, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, there is a 601(b) point of order against \nthis budget because it raises spending above the spending caps set in \nthe 1993 budget.\n  My remaining business with the budget is I want to raise this point \nof order. We are going to have 1 minute a side tomorrow, I guess, to do \nclosing. I would like to ask unanimous consent that tomorrow I be \nrecognized for the purpose of making the point of order. I can make it \nwithin the minute, and then we will have the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, I wonder if the Senator\n\n[[Page S4989]]\n\nwould agree to double that time, 2 minutes to a side.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, in light of the fact that I don't think \nthere is further debate planned on this amendment on either side, I at \nthis point yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If we yield our time, that means there is 1 minute on a \nside tomorrow under the interpretation of the Parliamentarian.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 353, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, I believe \namendment No. 353, and I ask unanimous consent that I may modify the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I send the modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 353), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 56, strike line 5 through page 58, line 12 and \n     insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 209. HIGHWAY RESERVE FUND FOR FISCAL YEARS 1998-2002.\n\n       (a) In General.--If legislation generates revenue increases \n     or direct spending reductions to finance highways and to the \n     extent that such increases or reductions are not included in \n     this concurrent resolution on the budget, the appropriate \n     budgetary levels and limits may be adjusted if such \n     adjustments do not cause an increase in the deficit in this \n     resolution.\n       (b) Adjustments for Budget Authority.--Upon the reporting \n     of legislation (the offering of an amendment thereto or \n     conference report thereon) that reduces direct non-highway \n     spending or increases revenues for a fiscal year or years, \n     the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget shall submit \n     revised budget authority allocations and aggregates by an \n     amount that equals the amount such legislation reduces direct \n     spending or increases revenues.\n       (c) Establishing a Reserve.--\n       (1) Revisions.--After the enactment of legislation \n     described in subsection (a), the Chairman of the Committee on \n     the Budget may submit revisions to the appropriate \n     allocations and aggregates by the amount that provisions in \n     such legislation generates revenue increases or direct non-\n     highway spending reductions.\n       (2) Revenue increases or direct spending reductions.--Upon \n     the submission of such revisions, the Chairman of the \n     Committee on the Budget shall also submit the amount of \n     revenue increases or direct non-highway spending reductions \n     such legislation generates and the maximum amount available \n     each year for adjustments pursuant to subsection (d).\n       (d) Adjustments for Discretionary Spending.--\n       (1) Revisions to allocations and aggregates.--Upon the \n     reporting of an appropriations measure, or when a conference \n     committee submits a conference report thereon, that \n     appropriates funds for highways, the Chairman of the \n     Committee on the Budget shall submit increased outlay \n     allocations, aggregates, and discretionary limits for the \n     amount of outlays flowing from the additional obligational \n     authority provided in such bill.\n       (2) Revisions to suballocations.--The Committee on \n     Appropriations may submit appropriately revised \n     suballocations pursuant to sections 302(b)(1) and 602(b)(1) \n     of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n       (e) Limitations.--\n       (1) In general.--The revisions made pursuant to subsection \n     (c) shall not be made--\n       (A) with respect to direct non-highway spending reductions, \n     unless the committee that generates the direct spending \n     reductions is within its allocations under section 302(a) and \n     (602)a of the Budget Act in this resolution (not including \n     the direct spending reductions envisioned in subsection (c)); \n     and\n       (B) with respect to revenue increases, unless revenues are \n     at or above the revenue aggregates in this resolution (not \n     including the revenue increases envisioned in subsection \n     (c)).\n       (2) Outlays.--The outlay adjustments made pursuant to \n     subsection (d) shall not exceed the amounts specified in \n     subsection (c)(2) for a fiscal year.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to provide a \nmeaningful and effective mechanism that will allow the Senate to boost \nsubstantially our national investment in highways. Much has been said \nover the last few days, both in the Senate and in the other body, \nregarding the critical need for our nation to reverse the trend of \nnational disinvestment in our Nation's highways.\n  My amendment would substitute the reserve fund provisions in the \ncommittee-reported resolution with a new fund that will provide the \nSenate with the opportunity to consider reported bills or individual \namendments that reduce spending in nonhighway areas or increase \nrevenues to allow for increased highway funding. Mr. President, I \nbelieve that when the Senate is faced with the very difficult process \nof reauthorizing ISTEA, there will be renewed interest in finding \nadditional funding for highways. But we must have the mechanism \navailable to us to revisit the issue. This amendment will provide us \nwith that opportunity.\n  I want to thank the chairman and ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee, Senators Domenici and Lautenberg, for their cooperation in \nthe development of this amendment.\n  I hope they will accept my amendment, as modified.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Senator Byrd has understood from our \nside through my staff and myself that we are willing to accept the \namendment. It may need further refinements, and he understands that. \nBut we have no objection to it under those circumstances.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We are pleased to support the amendment, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield back any time in opposition.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield back any time I may have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is agreeing on the amendment of \nthe Senator from West Virginia.\n  The amendment (No. 353), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Domenici and Senator \nLautenberg for their consideration and courtesy and for their \nacceptance of the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Amendments Nos. 291, 350, 351, and 356 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment \nNo. 291 by Senator Murray, amendments Nos. 350 and 351 by Senator \nHarkin, and amendment No. 356 by Senator Robb be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 291, 350, 351, and 356) were withdrawn.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I have a series of amendments here \nthat have been agreed to on both sides.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 354\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the extension of \n    the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund through fiscal year 2002)\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg], for Mr. \n     Biden, for himself, Mr. Byrd, and Mr. Gramm, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 354.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record of May 21, 1997.)\n\n[[Page S4990]]\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want to commend President Clinton and \ncongressional leaders on both sides for bringing before the Senate a \nbalanced budget.\n  I also believe that this budget goes a long way toward protecting the \nkey priorities I believe must be protected.\n  But, of all those priorities, I believe that none is more important \nthan continuing our fight against violent crime and violence against \nwomen.\n  To a great extent, this budget resolution meets this test--but, in at \nleast one area of this crime front, I believe the budget resolution \nmust be clarified.\n  The amendment I am offering, along with Senators Byrd and Gramm does \nexactly that--by clarifying that it is the sense of the Senate that the \nviolent crime control trust fund will continue through the end of this \nbudget resolution, fiscal year 2002.\n  I am particularly pleased that Senator Byrd--who, more than anyone, \ndeserves credit for the crime law trust fund. Senator Byrd worked to \ndevelop an idea that was simple as it was profound--as he called on us \nto use the savings from the reductions in the Federal work force of \n272,000 employees to fund one of the Nation's most urgent priorities: \nfighting the scourge of violent crime.\n  Senator Gramm was also one of the very first to call on the Senate to \nput our money where our mouth was. Too often, this Senate has voted to \nsend significant aid to State and local law enforcement--but, when it \ncame time to write the check, we did not find nearly the dollars we \npromised.\n  Working together in 1993, Senator Byrd, myself, Senator Gramm, and \nother Ssenators passed the violent crime control trust fund in the \nSenate. And, in 1994, it became law in the Biden crime law.\n  Since then, the dollars from the crime law trust fund have:\n  Helped add more than 60,000 community police officers to our streets;\n  Helped shelter more than 80,000 battered women and their children;\n  Focussed law enforcement, prosecutors, and victims service providers \non providing immediate help to women victimized by someone who pretends \nto love them;\n  Forced tens of thousands of drug offenders into drug testing and \ntreatment programs, instead of continuing to allow them to remain free \non probation with no supervision and no accountability;\n  Constructed thousands of prison cells for violent criminals; and\n  Brought unprecedented resources to defending our southwest border--\nputting us on the path to literally double the number of Federal border \nagents over just a 5-year period.\n  The results of this effort are already taking hold:\n  According to the FBI's national crime statistics, violent crime is \ndown and down significantly--leaving our Nation with its lowest murder \nrate since 1971;\n  The lowest violent crime total since 1990; and\n  The lowest murder rate for wives, ex-wives and girlfriends at the \nhands of their intimates to an 18-year low.\n  In short, we have proven able to do what few thought possible--by \nbeing smart, keeping our focus, and putting our money where our mouths \nare--we have actually cut violent crime.\n  Today, our challenge is to keep our focus and to stay vigilant \nagainst violent crime. Today, the Biden-Byrd-Gramm amendment before the \nSenate offers one modest step toward meeting that challenge:\n  By confirming that it is the sense of the Senate that the commitment \nto fighting crime and violence against women will continue for the full \nduration of this budget resolution.\n  By confirming that it is the sense of the Senate that the Violent \nCrime Control Trust Fund will continue--in its current form which \nprovides additional Federal assistance without adding 1 cent to the \ndeficit--for the full duration of this budget resolution.\n  The Biden-Byrd-Gramm amendment offers a few very simple choices: \nStand up for cops--or don't; Stand up for the fight against violence \nagainst women --or don't; Stand up for increased border enforcement--or \ndon't.\n  Every Member of this Senate is against violent crime--we say that in \nspeech after speech. Now, I urge all my colleagues to back up with \nwords with the only thing that we can actually do for the cop walking \nthe beat, the battered woman, the victim of crime--provide the dollars \nthat help give them the tools to fight violent criminals, standup to \ntheir abuser, and restore at least some small piece of the dignity \ntaken from them at the hands of a violent criminal.\n  Let us be very clear of the stakes here--frankly, if we do not \ncontinue the trust fund, we will not be able to continue such proven, \nvaluable efforts as the Violence Against Women law. Nothing we can do \ntoday can guarantee that we, in fact, will continue the Violence \nAgainst Women Act when the law expires in the year 2000.\n  But, mark my words, if the trust fund ends, the efforts to provide \nshelter, help victims, and get tough on the abusers and batterers will \nwither on the vine. Passing the amendment I offer today will send a \nclear, unambiguous message that the trust fund should continue and with \nit, the historic effort undertaken by the Violence Against Women Act \nthat says by word, deed and dollar that the Federal Government stands \nwith women and against the misguided notion that domestic violence is a \nman's right and not really a crime.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Biden-Byrd-Gramm amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 354) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 352, As Modified\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautengerg], for Mr. Kohl, \n     for himself and Mr. Kerry, proposes an amendment numbered \n     352, as modified.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  If there is no objection, the amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 352), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Scientific research on the development of the brain has \n     confirmed that the early childhood years, particularly from \n     birth to the age of 3, are critical to children's \n     development.\n       (2) Studies repeatedly have shown that good quality child \n     care helps children develop well, enter school ready to \n     succeed, improve their skills, cognitive abilities and \n     socioemotional development, improve classroom learning \n     behavior, and stay safe while their parents work. Further, \n     quality early childhood programs can positively affect \n     children's long-term success in school achievement, higher \n     earnings as adults, decrease reliance on public assistance \n     and decrease involvement with the criminal justice system.\n       (3) The first of the National Education Goals, endorsed by \n     the Nation's governors, passed by Congress and signed into \n     law by President Bush, stated that by the year 2000, every \n     child should enter school ready to learn and that access to a \n     high quality early childhood education program was integral \n     to meeting this goal.\n       (4) According to data compiled by the RAND Corporation, \n     while 90 percent of human brain growth occurs by the age of \n     3, public spending on children in that age range equals only \n     8 percent of spending on all children. A vast majority of \n     public spending on children occurs after the brain has gone \n     through its most dramatic changes, often to correct problems \n     that should have been addressed during early childhood \n     development.\n       (5) According to the Department of Education, of \n     $29,400,000,000 in current estimated education expenditures, \n     only $1,500,000,000, or 5 percent, is spent on children from \n     birth to age 5. The vast majority is spent on children over \n     age 5.\n       (6) A new commitment to quality child care and early \n     childhood education is a necessary response to the fact that \n     children from birth to the age of 3 are spending more time in \n     care away from their homes. Almost 60 percent of women in the \n     workforce have children under the age of 3 requiring care.\n       (7) Many States and communities are currently experimenting \n     with innovative programs directed at early childhood care and\n\n[[Page S4991]]\n\n     education in a variety of care settings, including the home. \n     States and local communities are best able to deliver \n     efficient, cost-effective services, but while such programs \n     are long on demand, they are short on resources. Additional \n     Federal resources should not create new bureaucracy, but \n     build on successful locally driven efforts.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the budget totals and levels in this resolution assume \n     that funds ought to be directed toward increasing the supply \n     of quality child care, early childhood education, and teacher \n     and parent training for children from birth through age 3.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 352), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

Mr. President, I have an amendment of Senator Kit Bond \non the highway trust fund. It has been cleared on both sides. I send it \nto the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Mr. Bond, \n     proposes an amendment No. 325.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record of May 21, 1997.)\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I must start by saying that this is not an \nISTEA amendment, this is not a formula amendment, this is not a 4.3 \ncents amendment, this is not an Amtrak amendment, this is not an off-\nbudget amendment.\n  This is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment concerning reestablishing the \nlinkage between the revenues deposited in the highway trust fund and \ntransportation spending.\n  Mr. President, if I can take just a moment I want to read this short \nsense-of-the-Senate.\n\n       The Senate finds that--\n       One, there is no direct linkage between the fuel taxes \n     deposited in the Highway Trust Fund and the transportation \n     spending from the Highway Trust Fund.\n       Two, the Federal budget process has served this linkage by \n     dividing revenues and spending into separate budget \n     categories with fuel taxes deposited in the Highway Trust \n     Fund as revenues; and most spending from the Highway Trust \n     Fund in the discretionary category.\n       Three, each budget category referred to has its own rules \n     and procedures.\n       Four, under budget rules in effect prior to the date of \n     adoption of this resolution, an increase in fuel taxes \n     permits increased spending to be included in the budget, but \n     not for increased Highway Trust Fund spending.\n       It is the sense of the Senate that in this session of \n     Congress, Congress should, within a unified budget, change \n     the Federal budget process to establish a linkage between the \n     fuel taxes deposited in the Highway Trust Fund, including any \n     fuel tax increases that may be enacted into law after the \n     date of adoption of this resolution, and the spending from \n     the Highway Trust Fund. Changes to the budgetary process of \n     the Highway Trust Fund should not result in total program \n     levels for highways or mass transit that is inconsistent with \n     those allowed for under the resolution.\n\n  This sense-of-the-Senate is self explanatory, but let me provide some \nbackground.\n  Mr. President, back in 1956 the Federal highway trust fund was \nestablished as a way to finance the Federal-Aid Highway Program. This \nwas a dedicated trust fund supported by direct user fees/taxes. It was \ncalled a trust fund because, once the money went in, we were suppose to \nbe able to trust that money would come back out for use on our roads, \nhighways, and bridges.\n  However, the 1990 Budget Act eliminated the linkage between the \nrevenues raised by the user taxes and the spending from the \ntransportation trust fund. We know that we promised ourselves and our \nconstituents that the highway user taxes deposited into the highway \ntrust fund would be used for highways, but we now have an illogical \nprocess that does not always result in the desired outcome. With the \nprocess currently in place balances are accumulating in the trust fund \nand not being spent on the vitally important transportation needs we \nhave.\n  To correct the problem, we must reform our budget process.\n\n[[Page S4992]]\n\n  Mr. President, status quo is not sustainable.\n  Senator Chafee and I have introduced S. 404, the Highway Trust Fund \nIntegrity Act. I know that not everyone agrees with the revenue \nconstrained fund approach taken in that bill. However, I think everyone \ncan agree with this sense-of-the Senate that we must work something \nout. We must establish the linkage to ensure that the taxes deposited \ninto the highway trust fund are spend on transportation.\n  I share the concerns that many of my colleagues have--on both sides \nof the aisle--that we need to find ways to spend more on \ntransportation. This budget resolution moves us closer to that goal. I \nwant to thank the chairman of the Budget Committee and the ranking \nmember for including in the budget resolution the assumption of \nspending all of the estimated highway trust fund tax receipts that \ncomes in each year for highways.\n  All of us share the same belief that transportation funding is \ncritical to our individual States and the entire country. \nTransportation links our communities, towns, and cities with markets. \nIt links our constituents with their schools, hospitals, churches, and \njobs. An effective transportation system will help move this country \ninto the 21st century.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that as this Congress moves forward on \none of the most important and probably most difficult pieces of \nlegislation--ISTEA--we also continue our efforts to ensure that \n``trust'' is in the highway trust fund.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 funding for natural resource programs\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to ask the distinguished \nranking member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and \nWater Development, Senator Reid, and the distinguished ranking member \nof the Budget Committee, Senator Lautenberg, if they would respond to \nquestions I have concerning funding for natural resource programs in \nthe budget resolution for fiscal year 1998.\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to respond to a question from the senator \nfrom California.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I look forward to her question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me first ask my friend and State neighbor, Senator \nReid, to recall the provision in last year's omnibus appropriations \nbill, that authorized the California Bay-Delta Environmental \nEnhancement and Water Security Act. The Act authorizes Federal \nparticipation in the CALFED Bay-Delta Program, which is charged with \ndeveloping a balanced, comprehensive and lasting plan to restore and \nenhance the ecological health and improve water management in the Bay-\nDelta system. This program is a top priority of the State of California \nand has support from business, environmental and water users throughout \nthe State. I would like to ask Senator Reid, as the ranking member of \nthe appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over this act, if he \nagrees with me that it is important to fund this program?\n  Mr. REID. I want to thank the Senator from California for bringing \nthis issue to my attention. Indeed, I believe the Bay-Delta program \nserves as a national model on how we can bring environmental, \nagribusiness, and other water users to the same table with the goal of \npreserving our natural resources for many uses. I see the program has \nhaving a particular benefit for our Western States. If California \nrestores its environment and improves its water supply reliability, \nthen we relieve the pressure on the Colorado River and lessen any \ntensions among the seven Colorado River States. When California \nrestores migratory bird habitat and provides water for wildlife \nrefuges, the health of the Pacific flyway will be improved, benefitting \nStates from Arizona to Alaska.\n  While the investments will be made in California, the benefits will \nbe realized throughout the west. I look forward to working with the \nsenator from California on the Bay-Delta project on the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Senator. Let me now ask our very distinguished \nranking member of the Senate Budget committee, Senator Lautenberg, \nabout the Bay-Delta program. Senator Lautenberg, as one of the \nnegotiators involved in this current budget agreement and as a member \nof the Budget Committee leadership, is it your view that the amounts \nprovided under the Natural Resources function in this Budget Resolution \nare sufficient to accommodate the President's request of $143 million \nin fiscal year 1998 to implement the California Bay-Delta Environmental \nand Water Security Act?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Let me first also express my support for this \ncritical program to protect California's Bay-Delta system. I do believe \nthat the amount that the Budget Committee has provided under the \nnatural resources function is sufficient to accommodate the funding of \nthe California Bay-Delta Environmental Water Security Act.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to thank both of the Senators for their time to \ndiscuss the Bay-Delta project and, for their\n\n[[Page S4993]]\n\nsupport as fellow members of the Appropriations Committee, for the \nPresident's request for funding the program in fiscal year 1998.\n\n\n                     funding for veterans' programs\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I wish to comment on the impact this \nbudget agreement will have on America's veterans, and to express my \nconcerns that funding assumed under the agreement will not be \nsufficient to provide for adequate health care for America's veterans.\n  If it is approved, the budget resolution will require the Committee \non Veterans' Affairs [VA] to report legislation which will reduce \nentitlement spending, over a 5-year period, by $2.7 billion compared to \nthe budget baseline. That sounds like, and is, a substantial sum. \nHowever, I believe the committee will be able to meet this goal by \nextending the expiration dates of savings provisions already enacted as \npart of prior deficit reduction measures, and by agreeing to round down \nto the nearest dollar future cost-of-living adjustments.\n  No one is happy that controlling the deficit requires restrained \ngrowth in mandatory-account spending for veterans' benefits. But I am \nconfident that the committee will be able to meet its mandatory \nspending instructions in such a way as to ensure that no provision in \nthe final reconciliation bill will result in a veteran who receives a \nbenefit this year not also receiving the same benefit next year. \nIndeed, even after the committee has complied with its reconciliation \ninstructions, spending for veterans' benefits from mandatory accounts \nwill increase each year the budget agreement is in effect.\n  I am also pleased that the proposed budget resolution permits the \ncommittee to report legislation which will allow VA to retain money it \ncollects from private health insurance carriers when VA treats the \nnonservice-connected illnesses of veterans who have health insurance. \nUnder current law, VA is required to bill insurance companies when it \ntreats the nonservice-connected illnesses of insured veterans. However, \nVA is required to transfer the money it collects to the Treasury. \nAllowing VA to retain the money it collects will provide a real \nincentive for more efficient and effective collections.\n  However, the administration proposed its health insurance proceeds \nretention provision with a hook. The President, in requesting the \nauthority to allow VA to retain health insurance proceeds, also \nproposed that VA receive, initially, a cut in appropriated funds for VA \nmedical care and that appropriations be frozen at that reduced level \nover the succeeding 4 years. historically, VA has needed an increase of \nalmost a half a billion dollars a year just to pay for VA employees' \ncost-of-living salary adjustments and for the increased costs of \nmedical supplies and equipment.\n  In its April 24, 1997, ``Views and Estimates'' letter to the Budget \nCommittee, the Veterans' Affairs Committee expressed its serious \nconcerns about the wisdom of relying on an untested source of revenue--\ninsurance collections--for a program as critical as veterans' health \ncare. I continue to have that concern.\n  The budget resolution now before this body is even worse than the \nPresident's initial proposal. It does not merely carry forward the \nPresident's proposal to cut appropriations for VA medical care, and \nthen maintain that reduced level of appropriations for 5 years. Under \nthis proposal, VA discretionary spending in 1998 will be $400 million \nless than it was in fiscal year 1997, and $3.1 billion less than \ncurrent levels over the 5-year term of the agreement, even after \nallowing for retained health insurance collections.\n  The cost of providing health care for veterans consumes over 417 \nbillion of $18 billion plus in VA discretionary spending. Almost all of \nthe rest of VA discretionary spending is expended on construction, \nmedical research, and for the salaries of VA employees who process \nveterans' disability claims. There are no unimportant discretionary \naccounts with VA's budget. According to VA, each 4100 million pays for \nabout 1,400 VA care givers, and for care for about 22,000 veterans.\n  In February, 1997, Dr. Kenneth Kizer, VA's Under Secretary for \nHealth, announced an initiative to increase the number of veterans VA \ntreats by 20 percent and to reduce VA's cost per patient by 30 percent. \nIn time, reforms in the delivery of VA care may enable VA to absorb \nreal reductions in health care funding. But those reforms have not yet \ntaken root. Further, it takes money to make money. According to VA, \nreforms needed to achieve Dr. Kizer's ambitious goals will cost money \nto implement. If Congress reduces VA medical funding before VA's \nreforms are implemented, we should not be surprised if VA's goals of \nincreasing the number of veterans treated, and reducing the average \ncost of treating each patient, are postponed or even abandoned. I \nbelieve that would be a false economy, and a tragedy for our veterans.\n  I recognize that discretionary spending assumptions are just that \nassumptions. The actual decisions will be made as the Congress debates \nand enacts appropriations bills to fund discretionary programs. The \nAppropriations Committee always faces heavy pressure to ensure adequate \nfunding for VA medical care. This budget resolution will only increase \nthat pressure.\n  Mr. President, 26 million American veterans will watch to see how--\nand if--the Congress will rise to the challenge presented by the \ndiscretionary spending assumptions affecting the VA in this budget \nresolution. I will fight to assure that adequate funding for veterans' \nhealth care is provided. In my estimation, appropriations for \ndiscretionary spending on veterans' programs, which are assumed under \nthis budget agreement, are not sufficient. I intend to work hard, as \nchairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee and as a member of the \nAppropriations Committee, to correct this inequity.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to have supported \nthe amendment offered by my colleague from Florida, Senator Mack, which \nexpresses the sense of the Senate that Federal funding for biomedical \nresearch should be doubled over the next 5 years. This amendment is \nbased on a resolution which I cosponsored, Senate Joint Resolution 15--\none of the first bills the Republican leadership introduced in the \n105th Congress. That resolution, and the amendment we adopted last \nnight, sends a message to the American people, as well as to scientists \nand policy makers, that Congress is committed to enhanced funding for \nthis crucial research.\n  Americans consistently identify increased funding for medical \nresearch as something they believe should be a national priority. They \nwant researchers to unravel the mysteries of cancer, Alzheimer's \ndisease, Parkinson's, cystic fibrosis, heart disease, HIV, multiple \nsclerosis, and countless other diseases which plague Americans today. \nAnd they do not want their national leaders or scientists to rest until \nthere is a cure.\n  We must bring the full force of our country's tremendous resources to \nbear on these diseases in the same way we rallied to be the first to \nset foot on the Moon. We are a nation that has split atoms, sent probes \nto the far reaches of the solar system, and eradicated polio from the \nface of the Earth. We ought to be able to conquer these diseases.\n  Over the years, we have increased our Federal commitment to medical \nresearch. For example, 25 years ago, Congress allocated just $400 \nmillion to the National Cancer Institute. Today, total funding for \ncancer research at the National Institutes of Health for this fiscal \nyear is $2.7 billion. This represents an increase of close to 700 \npercent. And this infusion of Federal funding is working. For the very \nfirst time since cancer mortality statistics were first collected in \n1930, mortality rates from cancer are actually decreasing.\n  Researchers are beginning to isolate the genes responsible for \nvarious diseases at a seemingly breathtaking speed, and gene therapy \nmay someday offer exciting new treatments--or even a cure--for these \ndiseases. Scientists are beginning to understand the very workings of \ncancer cells, and immunotherapy may offer cancer sufferers new hope. \nBut how this knowledge may someday be translated into benefits for \neveryday Americans is yet unknown. We need to increase Federal funding \nso that we can capitalize on these important breakthroughs.\n  Throughout my tenure in both the House and Senate, I have worked hard \nto increase funding for medical research. In fact, on the first \nlegislative day of this session, I introduced a bill\n\n[[Page S4994]]\n\nwhich would raise the reauthorization level for breast cancer funding \nto a record $590 million. The Mack resolution demonstrates the very \nsame commitment to ensuring that Americans no longer suffer from \ndiseases that cut their lives short and cause undue suffering. Our \nenhanced investment in medical research will save countless lives and \nhealth care dollars, and alleviate suffering in millions of Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/22/senate-section/article/S4944-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ACCURATE MEASURE OF THE COST OF LIVING\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, this budget may solve our short-term \nbudget problems, but my concern remains that it does not do enough \nabout the long-term budget problems we face. If we want to keep the \nbudget in check over the long-haul, we need to adopt policies that will \nslow entitlement spending in a rational, equitable way.\n  At present, we use the Consumer Price Index [CPI] to determine cost-\nof-living adjustments in our Federal tax and entitlement programs. \nThere is wide, although not universal, agreement among leading \neconomists, that the CPI overstates the cost-of-living and should be \nadjusted. Indeed the December 4, 1996 final report to the Senate \nFinance Committee from the Advisory Commission to Study the Consumer \nPrice Index concluded that:\n\n       The Commission's best estimate of the size of the upward \n     bias looking forward is 1.1 percentage points per year. The \n     range of plausible values is .8 to 1.6 points per year.\n\n  Mr. President, we ought not to make the problems we face in funding \nour entitlement programs even worse by paying benefits based on an \noverstated cost of living. Spending on entitlement programs is already \ncrowding out spending for the traditional discretionary functions of \nGovernment like clean air and water, a strong national defense, parks \nand recreation, education, our transportation system, research and \ndevelopment, and other infrastructure spending.\n  If steps are not taken to reverse this trend, nearly all Federal \nrevenues will be consumed by entitlement spending and interest on the \ndebt shortly after the year 2000. By 2030, revenues may not even cover \nentitlement spending, much less interest on the debt or a single dollar \nof discretionary spending. This is an unsustainable trend.\n  Adjusting the cost-of-living adjustments triggered by the CPI, by 1 \npercentage point, would produce nearly a trillion dollars in savings \nover 12 years and $46 billion in 2002 alone. To illustrate what just \nhalf of this amount--$23 billion--in domestic discretionary spending \ncould fund, I have a list of programs and what they will cost in \ninflation-adjusted numbers in 2002. This entire list of programs could \nbe funded by half of a 1 percentage point reduction in CPI, with money \nto spare.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                                               Cost in fiscal year 2002\nCleaning up environmentally damaged sites....................\\1\\ $6.356\nHead Start....................................................\\1\\ 4.455\nAgriculture Research..........................................\\1\\ 2.005\nNational Park Service.........................................\\1\\ 1.770\nSafe Drinking Water...........................................\\1\\ 1.425\nSuperfund.....................................................\\1\\ 1.421\nFish and Wildlife Service.....................................\\1\\ 1.417\nClean Water Programs............................................\\2\\.736\nNSF Education and Human Resources...............................\\2\\.682\nEducation Technology............................................\\2\\.370\nSolar and Renewable Energy......................................\\2\\.281\nViolence Against Women..........................................\\2\\.214\nJuvenile Justice Program........................................\\2\\.185\nNational Endowment for the Humanities...........................\\2\\.123\nNational Endowment for the Arts.................................\\2\\.111\n                                                             __________\n                                                             \n      Total in billions of dollars...............................21.551\n\n\\1\\ In billions of dollars.\n\\2\\ In millions of dollars.\n\n  Mr. KERREY.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nadditional $700 million appropriation for the Land and Water \nConservation Fund [LWCF] included in the balanced budget agreement. \nWhile I commend the President and congressional leadership for \nrecognizing the importance of the LWCF, I have concerns that this \nadditional appropriation will not be spent on the priorities for which \nthe LWCF was established.\n  I urge congressional appropriators not to use this additional LWCF \nmoney on a handful of large projects, including the acquisition of \nHeadwaters Forest in California and the New World Mine in Montana. \nThose projects were identified as priority land acquisitions by \npoliticians, not by Federal land managers. Rather, I urge the \nappropriators to spend this additional LWCF money as the Land and Water \nConservation Act directs on the hundreds of priority land acquisitions \nand local recreation projects identified by Federal land management \nagencies and the States.\n  As originally envisioned, the administration planned to acquire the \nHeadwaters and the New World Mine through land exchanges. Now, under \nthe terms of the budget agreement, these lands would not be acquired by \nland exchange but by purchase.\n  Mr. President, this change sets a horrible precedent. It is bad \npublic policy, and the Congress should not be a partner in this land \ngrab, as now proposed. I also fear that these land grabs, which do not \ninvolve public participation and which are inconsistent with land \nmanagement plans, may become the norm as opposed to the exception.\n  Recently, the President announced the creation of the 1.7 million \nacre Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah. He made the \nsame sort of promises from Arizona that he made in Yellowstone when he \nspoke about the controversy surrounding the New World Mine. The Utah \nNational Monument lands contain 176,000 acres of school trust lands \nthat contain approximately 1.54 billion dollars' worth of coal deposits \nwhich, if extracted, would fund the Utah school systems. The President \nindicated that other Federal lands in Utah would be made available, and \nthe schoolchildren in Utah would not be hurt by the creation of the \nNational Monument. There are apparently no plans to complete land \nexchanges in Montana or California, and the taxpayers are going to take \nanother hit for Presidential promises. One only has to wonder what we \nare going to do to make the schoolchildren of Utah whole. If we begin \nby fully funding the acquisitions at Headwaters and the Mine, how do we \nignore Utah when the President decides to just buy them out. This is \nnot how Congress intended for the Land and Water Conservation Act to be \nused.\n  Over 30 years ago, in a remarkable bipartisan effort, Congress and \nthe President created the LWCF. The LWCF provides funds for the \npurchase of Federal land by the land management agencies--the Federal-\nside LWCF program--and creates a unique partnership among Federal, \nState, and local governments for the acquisition of public outdoor \nrecreation areas and facilities--the State-side LWCF program. The LWCF \nis funded primarily from offshore oil and gas leasing revenues which \nnow exceed $3 billion annually, and has been authorized through the \nyear 2015 at an annual ceiling of $900 million.\n  However, LWCF moneys must be annually appropriated. And, despite the \nincrease in offshore oil and gas revenues, the LWCF has not fared well \nin this decade. Expenditures from the LWCF have fluctuated widely over \nits life but have generally ranged from $200 to $300 million per year. \nIn the 1990's, total appropriations to both the Federal and State sides \nof LWCF steadily declined from a high of $341 million during the Bush \nadministration to $149 million in fiscal year 1997.\n  Most significantly, all of the fiscal year 1997 appropriation was for \nthe exclusive purpose of Federal land acquisition. In 1995, Congress \nand the President agreed to shut down the State-\n\n[[Page S4995]]\n\nside LWCF program. For fiscal year 1998, the President has requested \n$165 million for Federal land acquisitions and only $1 million for \nmonitoring previously funded State-side projects. The President did not \nrequest any funds for new State-side projects.\n  Mr. President, I believe the additional appropriation provided for in \nthe budget agreement presents a significant opportunity to right those \nmisguided decisions on the use of the LWCF.\n  The State-side of the LWCF has played a vital role in providing \nrecreational and educational opportunities to millions of Americans. \nState-side LWCF grants have helped finance well over 37,500 park and \nrecreation projects in all 50 States, including campgrounds, trails, \nand open space.\n  The availability of these outdoor recreation facilities is critical \nto the well-being of Americans. People who participate in outdoor \nrecreation activities, whatever the activity, are happier and \nhealthier. Recreation is an important component of our economy. \nMoreover, while trips to our National Parks create experiences and \nmemories which last a lifetime, day-in and day-out, people recreate \nclose to home. In fiscal year 1995, the last year for which the State-\nside LWCF grant program was funded, there were nearly 3,800 \napplications for State-side grants. Unfortunately, there was only \nenough money to fund 500 projects. The demand for those local \nrecreation resources is increasing.\n\n  That is why stateside LWCF grants are so important. Stateside LWCF \ngrants help address the highest priority needs of Americans for outdoor \nrecreation. At the same time, because of the matching requirement for \nstateside LWCF grants, these grants provide vital seed money which \nlocal communities use to forge partnerships with private entities. In \nthe absence of the grants, I fear local park and recreation services \nwill fail to meet the ever-growing demands of the American public, and \nthe Federal Government will be asked to fill the void--a role the \nFederal Government cannot, and should not, play.\n  At the same time, the Federal land management agencies have \nidentified, through their planning processes, the lands they would like \nto purchase for inclusion in the Federal estate. Again, the purchases \nwould be made with LWCF moneys. The lands often are in holdings in \nnational parks or forests. Or, they may be lands with unique \ncharacteristics which the Federal land managers believe should be owned \nby the Federal Government. Interestingly, neither Headwaters Forest nor \nthe New World Mine meet these criteria. Rather, both the Headwaters \nForest and the New World Mine, have been labeled as Federal land \npriorities according to the politicians, not to the professional land \nmanagers.\n  The budget agreement, as interpreted by the Clinton administration, \nwould ignore hundreds of prioritized projects and focus on a handful. \nThe $315 million the President would like to spend on Headwaters Forest \nand New World Mine could be spent on hundreds of park and recreation \nfacilities throughout the Nation. Would the American people rather own \n5,000 acres in California and a mine in Montana, or park and recreation \nfacilities Americans can enjoy on a daily basis?\n  Why should Congress bail out the administration because it could not \nfulfill the terms of deals it made on its own for the acquisition of \nHeadwaters Forest and New World Mine?\n  Once again, when he announced each of those deals, the President \npromised the lands would be acquired through land exchanges. We stand \nready to work with the President on land exchanges to accomplish his \npriorities in Montana and California. But this should be a process \nwhere the President and Congress work together. Instead, those who have \nbeen waiting for years for the Government to acquire their lands, as \nthey were promised when we incorporated private lands into national \nparks and forests, will just have to wait. Moreover, children \nthroughout urban America may not have a park to play in or bike trail \nto ride on because their money was spent on the old growth redwoods in \nCalifornia and the New World Mine in Montana\n  We have held no hearings on the New World Mine. There have been no \nhearings on Headwaters. Congress has not been a participant in this \nprocess. In fact, most of us know little about the two proposals. On \nthe other hand, we know quite a bit about the stateside of the LWCF. \nAll of our constituents and all of our States have benefited from new \ngreenways, trails, scenic pathways, bicycle trails, parks, recreation \nfacilities, ball parks, open spaces, and the list goes on and on and \non.\n  Mr. President, I encourage my friends on the Appropriations Committee \nto seriously evaluate the President's proposal in light of the priority \nprojects that could otherwise be funded under the LWCF. We have an \nopportunity to save and enhance a program that has proved to be \nbeneficial to all Americans. Let us weigh the pros and cons, and be \nmindful of the dangerous precedent we will set if we just swim merrily \nalong with the President into his ocean of land acquisition.\n  Unfortunately, the majority of city kids will never see the \nHeadwaters or the site of the New World Mine. But a majority of city \nkids will see and be able to experience the results of the LWCF if \nproperly applied. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, during my tenure in the Senate, I have \nlong been concerned about our Nation's economic fundamentals and long-\nterm competitive and economic vitality. During the 1980's, budget \ndeficits roared upward as both spending increased and major tax cuts \nwere enacted. As Senator Hollings mentioned here last night, it can be \nan intoxicating combination to slash taxes for constituents while \npumping up spending. This is what we did in those years. In a way, we \njust stole from the future, from our childrens' future and from the \nstrength of the economy that they will live in.\n  Fortunately in 1993, we turned this trend around. Since passage of \nthe 1993 budget, our Nation has shaved $2.5 trillion off of our budget \ndeficit. This is a stunning turnaround for our country, and we are on \nthe verge of achieving the kind of balance and fiscal responsibility \nthat I have been fighting for these many years. If the truth be told, \nthis balanced budget resolution, which we are debating now, is rather \nmodest and only cuts another $207 billion off during the next 5 years. \nThis is a tenth of what we accomplished in 1993. However, this \nresolution is vastly better than the draconian and unfair budget \npackage the Republican majority tried to pass in 1995.\n  Our fiscal prudence has brought down interest rates, helped increase \ninvestment and business activity, and increased our employment levels \ndramatically. Continuing this trend makes sense for our Nation and \nmakes sense for New Mexico.\n  Balancing the budget is an important component of fiscal health--but \nwe would be making a great mistake--to think that this solves all of \nour economic problems. We need to know the details of the tax \nframework, which we will soon debate, to fully understand how this \nbudget will impact the lives and quality of life of our citizens. New \nMexico is still trailing much of the Nation, and has a long way to go \nbefore my State will share as it should in the growth of this economy. \nNew Mexicans have the lowest level of pension coverage in the Nation; \nthe lowest level of health care coverage; the highest poverty rate in \nthe Nation and the only State in the Nation to worsen its poverty level \nduring the last 2 years; we also have the highest unemployment levels \nwest of the Mississippi.\n  New Mexico is not expecting large hand-outs to improve its \nsituation--but we need to be sure that the budget framework we are \ndebating here--and the follow-on tax bill, which represents the small \nprint at the bottom of the contract--impacts New Mexico fairly in \nrelation to other parts of the Nation. I want to make sure that we \ninvest in education, which provides the best chance for the people of \nmy State to get ahead. And I want to make sure that any tax cuts we \nprovide are responsible, equitable, and reward the hard working \nfamilies in New Mexico and across the country.\n  While I support this budget, we need to be honest about the fact that \nthis budget does not deal with the looming challenge of increased \nSocial Security and Medicare entitlement spending caused by the aging \nof the Baby Boom generation. Also, we are not incorporating any \nstructural changes in our\n\n[[Page S4996]]\n\ndefense spending. In fact, it is hardly reflected in this budget that \nthe Soviet Union has dissolved and that strategic threats to our Nation \nhave dramatically decreased. Our defense strategy seems to be primarily \nthe product of inertia.\n  Although the details of the accompanying tax bills are not yet clear, \nthere are some items that concern me greatly. First, I am concerned \nthat the $500 per child tax credit is not clearly specified as \nrefundable. If this is not refundable, it means that low-income working \nfamilies in New Mexico will not significantly benefit from this \nprovision and will largely help those who are already better off in our \nsociety; 45 percent of the tax filers in New Mexico have adjusted gross \nincomes below $15,000; 70 percent have income levels below $30,000. \nThis means that the majority of those in my State--and probably \nothers--will not benefit much from this per child tax credit unless we \nmake this credit refundable.\n  In the areas of capital gains relief, inheritance tax exclusions, and \nIRA tax cuts, I see something very dangerous brewing that we must not \nallow to happen. While I don't want to see Medicare cuts made just to \nput money in the pockets of the wealthy, I can support reasonable tax \ncuts--as long as they do not come at the expense of achieving real \nbalance in our budget or at the expense of improving our schools or \nenvironment. But in this deal, $85 billion in cuts is pledged during \nthe first 5 years of the agreement--and nearly double that amount, $165 \nbillion, is pledged in the following 5 years, 2003-7. Given that the \ntax cuts are priced at $42 billion in the 10th year of this program--\nand are increasing at a rate of $5 billion a year during the last 3 \nyears--we can logically anticipate tax cuts in the vicinity of $500 \nbillion or more, or over half a trillion dollars, during the next 10 \nyears 2008-17.\n  What is alarming about this is that if the numbers I just cited are \nbelievable, then all of this celebration on balancing the budget could \nbe premature. The effect of a tax package with these characteristics \nwould be to reduce taxes on well-off Americans by half a trillion \ndollars, while leaving middle and lower income working Americans with \nvery little relief. A half trillion dollar reduction in our Federal \nrevenues could throw our budget again into substantial deficit. And \njust at the time that we have discovered that we are once again living \nbeyond our means, then the crushing entitlement costs of retiring Baby \nBoomers will hit us.\n  I hope we can develop a tax bill that will avoid this result--and \nI am confident that this budget resolution can be complied with in a \nfiscally responsible manner.\n\n\n                               Education\n\n  As others have said before me, this budget resolution and the \nbalanced budget agreement should be applauded for including many key \neducation programs, including provisions such as increases in Pell \ngrants to $3,000 per student, a new $35 billion program to help more \nstudents attend college, and substantial increases in funding for \neducation technology, Goals 2000 grants to States, and other programs \nto help improve elementary and secondary education.\n  Despite these important elements, however, I believe there are at \nleast two key remaining issues we should address if we hope to make \nthis resolution a blueprint for a more effective system of public \neducation.\n  The first of these education issues is school construction. Our \nschools' need for funding for school repair and construction is perhaps \nthe most obvious and compelling need that is ignored in this \nresolution.\n  With a student population that is 47 percent rural and a significant \nportion of the Nation's BIA schools, New Mexico is facing a school \nconstruction problem that exceeds that of many other States. Over 90 \npercent of New Mexico's schools need to upgrade or repair onsite \nbuildings; 44 percent of districts report having at least one building \nin need of serious repair or replacement. And as one of the fastest-\ngrowing States in the Nation, over 70 percent of our high school \nstudents are forced to attend schools that are as large or larger than \nthe 900-student maximum at which student achievement begins to \ndeteriorate.\n  For this reason, I am an original cosponsor of the Moseley-Braun \namendment to restore $5 billion in funding to help local school \nconstruction efforts.\n  A second educational issue we need to address is rigorous standards \nfor students receiving tuition tax deductions. Now that the President \nand the leadership have agreed on the need to develop a new $35 billion \nprogram to help more students go on to college, it will be essential to \nensure that these students are prepared to succeed once they arrive.\n  For the proposed $10,000 tax deduction, we need to find uniform and \nrigorous measures of academic preparedness to ensure that these funds \nare being used effectively.\n  A clear measure of academic preparation is necessary because it is \nincreasingly clear that fewer and fewer of those enrolling are \nreceiving adequate preparation to meet the challenge of college-level \nwork. And as a result, more and more students are dropping out, taking \nremedial courses, or struggling academically.\n  However, linking eligibility for these tax benefits to a student's \ngrade point average--whether it be in college or in high school--\nignores the fact that grades are not a sufficiently uniform or rigorous \nmeasure, given the decentralized nature of our schools and colleges.\n  We need to consider more uniform measures, including widely used \nexaminations and adaptations of other assessments for high school \nstudents that may be available. Without taking reasonable steps to \nensure the academic readiness of students, this new investment to \nencourage more students to attend college could be a cruel and \nexpensive hoax.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to address this issue \nwhen the tax bill is being considered later this year.\n  Mr. President, I will support passage of this budget resolution and \nam glad that we are finally closing in on a balanced budget and the \nkind of fiscal responsibility that benefits our Nation and our people. \nBut I support this resolution somewhat concerned about the implementing \nlanguage. If we are not careful, we could adopt legislation which \ninstitutionalizes a disparity between what we raise and what we spend.\n  I pledge my best effort to see that the end result of all these \nefforts is of benefit to working families in my State and it is the \nhope that we will arrive at such an end result that causes me to vote \n``Aye'' on the resolution.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I am pleased that this budget agreement \nincludes my proposal to give Amtrak a capital fund. My proposal creates \nan Amtrak reserve fund which would give Amtrak the capital funds that \nit needs to survive. Amtrak is currently borrowing to meet payroll and \nif additional capital funding is not provided, Amtrak President Tom \nDowns, has testified that the company will not survive beyond mid-1998.\n  Let me be clear. This reserve fund is not my first preference. Amtrak \ntoday needs funding that I would prefer to do through direct spending. \nHowever, this reserve fund language is a compromise with the chairman \nof the Budget Committee to ensure that the Appropriations Committee \nwill continue to have complete control over the funding of Amtrak.\n  Our compromise language would allow spending caps for passenger rail \nto be raised by the amount of revenue raised in the Senate Finance \nCommittee. It is the first step, and a very critical step, for ensuring \nthat Amtrak would be able to receive the capital funds, subject to the \nappropriations process, it needs to survive.\n  This provision does not create a trust fund nor ensure the creation \nof a trust fund for Amtrak. It is merely a placemark in the budget \nwhich provides that should money be raised for Amtrak, the spending \ncaps would be raised by that amount.\n  Three more steps are required if Amtrak is to see a capital fund:\n  First, legislation must be enacted to create a fund; second, \nlegislation must be enacted which pays for the fund; and finally, once \nall these steps have been accomplished, the appropriators must act to \nfund Amtrak. Let me reiterate, that the fate of Amtrak will continue to \nbe in the appropriators' hands.\n  Again, this is the first significant step to allow for a creation of \na fund for Amtrak this year. This provision is\n\n[[Page S4997]]\n\nnecessary so that the creation of such a fund would not be in violation \nof the Budget Act. It merely creates room in the budget to allow \nspending from the rail fund, provided money is raised to finance this \nfund.\n  Let me also say that this provision does not in any way put funding \nahead of legislative reforms for Amtrak. Many Senators supporting this \nprovision also support legislative reforms. I believe Amtrak must be \nable to operate like a business. Amtrak needs these reforms and they \nmust be enacted this year. Senator Hutchison has recently introduced a \nmajor reform package which I generally support. I believe any \nadditional capital funding must be done in conjunction with this reform \npackage. This Amtrak reserve fund would not prevent this from \nhappening. Again, the provision we are debating today merely says that \nshould a trust fund be created and funded, there would be room in the \nbudget.\n  Also, this provision does not rely on the transfer of a half-cent \nfrom the 4.3 cent per gallon motor fuels tax. It has nothing to do with \nthe 4.3 cent per gallon motor fuels tax. This reserve fund would be \nfinanced without such a transfer. My goal, however, would be that total \ncapital funding for Amtrak would equal the revenues derived from a \nhalf-cent.\n   Mr. President, we cannot lose our national passenger rail system. If \nsomething is not done to give Amtrak the capital funds it needs, Amtrak \nwill not survive. This is not an idle threat. GAO has testified before \nmy committee that this is the case. Amtrak President Tom Downs has \ntestified that the company would not survive past 1998. Amtrak's \nfinancial report proves it. The question before us is whether or not we \nwant this country to have a national passenger rail system. If we want \na national system, we must give Amtrak a secure capital funding source. \nThis provision is the first step in creating such a fund.\n   Mr. President, all major modes of transportation have a dedicated \nsource of capital funding, except for intercity passenger rail. Amtrak \nneeds a similar capital funding source to bring it's equipment, \nfacilities and tracks into a state of good repair. Much of Amtrak's \nequipment and infrastructure has exceeded its projected useful life. \nThe costs of maintaining this aging fleet and the need to modernize and \noverhaul facilities through capital improvements to the system are \nserious financial challenges for Amtrak. This provision is the first \nstep in helping to reverse these problems and give Amtrak the resources \nnecessary to meet its capital investment needs.\n  Mr. President, GAO, Amtrak, and the National Commission on Intermodal \nTransportation have called for a secure source of capital funding for \nAmtrak. I believe that now is the time for this Congress to reverse our \ncurrent policy that favors building more highways at the expense of \nalternative means of transportation such as intercity passenger rail. \nDespite rail's proven safety, efficiency, and reliability in Europe, \nJapan, and elsewhere, intercity passenger rail remains severely \nunderfunded in the United States. In fact, over half of the Department \nof Transportation's spending authority is devoted to highways and \nanother quarter to aviation; rail still ranks last with roughly 3 \npercent of total spending authority.\n  Last year we spent $20 billion for highways while capital investment \nfor Amtrak was less than $450 million. In relative terms, between \nfiscal year 1980 and fiscal year 1994, transportation outlays for \nhighways increased 73 percent, aviation increased 170 percent, and \ntransportation outlays for rail went down by 62 percent. In terms of \ngrowth, between 1982 and 1992 highway spending grew by 5 percent, \naviation by 10 percent, while rail decreased by 9 percent.\n  A problem that is going to increase is the congestion on our roads. \nBetween 1983 and 1990, vehicle miles traveled increased nationwide by \n41 percent. If current trends continue, delays due to congestion will \nincrease by more than 400 percent on our highways and by more than \n1,000 percent on urban roads. Highway congestion costs the United \nStates $100 billion annually, and this figure does not include the \neconomic and societal costs of increased pollution and wasted energy \nresources.\n  Air travel is equally congested. Commercial airlines in the United \nStates presently transport over 450 million passengers each year. A \nrecent transportation safety board study revealed that 21 of the 26 \nmajor airports experienced serious delays and it is projected to get \nworse. Again, the costs are enormous. A 1990 DOT study estimated the \nfinancial cost of air congestion at $5 billion each year, and it \nexpects this number to reach $8 billion by 2000.\n  Congestion is a problem and it must be addressed. However, the \ncurrent path we are on directs more money for highways and airports. \nFor us in the Northeast, building more roads is simply not an option. \nWe do not have the land nor the financial resources to build more \nhighways or more airports. For these reasons, we must provide more than \njust good roads but a good passenger rail system as well.\n  Adequately funded passenger rail can successfully address highway \ngridlock and ease airport congestion. Passenger rail ridership between \nNew York and Washington is equal to 7,500 fully booked 757's or 10,000 \nDC-9's. Between New York and Washington, Amtrak has over 40 percent of \nthe air-rail market.\n  Improved Northeast rail service will also have the same positive \nimpact on road congestion. The 5.9 billion passenger miles were taken \non Amtrak in 1994. These are trips that were not taken on crowded \nhighways and airways. Improved rail service in the Northeast is \nprojected to eliminate over 300,000 auto trips each year from highways \nas well as reduce auto congestion around the airports.\n  Improved rail service will also have a positive effect on rural \nareas. Twenty-two million of Amtrak's 55 million passengers depend on \nAmtrak for travel between urban centers and rural locations which have \nno alternative modes of transportation.\n  Mr. President, now is the time to invest in our rail system.\n  Opponents of this language say that we should stop subsidizing \nAmtrak. Amtrak needs to be self-sufficient.\n  I would like to see that happen, but to date, I am not aware of any \ntransportation system that supports itself without Federal assistance. \nFurther, I am not aware of any transportation system that supports \nitself through user fees. According to the Department of \nTransportation, in fiscal year 1994 nearly $6 billion more was spent on \nhighways than was collected in user fees.\n  In fiscal year 1995 nearly $8 billion more was spent on highways than \nwas collected in taxes. Transit which is exempted from the motor fuels \ntax, received $3 billion in revenues in motor fuels revenues last year. \nI repeat, no mode is self-financed.\n  If we want a national passenger rail system, we must fund it \nproperly. This provision is an important step to give Amtrak the \ncapital funds it needs to survive.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I have made the decision to vote in \nfavor of the budget resolution before us to achieve a balanced budget \nand invest in key priorities for the country. This is not a vote to \nclaim that this budget plan is perfect or a replica of the specific way \nI would best like to see the budget balanced and my own State's needs \naddressed. However, as a result of President Clinton working with \nCongress to reach this agreement, this plan represents a responsible \ncourse for completing the job of deficit reduction and launching \nessential steps for our future.\n  This budget plan is also a victory against the dangerous and reckless \nefforts we have seen over the past 2 years in the name of balancing the \nbudget, reforming Medicare, and other attractive but misleading labels. \nI am extremely proud and now relieved that some of us succeeded in \ndefeating the extreme cuts proposed in the budget plans offered by \nRepublicans that would have done such grave damage to Medicare, \neducation, infrastructure, and other priorities. The Republican plans \nliterally raided Medicare to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy, and \nwould have put crushing burdens on working families and our communities \nthat were totally unnecessary and wrong.\n  This budget plan now before us is possible because of the tough \nchoices and hard work done by President Clinton, with the sole help of \nDemocrats and not a single Republican vote, in 1993 to enact a historic \npackage of deficit reduction and economic growth\n\n[[Page S4998]]\n\nmeasures. Instead of the horrors predicted by opponents, that 1993 \nbudget and economic plan cut the deficit from $290 billion to $67 \nbillion. Over the past 4 years, we have watched the economy grow \nsteadily, interest rates come down and stabilize, inflation remain low, \nand unemployment reach record lows.\n  Some of the critics of the bipartisan budget agreement before us now \nseem to be upset because this plan doesn't hurt enough. Since when is \npain or sacrifice the goal of a Federal budget? The goals should be \nfairness, balance, priority-setting, and investment as we hammer out a \nbudget that also adheres to fiscal discipline. And the reason we can \nnow proceed to finish the job of balancing the budget is because some \nof us have been hard at work over the past years to limit spending, set \npriorities, and make the real choices.\n  This budget agreement is a plan with the necessary spending cuts and \nreform to balance the budget, with investments in urgent needs that \nAmericans want us to address. This means accepting tradeoffs and \nlimits. In fact, I have been obligated to vote against certain \namendments in the past few days to increase spending in areas that I \nhave a strong commitment to, from childrens programs to highway \nspending. But in order for this agreement to go forward, and enable us \nto fill in the details and even work out revisions, I feel a \nresponsibility to help the bipartisan leadership maintain the fabric of \nthis agreement.\n  Mr. President, I am especially pleased that this agreement includes \n$16 billion for expanding health care coverage for children. My hope is \nthat this will translate directly into enacting the legislation \nintroduced by Senator Chafee and myself, with broad, bipartisan \nsupport, to use the Medicaid Program to insure up to 5 million children \nwith the most urgent needs. Our approach would build on a foundation \nthat serves children and families well, in a cost-effective and \ntargeted manner.\n\n  As the former chairman of the National Commission on Children, I view \nthis budget agreement as the bipartisan commitment needed to fulfill \nother parts of the agenda we recommended to make children a higher \npriority in deeds, not just rhetoric, in America. With the education \ntax cuts promised for families, a children's tax credit, and more \ninvestment in early childhood and education, along with the childrens \nhealth care initiative promised, we can make sure this country prepares \nmore of the next generation to be ready for the incredible challenges \nahead of us.\n  Mr. President, while I generally support the provisions of the \nbalanced budget resolution, I want to make a special point of the fact \nthat I take strong exception to the proposed funding for veterans. It \nis my view that veterans, who have sacrificed for this country, are \ncarrying a disproportionate share of the burden to balance the Federal \nbudget.\n  As the ranking member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, this \npart of the budget is the area that I have a special responsibility to \nreview in great detail. In addition, it affects West Virginians in \ncountless ways. It is a sad statement that spending for veterans was \nnot included in the list of protected programs by the President or \ncongressional leadership. The result is that veterans benefits and \nservices have been cut. In fiscal year 1998, discretionary veterans \nprograms covering medical care, construction, and general \nadministrative expenses will be decreased by $132 million in fiscal \nyear 1998. To me, this represents a serious cut in veterans programs. \nVeterans groups and their advocates have agreed over the years to pull \ntheir weight in a concerted effort to balance the budget. However, this \nagreement does not reflect a sense of fairness. Aside from the deep \ncuts in Medicare and Medicaid and receipts from spectrum sales, \nveterans face the largest cuts in programs, and this is unacceptable.\n  The budget resolution effectively flatlines the Department of \nVeterans Affairs' [VA] medical care appropriation to $16.959 billion \nover the next 5 years, and in an attempt to supplement this funding \nshortfall, builds in a new revenue stream.\n  For the first time, VA will retain all third-party payments collected \nfrom insurance companies, and the budget agreement assumes that these \nfees will be available to support discretionary spending for VA medical \ncare. In policy, I have always supported retention of these so-called \nMedical Care Cost Recovery [MCCR] collections on the basis that these \ncollections would enhance medical services for veterans. Unfortunately, \neven with these new funds--$604 million in fiscal year 1998--the \nresulting level of funding would not be sufficient to support current \nservices in fiscal year 1998. Projected outyear medical care spending \nwould rise by less than one-half of one percent, while at the same \ntime, the number of unique patients VA treats is projected to rise at \nan average annual rate of over 3.5 percent. If this same growth rate \nwere applied to Medicare, America's seniors would rightly be marching \non the Capitol.\n  Mr. President, I want my colleagues to know that when we speak of the \nfunding level for VA medical care, we are really talking about such \nconcerns as the long-term care needs of our World War II and Korean war \nveterans, the health care needs of ailing Vietnam and Persian Gulf war \nveterans, specialized services provided to veterans who are \ncatastrophically disabled, and basic health and preventive care \nservices provided to all our veterans.\n  Under the budget agreement, veterans seeking medical care from the VA \nwould be dependent upon uncertain funding, including a base \nappropriation which is $54 million less than the previous year; an \nuntested plan to secure funding from insurance companies; and another \ncontroversial proposal, Medicare reimbursement, which will require \ncongressional approval. I believe that the Government can be fiscally \nresponsible and reduce the Federal deficit and debt, and still fulfill \nour commitment to our Nation's veterans. Asking veterans to rely upon \ntenuous funding mechanisms for their medical care does not meet this \nbasic criteria.\n  This proposed level of funding will also be particularly troublesome \nin those areas of the country which are losing VA health care funding \nas part of VA's new resource allocation model. Those facilities which \nare already slated to lose resources, including the Clarksburg VA \nMedical Center in my home State, will be hit even harder by the low \nlevel of fiscal year 1998 funding.\n  Mr. President, some have viewed this budget agreement as a victory \nfor veterans. This is simply a misunderstanding of the facts. Veterans \ngroups know and understand that a frozen appropriation coupled with \ncuts in other programs will translate into a reduction of services and \nbenefits, and I understand that they will be opposing the resolution. I \nwill be working throughout the appropriations process to assure that \nthese cuts are diminished. In sum, the appropriators will have to do \nbetter if we are to honor our commitment to veterans.\n  Before concluding, I also warn my colleagues who are such strong \nproponents of capital gains and estate tax relief that these \nrequirements are going to be subject to intense scrutiny by Americans \nwho have every right to ask some tough questions. When working families \nstruggle as hard as they do to make ends meet and give their children \nopportunities to succeed, they want to see a Federal budget with \npriorities that make sense.\n  Every year, when faced with the budget process and debate, I have to \nweigh the various principles and goals that guide me in all of my work \nas the Senator of West Virginia. I have fought certain plans and \nproposals strenuously, because of their tilted and unfair approaches. \nIn the case of the budget agreement before us, I believe it is an \neffort that should go forward. It is a work-in-progress, and I will be \nworking hard to improve it. But at the same time, it captures the basic \ngoals that the people of West Virginia and the country are asking us to \npursue. We need to complete the job of balancing the budget. We also \nneed to take new steps to address the opportunities and needs of \nAmericans, in education, health care, research, and other key areas. \nWith a bipartisan budget agreement resolved to pursue these goals, I \nwill vote to get the job underway.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this is a notable occasion.\n  We are adopting a bipartisan budget plan, an uncommon event, made \neven more exceptional because that plan outlines a path toward \nachieving balance in the unified budget.\n\n[[Page S4999]]\n\n  As others have noted, this budget resolution is not perfect.\n  No one of us would have proposed precisely the same combination of \nprovisions we have in this resolution, that is the nature of political \ncompromise.\n  The result, however, is a package of provisions that does provide the \nopportunity to reach balance.\n  Mr. President, balancing our budget has been my highest priority as a \nMember of this body.\n  I ran on that issue in 1992, and I am pleased that we will enact a \nbudget outline that puts us on track to achieve that goal.\n  Mr. President, it is important to note that this agreement would not \nhave been possible without the President's deficit reduction package \nenacted in 1993.\n  Some now estimate that package achieved approximately $2 trillion in \ndeficit reduction between 1993 and 2002.\n  By contrast, the deficit reduction achieved in this year's budget \noutline is much smaller, but it is still an important accomplishment.\n  Mr. President, I think it also needs to be said this important \naccomplishment was achieved without amending our Constitution.\n  Indeed, I am convinced that the lack of a constitutional amendment \npushed both sides to get the job done right now.\n  No one was able to say to their constituents: ``Well, we passed a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget, now it's up to State \nlegislatures.''\n  Mr. President, we still have a ways to go.\n  This budget resolution is only the beginning; we still have to enact \nthe necessary spending cuts to reach balance.\n  More importantly, our longer-term budget prospects need much more \nserious work.\n  In fact, my biggest concern is that the agreement leaves enough room \nfor either or both sides to push tax or spending policies that worsen \nour longer-term budget prospects.\n  I am particularly concerned that while the tax cut agreement may look \nsustainable in the budget resolution, it may become entirely \nunsustainable in the long-run, and only aggravate the serious budget \nproblems we know we will face with the retirement of the baby boomers.\n  We all must continue the bipartisan commitment reflected by this \nbudget agreement to ensure the resulting tax and spending legislation \ndoes not undermine either the immediate goal of that agreement--\nbalancing the unified budget--nor our ability to take the next critical \nsteps--enacting necessary entitlement reform, balancing the budget \nwithout relying on the Social Security trust funds, and beginning to \nreduce our national debt.\n  Mr. President, while many can be congratulated for the work done to \nproduce this budget, I want to note especially the work done by our \nBudget Committee Chairman, the senior Senator from New Mexico [Mr. \nDomenici] and our ranking member, the senior Senator from New Jersey \n[Mr. Lautenberg].\n  I joined the Budget Committee this past January, and this is my first \nexperience as a member in working on a budget resolution.\n  To say the least, Mr. President, it has been a remarkable first \nexperience.\n  We all realize that reaching this kind of settlement is not simply a \nmatter of finding policies on which there is agreement.\n  The character and good will of the negotiators makes an enormous \ndifference, and both sides of the aisle were well represented in this \nregard.\n  Mr. President, understandably, we often find ourselves focusing on \nthe developing details of the agreement as the negotiations proceeded, \nand we all have specific matters to which we pay special attention.\n  All of that is appropriate.\n  But we often lose sight of the big picture, and the big picture here \nis that this budget resolution gives us the opportunity to actually \nachieve balance in the unified budget by 2002.\n  That is an historic achievement, and a great deal of the credit for \nthat achievement should go to our chairman and ranking member.\n  I am proud to serve with them, and delighted to be a member of the \ncommittee they oversee.\n  I look forward to working with them next year on a budget resolution \nthat takes the next important steps: enacting necessary entitlement \nreforms, achieving true balance without using the Social Security trust \nfunds, and reducing the national debt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/22/senate-section/article/S4994-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

The congressional participation in the OECD shipbuilding \nagreement continues in the 105th Congress. On April 22, 1997, Senator \nBreaux introduced S. 629, the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement Act. On April \n30, 1997, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, chaired by Senator McCain, held a hearing on trade \nmatters which included the OECD shipbuilding agreement. On June 5 that \nhearing will be continued with the focus on this particular maritime \ntrade policy.\n  I must say that S. 629 represents the administration's attempt to \nreconcile their earlier legislative proposal made in the 104th Congress \nwith the successful amendment made by the House of Representatives to \nthat bill. Let me be clear, while the current bill does not address all \nof the concerns voiced by America's largest shipbuilders, it is a \npositive step in the right direction. My colleagues must not ignore it.\n  It also begins to deal with issues I raised in my two colloquies in \nthe Senate with Senator Snowe.\n  I intend to work with Senator Breaux to amend S. 629 so that all \nappropriate maritime solutions are incorporated. At a recent maritime \nfunction, I challenged the audience to examine the new language and to \noffer constructive improvements. Our Nation has international maritime \nresponsibilities and we must respond to the challenge.\n  I believe that with the introduction of S. 629, the administration \nhas made an honest attempt to address the majority of the concerns.\n  I plan on working with my colleagues in both the Senate and the House \nof Representatives to ensure that acceptable ratification and \nimplementation legislation for the OECD shipbuilding agreement is \npassed by this Congress.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the majority leader for his efforts to address \nthe concerns of all U.S. shipbuilders while achieving proper \nratification and implementation of this important international \nagreement.\n  Mr. LOTT. A primary thrust of the amendment in the 104th Congress by \nthe House of Representatives was to clarify that the agreement shall \nnot affect in any way the Jones Act and other laws related to our \nessential coastwise trade. My colleagues know my position on the Jones \nAct--I support it unequivocally. I believe the language in S. 629 also \nsupports the Jones Act by requiring the withdrawal of the United States \nfrom the agreement if it interferes with our coastwise trade laws. \nHowever, I am continuing to work with Senator Breaux to further \nstrengthen this provision.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I agree with the majority leader. This legislation \nrepresents a strong reaffirmation to the world of the United States \nsteadfast support for the Jones Act.\n  Furthermore, the House of Representatives amended H.R. 2754 to \nclearly preserve the authority of the Secretary of Defense to define, \nfor the purposes of exclusion from coverage under the agreement, the \nterms ``military vessel'', ``military reserve vessel'', and ``essential \nsecurity interest''. While the administration and the Office of the \nUSTR attempted to define ``military reserve vessel'' by including a \ndescription of current military reserve vessel programs, some have \nexpressed concerns that this approach might in the future limit the \nflexibility of the Secretary of Defense to implement additional \nprograms, such as the National Defense Features Program. I am working \nwith Senator Lott to redraft this provision in a way that will not \nlimit United States national security options.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Acknowledging the valid concerns raised by Representative\n\n[[Page S5000]]\n\nBateman is appreciated. I believe together we can find the right \ndefinition to ensure our national security is protected. No one wants \nto jeopardize our military capabilities.\n  S. 629 would also grant the United States a 2-year extension for the \ntitle XI shipbuilding loan guarantee program to continue under its \ncurrent terms and conditions. This too is a move toward equitable \nimplementing language. However, other signatories, including Belgium, \nPortugal, Spain, and South Korea, were provided special arrangements, \nexemptions, and transition programs under the Agreement.\n  When the House of Representatives amended H.R. 2754 in the last \nCongress, it provided a 3-year transition period for the title XI \nprogram. This is an essential component for a fair agreement and I \nintend to work with Senator Breaux to restore the full 3-year \ntransition period as provided in last year's House bill.\n  Mr. BREAUX. H.R. 2754, as amended by the House of Representatives, \nwould have required that third country anti-dumping cases taken by the \nOffice of the USTR to the third country be adjudicated in a manner \nsimilar to that provided by the agreement. Some were concerned that S. \n629 would require that the injurious pricing action be taken in \naccordance with the laws of that third country, without regard to \nwhether those laws are consistent with the agreement. I intend to work \nwith Senator Lott to ensure that such third country proceedings are \nconsistent with the injurious pricing actions of the agreement.\n  Mr. LOTT. Many of our American shipbuilders also expressed their \nconcern to me that several countries with a significant shipbuilding \nindustrial presence are not signatories to the agreement. This reduces \nthe effectiveness of the agreement. S. 629 includes a provision not \nfound in last year's House bill which would direct our Trade \nRepresentative to seek the prompt accession to the agreement by these \nother countries. This is one step in the right direction. Another step \nis that S. 629 also would direct our Trade Representative to use the \nmechanisms already available under existing U.S. trade laws to redress \nefforts by non-signatories to undermine the agreement.\n  Additionally, I expect our Trade Representative to vigorously protest \nthe recent approval of approximately $2.1 billion in restructuring aid \nto shipyards in Germany, Spain, and Greece. I'm sure that all will \nagree that the agreement has no chance of holding together if any \nsignatories work around its provisions in order to continue unfairly \nsubsidizing their shipyards.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I would also like to note that S. 629 includes another \nimportant provision not found in H.R. 2754, as amended by the House of \nRepresentatives. S. 629 provides for U.S. shipyards to continue to \nreceive 25-year title XI financing when competing in bids against \nsubsidized non-signatory shipyards.\n  I want to once again thank the majority leader for his efforts to \nresolve the differences within the U.S. shipbuilding industry over the \nagreement and to find an appropriate solution that benefits the entire \nU.S. maritime industry.\n  Mr. LOTT. I anticipate a swift resolution of the jurisdictional \nissue. The Senate should focus on the successful enactment of a \ncorrected version of S. 629.\n  I look forward to working with the other members of the Senate \nCommerce and Finance Committees to develop fair implementing language.\n  I want to personally thank you John for your dedication to America's \nmaritime industry and I look forward to a continued partnership in \nfinding an acceptable consensus for the agreement's implementing \nlanguage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/22/senate-section/article/S4999-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to amend title III of the Public Health Service Act to \ninclude each year of fellowship training in geriatric medicine or \ngeriatric psychiatry as a year of obligated service under the National \nHealth Corps Loan Repayment Program; to the Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources.\n\n\n             THE GERIATRICIANS LOAN FORGIVENESS ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. REID. Good morning Mr. President. I come to the floor today to \noffer two bills which are written to address the national shortage of \ngeriatricians we are experiencing in this country. A problem I am sorry \nto say that is getting worse, not better. I am pleased to have as \noriginal cosponsors of my bills Senator Grassley, the distinguished \nChairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging and Senator Glenn, \nalso a member of the Aging Committee, one for whom I have tremendous \nrespect and regard.\n  Our Nation is growing older. Today, life expectancy for women is 79, \nfor men it is 73. While the population of the United States has tripled \nsince 1900, the number of people age 65 or older has increased 11 \ntimes, to more than 33 million Americans. By 2030, this group is \nprojected to double in size to nearly 70 million.\n  Mr. President, I first became concerned about this problem when a \nread a report issued by the Alliance for Aging Research in May of 1996 \nentitled, ``Will you Still Treat Me When I'm 65?'' The report concluded \nthat there are only 6,784 primary-care physicians certified in \ngeriatrics. This number represents less than one percent of the total \nof 684,414 doctors in the United States. The report goes on to state \nthat the United States should have at least 20,000 physicians with \ngeriatric training to provide appropriate care for the current \npopulation, and as many as 36,000 geriatricians by the year 2030 when \nthere will be close to 70 million older Americans.\n  The bills I am introducing today, the Medicare Physician Worforce \nImprovement Act of 1997 and the Geriatricians Loan Forgiveness Act of \n1997, aim--in modest ways and at very modest cost--to encourage an \nincrease in the number of trained doctors seniors of today and tomorrow \nwill need, those with certified training in geriatrics.\n  One provision of the Medicare Physician Workforce Improvement Act of \n1997 will allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to double \nthe payment made to teaching hospitals for geriatric fellows capping \nthe double payment to be provided to a maximum of 400 fellows per year. \nThis is intended to serve as an incentive to teaching hospitals to \npromote and recruit for geriatric fellows.\n  Another provision directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto increase the number of certified geriatricians appropriately trained \nto provide the highest quality care to Medicare beneficiaries in the \nbest and most sensible settings by establishing up to five geriatric \nmedicine training consortia demonstration projects nationwide. In \nshort, allow Medicare to pay for the training of doctors who serve \ngeriatric patients in the settings where this care is so often \ndelivered. Not only in hospitals, but also ambulatory care facilities, \nskilled nursing facilities, clinics, and day treatment centers.\n\n  The second bill I am offering today, The Geriatricians Loan \nForgiveness Act of 1997 has but one simple provision. That is to \nforgive $20,000 of education debt incurred by medical students for each \nyear of advanced training required to obtain a certificate of added \nqualifications in geriatric medicine or psychiatry. My bill would count \ntheir fellowship time as obligated service under the National Health \nCorps Loan Repayment Program.\n  Mr. President, the graduating medical school class of physicians in \n1996 reported they had incurred debts of $75,000 on average. My bill \nwill offer an incentive to physicians to pursue advanced training in \ngeriatrics by forgiving a small portion of their debt.\n  Last year Medicare paid out more than $6.5 billion to teaching \nhospitals and academic medical centers toward the costs of clinical \ntraining and experience needed by physicians after they graduate from \nmedical school. It is ironic, only a tiny fraction of those Medicare \ndollars are directed to the training of physicians who focus mainly on \nthe needs of the elderly. Of over 100,000 residency and fellowship \npositions that Medicare supports nationwide, only about 250 are in \ngeriatric medicine and psychiatry programs. Existing slots in geriatric \ntraining programs oftentimes go unfilled. With 518 slots available in \ngeriatric medicine and psychiatry in 1996, only 261, barely one-half of \nthem were filled.\n  By allowing doctors who pursue certification in geriatric medicine to \nbecome eligible for loan forgiveness, and by offering an incentive to \nteaching institutions to promote the availability of fellowships, and \nrecruit geriatric fellows, my bills will provide a measure of incentive \nfor top-notch physicians to pursue fellowship training in this vital \narea.\n  We must do more to ensure quality medicine today for our seniors and \nit is certainly in our best interest to prepare for the future when the \nnumber of seniors will double. Geriatric medicine requires special and \nfocused training. Too often, problems in older persons are \nmisdiagnosed, overlooked, or dismissed as the normal result of aging \nbecause doctors are not trained to recognize how diseases and \nimpairments might appear differently in the elderly than in younger \npatients. One need only look at undiagnosed clinical depression in \nseniors or the consequences of adverse reaction to medicines to see how \nvital this specialized training really is. This lack of knowledge comes \nwith a cost, in lives lost, and in unnecessary hospitalizations and \ntreatments.\n  We need trained geriatricians to train new medical students. Of the \n108 medical schools reporting for the 1994 to 1995 academic year, only \n11 had a separate required course in geriatrics, 53 offered geriatrics \nas an elective, 96 included geriatrics as part of another required \ncourse and one reported not offering geriatrics coursework at all. Mr. \nPresident, this is simply not good enough.\n\n  In a country where by 2030, 1 in 5 citizens will be over the age of \n65, there are only two departments of geriatrics at academic medical \ncenters across the entire country. Yet, every academic medical center \nhas a Department of Pediatrics. This just does not seem to make sense \nto me. While certainly no\n\n[[Page S5003]]\n\none would argue the need for emphasis on pediatrics, there is no less \nof a need for emphasis on geriatrics as well. In England, it is my \nunderstanding that every academic medical center has a department of \ngeriatrics. Do our friends in England know something we do not?\n  Mr. President, we have here a perfect case where an ounce of \nprevention will be worth a pound of cure. While not every patient over \n65 will need a geriatrician, in fact most will not, we need \nacademicians and researchers to train the medical community about the \nfield of geriatrics and we need primary care physicians to have access \nto trained geriatricians when a patient's case warrants it. As our \noldest old population increases, the population growing the fastest and \nmost appropriate for geriatric intervention, we must ensure that access \nto geriatricians becomes a reality.\n  I believe the Medicare Physician Workforce Act of 1997 and the \nGeriatricians Loan Forgiveness Act of 1997 are steps in the right \ndirection. While they will not solve the total problem, they do make a \ncritical first step.\n  Mr. President, I am grateful to the American Geriatrics Society for \ntheir assistance in working with my staff on this bill and I especially \nwant to thank my cosponsors, Senators Grassley and Glenn, for their \nsupport and leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                              The American Geriatrics Society,\n\n                                       New York, NY, May 20, 1997.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: On behalf of the American Geriatrics \n     Society (AGS), I am writing to offer our strongest support to \n     the ``Medicare Physician Workforce Improvement Act of 1997'' \n     and the ``Geriatricians Loan Forgiveness Act of 1997.''\n       With more than 6500 physician and other health care \n     professional members, the AGS is dedicated to improving the \n     health and well being of all older adults. While we provide \n     primary care and supportive services to all patients, the \n     focus of geriatric practice is on the frailest and most \n     vulnerable elderly. The average age of a geriatrician's \n     caseload exceeds 80, and our patients often have multiple \n     chronic illnesses. Given the complexity of medical and social \n     needs among our country's oldest citizens, we are strongly \n     committed to a multi-disciplinary approach to providing \n     compassionate and effective care to our patients.\n       As you know, America faces a critical shortage of \n     physicians with special training in geriatrics. Even as the \n     76 million persons of the baby boom generation reach \n     retirement age over the next 15 to 20 years, the number of \n     certified geriatricians is declining. By providing modest \n     incentives--which will encourage teaching hospitals to \n     increase the number of training fellowships in geriatric \n     medicine and psychiatry, provide loan assistance to \n     physicians who pursue such training, and support development \n     of innovative and flexible models for training in \n     geriatrics--your bills represent very positive steps toward \n     reversing that trend.\n       The American Geriatrics Society has been pleased to work \n     closely with your office to develop initiatives to preserve \n     and improve the availability of highest quality medical care \n     for our oldest and most vulnerable citizens. We believe that \n     the ``Medicare Physician Workforce Improvement Act'' and the \n     ``Geriatricians Loan Forgiveness Act'' represent a cost-\n     effective approach to training the physicians our nation \n     increasingly will need. We commend you for your leadership on \n     an issue of such vital importance to the Medicare program and \n     our elderly citizens.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Dennis Jahnigen, MD,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                  Alliance for Aging Research,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 16, 1997.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: As the Executive Director for the \n     Alliance for Aging Research, an independent, not-for-profit \n     organization working to improve the health and independence \n     of older Americans, I am writing in support of the ``Medicare \n     Physician Workforce Improvement Act'' and the ``Geriatricians \n     Loan Forgiveness Act.''\n       As you know, on May 14, 1996 the Alliance released a \n     report, ``Will You Still Treat Me When I'm 65?'', addressing \n     the national shortage of geriatricians. Currently, there are \n     only 6,784 primary-care physicians certified in geriatrics, \n     the area of medicine that addresses the complex needs of \n     older patients. That is less than one percent of the total of \n     684,414 doctors in the U.S. We currently need 20,000 \n     geriatricians and a total of 36,858 by the year 2030 to care \n     for the graying baby boomers. These two pieces of legislation \n     take the important first steps in solving this problem.\n       In addition to increasing the number of physicians trained \n     in geriatrics, we need to develop a strong cadre of academics \n     and researchers within our medical schools to help mainstream \n     geriatrics into both general practice and specialties. \n     Increasing the number of fellowship positions in geriatric \n     medicine will improve the situation.\n       We must have this kind of support and commitment from the \n     federal government, along with private philanthropy and \n     business if we are to sufficiently care for our aging \n     population. The Alliance for Aging Research is encouraged by \n     your leadership and support in this area and we look forward \n     to working with you to bring these issues before Congress.\n           Best regards,\n                                                     Daniel Perry,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original \ncosponsor of two very important bills being offered by my colleague on \nthe Senate Special Committee on Aging, Senator Harry Reid. The \nlegislation we are introducing today will encourage more of our \nnation's physicians to specialize in geriatric medicine. As our \npopulation continues to age and with the impending retirement of the \nbaby boomers, the need for trained geriatricians will be great. In my \nhome State of Iowa, 15 percent of the population is over 65 with the \nthird largest percentage of elderly in the Nation.\n  The incentives for residents to choose geriatrics as a specialty are \nlimited. The financial rewards are fewer than most other specialties. \nIn addition, patients require more time and attention because they \ntypically have a multitude of health problems. With the cost of \neducation so high, many residents face enormous debt when they complete \nmedical school. Institutions have trouble attracting students to \nspecialize in geriatric medicine due to the lack of financial \nincentives.\n  The Geriatricians Loan Forgiveness Act of 1997 will provide help to \nresidents. This bill gives the Secretary of the Department of Health \nand Human Services [DHHS] the authority to forgive up to $20,000 of \nloans under the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program on \nbehalf of a resident who completes the required 1 year fellowship to \nbecome a geriatrician. The maximum amount of residents eligible is 400.\n  The other bill I am cosponsoring today is the Medicare Physician \nWorkforce Improvement Act of 1997. We spent nearly $7 billion last year \non graduate medical education under the Medicare Program. Yet, only 200 \nof the over 100,000 residency and fellowship positions funded by \nMedicare are in geriatric medicine. This does not make sense. Medicare \nis a program for seniors. Therefore, we should be supporting physicians \nwho specialize in geriatrics.\n  The Medicare Physician Workforce Improvement Act has two provisions \nto encourage academic medical centers to train physicians in geriatrics \nunder the Medicare graduate medical education [GME] program. The first \nprovision provides for an adjustment in a hospital's count of primary \ncare residents to allow each resident enrolled in an approved medical \nresidency or fellowship program in geriatric medicine to be counted as \ntwo full-time equivalent primary care residents for the 1-year period \nnecessary to be certified in geriatric medicine. A limit is placed on \nthe number of residents enrolled each year to control the cost. No more \nthan 400 fellows nationwide can be eligible in any given year. This \nprovision will encourage institutions to train more geriatricians using \nMedicare funds.\n  The second provision is budget neutral. It directs the Secretary of \nDHHS to establish five geriatric medicine training consortium \ndemonstration projects nationwide. The demonstration will allow current \nMedicare GME funds to be distributed to a consortium consisting of a \nteaching hospital, one or more skilled nursing facilities, and one or \nmore ambulatory care or community-based facilities to train residents \nin geriatrics. This provision could be beneficial to rural areas and \nother areas not served by an academic medical center.\n  I applaud Senator Reid for his efforts to provide our Nation's \nelderly with qualified trained geriatricians. I ask my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to join Senator Reid and me in support of these \nlegislative initiatives.\n\n[[Page S5004]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Enzi, Mr. \n        Cochran, Mr. Helms and Mr. Kempthorne):\n  S. 781. A bill to establish a uniform and more efficient Federal \nprocess for protecting property owners' rights guaranteed by the fifth \namendment; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                    THE OMNIBUS PROPERTY RIGHTS ACT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased today to once again introduce \nthe Omnibus Property Rights Act. Many Members of the Senate have as a \nparamount concern the protection of individual rights protected by our \nConstitution.\n  One particular right--the right to own and use private property free \nfrom arbitrary governmental action--is increasingly under attack from \nthe regulatory state. Indeed, despite the constitutional requirement \nfor the protection of property rights, the America of the late 20th \ncentury has witnessed an explosion of Federal regulation that has \njeopardized the private ownership of property with the consequent loss \nof individual liberty.\n  Under current Federal regulations, thousands of Americans have been \ndenied the right to the quiet use and enjoyment of their private \nproperty. Arbitrary bureaucratic enforcement of Federal and State \nregulatory programs has prevented Americans from building homes and \ncommercial buildings, plowing fields, repairing barns and fences, \nclearing brush and fire hazards, felling trees, and even removing \nrefuse and pollutants, all on private property.\n  Fairness and simple justice demand that Americans owning property be \nentitled to the full use of their property. Ensuring compensation for \nregulatory takings is the first step toward restoring the fundamental \nright to own and use private property guaranteed by the takings clause \nof the fifth amendment to our Constitution. That is why I am once again \nintroducing legislation--the Omnibus Property Rights Act--to protect \nprivate property owners from overzealous regulators. This bill, similar \nin substance and procedure to the bills I introduced last Congress, \nrepresents the most comprehensive legislative mechanism to date to \nfoster and protect the private ownership of property.\n  The omnibus bill contains three different approaches contained in \ndifferent titles.\n  The first substantive title of the bill encompasses property rights \nlitigation reform. This title establishes a distinct Federal fifth \namendment ``takings'' claim against Federal agencies by aggrieved \nproperty owners, thus clarifying the sometimes incoherent and \ncontradictory constitutional property rights case law. Property \nprotected under this section includes real property, including fixtures \non land, such as crops and timber, mining interests, and water rights. \nThis title is triggered when a taking, as defined by the Supreme Court, \noccurs. Moreover, it allows for compensation when the property, or \n``affected portion'' of property, is reduced in value by 33 percent or \nmore.\n  It has been alleged that this bill would impede government's ability \nto protect public health, safety, and the environment. This is not \ntrue. This first title contains a ``nuisance exception'' to \ncompensation. It codifies that part of the 1992 Supreme Court decision \nin Lucas versus South Carolina Coastal Council, which held that \nrestrictions on property use based on ``background principles of the \nstate's law of property and nuisance'' need not be compensated. Thus, \nby adopting the Supreme Court's recent Lucas holding, the Omnibus \nProperty Rights Act provides that only innocent property holders are to \nbe compensated for government takings. Those that demonstrably misuse \ntheir property to pollute or to harm public health and safety are not \nentitled to compensation under the bill's nuisance provision.\n\n  Finally, this title also resolves the jurisdictional dispute between \nthe Federal district courts and the Court of Federal Claims over fifth \namendment ``takings'' cases--sometimes called the Tucker Act shuffle--\nby granting each court concurrent jurisdiction.\n  A second title in essence codifies President Reagan's Executive Order \n12630. Under this title, a Federal agency must conduct a private \nproperty taking impact analysis before issuing or promulgating any \npolicy, regulation, or related agency action which is likely to result \nin a taking of private property.\n  A third title provides for alternative dispute resolution in \narbitration proceedings.\n  The three titles of the Omnibus Property Rights Act together function \nto provide the property owner with mechanisms to vindicate the \nfundamental constitutional right of private ownership of property, \nwhile instituting powerful internal incentives for Federal agencies \nboth to protect private property and include such protection in agency \nplanning and regulating.\n  It is very significant that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice, after a year of research, concluded in a study dated March 8, \n1996, that the incentives built into the very similar bills I \nintroduced last Congress would have encouraged agencies to act more \nresponsibly, that the administrative cost of the bill would be quite \nsmall, and that compensation costs would be even smaller.\n  Despite some critics' charges that these very similar bills would be \ntoo costly, CBO found that the costs of both the omnibus bills will \ndiminish to an insignificant level over time. This is predicated on the \nCBO finding that each of the omnibus bills contain powerful incentives, \nwhich over time will reduce costs. These include: First, the bills' \nbright line legal standards, which better enable agencies to avoid \ntakings disputes; second, the takings impact assessment requirement, \nwhich requires agencies to analyze the affect of proposed regulations \non property rights; and third, the requirement that compensation be \npaid from the agency's budget, which inevitably will act as a deterrent \nto unconstitutional and unlawful takings. Based on extensive research, \nCBO estimated that each omnibus bill should cost no more than $30 or \n$40 million a year for the first 5 years of implementation, thereafter \ndiminishing to insignificant amounts. The new bill will cost even less.\n\n\n                     Importance of Private Property\n\n  The private ownership of property is essential to a free society and \nis an integral part of our Judeo-Christian culture and the Western \ntradition of liberty and limited government. Private ownership of \nproperty and the sanctity of property rights reflects the distinction \nin our culture between a preexisting civil society and the state that \nis consequently established to promote order. Private property creates \nthe social and economic organizations that counterbalance the power of \nthe state by providing an alternative source of power and prestige to \nthe state itself. It is therefore a necessary condition of liberty and \nprosperity.\n  While government is properly understood to be instituted to protect \nliberty within an orderly society and such liberty is commonly \nunderstood to include the right of free speech, assembly, religious \nexercise and other rights such as those enumerated in the Bill of \nRights, it is all too often forgotten that the right of private \nownership of property is also a critical component of liberty. To the \n17th century English political philosopher, John Locke, who greatly \ninfluenced the Founders of our Republic, the very role of government is \nto protect property: ``The great and chief end therefore, on Men \nuniting into Commonwealths, and putting themselves under Government, is \nthe preservation of their property.''\n  The Framers of our Constitution likewise viewed the function of \ngovernment as one of fostering individual liberties through the \nprotection of property interests. James Madison, termed the ``Father of \nthe Constitution,'' unhesitantly endorsed this Lockean viewpoint when \nhe wrote in The Federalist No. 54 that ``[government] is instituted no \nless for the protection of property, than of the persons of \nindividuals.'' Indeed, to Madison, the private possession of property \nwas viewed as a natural and individual right both to be protected \nagainst government encroachment and to be protected by government \nagainst others.\n  To be sure, the private ownership of property was not considered \nabsolute. Property owners could not exercise their rights as a nuisance \nthat harmed their neighbors, and government could use, what was termed \nin the 18th century, its despotic power of eminent domain to seize \nproperty for public use. Justice, it became to be believed, required \ncompensation for the property taken by government.\n\n[[Page S5005]]\n\n  The earliest example of a compensation requirement is found in \nchapter 28 of the Magna Carta of 1215, which reads, ``No constable or \nother bailiff of ours shall take corn or other provisions from anyone \nwithout immediately tendering money therefor, unless he can have \npostponement thereof by permission of the seller.'' But the record of \nEnglish and colonial compensation for taken property was spotty at \nbest. It has been argued by some historians and legal scholars that \ncompensation for takings of property became recognized as customary \npractice during the American colonial period.\n  Nevertheless, by the time of American independence, the compensation \nrequirement was considered a necessary restraint on arbitrary \ngovernmental seizures of property. The Vermont Constitution of 1777, \nthe Massachusetts Constitution of 1780, and the Northwest Ordinance of \n1787, recognized that compensation must be paid whenever property was \ntaken for general public use or for public exigencies. And although \naccounts of the 1791 congressional debate over the Bill of Rights \nprovide no evidence over why a public use and just compensation \nrequirement for takings of private property was eventually included in \nthe fifth amendment, James Madison, the author of the fifth amendment, \nreflected the views of other supporters of the new Constitution who \nfeared the example to the new Congress of uncompensated seizures of \nproperty for building of roads and forgiveness of debts by radical \nstate legislatures. Consequently, the phrase ``[n]or shall private \nproperty be taken for public use, without just compensation'' was \nincluded within the fifth amendment to the Constitution.\n\n\n            Current Protection of Property Rights Fall Short\n\n  Judicial protection of property rights against the regulatory state \nhas been both inconsistent and ineffective. Physical invasions and \ngovernment seizures of property have been fairly easy for courts to \nanalyze as a species of eminent domain, but not so for the effect of \nregulations which either diminish the value of the property or \nappropriate a property interest.\n  This key problem to the regulatory takings dilemma was recognized by \nJustice Oliver Wendell Holmes in Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 \nU.S. 393 (1922). How do courts determine when regulation amounts to a \ntaking? Holmes' answer, ``if regulation goes too far it will be \nrecognized as a taking,'' 260 U.S. at 415, is nothing more than an ipse \ndixit. In the 73 years since Mahon, the Court has eschewed any set \nformula for determining how far is too far, preferring to engage in ad \nhoc factual inquiries, such as the three-part test made famous by Penn \nCentral Transportation Co. v. City of New York, 438 U.S. 104 (1978), \nwhich balances the economic impact of the regulation on property and \nthe character of the regulation against specific restrictions on \ninvestment-backed expectations of the property owner.\n  Despite the valiant attempt by the Rehnquist Court to clarify \nregulatory takings analysis in Nollan v. California Coastal Comm'n, 483 \nU.S. 825 (1987), Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 112 S.Ct. \n2886 (1992), and in its recent decision of Dolan v. City of Tigard, No. \n93-518 (June 24, 1994), takings analysis is basically incoherent and \nconfusing and applied by lower courts haphazardly. The incremental, \nfact-specific approach that courts now must employ in the absence of \nadequate statutory language to vindicate property rights under the \nfifth amendment thus has been ineffective and costly.\n  There is, accordingly, a need for Congress to clarify the law by \nproviding bright line standards and an effective remedy. As Chief Judge \nLoren A. Smith of the Court of Federal Claims, the court responsible \nfor administering takings claims against the United States, opined in \nBowles v. United States, 31 Fed. Cl. 37 (1994), ``[j]udicial decisions \nare far less sensitive to societal problems than the law and policy \nmade by the political branches of our great constitutional system. At \nbest courts sketch the outlines of individual rights, they cannot hope \nto fill in the portrait of wise and just social and economic policy.''\n  This incoherence and confusion over the substance of takings claims \nis matched by the muddle over jurisdiction of property rights claims. \nThe Tucker Act, which waives the sovereign immunity of the United \nStates by granting the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction to \nentertain monetary claims against the United States, actually \ncomplicates the ability of a property owner to vindicate the right to \njust compensation for a Government action that has caused a taking. The \nlaw currently forces a property owner to elect between equitable relief \nin the Federal district court and monetary relief in the Court of \nFederal Claims. Further difficulty arises when the law is used by the \nGovernment to urge dismissal in the district court on the ground that \nthe plaintiff should seek just compensation in the Court of Federal \nClaims, and is used to urge dismissal in the Court of Federal Claims on \nthe ground that plaintiff should first seek equitable relief in the \ndistrict court.\n  This Tucker Act shuffle is aggravated by section 1500 of the Tucker \nAct, which denies the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction to entertain \na suit which is pending in another court and brought by the same \nplaintiff. Section 1500 is so poorly drafted and has brought so many \nhardships, that Justice Stevens, in Keene Corporation v. United States, \n113 S.Ct. 2035, 2048 (1993), has called for its repeal or amendment.\n  Title II of the Omnibus Property Rights Act addresses these problems. \nIn terms of clarifying the substance of takings claims, it first \nclearly defines property interests that are subject to the act's \ntakings analysis. In this way a floor definition of property is \nestablished by which the Federal Government may not eviscerate. This \ntitle also establishes the elements of a takings claim by codifying and \nclarifying the holdings of the Nollan, Lucas, and Dolan cases.\n  For instance, Dolan's rough proportionality test is interpreted to \napply to all exaction situations whereby an owner's otherwise lawful \nright to use property is exacted as a condition for granting a Federal \npermit. And a distinction is drawn between a noncompensable mere \ndiminution of value of property as a result of Federal regulation and a \ncompensable partial taking, which is defined as any agency action that \ndiminishes the fair market value of the affected property by 33 percent \nor more. The result of drawing these bright lines will not be the end \nfact-specific litigation, which is endemic to all law suits, but it \nwill ameliorate the ever increasing ad hoc and arbitrary nature of \ntakings claims.\n  Finally, I once again want to respond to any suggestion that may \narise that this act will impede Government's ability to protect the \nenvironment or promote health and safety through regulation. This \nlegislation does not, contrary to the assertions of some, emasculate \nthe Government's ability to prevent individuals or businesses from \npolluting. It is well established that the Constitution only protects a \nright to reasonable use of property. All property owners are subject to \nprior restraints on the use of their property, such as nuisance laws \nwhich prevents owners from using their property in a manner that \ninterferes with others.\n  The Government has always been able to prevent harmful or noxious \nuses of property without being obligated to compensate the property \nowner, as long as the limitations on the use of property inhere in the \ntitle itself. In other words, the restrictions must be based on \nbackground principles of State property and nuisance law already \nextant. The Omnibus Property Rights Act codifies this principle in a \nnuisance exception to the requirement of the Government to pay \ncompensation.\n  Nor does the Omnibus Property Rights Act hinder the Government's \nability to protect public health and safety. The act simply does not \nobstruct the Government from acting to prevent imminent harm to the \npublic safety or health or diminish what would be considered a public \nnuisance. Again, this is made clear in the provision of the act that \nexempts nuisance from compensation. What the act does is force the \nFederal Government to pay compensation to those who are singled out to \npay for regulation that benefits the entire public.\n  In other words, it does not prevent regulation, but fulfills the \npromise of the fifth amendment, which the Supreme Court in Armstrong v. \nUnited States, 364 U.S. 40, 49 (1960), opined is\n\n[[Page S5006]]\n\n``to bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear public \nburdens, which in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the \npublic as a whole.''\n  I hope that all Senators will join me in supporting this long overdue \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 782. A bill to amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization \nAct of 1994 to remove the provision that prevents the recovery of an \namount disbursed as a result of an erroneous decision made by a State, \ncounty, or area committee; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \nand Forestry.\n\n\n              THE USDA'S FINALITY RULE REPEAL ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I introduce legislation to repeal an \noutdated agricultural law that has cost taxpayers millions of dollars \nover the last several years.\n  Historically, as part of its statutory mandate to support farmers' \nincome, the Department of Agriculture made payments to farmers for the \nplanting of certain crops and in cases of natural disaster. In the \nprocess of carrying out this mission, USDA sometimes mistakenly \noverpaid farmers.\n  A provision of the 1990 farm bill, known as the finality rule or the \n90-day rule, allowed farmers to keep these overpayments if they were \nnot discovered within 90 days of the payment or application for farm \nprogram benefits. Repayment is required in cases of fraud or \nmisrepresentation involving the farmer.\n  Whatever its merits in 1990, changes in farm policy and new evidence \nindicate that the finality rule should be repealed. At the time of the \n1990 farm bill, to be eligible for farm program payments, it was \nnecessary for the county or State USDA office to determine that farmers \nwere actively engaged in farming and that their operations were \nstructured properly. Farmers often relied on these determinations \nbefore deciding which crops to plant, the size of the plantings, and \nhow to structure their farming operation for the crop year.\n  However, the landmark reforms in the 1996 farm bill eliminated these \njustifications for the finality rule. Under the 1996 farm bill, farm \npayments are no longer linked to the planting decisions of farmers and \nthe structure of the farming operation is unlikely to change. Today, \npayments are made based on a formula which does not vary from one year \nto the next.\n  The finality rule does not only apply to farm program payments. It \napplies to most types of payments received by farmers including \ndisaster relief assistance. But these disaster payments have been \ndramatically scaled back in recent years. In 1994, Congress passed the \nFederal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture \nReorganization Act which largely eliminated disaster assistance \npayments for most major crops. Instead of disaster aid, farmers were \nencouraged to buy crop insurance.\n  A recent report from the General Accounting Office provides further \nevidence that the finality rule should be repealed. According to GAO, \nfrom November 1990 through September 1996, USDA applied the finality \nrule to 10,694 cases in which the overpayments were not discovered \nwithin the 90-day time-frame. The rule allowed farmers to keep $4.2 \nmillion in overpayments. Nearly 90 percent of the overpayments involved \ncrop disaster initiatives or old-style farm programs which no longer \nexist.\n  GAO also looked closely at finality rule payments in fiscal years \n1995 and 1996. Even though the justification for the finality rule was \nto prevent farmers from having to repay large amounts of money years \nafter the money was paid, GAO found that most of the overpayments \ninvolved small sums and were discovered within 9 months or less. \nAccording to GAO, in the years studied, 86 percent of the finality rule \ncases involved $500 or less. In addition, 59 percent had overpayments \namounting to 10 percent or less of the correct payment amounts, and \ntwo-thirds were discovered within 9 months of the date of payment or \nthe filing of a program application. It should be noted that while most \nof the overpayments were small, a few large overpayments accounted for \nthe bulk of the dollar value of the overpayments. An examination of the \nGAO data indicate that the finality rule, in its application, has not \nserved its original stated purpose.\n  Mr. President, the U.S. Department of Agriculture agrees that the \nfinality rule should be repealed. In those limited number of cases in \nwhich repayment would work a hardship on the farmer, the very cases \nthat finality rule was supposed to assist, USDA has indicated that it \nwould use existing procedures already in place for debt collection in \nhardship cases.\n  In summary, Mr. President, the finality rule was largely designed for \nprograms which have been dramatically altered, it generally does not \nserve the hardship cases for which it was designed, and it can be \nreplaced by other existing procedures designed for hardship cases. The \nDepartment of Agriculture and the General Accounting Office support its \nrepeal. It is time to remove this outdated law from the books. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 782\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reform the United States Housing Act of 1937, \nderegulate the public housing program and the program for rental \nhousing assistance for low-income families, and increase community \ncontrol over such programs, and for other purposes.\n\n\n            THE PUBLIC HOUSING MANAGEMENT REFORM ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on \nBanking, Housing and Urban Affairs, I introduce the Public Housing \nManagement Reform Act of 1997 at the request of the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development, the Honorable Andrew M. \nCuomo.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of Oregon:\n  S. 785. A bill to convey certain land to the city of Grants Pass, OR; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n               THE GRANTS PASS LAND TRANSFER ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I am today introducing \nlegislation to transfer 320 acres of Oregon and California grant lands \ncurrently under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management [BLM] \nto the city of Grants Pass, OR. I am pleased to introduce this \nlegislation because it exemplifies how I believe our government should \nwork. I believe government works best when the local community has an \nopportunity to participate in making decisions important to them.\n  Since 1968, the city of Grants Pass has leased 200 acres of BLM land \nto operate the Merlin Municipal Solid Waste Facility under permit by \nthe Oregon Department of Environmental Quality [DEQ]. The current lease \nends April 14 in the year 2000 and, pursuant to BLM's national policy, \nthe lease will not be renewed. The city of Grants Pass has made an \nincredible commitment of time, manpower, and financial resources over \nseveral years to address and minimize the environmental concerns of the \nMerlin landfill. The long-term management and resolution of these \nenvironmental issues can best be handled by the city of Grants Pass \nthrough ownership of the property.\n  The 120 acres not part of the Merlin landfill are described by BLM as \n``scab lands'' and are not subject to timber harvest. In addition, if \nthe additional 120 acres are retained they would be landlocked or \nwithout access. For these reasons, the BLM recommends that these 120 \nacres be included in the land transfer. The 120 acres and any of the \n200 acres not used for solid waste management will be retained \nexclusively for public use.\n  The reason for this legislation is simple: Existing Federal law \nproviding for the transfer of Federal land either does not cover Oregon \nand California grant lands, presents administrative procedural \nrequirements, or does not provide\n\n[[Page S5007]]\n\nthe United States with the necessary environmental liability \nsafeguards.\n  The Grants Pass land transfer legislation is supported at all levels \nof government--local, State, and Federal. This legislation is a \ncompanion bill to that of my good friend and colleague from the House, \nCongressman Bob Smith, and is being heard today before the House \nSubcommittee on National Parks and Public Lands. I encourage my \ncolleagues to join me in support of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the provisions of the \nbill be inserted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 785\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CONVEYANCE OF BLM LAND TO GRANTS PASS, OREGON.\n\n       (A) Conveyance Required.--Effective on the date the City of \n     Grants Pass, Oregon tenders to the Secretary of the Interior \n     an indemnification agreement and without monetary \n     compensation, all right, title, and interest of the United \n     States in and to the real property described in subsection \n     (b) is conveyed, by operation of law, to the City of Grants \n     Pass, Oregon (in this section referred to as the ``City'').\n       (b) Property Described.--\n       The real property referred to in subsection (a) is that \n     parcel of land depicted on the map entitled ``      '' and \n     dated       , 1997, consisting of--\n       (1) approximately 200 acres of Bureau of Land Management \n     land on which the City has operated a landfill under lease; \n     and\n       (1) approximately 200 acres of Bureau of Land Management \n     land that area adjacent to the land described in subparagraph \n     (1).\n       (c) Consideration.--As consideration for the conveyance \n     under subsection (a), the Secretary shall require the City to \n     agree to indemnify the Government of the United States for \n     all liability of the Government that arises from the \n     property.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY:\n  S. 788. A bill to suspend temporarily the duty on certain materials \nused in the manufacture of skis and snowboards; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                      duty suspension legislation\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I introduce legislation of \nimportance to the economy and quality of life in my home State of \nWashington. The measure I am introducing will help maintain the \ncompetitiveness of an industry that makes vital contributions to our \nState and this Nation.\n  One of my top priorities here in the U.S. Senate is to support \npolicies that promote economic growth for people in Washington State \nand across the country. To me, this means preserving current jobs and \ncreating new jobs in all sectors of our economy.\n  The K2 Corp., located on Vashon Island in Washington State, makes an \nimportant contribution toward achieving this goal. As the last \nremaining major U.S. manufacturer of skis and just one of three major \nsnowboard makers in this country, K2 employs more than 700 people at \nits Vashon Island facility. The products made by K2 represent a \nsubstantial percentage of the American skis and snowboards sold around \nthe world. Maintaining the competitiveness of K2 helps ensure the \nUnited States remains a player in the global ski market.\n  To the extent possible, K2 purchases materials used in the \nmanufacture of skis and snowboards from companies based in Washington \nState and other regions of our country. However, K2 is unable to find a \ndomestic source that meets its requirements for two key raw materials--\nsteel edges and polyethylene base material. As a result, K2 must \npurchase these two commodities abroad and pay customs duties on the \nimported products. This forces K2 to spend more for these materials, \nthus diverting resources that could be used to expand business and \ndevelop new technologies.\n  My legislation seeks to make these resources available to K2 \nsuspending U.S. customs duty on imports of these two raw materials--\nsteel edges and polyethylene base material. It helps ensure K2 and \nAmerica continue to have a role in the international ski industry. \nTogether, these materials comprise a very small portion of all the \nmaterials used to produce skis. However, without the ability to acquire \nthem at a reasonable cost, K2's ability to compete on an international \nscale would be adversely affected.\n  K2 strives to continue as a key player in the increasingly \ncompetitive international ski and snowboard market. This duty \nsuspension legislation will help enable K2 to compete and to continue \nsupporting our Nation's economy. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation, which strengthens the U.S. ski and snowboard industry and \nsupports American jobs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Breaux, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Wyden, \n        Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Kohl and Mr. Chafee):\n  S. 789. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide Medicare beneficiaries with additional information regarding \nMedicare managed care plans and Medicare select policies; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n              MEDICARE BENEFICIARY INFORMATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator \nBreaux, to introduce the Medicare Beneficiary Information Act of 1997. \nMedicare is a Federal program paid for with taxpayer dollars. \nTherefore, Congress has the duty and obligation to ensure beneficiaries \nhave access to necessary information to select an appropriate health \nplan for their individual health care needs.\n  This legislation is based upon many of the recommendations made to \nmembers of the Senate Special Committee on Aging at a hearing we held \non April 10, 1997. This bill will improve competition among Medicare \nhealth plans and provide Medicare beneficiaries with the useful \ninformation they need to make an informed choice when selecting a \nhealth plan. Good, reliable information that allows consumers to select \namong competing options is essential for any market to work. The health \ncare market is no exception. Under Medicare, accurate, widely-available \ncomparative information does not exist. The Medicare Beneficiary \nInformation Act of 1997 addresses this problem by including the \nfollowing provisions:\n  While beneficiaries now have to call all the health plans in their \narea, wait for the marketing materials to come, and then try and \ncompare all the different brochures with no standard terminology \nrequired, this bill instructs the Secretary to develop comparison \ncharts for each Medicare HMO market and for Medicare Select plans. The \nSecretary has discretion to utilize existing mechanisms in place, such \nas regional Health Care Financing Administration [HCFA] offices and \nInsurance Counseling Assistance [ICA's] programs, to develop and \ndistribute these charts.\n  Comparison charts would be distributed by Medicare health plans in \ntheir marketing materials and at the time of enrollment and annually \nthereafter. In addition, the charts would be available upon request \nthrough HCFA. The charts would help beneficiaries understand the \ndifference between the HMO's in their market. The charts would also \ncontain a description of standard fee-for-service Medicare, so \nbeneficiaries have a reference point.\n  The charts will tell beneficiaries about, for example, the health \nplans' additional benefits; additional premiums; out-of-pocket \nexpenses; disenrollment rates, as recommended by the General Accounting \nOffice at the Aging Committee hearing; appeal rates, reversed and \ndenied; coverage for out-of-area services.\n  The bill also requires plans to inform beneficiaries about their \nrights and responsibilities using understandable, standard terminology \nregarding benefits; appeals and grievance procedures; restrictions on \npayments for services not provided by the plan; out-of-area coverage; \ncoverage of emergency services and urgently needed care; coverage of \nout-of-network services; and any other rights the Secretary determines \nto be helpful to beneficiaries.\n  These provisions are also included in the bill I introduced on May 6, \nentitled the ``Medicare Patient Choice and Access Act of 1997,'' or S. \n701. Senator Breaux and I believe that providing Medicare beneficiaries \nwith proper information to select the health plan that best meets their \nindividual health care needs is so important, we decided to introduce \nthis free-standing bill. Increasing choices within the Medicare program \nhas strong bipartisan support, but this approach is meaningless if \nbeneficiaries cannot make an informed choice. Our bill can be enacted \nand implemented quickly. HCFA is already collecting this data and plans \nto start\n\n[[Page S5008]]\n\ndistributing comparative information this summer through the Internet. \nHowever, Internet access is not enough. We need to provide this \ninformation in written form and through Medicare counseling programs as \nwell. Medicare beneficiaries, as research has shown, prefer reviewing \nwritten materials and having someone with which to talk. Our bill would \nenable beneficiaries to obtain a user-friendly chart utilizing existing \nMedicare counseling programs, local Medicare offices and through health \nplans participating in the Medicare program.\n\n  We ask our colleagues on both side of the aisle to join us in \ncosponsoring this important legislation. I ask unanimous consent that a \ncopy of the bill be submitted for the Record. I also ask unanimous \nconsent that a news column by Senator Breaux be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 789\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

In order to assist in the dissemination of the \n     comparative reports, the Secretary may also utilize medicare \n     offices open to the general public, the beneficiary \n     assistance program established under section 4359 of the \n     Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 1395b-\n     3), and the health insurance information counseling and \n     assistance grants under section 4359 of that Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395b-4).\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n       Giving Older Consumers Better Info on Health Care Benefits\n\n               (John Breaux, U.S. Senator for Louisiana)\n\n       The federal government needs to provide older Americans \n     with better information about all their health care options. \n     That was the conclusion of a senate hearing I recently \n     cochaired as the new ranking Democrat on the Senate Special \n     Aging Committee. We called in a number of health care experts \n     to talk about the quality of information provided to millions \n     of Medicare beneficiaries, including nearly 600,000 in \n     Louisiana.\n       Many who testified said that right now Medicare \n     beneficiaries are not being given all the information they \n     need to adequately compare the costs and benefits of their \n     health care coverage.\n       We learned that many beneficiaries simply do not know how \n     managed care is different from standard fee-for-service \n     Medicare. And they are not getting simple explanations of the \n     differences among the Medicare Health Maintenance \n     Organizations (HMO's) in their local areas. Because it is \n     generally agreed that HMO's best serve their enrollees when \n     they compete on factors other than just price, providing \n     Medicare beneficiaries with more and better information is \n     essential.\n       Consumers ideally need simple, readable comparison charts \n     so they are able to readily understand the differences \n     between plans. Currently, the Health Care Financing \n     Administration (HCFA), which administers Medicare, does not \n     provide beneficiaries with any comparative data. This means \n     older people who want to learn about managed care options \n     must call a toll-free number to see what HMO's are in their \n     area and then call each company one-by-one and request their \n     health care information. The problem is that each local plan \n     with a Medicare contract presents information using different \n     formats and language, so it's difficult or even impossible to \n     make cost and benefit comparisons.\n\n[[Page S5009]]\n\n       And while the vast majority of Medicare beneficiaries--87 \n     percent nationally--remain enrolled in traditional fee-for-\n     service Medicare, this is changing rapidly. The number of \n     beneficiaries nationwide who enroll in HMO's is growing by \n     about 30 percent a year. In Louisiana, the growth rate is \n     more than 50 percent. The number of health plans with \n     Medicare contracts is also increasing rapidly. In 1993, there \n     were 110 such plans. Last year, the number more than doubled \n     to 241.\n       In a recent report to the Congress, the General Accounting \n     Office (GAO) was critical of the type of information older \n     Americans get on their health care options. The Prospective \n     Payment Assessment Commission also said in a recent report \n     that ``cost and benefit definitions should be standardized so \n     that beneficiaries can better compare plans.''\n       And the Institute of Medicine last year reported that \n     ``current information available to Medicare beneficiaries \n     lags far behind the kinds of assistance provided by \n     progressive private employers to their employees.''\n       One way to begin addressing these disturbing structural \n     problems is to provide more and better information so that \n     beneficiaries can make informed choices. It is really a \n     fairly simple concept, but one that government often loses \n     sight of--people make wiser and less costly decisions for \n     themselves and their families if they have the right kind of \n     information.\n       In fact, in its October 1996 report, GAO recommended that \n     the federal government require plans to use standard formats \n     and terminology; produce benefit and cost comparison charts \n     with all Medicare options available for all areas; and \n     analyze, compare and widely distribute certain statistics \n     about HMO's, including their disenrollment rates and rate of \n     complaints.\n       Clearly, we must find a better way to inform Medicare \n     consumers about their choices because good information is the \n     key to making the right health care choices for ourselves and \n     our loved ones.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE:\n  S. 790. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nIndian tribes to receive charitable contributions of inventory; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n   Charitable Contributions of Inventory to Indian Tribes legislation\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation to \nexpand the current inventory charitable donation rule to include Indian \ntribes. This proposal is short and simple.\n  Under current law, companies may obtain a special charitable donation \ntax deduction under Internal Revenue Code section 170(e)(3) for \ncontributing their excess inventory to the ill, the needy, or infants. \nWhile not limited to any particular type of company or inventory, this \ndeduction commonly is used by food processing companies whose excess \nfood inventories otherwise would spoil. Indian tribes have had \ndifficulty obtaining these donations, however, because of an ambiguity \nin the law as to whether or not donating companies may deduct donations \nto organizations on Indian reservations.\n  The current language in section 170(e)(3) requires charitable \ndonations of excess inventory to be made to organizations that are \ndescribed in section 501(c)(3) of the Code and exempt from taxation \nunder section 501(a). While Indian tribes are exempt from taxation, \nthey are not among the organizations described in section 501(c)(3). \nAccordingly, it is not clear that a direct donation of excess inventory \nto an Indian tribe would qualify for the charitable donation deduction \nunder section 170(e)(3).\n  Ironically, the Indian Tribal Government Tax Status Act found in \nsection 7871 provides that an Indian tribal government shall be treated \nas a State for purposes of determining tax deductibility of charitable \ncontributions made pursuant to section 170. Unfortunately, the act does \nnot expressly extend to donations made under section 170(e)(3) because \nthat provision technically does not include States as eligible donees.\n  Mr. President, it is well documented that Native Americans, like \nother citizens, may meet the qualifications for this special charitable \ndonation. No one would argue that it is not within the intent of \nsection 170(e)(3) to allow contributions to Native American \norganizations to qualify for the special charitable donation deduction \nin that section of the code. The bill I am introducing today simply \nwould allow those contributions to qualify for the deduction. By \nallowing companies to make qualified contributions to Indian tribes \nunder section 170(e)(3), the bill would clearly further the intended \npurpose of both Internal Revenue Code section 170(e)(3) and the Indian \nTribal Government Tax Status Act.\n  The appropriateness of the measure is exhibited by the fact that it \nwas included in the Revenue Act of 1992 (H.R. 11), which was vetoed for \nunrelated reasons. At that time, the measure was supported on policy \ngrounds by the staffs of the joint committee on Taxation and Finance \nCommittee. In 1995, the joint committee estimated that the proposal \nwould have a negligible effect on Federal receipts over the 6-year \nperiod it estimated.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this bill and ask \nunanimous consent that its text be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 790\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with \nrespect to the treatment of certain amounts received by a cooperative \ntelephone company; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          Tax Treatment of Telephone Cooperatives Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nreaffirms the intent of the U.S. Congress, originally expressed in \n1916, to grant tax exempt status to telephone cooperatives. This \nexemption is now set forth in section 501(c)(12) of the Internal \nRevenue Code.\n  I am joined by my distinguished colleagues, Senators Dorgan, \nGrassley, Johnson, and Conrad.\n  This legislation is identical to a bill I introduced in the 103d and \n104th Congresses and to a measure that was included in the Revenue Act \nof 1992, which ultimately was vetoed.\n  Congress has always understood that a tax exemption is necessary to \nensure that reliable, universal telephone service is available in rural \nAmerica at a cost that is affordable to the rural consumer. Telephone \ncooperatives are nonprofit entities that provide this service where it \nmight otherwise not exist due to the high cost of reaching remote, \nsparsely populated areas.\n  The facilities of a telephone cooperative are used to provide both \nlocal and long distance communications services. Perhaps the most \nimportant of these for rural users is long distance. Without these \nservices, both local and long distance, people in rural areas could not \ncommunicate with their own neighbors, much less with the world. While \ntelephone cooperatives comprise only a small fraction of the U.S. \ntelephone industry--about 1 percent--their services are vitally \nimportant to those who must rely upon them.\n  Under Internal Revenue Code section 501(c)(12), a telephone \ncooperative qualifies for tax exemption only if at least 85 percent of \nits gross income consists of amounts collected from members for the \nsole purpose of meeting losses and expenses. Thus, the bulk of the \nrevenues must be related to providing services needed by members of the \ncooperative, that is, rural consumers. No more than 15 percent of the \ncooperative's gross income may come from nonmember sources, such as \nproperty rentals or interest earned on funds on deposit in a bank. For \npurposes of the 85 percent test, certain categories of income are \ndeemed neither member nor nonmember income and are excluded from the \ncalculation. The reason for the 85 percent test is to ensure that \ncooperatives do not abuse their tax exempt status.\n\n[[Page S5010]]\n\n  A technical advice memorandum [TAM] released by the Internal Revenue \nService a few years ago threatens to change the way telephone \ncooperatives characterize certain expenses for purposes of the 85 \npercent test. If the rationale set forth in the TAM is applied to all \ntelephone cooperatives, the majority could lose their tax exempt \nstatus.\n  Specifically, the IRS now appears to take the position that all fees \nreceived by telephone cooperatives from long distance companies for use \nof the local lines must be excluded from the 85 percent test and that \nfees received for billing and collection services performed by \ncooperatives on behalf of long distance companies constitute nonmember \nincome to the cooperative.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would clarify that access \nrevenues paid by long distance companies to telephone cooperatives are \nto be counted as member revenues, so long as they are related to long \ndistance calls paid for by members of the cooperative. In addition, the \nlegislation would indicate that billing and collection fees are to be \nexcluded entirely from the 85 percent test calculation.\n  Mr. President, it is no secret that mere distance is the single most \nimportant obstacle to rural development. In the telecommunications \nindustry today, we have the ability to bridge distances more \neffectively than ever before. Technology in this area has advanced at \nan incredible pace; however, maintaining and upgrading the rural \ntelecommunications infrastructure is an exceedingly expensive \nproposition. We must do all we can to encourage this development, and \nensuring that telephone cooperatives retain their legitimate tax exempt \nstatus is a vital step toward this goal. I believe that providing \naccess to customers for long distance calls as well as billing and \ncollecting for those calls on behalf of the cooperative's members and \nlong distance companies are indisputably part of the exempt function of \nproviding telephone service, especially to rural communities. The \nnature and function of telephone cooperatives have not materially \nchanged since 1916, and neither should the formula upon which they rely \nto obtain tax exempt status.\n\n  In the 104th Congress, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated the \ncost of this legislation to be $61 million over a 6-year period. At the \nappropriate time, I will recommend appropriate offsets to cover the \ncost of this measure over the 10-year period required under the Budget \nAct.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 791\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, since 1988, I have studied the effects on \nfamily farmers of a provision in estate tax law known as section 2032A. \nWhile section 2032A may seem a minor provision to some, it is \ncritically important to family run farms. A problem with respect to the \nInternal Revenue Service's interpretation of this provision has been \nfestering for a number of years and threatens to force the sale of many \nfamily farms.\n  Section 2032A, which bases the estate tax applicable to a family farm \non its use as a farm, rather than on its market value, reflects the \nintent of Congress to help families keep their farms. A family that has \nworked hard to maintain a farm should not have to sell it to a third \nparty solely to pay stiff estate taxes resulting from increases in the \nvalue of the land. Under section 2032A, inheriting family members are \nrequired to continue farming the property for at least 15 years in \norder to avoid having the IRS recapture the tax savings.\n  At the time section 2032A was enacted, it was common practice for one \nor more family members to cash lease the farm from the other members of \nthe family. This practice made sense in a situation in which some \nfamily members were more involved than others in the day-to-day farming \nof the land. Typically, the other family members would continue to be \nat risk with respect to the value of the farm and participate in \ndecisions affecting the farm's operation. Cash leasing among family \nmembers remained a common practice after the enactment of section \n2032A. An inheriting child would continue to cash lease from his or her \nsiblings, with no reason to suspect from the statute or otherwise that \nthe cash leasing arrangement might jeopardize the farm's qualification \nfor special use valuation.\n  Based at least in part on some language that I am told was included \nin a Joint Committee on Taxation publication in early 1982, the \nInternal Revenue\n\n[[Page S5011]]\n\nService has taken the position that cash leasing among family members \nwill disqualify the farm for special use valuation. The matter has \nsince been the subject of numerous audits and some litigation, though \npotentially hundreds of family farmers may yet be unaware of the change \nof events. Cases continue to arise under this provision.\n  In 1988, Congress provided partial clarification of this issue for \nsurviving spouses who cash lease to their children. Due to revenue \nconcerns, however, no clarification was made of the situation where \nsurviving children cash lease among themselves.\n  My concern is that many families in which inheriting children or \nother family members have cash leased to each other may not even be \naware of the IRS's position on this issue. At some time in the future, \nthey are going to be audited and find themselves liable for enormous \namounts in taxes, interest and penalties. For those who cash leased in \nthe late 1970's, this could be devastating because the taxes they owe \nare based on the inflated land values that existed at that time.\n  A case that arose in my State of South Dakota illustrates the \nunfairness and devastating impact of the IRS interpretation of section \n2032A. Janet Kretschmar, who lives with her husband, Craig, in \nCresbard, SD, inherited her mother's farm along with her two sisters in \n1980. Because the property would continue to be farmed by the family \nmembers, estate taxes were paid on it pursuant to section 2032A, saving \nover $50,000 in estate tax.\n  Janet and Craig continued to farm the land and have primary \nresponsibility for its day-to-day operation. They set up a simple and \nstraightforward arrangement with the other two sisters whereby Janet \nand Craig would lease the sisters' interests from them.\n  Seven years later, the IRS told the Kretschmars that the cash lease \narrangement had disqualified the property for special use valuation and \nthat they owed $54,000 to the IRS. According to the IRS, this amount \nrepresented estate tax that was being recaptured as a result of the \ndisqualification. This came as an enormous surprise to the Kretschmars, \nas they had never been notified of the change in interpretation of the \nlaw and had no reason to believe that their arrangement would no longer \nbe held valid by the IRS for purposes of qualifying for special use \nvaluation. The fact is that, if they had known this, they would have \norganized their affairs in one of several other acceptable, though more \ncomplicated, ways.\n  For many years, I have sought inclusion in tax legislation of a \nprovision that would clarify that cash leasing among family members \nwill not disqualify the property for special use valuation. In 1992, \nsuch a provision was successfully included in H.R. 11, the Revenue Act \nof 1992 and passed by Congress. Unfortunately, H.R. 11 was subsequently \nvetoed. In 1995, I introduced this provision as freestanding \nlegislation; however, it did not reach the full Senate for a vote.\n  Today, I am reintroducing a bill that is identical to the section \n2032A measure which was passed in the Revenue Act of 1992. I am joined \nin this effort by Senators Dorgan, Conrad and Mr. Johnson whose \nexpertise on tax and rural issues are well known.\n  I must emphasize that there may be many other cases in other \nagricultural States where families are cash leasing the family farm \namong each other, unaware that the IRS could come knocking at their \ndoor at any minute. I urge my colleagues in the Senate who may have \nsuch cases in their State to work with us and support this important \nclarification of the law.\n  I intend to request that the Joint Committee on Taxation estimate the \nrevenue impact of this proposal. At an appropriate time thereafter, I \nwill recommend any necessary offsets over a 10-year period as required \nby the Budget Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 792\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to require that \nthe Center for Substance Abuse Treatment carry out treatment programs \nfor adolescents; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n           THE SERVICES FOR CHILDREN OF SUBSTANCE ABUSERS ACT\n\n  S. 794. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to revise and \nextend the grant program for services for children of substance \nabusers; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n           THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT FOR ADOLESCENTS ACT\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two bills which \nseek to address one of the most critical problems tearing at the fabric \nof American society: substance abuse. When we consider health care \ncosts, lost time on the job, increased crime, and other related \nfactors, it is estimated that drug and alcohol abuse cost this Nation \nmore than $300 billion in 1993. While some efforts to address this \nproblem have been successful, there is still a great deal of work to be \ndone. The two bills that I am introducing, the Services for Children of \nSubstance Abusers Act and the Substance Abuse Treatment for Adolescents \nAct, seek to provide additional tools for families to fight the battle \nof addiction and its debilitating social consequences.\n  Addiction threatens the American family in several ways. The long \nterm emotional health of an individual is shaped during childhood, and \nthe children of substance abusers face numerous obstacles during their \ndevelopment. The children of substance abusers are typically deprived \nof the parent's attention and concern, and often the financial support \nto provide food, clothing, and shelter. In the most dramatic cases, \nchildren are exposed to substances prenatally and are deprived of a \nhealthy future before they are even born.\n  An estimated 7 million children are growing up with at least one \nsubstance abusing parent, and more than 200,000 women who gave birth in \nthe United States in 1992 used illegal drugs at some time during their \npregnancy. In addition, alcohol consumption by pregnant women has \nrecently surged, despite public campaigns about the effects of alcohol \non the developing fetus. Clearly these parents will need help if they \nhope to overcome their addictions and raise healthy children. \nUnfortunately, these parents often face several obstacles on the road \nto recovery.\n  The basic problem with our current drug and alcohol treatment \nprograms is that they fail to address the wide range of problems that \naddicted parents face. Many were physically or sexually abused as \nchildren. Many are victims of domestic violence. Many lack any formal \njob skills. Many will need child care assistance if they hope to enroll \nin a treatment program. Many fear that they will lose their children if \nthey come forward for treatment. In short, these parents face several \nproblems which extend far beyond their addictions.\n  The Children of Substance Abusers Act is currently authorized in the \nPublic Health Services Act, but it has never been funded. Today, I \nintroduce a revised version of this legislation that seeks to give \nfamilies affected by substance abuse somewhere to turn. The heart of \nthe bill is the grant program which will provide $50 million for a \ncomprehensive range of health, developmental, and social services to \nchildren, parents, and other family members. These services will \nenhance the\n\n[[Page S5012]]\n\nability of parents to access drug and alcohol treatment and promote \nfamily preservation, where appropriate.\n  The bill ensures that all children whose parents are substance \nabusers can enter the program and receive a range of services. The \nlegislation addresses another critical need by providing grants to \ntrain professionals, child welfare workers, and other providers serving \nchildren to identify and address the effects of familial substance \nabuse.\n  For years we have talked about the impact of substance abuse on \nfamilies. We have all visited the neonatal intensive care units, and we \nhave all seen reports on children who were abused and neglected because \ntheir parents were on drugs. The time has come for Congress to respond \nto what is going on in this country and take an aggressive step toward \nalleviating these problems.\n  The Children of Substance Abusers Act is critical to our efforts to \nreach out to those families that are struggling with substance abuse, \nand I urge my colleagues to support the legislation I introduce today \nand fund this critical program.\n  On another front, the increased prevalence of substance abuse among \nyoung Americans poses an additional public health crisis. Last year, \nthe percentage of teens using drugs within the past month rose from 8.2 \nto 10.9 percent, and the rate of drug use among 12 to 17 year-olds has \ndoubled since 1992. I am particularly disappointed to learn that \nConnecticut's students report higher rates of drug use than their peers \nnationwide.\n  Annually, more than 400,000 Americans under the age of 18 are in need \nof treatment, and in Connecticut approximately 6,700 students need \nsubstance abuse treatment. However, young people have few places to \nturn. Most treatment programs are designed for adults, and there are \nlimited resources available for the treatment of adolescents with drug \nand alcohol problems.\n  Federal and state initiatives have focused on preventing children \nfrom becoming substance abusers. While prevention efforts are effective \nand necessary, they do not provide for those adolescents with substance \nabuse problems. In addition, most substance abusing adolescents have \nco-occurring disorders, such as depression, learning disabilities, \npost-traumatic stress disorders, and other health problems which make \ntreatment even more challenging.\n  The Substance Abuse Treatment for Adolescents Act seeks to create a \nfunding stream for adolescent treatment. This would be the first time \nthat any money has ever been earmarked specifically for adolescent \ntreatment, setting aside an estimated $70 million annually to address \nthis problem. This bill would also eliminate the need within the public \nsystem for adolescent providers to compete with other groups for scarce \ntreatment dollars, thereby allowing them to focus upon the real \nproblem: successfully treating adolescent substance abusers.\n  Mr. President, this legislation marks a significant step on the road \ntoward improved treatment for adolescent substance abuse. It tells \nfamilies that we care about their children's health and well-being, and \nit sends a signal to those individuals who struggle to help our kids \novercome addiction that their hard work is not for naught, but will \nsoon be rewarded.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bills be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 793\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today, on behalf of myself and \nthe distinguished Senator from California, Senator Feinstein, to \nintroduce the Gun Kingpin Death Penalty Act of 1997. I hope that our \ncolleagues will soon join us in sending a clear and strong signal to \nour most violent gunrunners--your actions will no longer be tolerated.\n  Mr. President, the fight against gun violence is a long-term, many-\nstaged process. We have already succeeded in enacting the Brady bill \nand the ban on devastating assault weapons. Last year, even in the \nmidst of what many consider a hostile Congress, we told domestic \nviolence offenders that they could no longer own a gun.\n  And these laws have been effective: 186,000 prohibited individuals \nhave already been denied a handgun due to Brady background checks--70 \npercent of these people were convicted or indicted felons. Traces of \nassault weapons have plummeted since the ban, and prices have gone up. \nAnd our law enforcement officers are no longer dying at the hands of \ncriminals armed with assault weapons.\n  As I said, we have been successful. But we cannot be satisfied with \nvictories in battle--we must use every avenue possible to win the war \nagainst gun violence.\n  Mr. President, it is for this reason that I rose just a few weeks ago \nwith Senator Durbin to introduce a new prosecutorial tool in the fight \nto stop gun traffickers--the Gun Kingpin Penalty Act of 1997. That bill \nwould institute a sliding scale of mandatory minimum penalties for the \nworst gunrunners, and I hope we can debate it soon.\n  But we must also address the problem of the most violent and \ndangerous offenders--those who commit murder in furtherance of their \ngun trafficking crimes. So I rise again today to issue a new \nchallenge--send a message to murderous gunrunners that their violence \nmust stop.\n  Our Gun Kingpin Death Penalty Act of 1997, which is modeled after the \nDrug Kingpin Death Penalty legislation already enacted into law, \nprovides that any criminal who commits murder or successfully orders a \nmurder committed during the course of trafficking in more than 25 \nfirearms may receive life in prison or the death penalty. This \nprovision gives Federal prosecutors one more tool in the fight against \ngun trafficking, and sends out a warning to all violent gunrunners--\nthink twice before you act.\n  Mr. President, when I rose with Senator Durbin last month to \nintroduce the first in this two-bill attack on gunrunners, I cited \nrecent numbers gathered by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms \nwhich clearly demonstrate what many of us already knew all too well--\nseveral key highways in this country have become so-called firearm \nfreeways--pipelines for merchants of death who deal in illegal \nfirearms.\n  We learned from the ATF data that in 1996, New Jersey exported fewer \nguns used in crimes, per capita, than any other State--less than one \ngun per 100,000 residents, or 75 total guns. In contrast, Mississippi \nexported 29 of these guns per capita last year.\n  Meanwhile, an incredible number of guns used to commit crimes in New \nJersey last year came from out-of-State--944 guns were imported and \nused to commit crimes compared to only 75 exported--a net import of 869 \nillegal guns used to commit crimes against the people of New Jersey.\n  In fact, the top six exporters of illegal guns used to commit crimes \nin New Jersey supplied 62 percent of the guns, 585, and only one of \nthose six States--North Carolina--has strong gun control laws.\n  This represents a one-way street--guns come from States with lax gun \nlaws straight to States--like New Jersey--with strong laws.\n  New Jersey has long been proud to have some of the toughest gun \ncontrol laws in the Nation. But for far too long, the courageous \nefforts of New Jersey citizens in enacting these tough laws have been \nweakened by out-of-State gunrunners who treat our State like their own \npersonal retail outlet.\n  It is clear that New Jersey's strong gun control laws offer criminals \nlittle choice but to import their guns from States with weak laws. We \nmust act on a Federal level to send a clear message that this cannot \ncontinue and will not be tolerated. And we must send an equally clear \nmessage that gunrunners who commit murder risk the ultimate of \npenalties.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I remind my colleagues that we cannot rest \nsatisfied simply because we have succeeded in the past. The problem of \nillegal gun traffickers will not just go away, and we cannot stand by \nand watch as innocent men, women, and children die at\n\n[[Page S5014]]\n\nthe hands of criminals armed with these guns. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill. I ask that the bill be printed in the record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 796\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

DEATH PENALTY FOR CERTAIN FIREARMS TRAFFICKING \n                   VIOLATIONS.\n\n       Section 924 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(p) In addition to any other penalties set forth in this \n     title, any person engaging in an offense under paragraph \n     (1)(A) or (3) of section 922(a) that involves 25 or more \n     firearms, who intentionally kills or counsels, commands, \n     induces, procures, or causes the intentional killing of an \n     individual, and such killing results, shall be sentenced--\n       ``(1) to a term of imprisonment of not less than 20 years \n     and up to life imprisonment; or\n       ``(2) to death.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Baucus and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 797. A bill to amend the John F. Kennedy Center Act to authorize \nthe design and construction of additions to the parking garage and \ncertain site improvements, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n       THE JOHN F. KENNEDY CENTER PARKING IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to help \nresolve the most serious problem identified by patrons and visitors of \nthe Kennedy Center--the lack of adequate on-site parking. Joining me \ntoday as original cosponsors are: Senators Baucus and Kennedy.\n  This legislation provides authority to the Kennedy Center Board of \nTrustees to construct an addition to the existing parking garage at \neach of the north and south ends of the Center. Importantly, Mr. \nPresident, the garage addition authorized in this bill will come at a \ncost to the Federal Government. The project will be financed through \nthe issuance of industrial revenue bonds which will be repaid entirely \nwith revenue derived from operation of the expanded garage. Indeed, a \nprovision included in the legislation explicitly prohibits the use of \nappropriated funds for the purpose of constructing or financing the \nparking garage expansion.\n  Also included in the bill is authorization for the Center to take \naction on site modifications for the improvement of security on the \nsite. The Center has conducted a complete security review, and among \nthe recommendations are changes to the main approach and plaza. This \nlegislation allows the Center to pursue site modifications for the \nprotection of the building and its visitors.\n  Consistent with the John F. Kennedy Center Act Amendments of 1994, \nthe Center's plans for the garage expansion and other related site \nimprovements will be developed in close consultation with the \nDepartment of Interior. In fact, the National Park Service sent a \nletter today to the president of the Kennedy Center, Mr. Lawrence J. \nWilker, conveying its approval of the conceptual plan for this project.\n  Mr. President, let me say that this proposal reflects the commitment \nof the Kennedy Center trustees to continually improve this Presidential \nmonument for the benefit of the Public--in a manner that is financially \nresponsible. And indeed, the Center is an operation run in a \nfinancially sound way.\n  A little-known fact about the Kennedy Center is that 90 percent of \nthe Center's annual operating income is derived from private sources. \nThe Federal Government provides only 10 percent of the Center's annual \noperating income--and these Federal funds are carefully limited to \nnonperformance activities. This legislation maintains that impressive \nprivate-to-Federal funding ratio.\n  I am proud to serve as a trustee of the Kennedy Center, and commend \nthe board for its stewardship of this treasured asset--the national \ncenter for the performing arts and living memorial to the late \nPresident.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I want to thank Senators Baucus and \nKennedy for their help in drafting this bill. I look forward to working \nwith them and other colleagues to secure timely adoption of the \nmeasure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER:\n  S. 798. A bill to establish a Commission on Information Technology \nWorker Shortage; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n THE NATIONAL COMMISSION ON THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY WORKER SHORTAGE \n                       ESTABLISHMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the shortage of skilled workers is one of \nthe most critical issues facing the U.S. information technology [IT] \nindustry today. Our position as world leader in this industry is \nthreatened--not by technology--but by a shortage of necessary labor.\n  This issue is underscored by what we see in the want-ads every week: \nthousands of high-paying jobs unfilled, because there are not enough \nskilled applicants.\n  There is a shortage of nearly 200,000 workers nationwide. The \neconomic impact of this shortfall is being felt in every State and \ncongressional district across America.\n  Virginia, with its growing high-tech industry, is particularly hard \nhit--it is currently estimated that 18,000 jobs are currently unfilled. \nTechnology-based businesses in Virginia number over 2,450, employ more \nthan 290,000 workers, and contribute more than $13.8 billion in wages \nto the State's economy. At current rates of growth, by 2002 these \nnumbers are expected to jump to over 4,000 companies, employing about \n330,000, with $22 billion in wages. The average technology sector \nworker in Virginia earned $45,288 in 1996, compared to an average wage \nof $26,608 in the Virginia economy as a whole. By 2002, the average \ntechnology sector wage could grow to over $63,000.\n  By any measure, these are the jobs of the future. But unless our \nworkforce is educated and trained properly, these jobs will remain \nunfilled or, worse yet, move to countries with the necessary qualified \npeople. This 2-5-million-person industry is projected to nearly double \nin size by the year 2000. But its growth is being stunted by the \ninability of firms to hire the talent that they need to expand.\n  Let me be clear: this problem is not confined to just high technology \ncompanies and it is not limited to one region of the country. It \nextends to any firm that depends on information technology employees to \nexpand its markets, reach its customers, or improve its products.\n  Education is a key component of the solution to this problem. \nHowever, schools are not graduating enough qualified individuals to \nmeet the need. From 1986 to 1994, the number of bachelor degrees in \ncomputer science, for example, fell 43 percent from 42,195 to 24,200. \nAs the Senate begins the reauthorization process for the Higher \nEducation Act of 1965 and the formulation of job training legislation, \nI hope we will give particular emphasis to the impact that the shortage \nof skilled technology workers is having on the economy, and recognize \nthe need to ensure that our work force is prepared for the next \ncentury.\n\n  As cochair of the Senate Information Technology Caucus and a new \nmember of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, I want to \nbring this matter to the attention of the Congress and the public, to \ndemonstrate the far-reaching implications this crisis will have on the \nIT industry and the American economy as a whole.\n  We need to look at all options for addressing this problem. That is \nwhy I am introducing legislation establishing a National Commission on \nthe Information Technology Worker Shortage. The Commission will be \ncomprised of industry leaders, educators, and government officials who \nwill study this issue and provide Congress with potential solutions. \nThe Commission will draw on the brightest minds and the best ideas to \ncraft the solutions necessary to encourage more students to enter \ntechnical fields, to ensure that teachers and schools are equipped to \ntrain them, and to incorporate the best private sector initiatives. The \nCommission will report concrete legislative and administrative \nrecommendations to the President and to Congress within the year.\n  Mr. President, the Commission will provide the national focus and \nattention that this problem demands. I hope my colleagues will join me \nin supporting this initiative.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Con. Res. 28\n\n       Whereas there has been a two-to-threefold global increase \n     in mercury in the environment since the 1850's, increases of \n     3 times have been found in wilderness areas of the United \n     States, and much higher increases have been found in \n     developed areas of the United States;\n       Whereas mercury is truly a State, national, and \n     international concern because mercury is atmospherically \n     transported indiscriminately across political boundaries;\n       Whereas atmospheric deposition resulting from human \n     activities, including area sources, waste incineration and \n     disposal, and fossil fuel burning contributes to mercury \n     loading in the environment;\n       Whereas mercury is a persistent bioaccumulative toxic \n     substance that presents particular problems in aquatic \n     systems;\n       Whereas fish consumption advisories have been issued for at \n     least 1,500 water bodies in 37 States, including Vermont, \n     because of high levels of mercury contamination in fish, \n     resulting in losses to tourism and fishing industries and \n     related activities;\n       Whereas, according to estimates by the Administrator of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency, each year in the United \n     States between 80,000 and 85,000 pregnant women are exposed \n     to mercury levels high enough to produce risk to their \n     children;\n       Whereas the study of mercury required under section \n     112(n)(1)(B) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7412(n)(1)(B)), \n     required to be completed by November 15, 1994, represents the \n     best information in the world on the use, generation, and \n     disposal of mercury;\n       Whereas the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency effectively completed the draft report in 1995, but \n     has continually delayed submittal of the study to Congress;\n       Whereas there are known substitutes for most mercury-\n     containing products and devices, except for high-efficiency \n     lighting;\n       Whereas over 500,000,000 mercury-containing lamps are \n     annually produced in the United States, representing one of \n     the largest sources of mercury in municipal waste streams, \n     and typical waste management practices involve compaction, \n     which results in mercury releases, before and during \n     disposal;\n       Whereas landfill air emissions test data for mercury is \n     lacking;\n       Whereas the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency is establishing simultaneously maximum achievable \n     control technologies for mercury sources pursuant to the \n     Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), proposing tightening \n     water quality criteria for mercury under the Federal Water \n     Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), placing \n     priority on mercury-contaminated superfund sites, but is \n     proposing to exempt mercury-containing lamps from hazardous \n     waste regulations;\n       Whereas the United States and Canada have jointly agreed in \n     the Agreement on Air Quality, Agreement on Great Lakes Water \n     Quality, 1978, and Agreement on Virtual Elimination of \n     Persistent Toxic Substances in the Great Lakes Basin to \n     control transboundary emissions and to cooperate on research \n     and development projects to eliminate toxic substances, \n     including mercury; and\n       Whereas Federal and State governments have taken many \n     actions to reduce mercury in the environment: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring),\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the Administrator of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency should--\n       (1) immediately release to Congress the study of mercury \n     required under section 112(n)(1)(B) of the Clean Air Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 7412(n)(1)(B));\n       (2) initiate a pilot program for landfill air emission \n     tests for mercury in the Northeast and nationally; and\n       (3) not exempt mercury-containing lamps from hazardous \n     waste regulations, but should instead adopt universal waste \n     rules that foster mercury recycling.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to draw the Senate's attention \nto something that is going on at the Environmental Protection Agency \nthat is of great concern to many of our House and Senate colleagues, \nand to myself. For the past year, I have been working with the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, the White House and now, the Science \nAdvisory Board, to release a 1,700-page report on the sources, health \nrisks, and control measure for mercury pollution in our country. This \nreport is the best and most complete assemblage of state-of-the-art \ninformation to date on the sources and health effects of mercury \npollution. It has undergone extensive internal and external peer \nreview. American taxpayers have already paid more than $1 million in \ncontract dollars and for more than 25,000 hours of staff time to \ndevelop this report. Had the report been submitted to the Congress when \nit was effectively completed roughly 17 months ago, the information it \ncontains would have been available to the public and for use by State \nand Federal decisionmakers.\n  Because of the widespread public and congressional concern over the \nhealth and environmental effects of mercury pollution, the 1990 Clean \nAir amendments required the EPA to conduct a study of mercury and \nsubmit that study to Congress by November 1994. Instead, the EPA \nsubmitted the report to the Science Advisory Board for review because \nnew studies are expected to be published over the next 2 years. Well, \nas we all know, one thing you can be sure of in this world is that \nresearchers will continue to research; there will always be new \nstudies, and this is as it should be. We need sound science to make \npublic policy decisions. But we also need up-to-date science, and that \nis what this report offers. As time passes, the information contained \nin the report becomes increasingly less useful for regulatory and \njudicial decisions.\n  Mercury poses a serious and growing public health and environmental \nthreat to our Nation. Thirty-seven States have issued human health \nconsumption advisories because of unacceptable levels of mercury in \nfreshwater fish. According to EPA estimates, as many as\n\n[[Page S5017]]\n\n85,000 pregnant women are exposed to mercury levels high enough to \nproduce risks to their children. Yet many States cannot identify the \nsources and quantities of this pollutant or address the problems that \narise both within and outside State borders.\n  We Vermonters are deeply concerned about what is being transported by \nair currents across our borders. Acid rain taught us that our tough \nlaws on the environment were not enough to protect us. We could be \naffected from other areas of the country whose environmental standards \nmay not be as high as our own. Yet despite these standards, Vermont and \nother States have become a dumping ground. We saw some of our \nhealthiest forests die off from pollution that came from outside our \nregion. Unlike the many compounds causing acid rain, mercury does not \nbreak down. It circulates through the environment. It is not going to \ngo away when we turn off the tap. It will settle in the lakes, streams, \nand soils of those States that were also the dumping ground for acid \nrain.\n  The public has a right to this report and the States need it to make \nsensible decisions about reducing mercury in the environment. Instead, \nit has been sitting on the shelf for nearly 2 years now. By holding \nback the mercury report, the administration is denying to Federal and \nState regulatory bodies and to the public information that will be \ncritical to the revision of health advisories, air pollution measures, \nand utility restructuring proposals. But releasing the report is only \nthe first step in addressing mercury pollution. The concurrent \nresolution I am submitting today also addresses the need to reduce \nmercury releases into the environment.\n  One major source of mercury is municipal waste due to the disposal of \nmercury-containing lamps. EPA has proposed a rule to either exempt \nmercury-containing lamps from hazardous waste regulations or to include \nthem in the universal waste rule, but EPA has made little progress \nsince 1995. Exempting mercury-containing lamps from the hazardous waste \nrule would allow more than 500 million lamps to be deposited in solid \nwaste landfills or conveyed to waste incinerators, perpetuating the \nuncontrolled release of mercury into the environment. In Vermont, we \nare building a recycling industry to collect mercury-containing lamps. \nWe are trying to keep mercury out of our waste stream. Without a \nFederal effort to encourage the same preventive steps in other States, \nthis effort will be for naught. By including mercury-containing lamps \nin the universal waste rule, we would encourage recycling and the \nelimination of these products from the municipal solid waste stream.\n  Another integral step in addressing mercury pollution is development \nof a better inventory of mercury emissions. One of the recommendations \nof the mercury report is to acquire test data on notable sources of \nmercury. My concurrent resolution calls upon EPA to begin landfill \ntesting in pilot sites across the country. Several States have already \nexpressed an interest in testing, and Florida has already begun testing \nat landfills. The only testing conducted at the Federal level was in \nNew York City where two studies raised contradictory findings. In a \n1994 Minnesota study, more than 10 percent of the overall emissions of \nmercury were attributed to landfills. We need to verify these initial \nfindings through a national pilot program. Unfortunately, the 1,700-\npage mercury report does not include an examination of landfills.\n  It is my hope that by releasing the mercury report, promulgating \nregulations on disposal of mercury-containing lamps and testing for \nmercury emissions, we will lay the groundwork for the long-overdue \nreduction of mercury from several sources. I am pleased to be joined by \nmy colleagues, Senators Wellstone, Jeffords, Levin, Moynihan, Feingold, \nand Dodd, in submitted this Senate concurrent resolution. I hope that \nthis resolution will draw to this issue the attention not only of the \nSenate, but also of the administration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/22/senate-section/article/S5016-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5017-S5018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      committee on armed services\n\n  Mr. THOMAS.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Bruce \nand Christine Pesola, of Marquette, MI, whose restoration of the \nLandmark Inn Hotel has preserved one of the Upper Peninsula's \narchitectural and historic treasures for a new generation.\n  The Landmark Inn Hotel originally opened on January 8, 1930, and was \nknown as the Hotel Northland. At that time, the Northland was the \npremier hotel in the Upper Peninsula. Throughout the years, the hotel \nhas housed many notable people, including Amelia Earhart, Bud Abbott \nand Lou Costello, and musical legends Duke Ellington and Louis \nArmstrong.\n  When Bruce and Christine Pesola purchased the hotel in 1995, it had \nstood vacant for more than 12 years. While many people were calling for \nthe demolition of the building, the Pesolas were dedicated to \npreserving this piece of history. Described by one local newspaper as a \n``squalid, vacant blemish on the city's skyline,'' the rehabilitation \nof the Landmark Inn will contribute significantly to restoration \nefforts in downtown Marquette. As a longtime proponent of historic \npreservation, I was pleased to support the Pesolas in their efforts to \nsecure the project's eligibility for historic preservation \ncertification from the Department of the Interior, enabling the Pesolas \nto receive federal tax credits in return for their commitment to \nretaining the historic characteristics of the hotel.\n  The renovation of the Landmark Inn Hotel stands as an example of the \nbenefits of historic preservation. Not only will Marquette gain a \nquality hotel in the downtown area, the people of the city of Marquette \nand the State of Michigan will retain an important link to the past. I \nknow my colleagues will join me in expressing congratulations and best \nwishes for future success to Bruce and Christine Pesola on the occasion \nof the grand opening of the Landmark Inn Hotel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/22/senate-section/article/S5018-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO THE NEW HAMPSHIRE DELEGATES ATTENDING A NATIONAL SUMMIT ON \n                              VOLUNTARISM\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to the New Hampshire delegates who represented the Granite \nState at the National Summit on Voluntarism in Philadelphia from April \n27 through April 29. The 3-day summit focused on the challenges facing \nour Nation's children and youth, and encouraged Americans to dedicate \ntheir time and talents to communities and children. It was organized on \nthe suggestion that America's young people have access to five \nfundamental resources. These resources include an ongoing relationship \nwith an adult, safe places during nonschool hours to learn, a healthy \nstart, a skill through effective education, and the opportunity to give \nback through community service.\n  I would like today to honor the individuals from my state who gave \ntheir time and energy so our children can remain safe and strong. They \nare: Amy McGlashan of New Hampshire College and University Council, \nDaniel Forbes of St. Anselm College, Carlos Agudelo of the ALPHA \nAlliance, Regis Lemaire of the Office of Youth Services, David Fish of \nthe United Parcel Service, Darlene E. Schmidt of CFX Bank, Joshua Morse \nof Southern New Hampshire Services, JoAnn St. Pierre of the Voluntary \nAction Center, Ann Puglielli of St. Anselm College, Richard Shannon of \nNew Hampshire Catholic Charities, Susan Gilbert of Manchester, Suzanne \nCarbon of the Grafton County Family Court, Catie Doucette of the White \nMountain School, Ed Farrell of the White Mountain School, Dick Fowler \nof the Division of Children and Youth Services, Katie Kelley of the \nPathfinders Program, Theresa Kennett of Kennett High School, Bruce Labs \nof Woodsville High School, Sara Lang of Woodsville High School, Mike \nPurcell of White Mountain Mental Health, Lynn Wheeler of Nighswander, \nLord & Martin, Debbie Tasker of the Dover Adult Learning Center, Bernie \nMucci of Tyco International Ltd., Elise Klysa of the Timberland Corp., \nRon Borelli of Aavid Thermal Technologies Inc., Karen Brown of Channel \n9 News, Chris Gallagher of the Corporation for National Service, Sidney \nSwartz of the Timberland Corp., and Ken Freitas of the Timberland Corp.\n  Each and every delegate from the State of New Hampshire has achieved \nsuccess in effective citizen service. They are experienced in creating \nopportunities for others to contribute to solutions, and have a record \nof getting things done. Above all, they are trusted by others in their \ncommunity and for that they can be very proud.\n  The summit proved to be beneficial. The representatives from New \nHampshire combined their efforts with delegates from Delaware. They \ncame up with creative plans to bring adults and college students into \nManchester's public schools together to help establish a mentoring \nprogram. The New Hampshire delegates will meet again in the summer to \nreview this proposal and the other ideas they collected and decide how \nto use them.\n  I commend the New Hampshire delegates on their willingness to help \nmake the Granite State a better place to live, and to ignite the spirit \nof voluntarism to provide a strong foundation for America's youth. New \nHampshire is fortunate to be blessed by their leadership and \ndedication. I applaud them for their outstanding work, and am proud to \nrepresent all of them in the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/22/senate-section/article/S5018-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5018-S5019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO RICHARD LLOYD THOMPSON, SR.\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ntruly remarkable man who, on May 30, 1997, will celebrate his \nretirement after 38 years as an educator--Richard Lloyd Thompson, Sr. \nof Middletown, CT.\n  Within every middle-sized town in America, there is a small handful \nof individuals that form the backbone of that community. Everyone knows \nand respects these individuals, because they are continually working to \nstrengthen neighborhoods and help others. They always place the needs \nof others above their own, and they continually give of themselves to \nensure that their hometown is a better place in which to live. Dick \nThompson is one of these individuals.\n  People like Dick Thompson are every bit as important to the city of \nMiddletown, CT as major employers like Aetna, Pratt & Whitney, and \nWesleyan University. He has helped to educate more than a generation of \nstudents in Middletown, and countless children and their families in \nthis town have had their lives positively impacted by him.\n  Dick has seen Middletown grow and mature before his own eyes. After \nteaching in the Hartford Public Schools for 10 years, he came to \nMiddletown in 1971 to serve as the principal at Bielefield Elementary \nSchool. When Dick accepted this job, he entered a newly racially \nintegrated school as the first nonwhite school administrator in the \nhistory of this school system. Through the strength of his own \ncharacter, he was able to guide the school through a period of social \nuneasiness, and he has been an institution within the Middletown school \nsystem ever since.\n  But Dick Thompson's contributions extend far outside the school. He \nhas served on Middletown's Planning and Zoning Commission, their \nCharter Revision Commission, and their Salvation Army Advisory \nCommittee. To illustrate the broad variety of his community \ninvolvement, he has been named an honorary deputy by the Middlesex \nCounty Sherriff's Association, and he has also served as a Middlesex \nCounty justice of the peace.\n\n[[Page S5019]]\n\n  I have been fortunate to get to know Dick personally through his \ninvolvement with the Democratic Party. He has been a local and State \ndelegate for Middletown's Democratic Town Committee, and he has also \nserved on Middletown's Democratic Nominating Committee.\n  Despite the broad range of Dick Thompson's community service, the \ndriving force behind all of his activities has been his concern for \nchildren. As someone who was orphaned at the age of 5, and who lived in \nan orphanage from ages 5 to 18, Dick is keenly aware of the needs of \nchildren and the positive impact that the surrounding community can \nhave on a child's life. Dick sits on Middletown's Youth Services \nCommission, and he has taken a very active role in the lives of \nchildren through his service as a Deacon in his church. Dick has been a \nmentor for many children, and he has helped to instill these young \npeople with a strong set of values that they will carry for a lifetime.\n  As Dick approaches his retirement, I am certain that he would \nconsider his commitment to his family to be his greatest \naccomplishment. Dick has been happily married to his wife Betty for \nmore than 30 years, and together they have raised two wonderful \nchildren. Following in the family tradition, their daughter, Claudette \nRenee, worked as an educator of children and adults. She worked for \nHead Start programs in both Boston and Atlanta, and she currently \nserves as a technical director for an international corporation in \nMaryland. Their son, Richard, graduated from law school in 1994, and he \nis working as an attorney in the Washington, D.C. area. There is no \ngreater source of pride for a parent than to see his children succeed, \nand Dick should be pleased to know that his pride in his children is \nexceeded only by their admiration for their father.\n  Again, I want to congratulate Dick Thompson on his retirement, and I \nwish him the best of luck in all his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/22/senate-section/article/S5018-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5019-S5020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                BROOKE COUNTY'S BICENTENNIAL CELEBRATION\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \na historical milestone in my state of West Virginia. In 1797, Brooke \nCounty, named after Gov. Robert Brooke of Virginia, was officially \nborn. I take this opportunity to congratulate Brooke County on its \nbicentennial celebration.\n  Brooke County, located in the northern Panhandle of West Virginia, \nwas created from part of Ohio County. The first session of the Brooke \nCounty court took place in the home of William Sharpe on May 23, 1797. \nSince that day, the residents of Brooke County have played a vital role \nin the development of West Virginia and the Nation. Its residents \nfought to protect our Nation in the War of 1812 and to keep it intact \nin the Civil War. They founded Brooke Academy, the first educational \ninstitution on the Ohio River, south of Pittsburgh and west of the \nAlleghenies. However, they are not only sound in body and mind, but \nalso in their souls, as the Christian Church, the Disciples of Christ, \nand the Church of Christ all have their early roots in 19th century \nBrooke County.\n  From the Duval Glass House, the first glasshouse in West Virginia, to \nthe delicious Grimes golden apples, the residents of Brooke County have \nbeen steeped in a tradition of innovation. Their accomplishments are \nnumerous and far-reaching. Part of the highly industrialized Ohio \nValley, Brooke County has seen its innovation at work, as their \nindustries have grown from early paper bag and marble manufacturers to \na variety of steel industries including the most modern steel coating \nmill in the world.\n  On behalf of all citizens from the Mountain State, I would like to \nonce again commend Brooke County on its 200th birthday and ask that my \ndistinguished colleagues join with me in recognizing its rich history \nof accomplishments and innovation.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, several weeks ago the ABC News \n``20/20'' program aired a piece entitled ``Your Tax Dollars at Work,'' \na report about an airport construction project in northwest Arkansas. \nThe report focused on allegations that the new airport was unnecessary \nand a waste of Federal tax dollars. As chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee, I believed it was incumbent on me to followup on these \nallegations. I consequently requested that the General Accounting \nOffice [GAO] review the project to ensure that the Federal Aviation \nAdministration [FAA] followed the agency's established process to \nallocate discretionary airport funds to this project.\n  I want to state at the outset that the GAO has said that nothing \nillegal has taken place with respect to the project. In its review, \nhowever, shortcomings were discovered with the FAA's grant \ndecisionmaking process that need to be addressed. The FAA's decision to \nprovide grants for the new Northwest Arkansas Federal Government does \nnot always do the best job in managing the taxpayers' money. In this \ncase, the FAA could have better managed the airport grant program. The \nFAA decided to fund this airport, although the circumstances on which \nit made its decision changed. When this new airport is built and ready \nfor use in 1998, the Federal Government's share will be $70 million, \nalmost two-thirds of the airport's total cost. It remains to be seen, \nhowever, if the airport will have an airline to serve it and if \npassengers will use it.\n  The FAA must ensure that the limited Federal funds available for \ndeveloping the Nation's airports to go to the most deserving projects. \nMaintaining and improving the Nation's airport system requires \ncontinual capital investment and the FAA provides Federal grants to \nhelp with that development. As with other Federal programs, the airport \ngrant program has taken its share of cuts as we work toward balancing \nthe budget. This situation makes it even more important that the FAA \ndoes the best possible job in managing the program's approximately $1.5 \nbillion in funds.\n  From the beginning, there were problems with the FAA's decisionmaking \nprocess in awarding grants to NWARA. The FAA went outside its priority \nsystem, and relied in part on its subjective assessment in awarding the \nairport $70 million over the 12-year period from 1991 through 2002. The \nFAA made its decision in 1990 and did not reconsider its position, \nalthough the circumstances on which the decision was based changed in \nthe immediate following years. In making its decision, the FAA assumed \nthat a nearby airport, Drake Field in Fayetteville, AR, would close and \nthat all air service would move to NWARA. Drake Field, however, remains \nopen and improvements to this airport have been made. The airlines are \nhappy with the airport. Rather than closing, it appears that Drake \nField will compete with NWARA. These airports are less than 30 miles \napart. The FAA also said airlines were behind the construction of \nNWARA. To this day, however, no airlines have made a firm commitment to \nuse this new airport.\n\n  The FAA also decided to provide grants to NWARA under a rarely used \nspecial mechanism called a letter of intent. This mechanism allows the \nFAA to schedule grant payments in future years beyond the program's \nauthorization period. Of the tens of thousands of grants the FAA has \nawarded, only about 50 letters of intent have been issued and only \ntwo--one of which went to NWARA--have been issued in the last 4 years. \nThe Congress established letters of intent only to fund projects that \nsignificantly enhance the capacity of the national airport system. The \nFAA, however, awarded the letter of intent to NWARA without having \ndefined what constitutes a significant capacity enhancement for small \nairports like NWARA. The agency also used a cost-benefit analysis to \njustify the letter of intent, analysis that was not redone even though \nit was not clear that certain assumptions the agency made would hold, \nsuch as the closing of Drake Field.\n  The sloppiness of the FAA's decisionmaking process on this project \nhas been disappointing, although legal. The GAO and other observers \nagree that it would be a waste of investments already made to withhold \nFederal funding now. NWARA has received about 40 percent of its total \n$70 million in grant funding, and construction of the airport is under \nway. The airport's runways will be completed by the end of 1997 and its \nterminal soon thereafter.\n  Nevertheless, the review of this project has been a valuable \nexercise. We must be certain that scarce Federal\n\n[[Page S5020]]\n\nresources are allocated to their highest and best uses. The FAA must be \nable to demonstrate compelling reasons for using subjective assessments \nto place projects on the priority list for Federal funding. The GAO \nwill soon report to the FAA on how it can tighten up its grant award \nprocess, and better adhere to the criteria that the agency has laid out \nfor itself. In the meantime, the Commerce Committee will continue to \noversee the FAA's management of its grant program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/22/senate-section/article/S5019-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OLDER AMERICANS MONTH\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, since 1963 when President Kennedy \nbegan this important tradition, May has been designated ``Older \nAmericans Month,'' a time set aside each year for our country to honor \nsenior citizens for their many accomplishments and contributions to our \nNation.\n  Those of us who have worked diligently in the U.S. Senate to ensure \nthat older Americans are able to live in dignity and independence \nduring their retirement years, look forward to this opportunity to \npause and reflect on the contributions of those individuals who have \nplayed such a major role in the shaping of our great Nation. We honor \nthem for their hard work and the countless sacrifices they have made \nthroughout their lifetimes, and look forward to their continued \ncontributions to our country's welfare.\n  Today's senior citizens have witnessed more technological advances \nthan any other generation in our Nation's history. Seniors today have \nlived through economic depressions and recessions, times of war and \npeace, and incredible advancements in the fields of science, medicine, \ntransportation and communications. It is imperative that we address the \nneeds of these Americans who have devoted so much of their life \nexperience and achievement to the betterment of our society. The \ncelebration of Older Americans Month provides us with the opportunity \nto highlight the importance of reauthorizing the Older Americans Act. \nAs a vigorous and consistent supporter of measures to benefit senior \ncitizens, I am pleased to be a past cosponsor and strong supporter of \nthis important legislation. First enacted in 1965, the Older Americans \nAct has evolved from its original mandate to promote independent living \namong those older citizens with the greatest social and economic need \ninto today's dynamic network of community and home-based services so \ncritical to many of our Nation's seniors.\n  The need for such legislation becomes especially apparent in light of \ncurrent demographic trends. Senior citizens today comprise more than 12 \npercent of the country's population. Baby boomers, who represented one-\nthird of all Americans in 1994, will enter the 65-years-and-older \ncategory over the next 13-34 years, substantially increasing this \nsegment of our population. In my own State of Maryland, more than \n768,400 individuals are over the age of 60, representing 15 percent of \nMaryland's total population. By the year 2020, that percentage is \nexpected to increase to just over 23 percent. These demographic \ntransformations pose significant challenges and opportunities and the \nOlder Americans Act provides an excellent framework from which to \naddress these challenges as we move into the next century. It is not \nenough to just honor our senior citizens. We must continue to enact \nmeaningful legislation which will help meet the needs of this valuable \nand constantly expanding segment of our society.\n  The theme of this year's celebration is ``Caregiving: Compassion in \nAction.'' In my view, it is most appropriate that--as the percentage of \nthe population over age 65 continues to grow--we take this opportunity \nto focus on how we, as a society, will care for our seniors. It is, \ntherefore, incumbent upon us all to be prepared to both understand and \naddress the needs of our seniors as they become an increasingly larger \nsegment of American society. Many of us are already addressing this \nserious need. The Administration on Aging estimates that each day, as \nmany as five million senior citizens in the United States are \nrecipients of care from more than 22 million informal caregivers. As \nprograms such as Medicare and Medicaid continue to feel the pressures \nof the current Federal budget process, the noble and compassionate work \nof these dedicated individuals is particularly critical.\n  Mr. President, I have always believed strongly in the potential of \nthis significant and growing population to contribute to the \ndevelopment of policies that effect all Americans. Our Nation's seniors \nare an ever-growing resource that deserves our attention, our \ngratitude, and our heart-felt respect. As observance of Older American \nMonth comes to a close, I look forward to working with my colleagues in \nthe Senate in implementing public policies which affirm the \ncontributions of older Americans to our society and ensure that they \ncontinue to thrive with dignity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/22/senate-section/article/S5020-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CONGRATULATIONS TO WHEAT MONTANA FARMS AND BAKERY ON MONTANA SMALL \n                          BUSINESS OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to extend my \ncongratulations to Dean Folkvord of Wheat Montana Farms and Bakery of \nThree Forks on winning the Small Business Person of the Year Award. It \nis a real pleasure to recognize Dean and his family for his dedication \nand hard work.\n  There is a fierce competition in Montana for Small Business Person of \nthe Year since 98 percent of our businesses are classified as small, \nand that makes Dean's accomplishments special. I was amazed when I \nlearned of it, but Wheat Montana mills more wheat in a year than is \ngrown in Montana. It takes a truly successful operation to handle that \nmuch wheat.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to say we have many small business success \nstories like Wheat Montana, and many folks like Dean keeping our \neconomy growing and putting Montanans to work. There were two close \nrunners-up for this award this year, and many other small businesses \nwere awarded in other categories. Together, they are the engine that \nkeeps Montana running.\n  Congratulations again to Dean Folkvord and the Wheat Montana family, \nand to Montana's entire small business community for all you \ndo.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/22/senate-section/article/S5020-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HONORING THE MANITOWOC WORLD WAR II SUBMARINE EFFORT\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, recently, the distinguished \nSenior Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl] and I, along with our \ncolleague from the House of Representatives, Representative Thomas \nPetri, wrote to the Secretary of the Navy, the Honorable John H. \nDalton, indicating our strong support for the proposal to name the \nthird Seawolf class submarine the Manitowoc, recognizing the unique \ncontribution by the city of Manitowoc, WI, to the development of U.S. \nsubmarine superiority in World War II.\n  The Manitowoc Shipbuilding Co. produced 28 submarines during World \nWar II--roughly ten percent of America's submarine fleet during that \nwar. The 25 Manitowoc-built submarines in the Pacific theater sank 132 \nenemy ships.\n  Prior to World War II, the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Co. had never \nproduced submarines. As America entered the war, and the Nation \ncommitted its resources and energies to the effort, this shipbuilding \ncompany took on the task of retooling, retraining its employees, and \nrestructuring its facilities to produce high-quality submarines at a \nwartime pace. They completed production of the submarines 19 months \nahead of schedule and $1.8 million under budget. In all, some 7,000 \npeople were employed at the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Co. at the height of \nWorld War II production, many working numerous nonstop shifts. Many \nalso came from other cities and towns and the Manitowoc community \nopened up its arms to support these workers, giving them a home-away \nfrom home, which helped to maintain the morale of these essential \nworkers in the war effort.\n  I am pleased to note that the Wisconsin State Senate has just passed \na measure urging the Navy to name the new submarine the Manitowoc. \nNaming the new sub the Manitowoc would honor those who served on the \nManitowoc-built subs, those individuals who worked 24 hours a day to \nbuild them, and the city which extended its support to the Herculean \nproduction effort. It would be a fitting tribute.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/22/senate-section/article/S5020-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5021]]\n               SAFETY AND HEALTH ADVANCEMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, as an original cosponsor of S. 765 I \nwant to stress the importance of this measure and urge my colleagues to \nsupport its passage.\n  Mr. President, the Safety and Health Advancement Act is based on one \nsimple premise: The Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n[OSHA] can be more effective at ensuring safe working environments by \nworking with businesses than by waiting for violations to occur and \nthen issuing fines. The purpose of this bill is to refocus OSHA's \nmission from enforcement to consultation, without putting a \nstraightjacket on its ability to enforce when required.\n  S. 765 takes a number of important steps to help small business \ncomply with OSHA standards. First, it establishes a third-party review \nprocess whereby a licensed auditor may consult with businesses and \ncertify that the are in compliance with applicable OSHA standards. If \ncertified, the business will be exempt for 2 years from any civil \npenalty prescribed by the OSH Act.\n  Second, S. 765 broadens the technical assistance program run by the \nStates and OSHA. Under this program, the Montana Safety Bureau, with \nassistance from OSHA, consults with businesses and helps them meet OSHA \nstandards. If in compliance, the business is exempt from general \ninspections for 2 years. This is a good program, but it is not widely \nused and it is underfunded, especially in Montana. S. 765 expands and \nmakes permanent this assistance program.\n  Third, this bill writes into law OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program \nand requires the Secretary of Labor to encourage small businesses to \nuse the program. If a business applies under the program and is \ncertified as safe, it is exempt from inspections and certain paperwork \nrequirements. Only 300 employers are currently in this program, but I \nknow of plenty of small businesses that would qualify.\n  Finally, this bill requires OSHA to submit all proposed standards to \nthe National Academy of Sciences for review and comments, and bars OSHA \nfrom using quotas for inspections, citations, or penalties.\n  Mr. President, I will soon be chairing a Small Business Committee \nfield hearing in Montana to hear from small businesses how Federal and \nState regulations adversely affect them. The loudest complaints I will \nhear will be about OSHA and its heavy-handed enforcement policies. As a \nformer small businessman, I know that working with small businesses to \nhelp them comply with OSHA standards will have better results than \nenforcement alone. By encouraging compliance, workplaces will be safer \nand workers will be better off.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/22/senate-section/article/S5021-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IN MEMORY OF ANDREW TEN\n\n Mrs BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today in memory of a \nremarkable young boy, and in tribute to his devoted family. Andrew Ten \nwas just 12 years old when he passed away this week from complications \nresulting from a chronic neurologic, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal \ncondition that left him physically handicapped for most of his short \nlife. His life-treatening diseases required constant home medical and \nnursing care, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\n  Andrew came to my attention through his father, Rabbi Harold Ten, \nwhose devotion to and love for his son was equaled only by his \nperserverence and tenacity in fighting the injustices of the health \ninsurance system millions of Americans must endure every day. I will \nnot delve into the details of young Andrew's case, but suffice it to \nsay that he and his family were the victims of a system that encourages \ncapriciously unilateral decisionmaking by the medical-industrial \ncomplex that fails to account for the real-life, human tragedies that \nfamilies confront every day.\n  It was another example of how the understandable drive to hold down \nhealth care costs and maximize the profits often forces insurance \ncarriers to make decisions that make no sense on a human level. It was \nan example of serious flaws and omissions in the laws protecting the \nconsumer from health care system abuses, something we must not forget.\n  It was also an example of how one person can wage a battle against \nthe inertia that often results in injustice. If it were not for the \nintervention of my office, after I had been contacted by Rabbi Ten, \nyoung Andrew would not have received the critical medical care he \nneeded. But, it should not have come to that. The law should have been \nenough to protect Andrew and his family.\n  That is a fight for another day. Today, I want to offer my \ncondolences to Rabbi Ten and his family on their loss. My heart goes \nout to them, who have fought so hard to prolong the life of their son \nand brother. I know that they will show the same courage and faith as \nthey mourn his death.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/22/senate-section/article/S5021-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   APPOINTMENTS BY THE VICE PRESIDENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
