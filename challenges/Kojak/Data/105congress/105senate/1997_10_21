ABRAHAM AKAKA, PASTOR EMERITUS, \n                            KAWAIAHAO CHURCH\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of the \nReverend Dr. Abraham Akaka, my brother Abe, who passed away last month. \nBrother Abe, as our family knew him, was ``kahu,'' meaning shepherd in \nHawaiian, to people of faith in Hawaii. For 28 years, he was pastor of \nKawaiahao Church, the Westminster Abbey of the Pacific, Christianity's \nmother church in Hawaii. A true man of God, he dedicated his life to \nserving our church and its congregation, while attending to the \nspiritual needs of our people and communities across our State, and \nNation. In a life marked by numerous achievements, honors, awards, and \ntitles, the appellation ``kahu'' best describes Brother Abe.\n  He was also a beloved husband and wonderful father to his five \nchildren, aided in his ministry by his wife Mary Lou Jeffrey Akaka. He \nwas a source of comfort and inspiration, a bulwark of strength, and \nfont of love for our family, and will be sorely missed.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a tribute I offered at my brother's \nmemorial service at Kawaiahoa Church be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nStatement of Tribute by Senator Daniel K. Akaka at the Funeral Service \nof the Reverend Dr. Abraham Kahikina Akaka, Kawaiahao Church, Saturday, \n                           September 20, 1997\n\n       Aloha ke Akua!\n       Mama Kahu, Mary Lou, Fenner, Pua, Sally, Sandy, Jeff--the \n     family of Abraham Akaka. Spiritual, Community, Governmental, \n     Business Leaders of Hawai`i, our sister States and the World; \n     and friends, all who were personally touched by the ministry \n     of this Man of God, Rev. Dr. Abraham Kahikina Akaka.\n       Aloha! I rise on behalf of my family, the descendants of \n     Simeon, Pulu and Kahikina Akaka to give honor and pay tribute \n     to brother Abe. He was truly a distinguished human being who \n     believed deeply in God, our Lord Jesus Christ and the \n     ``pono'' (making things right) as the destiny for mankind--\n     those with needs on every level of human existence. He was \n     the Kahu, the Shepherd to all people.\n       Words and time do not permit me to tell you of his untold \n     accomplishments. Brother\n\n[[Page S10868]]\n\n     was a mortal being like you and me and was gifted with many \n     Blessings from the Lord that determined his life and mission. \n     He was a channel to all for God's love. He was in the right \n     place at the proper time and had a manner that brought about \n     positive changes to personal lives and our diversified \n     communities. He was constantly working to prescribe \n     understandable goals, even through metaphors, that we might \n     be guided to assuring a productive, useful and positive \n     future for all rather than a future of futility and \n     obsolescence. He held high hopes for the people of Hawai`i, \n     the people of our country and the people of our world.\n       As you know, Abe was born in a family whose parents \n     nurtured their children in the Christian faith and lived by \n     the Christian faith. Ma and Pa began and ended each day with \n     a family devotion known as ohana. We thanked God at each meal \n     and had to be home to auau, take a bath, when the ice house \n     whistle blew at 5 p.m. and shortly after dinner we retired \n     for the night. School and church dominated our activities. \n     Sunday was devoted to Sunday school at 9 a.m.; service at \n     10:30 a.m. Pauoa Apana service at 2 p.m.; Christian Endeavor \n     at 6 p.m.; evening church service at 7:30 p.m.; we were back \n     home at 9 p.m. We attended Pauoa School, Kawananakoa School, \n     McKinley High School, University of Hawai`i during the week. \n     As the baby in our family, I was the only one that attended \n     the Kamehameha Schools and served in the U.S. Army during \n     World War II. Though our family was young and close-knit, \n     brother Abe was the one that worked at developing a \n     beautiful body and played the ``Tarzan'' role in the \n     trees. He even caught, from the circular saw, flying ice \n     flakes in his hands to eat like shaved ice. Brother John \n     tells me of Abe, at Akaka Lane, falling into the taro \n     patch on broken glass which cut his arm badly and caused \n     him to bleed profusely. Brother Johnny and sister Susan \n     called sister Phenbe for help because they didn't know \n     what to do. And sister Pheobe nursed Abe through this and \n     many other predicaments during his young life.\n       Since Pa and Ma led us, our family recited our memory bible \n     verses, sang hymns, usually recited the 23rd Psalm in \n     Hawaiian, kneeled and prayed and repeated the Lord's Prayer \n     in Hawaiian together, at each ohana. As a result, Abe became \n     a talented singer and musician, along with sister Annie and \n     brother John. Sisters Phoebe and Susan, brother Joe and I \n     trailed behind them. Such was our family life with Ma and Pa, \n     Tutu Kahoa of Pearl City and Tutu Akaka and Tutu Hiwauli of \n     Pauoa.\n       Following the Conference of World Christian Youth in \n     Amsterdam, Holland, in 1939, Abe made his decision to educate \n     himself to serve our Lord. How did brother affect people? How \n     did people perceive him? He saved lives by helping people \n     over crucial moments of despair and anxiety by spiritual \n     counseling and financial assistance. He was accessible to \n     help the needs of all--from CEOs to workers--from the rich to \n     the poor--from those in their twilight years to those in the \n     dawn of life. He was truly the Shepherd, a man of God; a \n     visionary (rebel); believed and lived God first, others \n     second, self last; related every utterance to God; extended \n     and lived the Love of God (Aloha ke Akua); was a profound and \n     deep thinker; extremely courteous, caring and generous; went \n     the extra mile; good listener; had a keen sense of \n     understanding situations; gave you 100% of his attention even \n     though he was running to another appointment; prolific \n     writer; expressive composer; a clarity man, made things \n     clear; man of ``pono''; good communicator through speaking, \n     chatting, writing, promptness in writing and sending \n     postcards; grateful man; man of creative expressions in \n     music, oratory, prayer; believed that something new should be \n     blessed and started right in God's hands; very humble man; \n     would not let grass ``grow under his feet''; he moved to \n     build bridges, bring harmony to people and functions and did \n     not let the future lead toward obsolescence.\n       Do you know that (to mention a few):\n       He was the State Senate Chaplain in 1959 for 2 years.\n       His Statehood address was disseminated all over the world.\n       He was a UH Regent, 1961-63.\n       The Saturday Evening Post wrote of him as the ``Hustling \n     Shepherd'', Aug. '62.\n       He received the NAACP Award, 1964 (Civil Rights).\n       He was Chair of the Hawaii Civil Rights Commission.\n       He conducted a Service of Thanksgiving for the safe return \n     of the Apollo 13 Astronauts at Kawaiahao Church with \n     President and Mrs. Nixon (Aug. 19, 1970).\n       Preached at the White House, April 19, 1970, by invitation \n     from President Nixon.\n       He was a notable composer--Kristo ka Pohaku Kihi, 1989, \n     Aloha Ke Akua, 1996, and others.\n       He was honored by being given the prestigious privilege of \n     delivering the Prayer in both the U.S. House and Senate. \n     Excerpts from the Congressional Record:\n\n             [Congressional Record--House, Sept. 14, 1977]\n\n               Prayer by Rev.

Mr. President, I ask the Senate to pause for \n     a moment and note a rare and inspiring event which has just \n     occurred when the prayer was read by the Reverend Akaka, \n     brother of Senator Akaka, now the Presiding Officer, and \n     a Member of the U.S. Senate from Hawaii.\n       The people of Hawaii and the Akaka family can take \n     justifiable pride in the service of two sons to the people of \n     their State in two different but honorable ways.\n       The Reverend Akaka serves the spiritual needs of the people \n     of Hawaii. Senator Akaka serves with great distinction the \n     material needs of the people of Hawaii.\n       We are honored to have Senator Akaka as a valued and \n     beloved Member of this body, and we are very pleased and \n     honored to welcome his brother today and thank him for his \n     very fine prayer.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n             The Reverend Dr. Abraham Akaka, Guest Chaplain\n\n       Mr. Akaka. Mr. President, I thank the leader for his \n     generous remarks, and I appreciate his remarks, because our \n     relationship in our family is very close.\n\n[[Page S10869]]\n\n       It is indeed a signal honor and a privilege for me to be \n     permitted by the U.S. Senate to convene this honorable body \n     today as its Acting President pro tempore, and a genuine \n     personal pleasure to introduce my brother, the Reverend Dr. \n     Abraham Akaka, to give the opening prayer.\n       Brother Abe, as our family knows him; or ``kahu,'' meaning \n     ``shepherd'' in Hawaiian, as many in our community in Hawaii \n     know him, was born in Honolulu 74 years ago. He began his \n     service to the Lord and our people after graduating from the \n     Chicago Theological Seminary of the University of Chicago, \n     with a bachelor of divinity degree.\n       He was the pastor of our Kawaiahao Church, the mother \n     church of Hawaii, for 28 years. With brotherly love and \n     family pride, I think I can fairly say that Brother Abe was \n     Kawaiahao Church, and Kawaiahao Church was Brother Abe. He \n     dedicated his life to serving our church and its parishioners \n     and the greater Hawaii, and forgive me for my brotherly \n     pride, but the church will not be the same again without him. \n     In 1964, he lobbied here in Washington, DC, for the Civil \n     Rights Act, was the first chairman of the civil rights \n     commission for the State of Hawaii, and sent leis that were \n     worn by Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King and his supporters in the \n     Selma, AL, march. He began to organize the Congress of \n     Hawaiian People, Friends of Kamehameha Schools, and Council \n     of Hawaiian Organizations. He served as regent of the \n     University of Hawaii.\n       Among the honors bestowed on my brother are honorary \n     doctoral degrees from the Chicago Theological Seminary of the \n     University of Chicago, the University of Hawaii, Illinois \n     Wesleyan University, the University of the Pacific in \n     Stockton, CA, and Salem College in West Virginia. He served \n     as the chaplain in our territorial senate, and subsequently, \n     our State senate. He gave our statehood sermon on May 13, \n     1959, and inspired our Hawaii State Legislature to name our \n     State, ``the Aloha State.'' Following Henry J. Kaiser, he \n     received the Hawaii Salesman of the Year in 1952.\n       Brother Abe has been most ably assisted in his calling by \n     his bride of 47 years, Mary Louise Jeffrey Akaka. They share \n     their love with five children and seven grandchildren.\n       In retirement, Kahu continues to serve through the Akaka \n     Foundation.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n Letter of Condolence From President and Mrs. Clinton to Mrs. Abraham \n                                 Akaka\n\n       Dear Mrs. Akaka: Hillary and I were saddened to learn of \n     your husband's death, and we extend our deepest sympathy. We \n     hope that the love and support of your family and friends \n     will sustain and comfort you during this difficult time. You \n     are in our thoughts and prayers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n       We weep with sorrow because he will no longer talk, walk, \n     eat and play with us. We rejoice knowing that he is with God, \n     with Ma, with Pa, and with members of our family in that \n     Beautiful City of God in heaven--pearls, goldlined streets, \n     river of life.

Mr. President, I rise today to address the disturbing \nprospect that President Clinton will make the necessary certification \nto Congress that would permit so-called nuclear cooperation between the \nUnited States and China. I really believe we should be honest with each \nother. This is a political decision, driven by the United States-China \nOctober summit rather than the facts of China's weapons proliferation \nrecord.\n  The prospect of nuclear cooperation with China is perhaps the \nclearest illustration yet of the trust but don't verify approach behind \nthe administration's China policy. The administration does not want \nChinese President Jiang Zemin to return to Beijing emptyhanded. But I \nquestion the need to make concessions to China in the first place.\n  China has a weapons proliferation record that is unrivaled in the \nworld. Chinese trade barriers continue to block U.S. goods and \ncompanies. In the last several years, Beijing has had a human rights \nrecord that has resulted in the most intense religious persecution in \nseveral decades, and of course it has also resulted in the silencing of \nall political dissidents in China, according to our State Department \nreports.\n  In spite of such behavior, nuclear cooperation with China could \nbecome a reality. Beijing has made a host of nonproliferation promises \nto acquire United States nuclear technology, and the administration is \napplauding China's efforts. Sadly, China's promises of all new export \ncontrols and assurance that no nuclear technology will be sent to \nunsafeguarded nuclear facilities will do little to stem China's \nproliferation activity.\n  China has made and broken nuclear nonproliferation commitments for \nover a decade, and they have broken them with great regularity. Little \nconfidence can be placed in China's new nonproliferation promises until \nBeijing backs up such commitments with action. Disregarding the issue \nof whether or not China can be trusted, each of China's \nnonproliferation commitments is deficient in important areas.\n  China's new export controls are untested, and will be administered by \nagencies with close ties to the China National Nuclear Corporation--\nthat is the organization which has helped Iran prospect for uranium and \nthat is the organization which transferred ring magnets used for \nuranium enrichment to an unsafeguarded nuclear facility in Pakistan. So \nwe are alleging that we are going to have nonproliferation. Then we are \ngoing to put it in the hands of the organization which has been a \nmassive proliferator of nuclear weapons technology and capacity.\n  The ring magnet transfer was in apparent violation of United States \nlaw, although the Clinton administration did not impose sanctions as a \nviolation of China's commitments--so we had a violation of our law--it \nwas a violation of China's commitments under the Nuclear Non-\nproliferation Treaty and our administration refused to impose \nsanctions. I just don't think we can continue to turn our head away \nfrom the violations and then turn our head toward this country and say, \nwell, in spite of all that we'll wink and establish a new level of \ncooperation.\n  With regard to China, China has had great cooperation with Iran on \nnuclear issues. The administration is allowing China to use nuclear \nblackmail to obtain United States nuclear technology as it relates to \nIran. China will consider forswearing new nuclear cooperation, it says, \nwith Iran, such as the sale of a nuclear reactor and a plant for \nuranium conversion, if the administration will allow United States-\nChina nuclear cooperation to proceed. They are threatening to \nproliferate more nuclear weapons and proliferate more nuclear \ntechnology if we don't give them additional nuclear information and \nadditional nuclear technology with which they could violate agreements \nlike they have regularly. China's pledge to join the Zangger committee \nsays more about what China is unwilling to do rather than signaling a \nnew commitment to nonproliferation. China has joined the Zangger \ncommittee and not the Nuclear Suppliers Group because Zangger members \ncan continue to export nuclear technology to countries which keep some \nnuclear facilities\n\n[[Page S10870]]\n\nfrom international inspection. If they were to pledge to join the \nNuclear Suppliers Group that would be a different thing. But the \nZangger committee has the loophole necessary to proliferate nuclear \ntechnology with the potential of nuclear weaponry to places that don't \nhave international inspection. China is the only nuclear weapons power \nin the world that has not joined the Nuclear Suppliers Group and they \nremain unwilling to do so.\n  The national security arguments for United States-China nuclear \ncooperation are far from compelling, and the economic rationale is \nexaggerated. As the Washington Post notes this morning, United States \nbig business is lobbying hard for nuclear cooperation with China in \nhopes that this market will boost exports.\n  I want United States businesses to benefit from possible export \nmarkets, but China is seeking nuclear cooperation with the United \nStates to increase the number of bidders for and to lower the price of \nChinese power projects. Once China obtains nuclear technology, they \nwill reverse engineer our products and they will start building those \nproducts themselves and be our competitors in other export markets.\n  As Dan Horner of the Nuclear Control Institute notes in the Post \narticle this morning, China is only seeking enough technology to \ndevelop a domestic production capability.\n  The United States should not enter into nuclear cooperation with \nChina until real and observable progress is made in China's \nnonproliferation record. Before we send our nuclear technology to \nChina, Beijing should cut off all nuclear cooperation with terrorist \nstates, such as Iran. Before we send our nuclear technology to China, \nBeijing should maintain at least for 1 year an exemplary \nnonproliferation record for all weapons-of-mass-destruction technology, \nincluding technologies other than nuclear--chemical technologies and \nbiological technologies.\n  The threat of weapons of mass destruction has become a broader issue \nthan that of nuclear-proliferation technology alone. Chemical weapons, \nbiological weapons and the missile systems to deliver those weapons are \nall part of the weapons-of-mass-destruction threat. China's \nimprovements in nuclear nonproliferation are questionable at best, but \neven the administration can't defend China's broader weapons-of-mass-\ndestruction nonproliferation record.\n  Even though the administration argues that China has honored its May \n1996 pledge not to transfer nuclear material to unsafeguarded nuclear \nfacilities, doubts persist about China's recent nuclear-proliferation \nactivity. A June 1997 CIA report released this year states that:\n\n       During the last half of 1996--\n\n  After its assurances of May 1996--\n\n       During the last half of 1996, China was the most \n     significant supplier of [weapons of mass-destruction]-related \n     goods and technology to foreign countries. The Chinese \n     provided a tremendous variety of assistance to both Iran's \n     and Pakistan's ballistic-missile programs. China was also the \n     primary source of nuclear-related equipment and technology to \n     Pakistan, and a key supplier to Iran during this reporting \n     period.\n\n  Clearly, the Chinese record does not develop a sense of confidence in \nthose who observe her objectively, and it certainly does not justify a \nbill of good health that nuclear cooperation would signify.\n  Therefore, I hope the President does not accord to China a standing \nit does not deserve in a way that would jeopardize our capacity to \nrestrain the proliferation of nuclear technology.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today on a very, very important \nmission, and that is to highlight the important work of the March of \nDimes and its over 3 million dedicated volunteers across America. I \nthank and congratulate them on the most worthwhile of endeavors.\n  During the month of October, the March of Dimes Birth Defects \nFoundation is celebrating Campaign for Healthier Babies Month by \nstepping up its efforts to reach more women of childbearing age with \nvaluable information which will give every baby a better chance of \nbeing born healthy.\n  These efforts are critical to prevent birth defects, low birthweight \nand prematurity, which are the leading causes of infant death and \nmorbidity and also a tremendous cause of heartbreak and tragedy for so \nmany families in the United States today.\n  As all of us know, the March of Dimes is a national voluntary health \nagency whose mission is to improve the health of babies by preventing \nbirth defects and infant mortality. Through its campaign for healthier \nbabies, the March of Dimes funds programs of research, community \nservices, education and advocacy. To enhance these efforts, the \nfoundation has started the March of Dimes Resource Center.\n  The resource center provides accurate up-to-date information and \nreferral services to the public. It consistently offers high-quality, \nreliable, and prompt responses. It is staffed by highly trained \nprofessionals. The March of Dimes helps people one on one to address \npersonal and complex problems relating to maternal and child health. \nThe center provides information on numerous topics in which the March \nof Dimes has been in the forefront, such as the dangers of drug and \nalcohol use and other hazards during pregnancy. And most important, it \nis promoting the use of folic acid by women of childbearing age.\n  We know now that 400 micrograms of vitamin B folic acid taken \nregularly by women of childbearing age before they become pregnant can \nreduce by one-half, or even 70 percent, the incidence of neural tube \ndefects in babies born in America today. I don't know how many of my \ncolleagues know of a family that has been afflicted with the loss of a \nchild who was born with a severe and fatal neural tube defect. Many of \nus know good friends who were born with spina bifida and other problems \nwhich could be substantially reduced if women of childbearing age \nregularly take 400 micrograms of vitamin B folic acid every day.\n  The March of Dimes professionals and the resource center answer \nquestions from parents, health providers, students, librarians, \nGovernment agencies, health departments, social workers--people from \nall walks of life. The good people at the March of Dimes estimate that \nthrough the resource center, they will provide information to almost \nhalf a million individuals in the first year alone.\n  The center is a state-of-the-art facility which can be contacted by \npeople around the world through both a toll free number and e-mail. \nMarch of Dimes is shortened to MODIMES, M-O-D-I-M-E-S. MODIMES. The \ntoll free number is 1-888-MODIMES, or by e-mail, the Web site is \nwww.modimes.org. I urge people to take advantage of the toll free \nnumber or the Web site.\n  I congratulate the March of Dimes on the success of the resource \ncenter, and I thank them for the years of dedicated work to prevent \nbirth defects and to reduce infant mortality.\n  Mr. President, we rank far too high in infant mortality in this \ncountry. Many, many countries do better than we do because we don't \nprovide the care and the attention that expectant mothers need.\n  Many of my colleagues in this body know that I have been a long-time \nsupporter of a particular priority, the March of Dimes and the Birth \nDefects Prevention Act I first introduced in 1992. It has been passed \ntime and time again by the Senate. In June of this year, this vital \npiece of legislation passed the Senate by a unanimous vote. A House \ncompanion bill currently has over 130 cosponsors. Both bills have \nstrong bipartisan support in our body, the majority leader and the \nminority leader both, along with most of the people on all the relevant \ncommittees.\n\n[[Page S10871]]\n\nThe groups endorsing this include the March of Dimes Birth Defects \nFoundation, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National \nAssociation of Children's Hospitals, the American Hospital Association, \nthe National Easter Seals Society, the Spina Bifida Association of \nAmerica, and numerous others.\n  I urge all of my colleagues and people who may be listening around \nthe country to urge the House to take up this important legislation and \npass it this year. As we get to the end of a particular year's session, \nthere are always so many things, so many other bills that people think \nare priorities. Let me ask anybody to name me a priority that would be \nhigher than helping the families of America of each of our States avoid \nthe tragedy of the loss of an infant through birth defects or the \npermanent disability of a child born with birth defects.\n  America's families and all of us have waited too long for this \nmeasure because it can go a long way in preventing birth defects, which \nis the leading cause of infant death. Quite simply, a little prevention \ngoes a long way in avoiding family pain and heartache. It is up to \nCongress, it is up to us to seize this excellent opportunity to protect \nour most valuable resources--our children. I urge all of my colleagues \nto pay attention and to take an interest in this vital matter.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/21/senate-section/article/S10870-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this week, representatives from over 160 \nnations are meeting in Bonn, Germany, for the final negotiating session \nprior to the climate change conference scheduled in Kyoto in December. \nIt is a critical meeting, the culmination of several years of \ninternational cooperation on this extraordinarily important global \nissue.\n  Over the past several months I have had an opportunity to discuss \nglobal warming with scientists and representatives from the United \nStates and abroad and, indeed, we have had one brief discussion on the \nSenate floor in the context of the Byrd-Hagel amendment.\n  Last week, I met in London with a number of officials of the \nGovernment of Great Britain, but most importantly on this subject with \nForeign Minister Robin Cook, to discuss our mutual concerns about the \nclimate change problem and how best to address this issue from a global \nperspective. As our U.S. negotiators continue their work in Bonn and \nthe President finalizes the U.S. position for the Kyoto conference, I \nwanted to share with my colleagues some views on the science of global \nwarming, on the international process, the U.S. role, and the next \nsteps that the United States and others should undertake to address \nthis issue in a responsible manner.\n  Last July, I joined with Senator Byrd and others in the Chamber to \ndiscuss global warming and to debate Senate Resolution 98 which \naddressed some of the Senate position on the Kyoto treaty. The Byrd-\nHagel resolution called for the United States to support binding \ncommitments to reduce greenhouse gases only if: One, all nations, \ndeveloped and developing, participate in addressing this global \nproblem; and two, if the commitment did not adversely impact the U.S. \neconomy. In addition, the resolution created a bipartisan Senate \nobserver group of which I am pleased to be a member. Our task is to \ncontinue to monitor this process.\n  I supported the Byrd-Hagel resolution, Mr. President, which passed \nthe Senate 95-0 after we worked out in colloquy some of the \ninterpretations of definitions contained therein. I supported it \nbecause I believe that there has to be a universal effort to tackle \nthis ever-growing problem, and that the United States, while taking a \nlead role, need not jeopardize its economic viability in order to meet \nour international obligations.\n  The resolution language, in my judgment, provides enough flexibility \nto address the concerns of growing economies of the developing world \neven as we encourage them to join in this global effort.\n  The resolution was silent, however, as to the science of global \nwarming. It addressed only the U.S. role in the Kyoto negotiations. \nDuring the debate over the resolution, there was some discussion by a \nfew Senators over their interpretation individually of the science. But \nthere was no broad debate about the science, and there was certainly in \nthe resolution no judgment by the U.S. Senate whatsoever as to the \nfoundations of science which might or might not be applied to the \nnegotiations in Kyoto. From the statements in the Record by the \nresolution's chief sponsor, Senator Byrd, it is clear that he agrees, \nas I and others do, that the prospect of human-induced global warming \nas an accepted thesis is beyond debate, and that there are many adverse \nimpacts that can be anticipated as a consequence of those theories in \nfact being found to be true. We are joined by many of our colleagues in \nthinking that there is sufficient scientific consensus that human \nactivities are exacerbating climate changes.\n  The vast majority of scientists and policymakers who have examined \nthis issue carefully have concluded that the science is sound and that \nit is time to take additional steps through the established \ninternational theory to address this issue in a more systematic way. A \nsmall but extremely vociferous minority continue to assert that the \nscience is not yet convincing. They advocate a wait-and-see approach. \nThey believe that continued review and inaction is best for the U.S. \neconomy and for Americans in general.\n  Given the money that the very vociferous minority has been expending \nin trying to promote their view, and given the fact that shortly we \nwill be engaged in some discussions based on the factual foundations of \nthis issue, I would like to address the issue of science for a few \nmoments on the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, the vast majority of the scientific community--the \nvast majority of those who have taken time to make a dispassionate, \napolitical, nonideological determination based on lifetimes of work, \nand certainly on a lifetime-acquired discipline in their particular \nareas--the vast majority of consensus of those who have been so engaged \nis that the science regarding global warming is compelling and that to \ndo nothing would be the most dangerous of all options.\n  In the late 1980's, a number of our Senate colleagues--among them \nVice President Gore, State Department Counselor Tim Wirth, Senators \nJohn Heinz and Fritz Hollings--and I, and a few others became \nincreasingly concerned about the potential threat of global warming. It \nwas at that time that I joined as an original cosponsor of Senator \nHollings' bill, the National Global Change Research Act, which \nattracted support from many Members still serving in this body, \nincluding Senators Stevens, McCain, Cochran, Inouye, and Gorton. After \nnumerous hearings and roundtable discussions, this legislation to \ncreate the global change research program at the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration became law in 1990.\n  As a Senator from a coastal State I take very seriously parochial \nimplications of global warming. As a United States Senator and a member \nof the Foreign Relations Committee, I am also concerned about the \ncrafting of a workable international response that treats all parties--\nincluding the United States --fairly.\n\n[[Page S10872]]\n\n  I have stated that I would be happy to engage any of my colleagues in \nthe debate on the science of climate change here on the Senate floor, \nor elsewhere. And I have sought on numerous occasions--as yet not \nsuccessfully--to try to get an adequate airing of the science within \nthe Senate observer group. And it is my hope that, before that group \nreports to the Senate, a broad-based review of the science will be \nundertaken in a bipartisan, nonpolitical way.\n  But, Mr. President, before we even proceed further with \nthat analysis, I want to take this opportunity to at least lay out some \nprecursor truths with respect to the science as we know it.\n\n  Whether by nature or experience, we know that scientists are a \nfundamentally cautious group of people. That is why I find it \nparticularly compelling that over 2,000 scientists who participated in \nthe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change--the most comprehensive \nand thoroughly reviewed assessment of any environmental problem ever \nundertaken--concluded that global climate change is currently under \nway. The 1995 IPCC report concludes that the Earth has already warmed \nabout 1 degree Fahrenheit over the last century, and that ``the balance \nof evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on \nglobal climate.'' The IPCC estimates that the global surface air \ntemperature will increase another 2 to 6.5 degrees Fahrenheit in the \nnext century. Their ``best guess'' is that we will experience warming \nof about 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2100. That would be a \nfaster rate of climate change than any experienced during the last \n10,000 years of the history of this planet. And we have to recognize \nthat the human history as we have recorded it and, therefore, \nunderstand its impact on ourselves and current human endeavor is within \na span of about 8,000 years.\n  The conclusion that the observed warming trend is not simply a \nnatural fluctuation is affirmed by the research of several \ninstitutions. Basing their conclusions on climate model calculations, \nscientists at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, \nGermany, concluded that the warming of the Earth over the past 30 years \ngoes far beyond natural variations. Indeed, there is a judgment that \nthere is only a 1-in-40 chance of that variation being natural. So we \nare dealing with a 1-in-40 prospect in terms of odds.\n  The United States and other governments have been collecting at \nground-based and ocean-based sites global surface temperature \nmeasurements since the year 1880. Remarkably the 11 warmest years this \ncentury have all occurred since 1980, with 1995 the warmest on record.\n  Some will argue that there are discrepancies between our long-term \nsurface record and recent satellite observations. But that fact--by \nagain nonideological dispassionate and nonpolitical scientists--has \nbeen determined to be not surprising at all because the two \ntechniques--measurement at the surface and measurement by satellite--\nare entirely different. They measure temperature at different parts of \nthe Earth's system--the surface and various layers of the atmosphere. \nIn addition, other factors, such as the presence of airborne materials \nfrom the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo volcano, affect each record in a \nvery different way.\n  The natural ``greenhouse effect'' has made life on Earth possible. \nWithout it, our planet would be about 60 degrees colder. Water vapor, \ncarbon dioxide, and other trace gases, such as methane and nitrous \noxide, trap the solar heat, and they slow the loss of that solar heat \nby the reradiation back into space. That is a natural process.\n  But with industrialization and with population growth, greenhouse gas \nemissions from human activities have consistently increased. \nAnthropogenic climate changes, most importantly the burning of fossil \nfuels--coal, oil, and natural gas--and deforestation, have tipped the \nvery delicate balance of nature. We all know that the forests of the \nplanet play a critical role in the recycling of carbon dioxide. The \nforests in the Amazon, all through Central and Latin America, and all \nthrough Asia have been disappearing in entirely measurable and \ndiscernible ways. As we have seen by satellite photography over the \nlast 15 or 20 years, all of the areas of the Earth's green are \nbeginning to shrink in those satellite photographs; we understand that \nwe are diminishing our capacity to do the recycling of the \nCO2.\n  Therefore, more gas is trapped. More gases have the impact of \ndiminishing the amount of reradiation that takes place. This natural \nclimate variability alone, including the effect of volcanic eruptions \nand solar variability--that is, sunspot activity--would not have \nchanged carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. However, the manmade \naddition, presently about 3 percent of annual natural emissions, is \nsufficient to exceed what is known to be the balancing effects of \n``carbon sinks.'' As a result, carbon dioxide is gradually accumulated \nin the atmosphere, until, at present, its concentration is 30 percent \nabove preindustrial levels. Existing data of other greenhouse gases \nshow increasing concentrations of methane, nitrous oxide, and \nchlorofluorocarbons over recent decades. While ice core data show that \nconcentrations of methane and nitrous oxide have increased in the past \nfew centuries, after having been relatively constant for thousands of \nyears, chlorofluorocarbons are absent from deep-ice cores because they \nhave no natural sources and were not manufactured before 1930.\n\n  So I want to emphasize for those who try to doubt the science, for \nthose who come and say there is no indicator of this change and that we \nhave only been recording the temperature since 1880, the fact is that \nboth in the Arctic and the Antarctic we have accumulations of thousands \nof years--tens of thousands of years--of ice. And we have to be able to \nbore down into that ice. In the bores that we bring out--just as we \nhave tested and found geological formations which have allowed us to \ndrill for gas--we have been able to come up with ice cores. And as the \nscientists look at those ice cores, they have been able to measure the \ndegree of carbon dioxide that was trapped in those ice cores. By \nmeasuring that, and, indeed, by measuring the absence of \nchlorofluorocarbons, we have been able to trace thousands of years of \nclimatic activity and change that we otherwise would not have knowledge \nof.\n  That is what has given us this capacity to make a determination about \nthe rapidity with which changes are taking place today relative to what \nwe knew or can discern was taking place thousands of years ago.\n  While we have no control over sun spots or volcanoes, we, obviously, \ncan control human activities.\n  Then the question will be, ``Well, why should we do that? What is the \nshowing that somehow this really represents a danger sufficient to \nrequire a response from Government?'' Well, the essential issue here, \nMr. President, is one of compounding emissions over time. We know that \nthe emissions we put into the atmosphere today have a life that goes on \nand on and on. It is like nuclear material that has a half-life. So \ndoes this material have a half-life. And the fact is that, even if we \nwere to stop our activity today, what is already in the atmosphere will \ncontinue to do the damage that it does. And the models have to measure \nthe rate at which we might be able to reduce today in order to \nguarantee that you have turned off the spigot sufficiently to be able \nto control what will happen in the future. But anyone who follows the \nstock market or even your back account, obviously, understands the \nmiracle of compounded interest. It means that a small amount set aside \nbecomes a big amount over time.\n  That is what is happening to the Earth's accumulation of greenhouse \ngases. Many of these gases reside in the atmosphere for years to come--\nhundreds to thousands of years. Even constant emissions of the gases \ncan cause atmospheric concentrations to build up rapidly.\n  So, unlike the stock market, when it comes to emissions, the small \namounts don't necessarily bring a miracle. But they could bring \nenormous calamities.\n  So why would we care if the Earth warms a few degrees? I have \nactually heard people say it really doesn't matter that much if all of \na sudden North Dakota or South Dakota became a little more attractive, \nand they don't have as long a winter, or somehow you have a longer \nhiking season in a particular State. Well, Mr. President, it isn't that \nsimple. It just isn't reduced to that kind of simplistic judgment about \nthe overall impacts.\n\n[[Page S10873]]\n\n  The IPCC scientific assessment of climate change estimated that the \naverage surface temperature will increase by 1 to 3.5 degrees with an \nassociated rise in sea level of 6 to 37 inches. These changes are \nprojected to lead to a number of potentially serious consequences with \nincidence of heat waves, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and other \nextreme events affecting human health and natural ecosystems.\n  Americans will experience more health problems and there will be an \nincrease in health-induced deaths from future warming. Heat waves of \nthe type in the 1995 Chicago heat wave which killed 465 people will \noccur more frequently, and increased warming will exacerbate existing \nair quality problems such as smog that aggravate asthma and allergic \ndisorders, especially in children and the elderly. Warmer climates \nbreed diseases such as malaria, dengue and yellow fevers, encephalitis, \nand cholera due to the expansive range of mosquitoes as a consequence \nof increased warmer climates and other disease-carrying organisms.\n  One key aspect of climate change that is important to remember is the \nslow capacity of any corrective action to have an impact. Harvard \nprofessor and member of the President's Committee of Advisors on \nScience and Technology, Dr. John Holdren, shared his analogy at the \nWhite House Round Table on Climate Change. He said:\n\n       The world's energy-economic system is a lot like a \n     supertanker, very hard to steer and with very bad brakes * * \n     * and we know from the science that the supertanker is \n     heading for a reef * * * it's a bad idea to keep on a course \n     of full speed ahead.\n\n  The oceans are going to continue to expand for several centuries even \nafter the temperatures stabilize. We are currently dealing with rising \nsea levels that are already eroding beaches and wetlands, inundating \nlow-lying areas and increasing the vulnerability of coastal areas to \nflooding from storm surges and intense rainfall.\n  We know how costly droughts, flood control, and erosion mitigation \nefforts can be to the taxpayers. We constantly, every year, are facing \nrequests from one community or another to do a beach-erosion project or \nto undertake some kind of erosion mitigation, and we spend literally \nmillions of dollars in insurance as a consequence of those anticipated \nproblems already.\n  Damages from the southern plains drought of 1996 were estimated at $4 \nbillion; the 1993 Mississippi River flood damages were $10 billion to \n$20 billion; the Pacific Northwest floods of the winter of 1996-97 were \n$3 billion; the 1997 Ohio River flood was nearly $1 billion; and the \n1997 river flood in the Northern Plains was another $2 billion. And \nthis is just the impact of the changes perceived in the United States \nin the last few years.\n  Scientists have not definitively said that any one of these events I \njust listed is absolutely tied to global warming. And I am not going to \nsuggest that that is in fact true if they are not willing to suggest \nthat that there is that linkage. But the scientists have issued a \nwarning. The scientists have issued a warning--not the politicians, the \nscientists. And their warning is that these disasters collectively show \nprecisely what we are likely to see if we do not reverse the current \ntrend lines of global warming. And we will see them with greater \nfrequency, with more destruction under global warming.\n  The areas of greatest vulnerability are those where quality and \nquantity of water are already problems such as the arid and semiarid \nregions in the United States and the world. If warming trends were to \ncontinue, then water scarcity in the Middle East and Africa will become \neven more pronounced, exacerbating tensions among countries that depend \non water supplies that originate outside of their borders.\n  Another key area of concern will be the dramatic alteration of \ngeographic distributions of vegetation. The composition of one-third of \nthe Earth's forests would undergo major changes as a result of a \ndoubling of preindustrial carbon dioxide levels. Over the next 100 \nyears, the range of some North American forest species will shift by as \nmuch as 300 miles to the north, far faster than the forests can migrate \nnaturally. For example, in my region of the country, New England, we \ncould lose the most economically important species, the sugar maple.\n\n  Other areas of the country would be hit economically as well. The \ntourism industry, for instance, surrounding the Glacier National Park \ncould literally evaporate along with glaciers which we already know \nhave receded steadily for decades. Since the park's founding, over 70 \npercent of the glaciers have already melted. Model projections indicate \nthat all of the park's glaciers will disappear by the year 2030 unless \ntemperatures begin to cool. One-third to one-half of the world's \nmountain glacier mass could disappear by the year 2100, thus \neliminating a natural reservoir of water for many areas.\n  Let me give an example. In Lima, Peru, the entire water supply for 10 \nmillion people depends on the annual summer melt from a glacier that is \nnow in rapid retreat. These are just some of the predictions, \npredictions made by scientists, predictions made by various models \nwhere they have taken the data which scientists have agreed on--not \nspeculated about, but agreed on.\n  The facts about global warming are beyond reasonable scientific \ndoubt, and they ought to be beyond reasonable policymaking doubt.\n  Mr. John Browne, CEO of British Petroleum, in a recent speech at \nStanford University said:\n\n       The time to consider the policy dimensions of climate \n     change is not when the link between greenhouse gases and \n     climate change is conclusively proven but when the \n     possibility cannot be discounted and is taken seriously by \n     the society of which we are part. We in BP have reached that \n     point.\n\n  That is the CEO of British Petroleum saying that they have reached \nthe point of concluding that linkage exists.\n  Efforts to rein in and reduce manmade contributions of such emissions \nare now warranted. Worst case scenarios under current business-as-usual \npractices are catastrophic.\n  So let me turn for a moment to the international efforts and the role \nof the United States at this point.\n  In 1992, it was precisely because of those scientific conclusions \nthat I have just enumerated that President Bush at the Earth Summit in \nRio signed a climate-change agreement, and it was ratified later that \nyear by the Senate. That agreement pledged that nations would reduce \ntheir gas emissions to their 1990 levels by the year 2000. Regrettably, \nthe vast majority of nations, including the United States, have failed \nto achieve this goal. Today, the United States has increased emissions \nabout 8 percent above 1990 levels. Much of that increase has been tied \nto our economic expansion.\n  However, it should also be noted that industry during this remarkable \ngrowth period was also engaged in a voluntary program to reduce \nemissions. While not achieving its objective completely, the voluntary \neffort did meet 70 percent of the original targets at a time when the \nAmerican economy grew and wherein the American jobs machine was rolling \nalong at as high a rate as we have seen in recent years. The relative \nsuccess of voluntary industry effort ought to encourage confidence that \nmore comprehensive efforts under a global regime can result in greater \nprogress at far less cost than Cassandras allowed for.\n  However, the question is now for all countries, developed and \ndeveloping, to step forward to support binding commitments to reach an \nacceptable level of human-induced emissions. That is why the United \nStates is engaged in negotiating a legally binding climate-change \nagreement to be finalized in Kyoto this December.\n  Our challenge is to shape an agreement which sets tough, realistic \nglobal emission standards and goals while harnessing the market forces \nto lower costs, foster technological development, and ensure economic \ngrowth.\n  The climate change problem is global. It requires a solution, \nobviously, that includes a global response--participation from all \nnations, industrialized countries and those countries in the developing \nworld. The best approach is to establish a global economic incentive \nprogram in which the free market and not Government intervention is \ndriving the reductions.\n\n  The goal of universal participation via an international treaty with \nbinding commitments ought to be undertaken now, not with delay, not \nwith an effort to try to have subterfuge diminish what we can \naccomplish in Kyoto. The United States, with 22 percent of global \nemissions, is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases. And \ntoday\n\n[[Page S10874]]\n\nthe industrial world comprises nearly three-quarters of all of the \nglobal emissions. But that does not mean that we are the only ones who \nshould deal with this problem. The reason for that is clear. China is \ncurrently the world's second largest emitter, and it is expected to \ndisplace the United States as the largest emitter by the year 2015. \nOver the next few decades, 90 percent of the world's population growth \nwill take place in the developing world. Given the projected economic \nand population growth statistics of China and other quickly developing \ncountries such as India, Mexico and Brazil, the developing world will \nexceed the industrialized world in emissions by the year 2035.\n  Universal participation, therefore, does not mean we have to all \nbegin at the same time. It does not mean you have to embrace the exact \nsame commitment at the exact same implementation moment. Clearly, if \none country is doing more than another, there is room for us to be able \nto negotiate an agreement where we all meet at the appropriate point. \nBut it does mean that it is quite reasonable for the industrialized \nnations, those nations that have put most of the greenhouse pollution \ninto the atmosphere, initially to take the lead, as long as in so doing \nthey do not simply fall into a trap of disadvantaging themselves \neconomically. A scenario where the industrialized world acts alone will \nnot be enough to prevent the costly implications of global warming in \nthe future.\n  I want to emphasize that. The developing nations cannot go to Kyoto \nand suggest that it is up to the developed world simply to bear the \nburden of reductions, because even if we reduce to the greatest degree \npossible, we cannot alone avert the problems that will come from global \nwarming. It is absolutely essential that China, India, Brazil, Mexico, \nand other countries join in the effort with an understanding that we \nare moving down this road together.\n  Currently, many of these developing nations are not inclined to join \nin an international treaty. Some believe it is not in their immediate \neconomic interests to do so. Others believe that as long as the biggest \ncontributors to the problem, the industrialized nations, are not taking \nsufficient effective steps to cut back on greenhouse pollution, it is \nnot in the interest of their nations to do so either. One could well \nunderstand how they would make that kind of determination. Some of them \ncite the language of the 1995 ``Berlin Mandate,'' calling on the Annex \nI countries, the developed countries, to be the ones to complete a \ntreaty with binding commitments by December 1997 but to leave excluded \nthe developing world from an established binding reduction target.\n  Let me say that in my reading of the ``Berlin Mandate,'' I do not \nbelieve that we are precluded from proceeding to Kyoto in an effort to \ncome up with a two-stage arrangement which would have the developed \ncountries enter into an agreement while simultaneously bringing the \ndeveloped countries along. I don't believe it is in any nation's \ninterest to thwart international efforts to reduce greenhouse gases in \nas expeditious and as economically feasible a manner as possible. The \nremaining option is the option of doing nothing, and nothing would, in \nmost people's judgment, be ultimate mutual devastation.\n\n  The only viable solution is a global treaty which provides economic \nincentives for all nations. I believe such a treaty can be crafted, one \nthat would include all nations but permit flexibility in the targets \nand flexibility in the timing of compliance for developing nations, \nwhile at the same time requiring all countries to agree to make legally \nbinding commitments by a date certain. If the United States signs such \na treaty, it would be reasonable for the President to refrain from \ntransmitting that treaty to the Senate until the developing world signs \nits binding commitments. In that way we can make Kyoto a success, \ncoming up with the binding agreements necessary but still maintain and \nkeep good faith with the approach we have thus far deemed to be the \nroadmap to the achievement of this treaty.\n  In this Chamber I previously shared my concerns with a component of \nthe European proposal as it currently stands. The Europeans continue to \nargue for a treaty that would enable the European Union to secure an \nexclusive bubble emissions policy. This is tantamount to a regional \nemissions trading program. They want Europe to be contained under one \nbubble, whereby they can trade their emissions within the European \nbubble, a license, in effect, to increase emissions in some European \ncountries by relying on the trendline decreases that are already in \nplace in others. Such a posture is helpful only to the European Union. \nIt fails to address the essential need to engage those rapidly growing \neconomies of the developing world, and it excludes other industrialized \ncountries which could be left to meet target reductions in a more \ncostly manner.\n  The European proposal would provide the Europeans with a competitive \nadvantage over the United States by creating this collective emissions \ncap as opposed to country-by-country reduction targets. Some European \ncountries could actually increase their emissions by up to 40 percent. \nThis approach, coupled with their opposition to joint implementation \nwith developing nations, seems to be aimed almost exclusively at \nbeating the United States out of economically sensible emissions \nreduction activities in Eastern Europe, Russia, the Far East, and \nelsewhere. I think they should know that is not acceptable under most \npeople's definition of fairness.\n  Therefore, it is my feeling that we should approach Kyoto in the \nfollowing way. I believe President Clinton and his advisers have been \ndeveloping a U.S. position for these negotiations that moves mostly in \nthe right direction. I have shared views with the administration over \nthe course of these last months and in recent weeks, and there are a \nnumber of different options that are currently rumored to be under \nconsideration by the President. It is my hope the President will \nannounce a U.S. position that is aggressive in curbing the projected \nbusiness-as-usual trendline.\n  I believe the President ought to press for a proposal that will seek \nat least a target of 2010, rather than the outyear options of 2020 or \n2030 that we have heard discussed. The Europeans, given the protection \nof their European bubble proposal, have proposed a 15 percent reduction \nbelow the 1990 levels by the year 2010. Perhaps without the bubble this \nlevel may prove to be too ambitious to achieve without significant harm \nto their economies. However, I believe it is realistic for the United \nStates and other nations to stabilize their emissions at 1990 levels by \nthe year 2010, remembering, of course, that our original goal was to do \nso by the year 2000. With additional economic incentives such as early \ncredits for reductions and joint implementation and a market-oriented \nemissions trading system, perhaps additional reductions could be \nundertaken.\n  I believe also that the centerpiece of the U.S. negotiating position \nshould be a worldwide emissions trading program. Emissions trading is \nan important market mechanism that will benefit all countries including \nthe United States. But it is not only advantageous to U.S. businesses. \nIt will provide developing countries with incentives to sign up to \nbinding legal commitments that are absolutely essential to a workable \ntreaty.\n\n  The market-based approach of emissions trading is a sensible one that \nhelps businesses lower costs by promoting emissions reductions and by \ngiving the industry flexibility to decide how they will go about \nreducing pollution. We know an emissions trading system could reduce \nthe cost of emissions controls dramatically, afford American industry \ngreat opportunities to do what we do best, which is to innovate, to \ndevelop cheaper, better ways of getting the job done. And, if the \nsystem includes joint implementation with developing countries, \nproviding jobs here at home in the well-paying technology export \nsectors that serve the booming demands in rapidly industrializing \nnations, we would be well served.\n  Experiences in States such as Massachusetts or California or Texas or \nFlorida, States which have invested in technology and which have built \non their combined technology bases and education bases--those \nexperiences have proven where we invest in technology in order to solve \nsome of these problems, we inevitably not only create jobs for \nAmericans but we wind up creating an export capacity, because\n\n[[Page S10875]]\n\nwe are the leading, cutting edge of technology and we wind up greatly \nreducing the costs that the original estimates are based on.\n  If you look at the SO2 reduction programs in this country, \nI remember the automobile and other industries arguing it was going to \nbe upward of $1,000 per ton to reduce. In fact, because of the \ntechnology advances, the costs have come in around $90. Therefore, the \nopportunity, by virtue of pushing our technology and advancing our \ncapacity to transfer that technology to the developing countries, can \nassist all of us in the effort to create jobs and to provide for the \ngains necessary to be able to meet these targets. The United States \nshould contain in this effort, along with the rest of the \nindustrialized countries, a significant technology transfer component \nin order to assist in achieving this treaty and its goals.\n  Economically, the best time to establish an international trading \nprogram is now. Many developing countries are currently investing in \nlong-term energy programs. By excluding any discussion of joint \nimplementation with developing countries and early credits for \nreductions prior to implementation of such a system, important \nincentives to encourage developing countries to begin shifting their \ndevelopment trajectory to a cleaner path would be lost. U.S. industry \nand U.S. competitiveness are the winners of an international trading \nsystem, wholly apart from any environmental gains.\n  Environmentally, we need to get the trading program going as soon as \npossible, and world events are escalating the seriousness of the \nproblem. The terrible fires in Indonesia and the havoc that that \nconflagration continues to wreak on the people of South Asia are \nadditional testaments to an urgent need for a global framework that \nprovides powerful market incentives for environmentally friendlier \nbehavior. Emissions from these fires are pumping greenhouse gases into \nthe atmosphere and destroying forests that could be protected and \nharvested in a much more sustainable manner. A Kyoto protocol that \nprovides credits for protecting forests that sequester carbon dioxide, \nand an income stream that would potentially be available to those who \nhusband the forest, would be an important step for the nations and the \npeoples of the worlds.\n  A model for such a regime is the SO2 trading program \ncontained in the 1990 Clean Air Act. That program, as I mentioned a \nmoment ago, really contradicted what had been predicted by the \nindustry. According to the Wall Street Journal, some initial industry \nestimates for those SO2 reductions were $1,500 per ton but \nwhich actually came in at $90 per ton, which was 6 percent of the \noriginal doom forecast of the industry.\n  I would like to emphasize one point about the sulfur program that is \nkey to its success. In the sulfur trading program, the Government has \nresisted the temptation to intervene in the market and provide price \nprops or cushions, or to print new allowances and sell them at a set \nprice. I understand that one option before the President is exactly \nsuch an approach. I believe other Senators would join me and strongly \nurge him to resist such intervention here. When the Government \nintervenes in market trading it inevitably drives those prices up.\n  My recommendation to the President would be that any proposal that \nwould make companies pay the Government for additional carbon permits \nis likely to be regarded--in this institution, anyway--as a thinly \nveiled tax, and would, frankly, not receive favorable reception. I urge \nthe President to let the market for greenhouse emissions reductions do \nwhat the markets do best, which is to spur companies to develop better \nproducts at a lower cost. I am very optimistic that the President will \nultimately make a judgment that would be opposed to that alternative, \nsignificant intervention in the marketplace.\n  A second goal should be a framework that brings all countries into \nthis effort at the beginning while allowing for the developing \ncountries to initiate their reduction efforts at a different rate than \nthe industrialized world. I think this is an essential component of any \nrealistic approach to this effort. Even without a universal emission \nreductions program, the Montreal Protocol, signed by President Reagan \nduring his second term, called for the phaseout of chlorofluorocarbons. \nAs with the SO 2 estimates, the CFC reduction costs were \ngrossly exaggerated by certain industry sectors. Market-type mechanisms \nin the Montreal Protocol and the U.S. domestic implementation program \ndrove prices down, with the result that companies were spurred to bring \nonline CFC substitutes that proved cheaper and cleaner. A more \ninclusive treaty, covering all greenhouse gas emissions, sources and \nsinks would produce even more economic and environmental progress.\n  A final goal is to recognize the opportunity presented by technology \nto help in this effort. The United States is now a world leader in the \nhigh tech industries of pollution prevention, abatement and control. \nWith a global emissions reduction treaty, the faster we invest in new \npollution prevention and energy conservation technologies, the faster \nwe will achieve emissions reductions and the quicker we will gain \nmarket share in the international arena. This means more jobs for U.S. \nworkers and more revenues for U.S. companies. If we don't, then someone \nelse will.\n  I would simply cite the example of what took place in the two decades \nago. At the end of the 1970's, President Carter had made a commitment \nto alternative and renewable fuel research. Regrettably, when the \nReagan administration arrived in 1980, support for the institute in \nColorado was withdrawn. So it was that over a 10-year period of time \nthe great lead that the United States had built up in photovoltaics and \nin alternatives and renewables was lost.\n  Today, as the former Soviet bloc countries of Eastern Europe come \nonline in their effort to try to reduce the grotesque pollution that is \none of the longest legacies of the Communist rule, they are turning to \nthe Japanese and to the Germans for the technology where we once were \nthe leader. But since we withdrew our own investment, we ceased to be \nthat leader.\n  So I believe there is, in this effort, an enormous economic \nopportunity for the United States for the future. At home, we need to \nconsider ways to leverage our technological leadership through domestic \ntax provisions, such as a zero capital gains tax rate, or a \nspecifically targeted investment tax credit for companies that invest \nin pollution prevention and energy conservation, or quicker \ndepreciation of investment in such technologies. I repeat, a zero \ncapital gains tax rate or faster depreciation for those companies that \ninvest in energy saving, energy conservation and pollution prevention.\n  I anticipate, Mr. President, that following the announcement the \nPresident makes regarding a U.S. proposal, regardless of what that \nproposal entails, there will be a number of colleagues on the floor of \nthe Senate denouncing it, arguing that the science is not yet there or \nthat the economic assumptions are unreliable. Some will argue it is \nunnecessary and too costly for the United States to participate in an \ninternational treaty.\n  On the contrary. I believe the evidence from scientists is \noverwhelming, that it is far too costly to sit on the sidelines and do \nnothing. Mr. President, 2,500 leading economists, including 8 Nobel \nlaureates tell us:\n  For the United States in particular, sound economic analysis shows \nthat there are policy options that would slow climate change without \nharming American living standards, and these measures may, in fact, \nimprove U.S. production in the long term.\n  I believe that if we heed the warnings, if we plan for the future \nnow, if we avoid allowing this to become the political football that it \nmight, if we seek the involvement of all nations, we can secure a \nhealthy planet for ourselves and for our children and for future \ngenerations, and we can exercise our responsibility as U.S. Senators in \nthe way that we ought to. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts for his thoughtful comments about global warming. It is a \nsubject in which I am deeply interested.\n  I was very interested and pleased with his references and comparisons\n\n[[Page S10876]]\n\nwith what took place with the Montreal protocol and our efforts that \nwere successful in controlling chlorofluorocarbons, so-called CFC's. \nThere is an example where the first scientific body of opinion \nsuggested that, indeed, the CFC's were destroying the ozone layer. \nThere was great skepticism, not only in this body, but throughout the \nNation. But gradually, through testimony and through powerful speeches \nand articles by those who were involved, this country came to recognize \nthat, indeed, CFC's were destroying the ozone layer, were causing skin \ncancer to our population and the population of the world.\n  As a result of that, we moved forward and various meetings were held, \nwhich many of us remember, and capping it all off was the Montreal \nprotocol, which called for substantial reduction of the production of \nCFC's in our country and the world.\n  At the time, it looked as though it would be very difficult to \nachieve, but as the Senator from Massachusetts pointed out, the United \nStates' scientific and mechanical ingenuity rose to the surface and, lo \nand behold, we not only met those reductions but we exceeded them.\n  The results are now showing that the amount of chlorofluorocarbons in \nthe atmosphere has been reduced, at least the increases have been \nreduced, and gradually we will see a reduction in the total body of \nCFC's, as it were, in the atmosphere, because all of this takes a long \ntime to achieve.\n  I also say to the Senator from Massachusetts that I think it is \nimportant to stress not only the costs of complying with a global \nwarming treaty--that is always what is portrayed, it is going to cost \nour farmers, it is going to cost our manufacturers, it is going to cost \nour automobile industry, the coal miners, and on and on it goes. The \ncosts of complying. But rarely does anybody ask, what are the costs if \nwe don't have the treaty?\n  The scientific evidence, as the Senator from Massachusetts was \npointing out, is increasingly coming to be recognized that, indeed, the \nworld is becoming warmer, just as the Senator pointed out what is \nhappening to the ice accumulations, the glaciers. In every single place \nin the world, the glaciers are retreating. Why is that coming about? It \nis coming about because of the increased temperature, infinitesimal \nthough it might seem, that is occurring throughout the world.\n  So more and more I believe we have to say to ourselves, what does it \ncost if we don't do anything? Just take Florida. I don't know what the \nheight of Florida is above sea level, but it must be tiny. If they get \nan increase in the level of the oceans of the world, and particularly \nthose in the Caribbean, for example, the effects to Florida can't help \nbut be devastating. Indeed, in my State, likewise; Massachusetts, \nlikewise. In all our States, we are doing what we can to increase \nseawalls. What is happening? We are not sure. All we know is, once upon \na time, our beaches were steeper and now they have been cut away. Now \nwe have to have breakwaters and barriers and groins, as they call them, \nand so forth, to try and prevent the erosion of the soil.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts pointed out what one of the presidents \nof one of the oil-producing countries of the world had to say. I would \nlike to also point out a statement by the chairman of the Ford Motor \nCo. finance committee, none other than William Clay Ford, Jr. This is \nwhat he had to say on October 11, just 10 days ago, as quoted in the \nWashington Post:\n\n       Ford Motor executive William Clay Ford, Jr., called global \n     warming a genuine threat to the environment and said \n     automakers who oppose a proposed treaty to address the \n     problem risk being ``marginalized'' in the court of public \n     opinion.\n\n  This is what someone, whose family owns 40 percent of the voting \nstock of Ford Motor Co., had to say.\n\n  The remarks by Ford, a leading contender to become chairman of the \nNo. 2 automaker, distances himself from several Detroit executives who, \nin recent months, have criticized the proposed global warming treaty \nsaying the phenomenon might not exist or its causes are uncertain.\n  So that's what the leader of the second largest automobile \nmanufacturing company in our country had to say.\n  All I am saying to my colleagues, and substantiating what the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts said, is let's examine this thing carefully. Let's \nlook at what the scientists have to say. We can say we don't agree with \nthem. I don't know how many Nobel laureates there are in that group--\nare there 10 Nobel laureates in that most recent group? It is something \nlike that--plus a total of 2,500 scientists.\n  I believe this thing is serious, and I think we ought to approach it \nwith that attitude and not say, ``No, we're not going to have anything \nto do with it because if we have anything to do with it and try and \nsolve the problem it will be very expensive.'' Well, that is no way to \napproach things.\n  I commend the Senator from Massachusetts for the remarks he made, and \nI hope that all our colleagues were listening. This thing is serious; \nlet's take it seriously. We may not agree. We may have different \nscientific evidence, but let's not just trash it because it is going to \nbe expensive to comply with.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for \nhis generous comments and also for his substantive comments. He has \nbeen dealing with this issue for a long period of time. As chairman of \nthe committee of jurisdiction with respect to the environment, as well \nas a Senator from a coastal State, a neighbor of ours, he is very \nknowledgeable about these impacts. He serves also on the observer \ngroup. So I appreciate his comments particularly and his leadership on \nit.\n  I will just say to my friend from Rhode Island, when I was in this \ndiscussion with the British minister just last week, he was quite \ndumbstruck, in fact, that Senators here are still questioning the \nscience or that some people want to make an issue out of the science. \nThere is almost a universal European acceptance among those in \nGovernment of the science. They really have stepped beyond that debate.\n  The debate now is not over the science. The debate is how do you \nreally deal with this the best. The Senator from Rhode Island pointed \nout Ford Motor Co. Let me just share with my colleague the \nenvironmental commitment statement by the insurance industry. The \ninsurance industry in America is increasingly concerned about this. \nHere is what they said:\n\n       Based on the current status of climate research and on \n     their experience as insurers and reinsurers, the member \n     companies of the UNEP-Insurance Industry Initiative conclude \n     that . . . Man-made climate change will lead to shifts in \n     atmospheric and ocean circulation patterns. This will \n     probably increase the likelihood of extreme weather events in \n     certain areas. Such effects carry the risk of dramatically \n     increased property damage, with serious implications for \n     property insurers and reinsurers . . . We are convinced that \n     in dealing with climate change risks, it is important to \n     recognize the precautionary principle, in that it is not \n     possible to quantify anticipated economic and social impacts \n     of climate change fully before taking action. Research is \n     needed to reduce uncertainty but cannot eliminate it entirely \n     . . . We insist that in accordance with the precautionary \n     principle, the negotiations for the Framework Convention on \n     Climate Change must achieve early, substantial reductions in \n     greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n  So I think that increasingly businesses are aware of the fact that \nthe costs of not doing something are the real measurement here.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman for bringing that to the Senate's \nattention. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, tomorrow we will be holding public \nhearings on a bill that is very significant. It is Senate bill 1084.\n  Back almost a year ago, in November of last year, the Administrator \nof the EPA, Carol Browner, came out with the recommendation and the \nrule change to lower the ambient air standards as they pertained to \nparticulate matter and to ozone.\n  After looking at this, we found that there was at that time no \nscientific\n\n[[Page S10877]]\n\njustification for lowering the ambient air standards. Consequently we \nstarted having hearings.\n  Our first hearing was with the scientific community. We had \nrepresentation there from CASAC, that is the Clean Air Science Advisory \nCommittee. It was somewhat unanimous among all the scientific community \nthat there is no scientific justification for lowering standards.\n  One of the things that was rather interesting that came up in that \nfirst hearing was a group of young children, we understand now, that \ncame from some hospital who came in wearing masks, as if to say, ``You \nmust lower these standards or we're not going to be able to breathe.''\n  I think a great disservice was done because it came out during the \ncourse of that hearing that these children used breathers, respirators; \nthey were using various medical equipment that has the chemical CFC in \nit that allows them to breathe. At precisely the same time that the \nAdministrator of the EPA was saying that we had to do something about \nlowering the ambient air standards so these young people could breathe, \nI asked for a show of hands as to how many of them used, in their \nparticular medical devices, CFC's. Every hand went up.\n  I asked, ``How many of you are aware of the fact that Administrator \nBrowner, the same one who is advocating lowering the standards, has \nsaid she's going to take CFC's off the market so you folks would not be \nable to use these in your breathers?''\n  I was pleased to find out this morning that Senator Tim Hutchinson \nfrom Arkansas has introduced legislation that will keep the EPA and the \nother various bureaucracies from taking this chemical off the market. I \ncertainly applaud him for that. I will join him in that effort.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/21/senate-section/article/S10876-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10877-S10878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ISTEA AND CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I notice that we are in a situation today \nthat is no different than the circumstances we found ourselves in \nbefore we left for the recess last week, and that is the bill that is \non the floor of the Senate is the highway reauthorization bill, or \nISTEA. Most people want to get some progress made on that piece of \nlegislation.\n  I might say to the Senator from Rhode Island and the Senator from \nMontana who are managing that bill, I think they have done an \nextraordinary job with that bill and I support what they have done. I \nvery much want the Senate to be able to complete its work on the \nhighway reauthorization bill.\n  I also am someone who believes that if the Senate leaves after this \nfirst session of Congress without having dealt with the underlying bill \nof the campaign finance reform issue, more specifically, McCain-\nFeingold, we will not have done what we should do for the American \npeople on that issue. It is clear we have a serious problem in campaign \nfinance. It ought not be lost on the American people. I am sure it is \nnot. We have a system here that is broken. There is money ricocheting \naround every crevice of this political system.\n  There was a story in one of the newspapers today, some new groups are \ncoming together, suggesting each of the organizations and groups \ncontribute a million dollars so they can do new independent campaign \nexpenditures. The fact is there is all this money ricocheting around \nthe political system, and it ought not be lost on anybody that this \nsystem is broken and needs fixing.\n  How do we fix it? There are a number of different ideas, but the \nMcCain-Feingold is one that has been worked on and a lot of time has \nbeen spent on that proposal. At least we ought to have the opportunity \nfor a vote on the McCain-Feingold proposal. We were told prior to \nbringing the highway reauthorization bill to the floor of the Senate \nthat we would debate campaign finance reform. In fact, it was on the \nfloor of the Senate for some long while, but we never got to a vote on \nthe substance of campaign finance reform because all we did was talk \nand talk and talk, and then it was pulled from the floor before there \nwas an opportunity for a vote.\n  That is our dilemma. We have kind of a self-imposed set of \ncircumstances here where shackles have been allied in this legislative \nprocess so that, first, we can't get a vote on campaign finance reform, \nand, second, we have the highway reauthorization bill on the floor \nwhich we need to pass--it is a good bill, incidentally, which we need \nto pass--but it is brought to the floor with a Byzantine kind of \nstructure in which the parliamentary tree is filled with amendments and \nsecond degrees and they have done what is called fill the tree so that \nno one else can offer any amendments on this legislation. So we find \nourselves in a circumstance where we have gridlock, a self-imposed \ngridlock, because some are worried that we will force a vote on \ncampaign finance reform--a vote, incidentally, I think the American \npeople would like to see us have. So the result is they take a bill \nsuch as the highway reauthorization and load it up by filling the tree \nso that you can't do anything on that, either.\n  Now, I am thinking that perhaps later this afternoon I should come \nover--I guess what we have is a tree filled and the last amendment is a \nsecond-degree amendment--and maybe I should ask for the yeas and nays \non the second-degree amendment. I think the yeas and nays would be in \norder on the second-degree amendment, so perhaps in order to try to end \nthis gridlock, we ought to at least ask for the yeas and nays on the \nsecond-degree amendment.\n  In fact, let me just say for the record, the second-degree amendment \nas constructed by Senator Lott, the majority leader, is one I will \nsupport. So if we get the yeas and nays, and I will vote for it, \npresumably a number of Members of the Senate would vote for it \nsufficient for it to pass, and then at that point the tree isn't full \nand people can come out here and offer amendments. Then we have one of \ntwo opportunities to do business: Either someone can come to the floor \nand offer an amendment to try to get a vote on McCain-Feingold, the \ncampaign finance reform bill that will reform the campaign finance \nsystem, or someone can come to the floor and offer an amendment on the \nhighway reauthorization act.\n  Either of those alternatives is preferable to the circumstance we now \nfind ourselves in. It does no service to the Senate to say, first, we \ndon't want to vote on campaign finance reform, so second, we will bring \nthe ISTEA bill or highway reauthorization to the floor of the Senate \nand then tie it up with the same rope that we used to tie up campaign \nfinance reform so that we are not able to move on either.\n  I again observe perhaps the approach should be for one of us, perhaps \nmyself or someone else, to come over this afternoon and ask for the \nyeas and nays. I assume we can find enough friends to come and get a \nsufficient second, and at some point we can get the yeas and nays on \nthe second-degree amendment, which is the lowest hanging fruit on this \nbitter tree that has been constructed, and at that point maybe we can \noffer some other amendments. My first choice would be campaign finance \nreform, get a vote on that and move on, but if it is not that, at least \nother amendments, so we can make progress on what I think is a very \ngood highway reauthorization bill.\n\n  I began by complimenting the Senator from Montana. He was not here, \nand the Senator from Rhode Island, I don't know if he heard, but you \nhave brought a bill to the floor of the Senate that is an \nextraordinarily good bill. I like this piece of legislation. This \ncountry needs your legislation. I think the country will be better \nserved by having the Senate pass it and going to conference and getting \nmore than a 6-month extension that seems to be the mood on the other \nside. To the extent we move this bill and put in law some very good \nlegislation, the country will be best served.\n  In order to get to that point, however, we have to find a way to \nuntie this whole process, first on ISTEA, especially on ISTEA, saying \nlet's bring\n\n[[Page S10878]]\n\nthe highway reauthorization bill to the floor and tie it up so nobody \ncan move and then also on campaign finance reform. On campaign finance \nreform we all know the American people want us to at least vote on that \nissue. They don't want people to be involved in parliamentary \nmaneuvering sufficient so you don't get an up-or-down vote on a bill \nthat a good number of Members of this Senate have worked on for many, \nmany, many months.\n  Mr. President, I will not do so now, but I say that if we have what \nis called a legislative tree filled with first- and second-degree \namendments sufficient so that no one else in the Senate is able to move \nat all on anything, perhaps what we ought to do is take that bottom \nsecond-degree amendment, which I support and I expect the ranking \nmember and the chairman would support, and let's vote on that. Let's \nhave a vote on it. I will vote for it, we will pass it, and we will \nopen a spot, and then let's do the business of either the highway \nreauthorization bill or any other amendment that one may wish to bring \nto the floor of the Senate, which might include on behalf of some the \ncampaign finance reform proposal.\n  That is the only way, it seems to me, that we would be able to get \nthe Senate to begin moving. It probably can only be considered \nsufficient to Members of a body that understand these rules to believe \nsomehow you make progress when the lights are on and the heat is on. \nBut there is no thoughtful discussion about an issue that allows you to \nmake progress because we have the thing tied in knots. That is not \nsomething that would be sufficient to the rest of the American people.\n  Let me finish by saying again that we have a very important bill on \nthe floor of the Senate right now. I want to be helpful in moving that \npiece of legislation, but it is not moving. It hasn't moved a \ncentimeter. We have made no progress at all since the moment it was \nbrought to the floor of the Senate, except for some statements. Why? \nBecause some people are afraid that campaign finance reform will be \nbrought to the floor as an amendment and be voted on and they don't \nwant to have a vote on campaign finance reform, so they tie up the \nhighway reauthorization.\n  Let's find a way to untie all of us. Let's have our votes up or down. \nHowever they come out, they come out. We don't waive those here. We \njust count them. Let's have them and decide where the votes are. In \nfact, prior to the highway reauthorization bill being brought to the \nfloor and the cloture vote, it looks to me like there is probably \nsufficient numbers of Senators who would vote for McCain-Feingold to \nenact legislation of that type. It appears to me that there are over 50 \nvotes in the Senate for that. But because we couldn't get past the \ncloture vote we couldn't get to it.\n\n  That is part of the purpose, I assume, with tying the Senate up with \nthis procedural tree. But I guess it would be appropriate for a Member \nof the Senate to ask for the yeas and nays on the underlying second-\ndegree amendment. I would certainly consider doing that later this \nafternoon, if that is what is available to us, and if that might get us \noff dead center and allow us to open up a slot either to do this bill, \nor for someone to come over and offer some other amendment of their \nchoice.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe).

Mr. President, I have a lot of sympathy with the remarks \nof the Senator from North Dakota. Being in a deadlock we are not \naccomplishing very much. The Senator is suggesting that we get off this \ndeadlock; that we start to accomplish something. And he is suggesting \nthat we vote on one of the amendments on this tree and suggesting under \nthe parliamentary rules that we vote on the first one, which is the \nsecond-degree amendment. I am very sympathetic to that. I want to move, \ntoo.\n  I also would like to get campaign finance reform passed. Why? I can \ntell you, having just been through an election, that this country has \ndramatically changed the way campaigns are run and financed from just a \nfew years ago. The present system is so bad. It is so obscene with \nvirtually no limit on the total number of dollars raised or spent on \nbehalf of, or for, or by candidates that it is demoralizing the \ncountry. It is causing the American people to think that the whole \nsystem stinks and becoming less and less involved in the democratic \nprocess and beginning to lose interest. And we run the risk of \nfragmenting a country--a country where Americans are going their own \nway; not a country that works together as a whole.\n  It is a huge problem. I can tell you, Mr. President. It is a huge \nproblem. And if this Senate and this House does not do something about \ncampaign finance reform very soon, this country, as we know it, is \ngoing to no longer be the greatest country on the face of this Earth \njust because we are going to be so awash in campaign money that the \nAmerican people are just going to begin to lose interest in the U.S. \nGovernment--certainly in the Congress, and in the Presidential \ncampaigns as well.\n  That is a vivid exaggeration. I grant you. They will have some \ninterest. But they are not going to be nearly as proud of this Congress \nand their Federal Government as they would like to be.\n  At the same time, I think we have to pass this highway bill. Why do I \nsay so? Because if the Senate does not pass the highway bill very \nsoon--that is, within the next week or so--then the chances of it \npassing this year are virtually nil. If we do not pass a highway bill--\nwe know the House wants a 6-month bill. The House's 6-month bill is \nsomething that is just totally unacceptable, in my view, because every \nyear, or every couple of years, we would be reauthorizing the highway \nbill. And it makes no sense. We need to pass a 6-year highway bill. It \nis that simple.\n  I have a lot of sympathy for the Senator from North Dakota. He is \nright. We have to start moving. I hope that leadership on both sides of \nthe aisle sits down and reaches an agreement today, and figure out a \nway to get off of this impasse so that we can do both--find a way to \ntake up and work campaign finance reform, and also pass this highway \nbill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Certainly.\n  Mr. DORGAN. My understanding is that the second-degree amendment that \nis pending is something that is acceptable, at least to the extent that \nI know it. I would vote for it. Would the Senator from Montana support \nit?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I would. I think most Senators would support it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. It seems to me that the only reason the tree is full with \na final second-degree amendment that would be acceptable to everyone is \nsimply to prevent others from offering amendments. I understand the \nparliamentary strategy here. But the problem is that it puts the Senate \nin the position of having kind of a glacial progress. I have never \ntried to watch a glacier move. But I have been told it will pass a lot \nof days.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If the Senator wishes, I will take the Senator up to \nGrinnell Glacier in Glacier Park where you can virtually watch the \nglacier move because the Earth is warming at such a rapid rate. It is \nmoving in the wrong way. It is receding, is diminishing. In fact, in 20 \nyears that glacier will totally evaporate.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Montana has actually seen \na glacier move, something I have not yet observed. Would the Senator \nfrom Montana agree that the glacier--however rapidly or slowly it is \nmoving--is moving more rapidly than we are?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I think the Senator makes a very good point. At least it \nis moving--the glacier.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator from Montana agree that we are not \nmoving; that we have a circumstance where a bill is brought to the \nfloor, and we are\n\n[[Page S10879]]\n\nvirtually tied in knots with a procedural tree, which is not unusual? \nIt has been used before, and used by Democrats as well. But it is \nrarely used. And it is used in most cases, I am told, to stop \nlegislation.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The point is the tree was developed with the longest \nhanging fruit a second-degree amendment. If that is acceptable to the \nSenate, my point was, let's come here and ask for the yeas and nays, \nand have a vote on it. And if the vote is yes, as I expect it would be, \nthen the tree is open, and we can offer amendments.\n  My expectation would be that someone would come and say, ``We are not \ngoing to allow you to offer amendments. We will fill the tree again.'' \nI say that is fine. Let's vote again. Let's keep voting, and maybe at \nsome point we will start making forward progress. You can have your car \nengine idling, and you can say, ``Well, the engine is running.'' Yes. \nBut you are not going anywhere. That is kind of what is happening here. \nWhat I want to do is have the engine running with the lights on, with \nthe heat going, and some discussion on the floor of the Senate. But we \nare not going anywhere. I want to go somewhere--both on campaign \nfinance reform, and I want to make progress on the highway \nreauthorization bill. And we are going nowhere on both of those fronts.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator is absolutely correct. We are at dead center. \nWe are not moving at all.\n  One way to perhaps get a little more momentum is the procedure \noutlined by the Senator. I hope that we could count on the same \nobjective by the leadership sitting down and working out an agreement \nso that we don't have to go through this process. But we may have to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would observe, finally, that the chairman and ranking \nmember are enormously patient. The bill is brought to the floor with a \nprocedure that really doesn't allow any movement on the bill. I expect \nyou will remain on the floor while the bill is being considered, and \nperhaps at some point when the bill is further considered that we will \nask for the yeas and nays and see if by that manner we can make some \nadditional progress.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator. I very much hope, as I said many \ntimes, that the leadership works out an agreement so we can solve this \nthing and get moving.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to report to my colleagues on \nthe activities in the House to establish a new export policy on \nencryption. This is an issue that is still at the top of my list of \nlegislation I hope this Congress can resolve within the next 2 months. \nThe House's actions last month turned a spotlight on how this issue \nshould ultimately be resolved.\n  Let me briefly review the issue. Encryption is a mathematical way to \nscramble and unscramble digital computer information during \ntransmission and storage. The strength of encryption is a function of \nits size, as measured in computer bits. The more bits an encryption \nsystem has, the more difficult it is for someone else to illegally \nunscramble or hack into that information.\n  Today's computer encryption systems commonly used by businesses range \nfrom 40 bits in key length to 128 bits. A good hacker, let's say a \ncriminal or a business competitor, can readily break into a computer \nsystem safeguarded by a lower-technology 40-bit encryption system. On \nthe other hand, the 128-bit encryption systems are much more complex \nand pose a significant challenge to any would-be hacker.\n  Obviously, all of us would prefer to have the 128-bit systems. And \nequally as important, we would like to buy such systems from American \ncompanies. Firms we can routinely and safely do business with. Foreign \ncompanies and individuals also want to buy such systems from American \ncompanies.\n\n[[Page S10880]]\n\n They admire and respect our technological expertise, and trust our \nbusiness practices. The United States remains the envy of the world in \nterms of producing top-notch encryption and information security \nproducts.\n  However, current regulations prohibit U.S. companies from exporting \nencryption systems stronger than the low-end, 40-bit systems. A few \nexceptions have been made for 56-bit systems. Until recently, it has \nbeen the administration's view that stronger encryption products are so \ninherently dangerous they should be classified at a level equal to \nmunitions, and that the export of strong encryption must be heavily \nrestricted.\n  While we are restricting our own international commerce, foreign \ncompanies are now manufacturing and selling stronger, more desirable \nencryption systems, including the top-end 128-bit systems, anywhere in \nthe world they want. Clearly, our policy doesn't make sense. Just as \nclearly, our export policies on encryption have not kept up to speed \nwith either the ongoing changes in encryption technology or the needs \nand desires of foreign markets for U.S. encryption products.\n  My intention is neither to jeopardize our national security nor harm \nlaw enforcement efforts. I believe we must give due and proper regard \nto the national security and law enforcement implications of any \nchanges in our policy regarding export of encryption technology. But it \nis painfully obvious we must modernize our export policies on \nencryption technology, so that U.S. companies can participate in the \nworld's encryption marketplace. The legislative initiative on this \nissue has always been about exports, but this summer that changed.\n  During the past month, the FBI has attempted to change the debate by \nproposing a series of new mandatory controls on the domestic sale and \nuse of encryption products. Let me be clear. There are currently no \nrestrictions on the rights of Americans to use encryption to protect \ntheir personal financial or medical records or their private e-mail \nmessages. There have never been domestic limitations, and similarly, \nAmerican businesses have always been free to buy and use the strongest \npossible encryption to protect sensitive information from being stolen \nor changed. But now, the FBI proposes to change all that.\n  The FBI wants to require that any company that produces or offers \nencryption security products or services guarantee immediate access to \nplain text information without the knowledge of the user. Their \nproposal would subject software companies and telecommunications \nproviders to prison sentences for failure to guarantee immediate access \nto all information on the desktop computers of all Americans. That \nwould move us into an entirely new world of surveillance, a very \nintrusive surveillance, where every communication by every individual \ncan be accessed by the FBI.\n  Where is probable cause? Why has the FBI assumed that all Americans \nare going to be involved in criminal activities? Where is the \nConstitution?\n  And how would this proposal possibly help the FBI? According to a \nforthcoming book by the M.I.T. Press, of the tens of thousands of cases \nhandled annually by the FBI, only a handful have involved encryption of \nany type, and even fewer involved encryption of computer data. Let's \nface it--despite the movies, the FBI solves its cases with good old-\nfashioned police work, questioning potential witnesses, gathering \nmaterial evidence, and using electronic bugging or putting microphones \non informants. Restricting encryption technology in the U.S. would not \nbe very helpful to the FBI.\n  The FBI proposal won't work. I have talked with experts in the world \nof software and cryptography, who have explained that the technology \nwhich would provide compliance with the FBI standard simply does not \nexist. The FBI proposal would force a large unfunded mandate on our \nhigh technology firms, at a time when there is no practical way to \naccomplish that mandate.\n  Rather than solve problems in our export policy, this FBI proposal \nwould create a whole new body of law and regulations restricting our \ndomestic market.\n  This and similar proposals would also have a serious impact on our \nforeign market. Overseas businesses and governments believe that the \nU.S. might use its keys to computer encryption systems to spy on their \nbusinesses and politicians. Most U.S. software and hardware \nmanufacturers believe this is bad for business and that nobody will \ntrust the security of U.S. encryption products if this current policy \ncontinues. In fact, this proposal appears to violate the European \nUnion's data-privacy laws, and the European Commission is expected to \nreject it this week.\n  So, the FBI proposal would: Invade our privacy; be of minimal use to \nthe FBI; would require nonexistent technology; would create new \nadministrative burdens; and would seriously damage our foreign markets.\n  This is quite a list.\n  Mr. President, the FBI proposal is simply wrong. I have learned that \neven the administration does not support this new FBI proposal. So why \ndoes the FBI believe it must now subject all Americans to more and more \nsurveillance?\n  This independent action by the FBI has created confusion and mixed \nsignals which are troublesome for the Senate as it works on this \nlegislation. Perhaps the FBI and the Justice Department need to focus \nimmediately on a coordinated encryption position.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate the members of the House Commerce \nCommittee for rejecting this FBI approach by a vote margin of more than \n2 to 1.\n  I am sure all of my colleagues are sympathetic to the fact that \nemerging technologies create new problems for the FBI.\n  But we must acknowledge several truths as Congress goes forward to \nfind this new policy solution. People increasingly need strong \ninformation security through encryption and other means to protect \ntheir personal and business information. This demand will grow, and \nsomebody will meet it. In the long term, it is clearly in our national \ninterest that U.S. companies meet the market demand. Individuals and \nbusinesses will either obtain that protection from U.S. firms or from \nforeign firms. I firmly believe that all of our colleagues want \nAmerican firms to successfully compete for this business. Today there \nare hundreds of suppliers of strong encryption in the world \nmarketplace. Strong encryption can be easily downloaded off the \nInternet. Even if Congress wanted to police or eliminate encryption \naltogether, I am not sure that is doable.\n  So, let's deal with reality. Clamping down on the constitutional \nrights of American citizens, in an attempt to limit the use of a \ntechnology, is the wrong solution. The wrong solution. This is \nespecially true with encryption technology because it has so many \nbeneficial purposes. It prevents hackers and espionage agents from \nstealing valuable information, or worse, from breaking into our own \ncomputer networks. It prevents them from disrupting our power supply, \nour financial markets, and our air traffic control system. This is \nscary--and precisely why we want this technology to be more available.\n  Only a balanced solution is acceptable. Ultimately, Congress must \nempower Americans to protect their own information. Americans should \nnot be forced to only communicate in ways that simply make it more \nconvenient for law enforcement officials. This is not our national \ntradition. It is not consistent with our heritage. It should not become \na new trend.\n  Mr. President, I would like to establish a framework to resolve this \ndifficult issue. I hope to discuss it with the chairmen and ranking \nmembers of the key committees. I especially look forward to working \nwith the chairman of the Commerce, Science and Transportation \nSubcommittee on Communications, Senator Burns. He was the first to \nidentify this issue and try to solve it legislatively. His approach on \nthis issue has always been fair and equitable, attempting to balance \nindustry wants with law enforcement requirements.\n  I believe there are other possible ideas which could lead to a \nconsensus resolution of the encryption issue. It is my hope that \nindustry and law enforcement can come together to address these issues, \nnot add more complexity and problems. The bill passed by the House \nCommerce Committee included a provision establishing a National \nEncryption Technology Center. It\n\n[[Page S10881]]\n\nwould be funded by in-kind contributions of hardware, software, and \ntechnological expertise. The National Encryption Technology Center \nwould help the FBI stay on top of encryption and other emerging \ncomputer technologies. This is a big step. This is a big step in the \nright direction.\n  It is time to build on that positive news to resolve encryption \npolicy.\n  Mr. President, there is an op-ed piece which appeared in the Wall \nStreet Journal on Friday, September 26. It is well written and \ninformative, despite the fact that its author is a good friend of mine. \nMr. Jim Barksdale is the president and CEO of Netscape Communications \nand is well-versed in encryption technology. Mr. Barksdale's company \ndoes not make encryption products; they license such products from \nothers. They sell Internet and business software and, as Jim has told \nme many times, his customers require strong encryption features and \nwill buy those products either from us or foreign companies.\n  Again, let's deal with reality. The credit union manager in \nMassachusetts, the real estate agent in Mississippi, the father writing \nan e-mail letter to his daughter attending a California university, \neach want privacy and security when using the computer. They will buy \nthe best systems available to ensure that privacy and security. And, in \njust the same way, the banker in Brussels, Belgium, the rancher in \nArgentina, and the mother writing e-mail to her daughter in a \nuniversity in Calcutta, India, each of these people also want privacy \nand security. They also will buy the best systems available to ensure \nthat privacy and security. And they want encryption systems they \ntrust--American systems. That's what this debate is about.\n  Mr. President, if Congress does not modernize our export controls, we \nrun the real risk of destroying the American encryption industry. And \nwe risk giving a significant and unfair advantage to our foreign \nbusiness competitors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/21/senate-section/article/S10879-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE FMC DID THE RIGHT THING\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the Federal Maritime \nCommission [FMC] for doing the right thing about Japan's ports. This \naction was not unexpected by the Japanese carriers, but I am sure many \nwere surprised with the FMC's dedication to seeing this through. During \nthe past few days, the Nation watched as a long running dispute between \nJapan and those countries whose ships call on Japan's ports appears to \nhave been resolved.\n  Japan's ports are widely known as the most inefficient and expensive \nin the developed world. Additionally, Japan's port system discriminates \nagainst non-Japanese ocean carriers.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. For many years, the United States has attempted to \nnegotiate commonsense changes to this system with Japan. Japan also \nfaced criticism from the European Union. However, no progress was made \nuntil earlier this year when the FMC voted to assess $100,000 fines \nagainst Japanese ocean carriers for each United States port call. It is \nreasonable for the United States to collect fines from the Japanese \nshipping lines. Before these fines were to be imposed, the Government \nof Japan agreed to make the necessary changes. The FMC judiciously gave \nJapan until August 1997 to work out these changes. When Japan failed to \nmeet this generous deadline, the fines automatically went into effect. \nBy last week, the Japanese ocean carriers had missed the FMC's deadline \nto pay the first $5 million in fines. Realizing that Japan would not \nfollow through on its promise to fix its port system unless stronger \nmeasures were imposed, the FMC voted last week to deny the same \nJapanese ocean carriers entry to and exit from United States ports.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this firm action has had the desired effect.\n  An agreement between the United States and Japan on the port issue \nhas been reached. The FMC's order will not have to be carried out, but \nit was vital to ensuring that Japan's discriminatory port practices are \nended. International trade only works when trading partners treat each \nother fairly. Diplomatic solutions only work when both sides live up to \ntheir commitments, and this only occurs when nations know there are \ngenuine consequences to inaction.\n  The FMC's active role in the port dispute ensured that United States \nocean carriers will be treated fairly in Japan. I want to personally \nrecognize Harold Creel, the Chairman of the FMC, and FMC Commissioners \nMing Hsu, Del Won, and Joe Scroggins for their efforts to resolve the \nJapanese port dispute in a firm, yet fair, manner.\n  Clearly, the FMC has both the responsibility and the authority to \ntake the action. And, the Commissioners approached their decision in a \nthoughtful and measured way.\n  I also want to thank the other members of the negotiation team, in \nparticular, the Maritime Administration which provided much needed \nmaritime expertise.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I want to add my congratulations to the FMC, the \nMaritime Administration, and the administration as well. The resulting \nimprovements in Japan's port practices will benefit not only U.S. ocean \ncarriers, but other ocean carriers and the shippers of the world \ntrading through Japan's ports.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would also note that the authority under which the FMC \ntook these actions, section 19 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, and \nthe independence of the U.S. Government's international shipping \noversight agency would be preserved under S. 414, the Ocean Shipping \nReform Act of 1997. Under this bill, the action would be carried out by \nthe U.S. Transportation Board, an expanded and renamed Surface \nTransportation Board. To those who expressed concerns that this \nmultimodal board would be unwilling or unable to be an effective \nregulator of the maritime industry, I tell them to look at the Surface \nTransportation Board's record of making tough decisions with regard to \nthe mergers of the largest railroads in the United States. When \nprovided with similar maritime expertise, this combined board will \ncertainly have the ability and willingness to protect the interests of \nthe United States in international maritime disputes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. The Majority Leader is correct. S. 414 does not limit \nthe United States' ability to address similar situations in the future. \nThe U.S. Transportation Board would have the same authority, \nindependence, and I believe the same willingness, to protect America's \ninterests as the FMC.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/21/senate-section/article/S10881-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, the American Medical Association recently \nhonored Massachusetts State Senator Mark Montigny of New Bedford with \nits 1997 Nathan Davis Award. This honor is a well-deserved tribute to \nSenator Montigny for his outstanding commitment to public service and \nhis leadership in health care.\n  The award was established by the AMA in 1989 to honor elected and \ncareer officials at the Federal, State and\n\n[[Page S10882]]\n\nlocal levels for their leadership in advancing public health. Mark \nMontigny's role on these vital issues in the Massachusetts legislature \nhas helped our State to make impressive progress in improving the \nquality and affordability of health care for all citizens.\n  In July 1996, one of Senator Montigny's principal legislative \ninitiatives was enacted into law, to provide health insurance for the \n160,000 children in Massachusetts without such insurance. His \ninitiative also launched a pilot prescription drug subsidy program for \nsenior citizens.\n  These initiatives are financed by a 25 cent increase in the State \ncigarette tax. The linkage between the cigarette tax and children's \nhealth insurance in Senator Montigny's bill was one of the principal \nmodels for the national children's health insurance legislation enacted \nby Congress as part of the balanced budget agreement this year.\n  New Bedford and Massachusetts are proud of Mark Montigny's leadership \non these issues. I congratulate him on the AMA's award, and I look \nforward to working closely with him in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/21/senate-section/article/S10881-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             NATO EXPANSION\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, this morning the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, on which I serve, held an important hearing on the topic of \nNATO expansion. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Secretary of \nDefense William Cohen testified at this hearing.\n  I feel that it is fitting at this time to keep in mind one of our \nrecently retired colleagues who has played such a pivotal role in \nadvancing the cause of NATO expansion. I am referring to my good friend \nfrom Colorado, Senator Hank Brown.\n  Few people have played a more crucial or steadfast role for the cause \nof NATO expansion than Senator Brown. He started his efforts after \nStalin's notorious Iron Curtain crumbled and never let up. His devotion \nand successes in advancing NATO expansion has made Hank Brown a warmly \nregarded household name throughout Central Europe, including the three \ncountries that have been invited to join NATO in this first round of \nexpansion, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic.\n  In fact, in the fall of 1996, the people of Poland showed their \nhighest regards for Senator Brown by awarding him Honorary Polish \ncitizenship in the name of the historic capital of Poland, Krakow. This \nis one of Poland's most prestigious honors. To this day, only two other \nAmericans have received this honor, President Ronald Reagan and \nPresident George Bush.\n  I recall a moving speech that Senator Mikulski--who sits on the \nAppropriations Committee with me--gave right here on the Senate Floor \njust after the Brown NATO Expansion Amendment passed last fall. Senator \nMikulski said that her mother had just placed a picture of Hank Brown \nin a place of honor on her fireplace mantle at home. I hope it is still \nthere. This is but one illustration of how the debate over NATO \nexpansion transcends party lines.\n  Senator Hank Brown has been one of the most effective advocates of \nsecuring freedom and peace for the people of Europe. We appreciated his \nvaluable leadership in the Senate on the cause of NATO expansion. His \nlegacy continues as the Senate proceeds with its consideration of this \nissue of great importance to the national security interests of the \nUnited States.\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second time by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. HUTCHINSON (for himself and Mr. Inhofe):\n       S. 1299.

A bill to limit the authority of the Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration to \nban metered-dose inhalers; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n                THE ASTHMA INHALER REGULATORY RELIEF ACT\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor to talk \nabout an issue which literally means life and breath to 30 million \nAmericans. It appears that in an effort to clean up the environment, \nsome heavy-handed bureaucrats are willing to reduce the quality of life \nfor those Americans--children, adults, and senior citizens--who are \ndependent upon inhalers like this inhaler that I have with me today. As \nI rode the elevator up to the Chamber, I mentioned to the elevator \noperator what I was going to be doing. She said, ``Well, please do it \nbecause it means life to me. I have to have this to breathe.''\n  I have a nephew, John Paul, who is an asthmatic, who has been \ndependent upon these inhalers that would be outlawed unless we act as \nthe Senate.\n  Because of this, I am offering the Asthma Inhaler Regulatory Relief \nAct, AIRR, which would block the Food and Drug Administration from \nbanning certain metered dose inhalers, MDI's. I am glad today that \nSenator Shelby, Senator Bond, and Senator DeWine have all joined as \noriginal cosponsors on this legislation. Senator DeWine has a special \ninterest in this, with four of his children, it is my understanding, \nbeing asthmatics and being dependent upon these inhalers. These \ninhalers are used by nearly 30 million Americans who suffer from \nrespiratory diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease, and cystic fibrosis. These people have come to rely on their \ninhalers as a lifeline for daily living. Yet, the FDA at this time, in \nits very questionable wisdom, has decided that inhalers severely damage \nthe environment and must be banned. One of only a few avenues to the \noutside world, the FDA would seal this avenue and ban these inhalers.\n  The FDA initially published an advanced notice of a proposed \nrulemaking to eliminate the use of MDI's that use chlorofluorocarbons \non March 6, 1997. About this time, I received several letters which \ninitially sparked my interest in the issue. I have come to\n\n[[Page S10883]]\n\nfind out that the FDA, in collaboration with the Environmental \nProtection Agency, proposed this rule as part of the EPA's desire to \neliminate all uses of chlorofluorocarbons as soon as possible. Most \nmetered dose inhalers use CFC's as the propellant to deliver the \nmedicine from the inhaler to the lungs of the patient. Under the 1987 \nMontreal protocol CFC's are to be phased out globally by the year 2005. \nHowever, certain uses of CFC's, including this inhaler, were explicitly \nrecognized by signatories of the protocol as vital to human health \nwhile posing relatively little harm to the environment. This exception \nhas allowed the continued manufacture and use of inhalers which use \nCFC's as their propellants.\n  This exception, however, is being threatened by the Food and Drug \nAdministration despite the objections of many, including the American \nAcademy of Family Physicians. In their May 5, 1997 letter to Michael \nFriedman, Deputy Commissioner of the FDA, the physicians wrote:\n\n       The Academy believes that the proposed rule might \n     negatively affect our patients' health care and urges the FDA \n     to continue to deem MDI's as ``essential'' under the Montreal \n     Protocol.\n\n  These are the doctors who deal with our children day in and day out. \nThey reiterated twice in their letter that they support eliminating \nCFC's from the environment but feel that this shortened timetable is \nnot necessary and may be detrimental, very detrimental to their \npatients' health.\n  Carol Browner, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency, has come to the Congress on numerous occasions to lobby on \nbehalf of EPA's proposed clean air standards. I serve on the clean air \nsubcommittee. We have had Administrator Browner before us numerous \ntimes as an advocate for children. One of the most compelling arguments \nshe has made on behalf of these new air standards is that she is saving \nthe children and the elderly from unnecessary respiratory illness. I \nrespect Ms. Browner for her zeal to protect children and the elderly, \nbut I find it ironic and amazing and I have to wonder how she can \nsupport taking the medication away from those whom she claims to be \ntrying to protect.\n  I wonder how she can look these children in the eye and tell them she \nis taking away the one thing that allows them to play outside and enjoy \nthe high-energy activities of running, climbing and participating in \nsports. Ms. Browner's actions will literally rob them of their \nchildhood and force them to sit on the sidelines. Of course, the EPA \nhas an answer. First, the EPA and the FDA will tell us there are other \nMDI's available that will provide the necessary protection for these \nchildren. The truth is there is only one that is currently available. \nMany are in the research and development stages, but that pales in \ncomparison to the hundreds of these inhalers that are available \ncurrently.\n  Doctors will tell you that different patients react differently to \ndifferent medications. There are many inhalers that are virtually \nidentical in composition yet have dramatically different effects on \nvarious patients. Again, quoting the American Academy of Family \nPhysicians:\n\n       We are concerned that the proposed rule will severely limit \n     the number of therapies available to our patients. We know \n     that a drug that works for one patient may not work for \n     another. We would like our members to have the flexibility to \n     try different therapies to find the one that is most \n     effective for their patients.\n\n  Simply put, 1 inhaler is not enough and 10 is not enough. Doctors \nmust have the ability to choose the medication that best suits their \npatients. In the case of respiratory treatment, one size definitely \ndoes not fit all.\n  Another concern I have with allowing one inhaler to dominate the \nmarket is the cost to the consumer. Obviously, where there are hundreds \nas currently exist, including many generic brands, there will be lower \nprices for the consumer. If we allow the FDA and the EPA to ban CFC \ninhalers, many may not be able to afford the treatment. The majority of \npatients who suffer from these symptoms live in the inner-city where \nthe cost of living is very high and their income very low. These \nfamilies rely on inhalers which can cost eight times less than newer \nname brand products without CFC's. If these children from low-income \ninner-city families lose the most accessible inhaler, they are less \nlikely to continue adequate treatment which is so important to a normal \nlife.\n  According to a recent Wall Street Journal article, the Joint Council \nof Allergy, Asthma and Immunology has told both the FDA and the EPA \nthat because of these increased costs, their proposal will unfairly \npunish poor children and the elderly who have the highest risks of \nasthma-related sickness and death.\n  A certain consequence of a decrease in the use of inhalers as part of \na schedule to keep asthma in control is an increase in hospital \nadmissions and an increase in deaths. According to a panel of the \nNational Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, between 1980 \nand 1993 failure to comply with treatment explains a 300 percent \nincrease in asthma-related deaths among children. This proposal put \nforth by the EPA and the FDA will increase costs and can only worsen \nthis statistic.\n  Another common argument the EPA will use is that by banning CFC's, we \nare making the air more safe for children and the elderly. While \ncertainly there are studies that show these gases are harmful and \nincrease the probability that an asthmatic will have an attack, if you \nlook at the statistics, you will find that inhalers, such as this one, \naccount for at most 1.5 percent of all CFC's produced in the world. The \nEPA supports taking away nearly 30 million people's inhalers to \neliminate approximately 1.5 percent of the CFC's produced. That hardly \nseems like a logical target for reducing CFC's and preserving and \nmaintaining the health of the American people.\n  In the October edition of Insight Magazine, Robert Goldbert, senior \nresearch fellow at George Washington Center For Neuroscience, \ndetermines that banning MDI's that only account for 1.5 percent of CFC \nemissions is another cynical exploitation of kids for the sake of \nenvironmental correctness.\n  I do not believe that this proposal is part of a strategy to save the \nozone layer. I believe it is a strategy to use children as a political \ntool for an end that I frankly do not understand. We cannot allow the \nFDA and the EPA to require children and senior citizens to foot the \nbill for reductions in CFC's that will do no good, while hurting the \nmost vulnerable.\n  These actions, if allowed to proceed, will literally rob these \nchildren of their childhood and significantly reduce the quality of \nlife of all those dependent on inhalers.\n  I urge the Presiding Officer and all of my colleagues who may be \nlistening today to join in cosponsorship of what I think is commonsense \nlegislation and that is going to be to the benefit of 30 million \nAmericans including children and the elderly and those who are most \nvulnerable in our society.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1299\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Asthma Inhaler Regulatory \n     Relief Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. LIMITATION ON AUTHORITY TO BAN METERED-DOSE INHALERS.\n\n       Neither the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency nor the Commissioner of Food and Drug Administration \n     may prohibit the manufacture, distribution, or sale of \n     metered-dose inhalers that use chlorofluorocarbons unless the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the \n     Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration jointly \n     certify to the Congress that alternatives to such inhalers \n     are available that, for all populations of users of such \n     inhalers, are comparable in terms of safety and \n     effectiveness, therapeutic indications, dosage strength, \n     costs, and retail availability.\n\n     SEC. 3. MORATORIUM ON FURTHER RULEMAKING.\n\n       The Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration shall \n     withdraw the March 6, 1997, advance notice of proposed \n     rulemaking concerning chlorofluorocarbons in metered-dose \n     inhalers and shall not issue any other proposal until after \n     the 10th Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on \n     Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer. Any subsequent \n     proposal shall be in the form of an advance notice of \n     proposed rulemaking and shall be initiated only after \n     extensive consultations with patients, physicians,\n\n[[Page S10884]]\n\n     other health care providers, manufacturers of metered-dose \n     inhalers, and other stakeholders.\n\n     SEC. 4. DEVELOPMENT OF STRATEGY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Following the 10th meeting of Parties to \n     the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone \n     Layer, but not later than January 30, 1999, the Commissioner \n     of the Food and Drug Administration shall publish a new \n     advance notice of proposed rulemaking, setting forth the \n     initial strategy for facilitating the transition in the \n     United States to metered-dose inhalers that do not use \n     chlorofluorocarbons.\n       (b) Obligations Under Montreal Protocol.--The initial \n     strategy developed under subsection (a) shall be submitted by \n     the Secretary of State to the Montreal Protocol Secretariat \n     by January 31, 1999, to fulfill United States obligations \n     under the Montreal Protocol decision IX/14.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAMS (for himself and Ms. Moseley-Braun):\n  S. 1300. A bill to provide for the minting and circulation of new $1 \ncoins; to the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                 the united states $1 coin act of 1997\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today Senator Moseley-Braun and I are \nintroducing the United States $1 Coin Act of 1997. The bill calls for a \nnewly designated, golden-colored $1 coin to replace the Susan B. \nAnthony.\n  Unless this legislation is approved in the near future, the U.S. Mint \nwill begin the process of minting more of the unpopular Susan B. \nAnthony coins by 1999. The supply of Anthony coins in government \ninventories fell by a total of 137 million coins in 1995 and 1996. Only \n133 million remain as of September 30, 1997. The inventory has been \nfalling at the rate of about 5 million per month because Anthony \ndollars are used at hundreds of vending locations, in more than a dozen \nmajor transit systems, and by the U.S. Postal Service.\n  Because the U.S. Mint has stated that it needs 30 months to design \nand fabricate a new $1 coin, the timeframe for a decision by Congress \nis short.\n  The current design of the SBA $1 coin is flawed because it has the \nsame color and reeded edge as a quarter. This makes it difficult for \nconsumers to tell the difference between an SBA $1 coin and a quarter.\n  The United States $1 Coin Act of 1997 will require the Treasury \nDepartment to change the color and edge of the SBA $1 coin so that it \nis different from the quarter. The act will not terminate the $1 bill.\n  Philip Diehl, Director of the U.S. Mint, stated his support for these \nreforms in his testimony to the House Subcommittee on Domestic and \nInternational Monetary Policy on October 21, 1997:\n\n       The U.S. Mint fully supports legislation which would \n     authorize issuance of a new dollar coin with new \n     characteristics at such time as the SBA inventory is \n     exhausted. In addition, immediate passage is critical because \n     the U.S. Mint needs at least 30 months to research and test \n     coin alloys and suitability for use in commerce.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that both a copy of the United \nStates $1 Coin Act of 1997 and a section-by-section summary of its \ncontents to be entered into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1300\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``United \n     States $1 Coin Act of 1997''.\n       (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act \n     is as follows:\n\n     SECTION 2. NEW $1 COIN.\n\n       (a) Weight.--Section 5112(a) of Title 31, United States \n     Code, is amended by striking, ``and weighs 8.1 grams.''\n       (b) Color and Content.--Section 5112(b) of title 31, United \n     States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in the 1st sentence, by striking, ``dollar,''; and\n       (2) by inserting after the 4th sentence, the following new \n     sentence: ``The dollar coin shall be golden in color, have a \n     distinctive edge, have tactile and visual features that make \n     the denomination of the coin readily discernable, be minted \n     and fabricated in the United States, and have similar \n     metallic, anti-counterfeiting properties as United States \n     clad coinage in circulation on the date of enactment of the \n     United States $1 Coin Act of 1997.''\n       (c) Design.--Section 5112(d)(1) of title 31, United States \n     Code, is amended by striking out the 5th and 6th sentences \n     and inserting the following new sentence: ``The Secretary of \n     the Treasury, in consultation with Congress, shall select \n     appropriate designs for the obverse and reverse sides of the \n     dollar coin.''.\n       (d) Production of New Dollar Coins.--\n       (1) In general.--Upon the depletion of the Government's \n     supply (as of the date of the enactment of this Act) of $1 \n     coins bearing the likeness of Susan B. Anthony, the Secretary \n     of Treasury shall place into circulation $1 coins which \n     comply with the requirements of subsections (b) and (d)(1) of \n     section 5112 of title 31, United States Code, as amended by \n     subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The Secretary may \n     include such $1 coins in any numismatic set produced by the \n     United States Mint before the date on which the $1 coins are \n     placed in circulation.\n       (2) Authority of secretary to continue production.--If the \n     supply of $1 coins bearing the likeness of Susan B. Anthony \n     is depleted before production has begun of $1 coins which \n     bear a design which complies with the requirements of \n     subsections (b) and (d)(1) of section 5112 of title 31, \n     United States Code, as amended by subsections (b) and (c) of \n     this section, the Secretary of the Treasury shall continue to \n     mint and issue $1 coins bearing the likeness of Susan B. \n     Anthony in accordance with such section 5112 (as in effect on \n     the day before the date of the enactment of this Act) until \n     such time as production begins.\n\n     SECTION 3. MARKETING PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Before placing into circulation $1 coins \n     authorized under section 2 of this Act, the Secretary of the \n     Treasury shall adopt a program to promote the use of such \n     coins by commercial enterprises, mass transit authorities, \n     and local, state and federal government agencies.\n       (b) Study Required.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     conduct a study on the progress of the marketing program \n     authorized by subsection (a).\n       (c) Report.--No later than March 31, 2001, the Secretary of \n     the Treasury shall submit a report to Congress on the results \n     of the study conducted pursuant to subsection (b).\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n     United States $1 Coin Act of 1997--Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n     Section 1. Short Title\n       The Act is called the ``United States $1 Coin Act of \n     1997.''\n     Section 2. New $1 Coin\n       Subsection 2(a). The new $1 coin will be of a golden color \n     so that consumers can tell the difference between it and a \n     quarter. The 8.1 gram weight restriction for the dollar coin \n     is deleted to take into account the difference in weight \n     caused by the coin being minted from a different alloy. \n     However, the new $1 coin will retain the same 1.043 inches \n     diameter as the old coin.\n       Subsection 2(b). The current $1 coin has the same color and \n     same reeded edge of a quarter. This subsection authorizes \n     that the new $1 coin be golden in color and have a \n     distinctive (probably smooth) edge. The change in the edge \n     will permit vision impaired consumers to be able to \n     differentiate the $1 coin from a quarter.\n       Subsection 2(c). This permits the Secretary of the \n     Treasury, in consultation with Congress, to change the design \n     of the dollar coin.\n       Subsection 2(d)(1). The U.S. Mint estimates that the \n     current supply of old $1 coins will be depleted within 30 \n     months. This subsection requires that upon the depletion of \n     the current supply of old $1 coins, the Treasury Department \n     shall place into circulation the new $1 coins. The Treasury \n     Department is also authorized to sell the new $1 coin as part \n     of a special set for coin collectors prior to date in which \n     the new coins are set to be placed in general circulation.\n       Subsection 2(d)(2). This requires the Treasury Department \n     to temporarily mint more SBA $1 coins, if the supply of these \n     coins is for some reason depleted prior to the introduction \n     of the new $1 coin. This will assure that commercial \n     enterprises and mass transit authorities will not experience \n     shortages of $1 coins prior to the introduction of the new $1 \n     coin.\n     Section 3. Marketing Program\n       This requires the Treasury Department to publicize the \n     issuance of the new $1 coin and promote the use of such $1 \n     coins to commercial enterprises, mass transit authorities and \n     government agencies. It requires the Treasury Department to \n     report on the progress of their promotion efforts no later \n     than March 31, 2001.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 1301. A bill to amend title 11, United States Code, to provide for \nconsumer bankruptcy protection, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n             The ``Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1997''\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Consumer \nBankruptcy Reform Act of 1997. This bill, which I am introducing with \nSenator Durbin, will tighten bankruptcy laws and do much to stem the \ntide of casual bankruptcies. With bankruptcy filings at all time record \nhighs, it's imperative that Congress enact serious and tough reforms of \nthe consumer bankruptcy chapters.\n  By far, the most pressing bankruptcy policy question facing America \ntoday relates to the explosion of consumer bankruptcies. Last April, I \nchaired a hearing on the crisis in consumer bankruptcies. While there's \nnot much agreement about the root causes of the\n\n[[Page S10885]]\n\nrise in consumer bankruptcies, it's obvious that Congress needs to do \nsomething now--before the economy takes a downturn--to reverse this \ntrend. At the present time, the economy is doing well and unemployment \nis low. Inflation is under control.\n  But we know there are always potholes on the road to economic \nprosperity. And we know that when the economy declines, bankruptcies \nincrease. With so many bankruptcies now, when times are good, I shudder \nto think of the strains we will face if we hit a recession. Clearly, \nCongress needs to act while the economy is still in good shape.\n  The Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act will discourage casual \nbankruptcies by sending a clear signal that you can't file for \nbankruptcy and walk away from your debts if you have the ability to re-\npay some portion of those debts. This is a simple and straightforward \nidea whose time has come. According to my research, Congress considered \nreserving bankruptcy relief for only those Americans who can't re-pay \ntheir debts as far back as 1932. So, what we're proposing is not based \non some unprecedented concept, but instead has a long and distinguished \nhistory.\n  The bill I'm introducing today amends section 707(b) of the \nbankruptcy code to permit bankruptcy judges to transfer debtors to \nchapter 13, or dismiss a case outright, if the debtor could re-pay 20 \npercent or more of their nonpriority unsecured debts. And the bill \nchanges current law to let creditors bring motions to bankruptcy judges \nto have debtors moved to chapter 13 or have their cases dismissed. This \nmeans that creditors can be the masters of their own destiny. The \nbankruptcy code should not prevent creditors from even presenting \nevidence that debtors who could repay their debts are abusing the \nbankruptcy code and walking away scott-free.\n\n  The bill also allows private chapter 7 trustees to bring motions \nunder the new section 707(b). And if they win on their motion, and the \ndebtor is either dismissed or transferred to chapter 13, the private \ntrustee will be reimbursed for attorney's fees. As an added incentive \nfor the private trustees, if they win on a section 707(b) motion, the \ncourt can order the debtor's attorney fined and make that fine payable \nto the trustee. Thus, there will be a army of trustees looking for \ndebtors who shouldn't be in bankruptcy. This will cause people to think \ntwice before rushing to declare bankruptcy. And that's a very positive \nreform.\n  However, in order to forge a bipartisan compromise, the bill doesn't \nmake ability to repay the only factor in determining whether to \ntransfer or dismiss a case. Instead, each debtor's individual \ncircumstances will be examined. In this way, our bill avoids the \ninjustice which can accompany a crude formula with practically no \nexceptions.\n  I'm also very aware that there have been abuses by creditors using \nharsh and abusive tactics to collect debts from people who have \ndeclared bankruptcy. So, the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act contains an \nentire title--title II--dedicated to enhancing consumer protections by \nrequiring judges to impose stiff penalties for abusive conduct and \nfrivolous court filings. As a strong supporter of rule 11 reform, I \nbelieve that Congress should crack down on groundless court filings \nwhich some creditors have used to harass and intimidate debtors.\n  I also believe that the Grassley-Durbin bill will encourage \nalternative dispute resolution and out-of-court settlements under the \nnew section 707(b), if a creditor refuses to attempt ADR, then a debtor \nwho could otherwise be transferred from chapter 7 to chapter 13 can \nraise this noncooperation as a defense. This will encourage creditors \nto negotiate out-of-court settlements. And that will save court time \nand resources--a goal which I am strongly committed to. I think that \nbringing Bureau of Labor statistics numbers into the bankruptcy code \nfor the first time, as the House bill does, is unprecedented and will \nbreed new and costly litigation. The Grassley-Durbin bill avoids this \nproblem by relying on time-tested bankruptcy provisions to identify \nchapter 7 filers who really need to be in chapter 13 or out of the \nbankruptcy system altogether.\n  This bill is fair and balanced and will implement needed changes \nefficiently and without the uncertainty and new litigation associated \nwith statistical formulas which are completely foreign to the \nbankruptcy code. It will crack down on bankruptcy abuses on both sides \nof the equation. And it will tell those who don't want to take personal \nresponsibility for their debts that the free-ride is over.\n  Finally, the bill also strikes the cap on single asset real estate, a \ngoal which I have long supported. I'm very grateful to Senator Durbin \nfor working with me on this matter, since it really is so important to \nthe health of the commercial banking industry.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1301\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today with my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Grassley, to introduce the Consumer Bankruptcy \nReform Act of 1997. This sensible and bipartisan piece of legislation \nis designed to check many of the serious abuses in the Bankruptcy Code \nwhile maintaining a workable system.\n  Neither Senator Grassley nor I can ignore the evidence that there are \nsome people who are taking advantage of the Bankruptcy Code. Their \nnumbers may not be great, but every abuse undermines confidence in the \ncode. As with all systems, the Bankruptcy Code is subject to abuse. \nPeople can and will manipulate it. Senator Grassley and I have \nintroduced this legislation to attempt to curb many of these abuses. We \nhave worked hard to craft a bill that is balanced--that corrects \ncreditor and debtor abuses. It also attempts to catch abuses without \nbeing so harsh that it makes the system unworkable and without turning \nits back on the fundamental principles and good of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  Hovering in the background of all that we attempt to do in this \nlegislation is the persistent news that personal bankruptcy filings are \nsteadily increasing. Last year, personal bankruptcies broke the 1 \nmillion barrier. And this year will be worse. No one sitting in this \nroom today can help but shudder at the prospect of 1.3 million personal \nbankruptcies this year.\n  The odds are that almost every American knows at least one person who \nhas declared bankruptcy. Both Senator Grassley and I vividly remember \nthe farm crises of the 1980's when good, hard-working people came to \nthe end of the line and were desperately trying to save their homes and \ntheir children's future. So they declared bankruptcy. We also remember \nthe floods that swept through our States not too long ago that left a \nfinancial catastrophe as deep as the natural catastrophe. We must not \nlose sight of these people.\n  This jump in personal bankruptcies in good economic times is \ndistressing, in large measure because it is a sign that many people--\npeople we know--are in trouble.\n  As distasteful as bankruptcy is, the fact remains that we need the \nsystem. We cannot dismantle or radically alter it without doing serious \ndamage to our economy, to creditors, and to millions of individuals. \nThe cold hard fact is that the bankruptcy system does not just help \nindividual debtors. It helps the creditors too. And by and large, it \nworks.\n  To see how, imagine a world where people could not declare bankruptcy \nwhen they were in financial straits. In this world, each individual \ncreditor would have to file suit in State court when the debtor \ndefaulted. Only the first unsecured creditor to the courthouse door \ncould get garnished wages to pay off the debt. The secured creditors \ncould repossess all of the secured property. Meanwhile, all of the \nremaining creditors would get nothing, and the debtor would be left \nwithout an automobile, a home, or any assets and with next to no money \nafter wage garnishment. There would be very few winners in that \nsituation.\n  In stark contrast, the Federal bankruptcy system offers creditors and \ndebtors a comprehensive system--paid for at public expense--which \nattempts to protect the creditors while also giving the debtor a chance \nto restart his\n\n[[Page S10891]]\n\nlife. Without our system, each creditor would be clawing his way \nthrough the State court system, racking up legal costs, achieving \nvirtually nothing, and turning millions of debtors into financial \noutcasts.\n  Some people credit our voluntary individual bankruptcy system to the \nEnglish author Daniel Defoe, who in 1697 proposed something akin to our \ncurrent chapter 7. Defoe made some very wise distinctions. He felt \nthere was a difference between the ``honest debtor, who fails by \nvisible necessity, losses, sickness, decay of trade, or the like'' and \nthe ``knavish, designing, or idle, extravagant debtor, who fails \nbecause wither he has run out his estate in excess, or on purpose to \ncheat and abuse his creditors.''\n  He also had something to say about creditors, praising the ``moderate \ncreditor, who * * * will hear reasonable and just arguments and \nproposals'' while warning against the ``rigorous severe creditor * * * \nwithout compassion, full of ill language, passion, and revenge.''\n  It took almost 150 years for the American Congress to implement \nDefoe's suggestion, although many individual States had acted before \nthen. In 1841, having experienced the Panic of 1837, Daniel Webster \nintroduced and passed a bill that allowed individuals to voluntarily \nfile for bankruptcy and discharge their debts. It is not surprising \nthat the central subject of debate 156 years ago was whether debtors \nwho could actually pay their debts would nevertheless try to avoid them \nby declaring bankruptcy. Some things never change.\n  Even as we focus on the Bankruptcy Code and its possible abuses, \nhowever, we should be very careful that we do not obscure a far more \nimportant and dangerous feature of our consumer economy--the \nproliferation of risky credit. Merely making bankruptcy abuse harder to \nget away with is only a small part of the equation. Another part is \npreventing bankruptcies in the first place by encouraging more \nresponsibility from banks as well as consumers.\n  Let me make this clear, I am happy to root out abuses in bankruptcy \nand to encourage people to repay as much as possible within the \nbankruptcy system. But I insist that I be met half way--that banks and \nconsumers do all they can to encourage healthy lending patterns and \nresponsible money management.\n  Mr. President, we may never be able to fully understand why \nbankruptcies have jumped so much. But a few things are clear. First, \npersonal bankruptcy rates are tied to increased consumer debt burdens. \nThe higher the level of credit card debt a person has, the greater the \nchance that the person will declare bankruptcy. And individual consumer \ndebt is very high. In 1996, consumers charged more than $1 trillion on \ncredit cards. According to the Consumer Federation of America, an \nestimated $374 to $396 billion in debt was being revolved or incurring \ninterest obligations.\n  To most people, accumulating credit cards seems easy and problem \nfree. The waters look awfully enticing when someone sends you a credit \ncard. But there is a dangerous undertow. And as people move further \nfrom the shore, they risk getting caught by the undertow. Essentially \npeople are placing themselves on the edge and not leaving enough of a \nmargin for dealing with an unexpected fiscal calamity.\n  Yet rather than trying to blame anyone for bankruptcies, let us try \nto find a way to avert future bankruptcies. Both halves of the \nbankruptcy equation can and should act more responsibly. For creditors, \nthat means providing consumers with enough information to assess the \nrisks. For debtors, that means taking a hard look at what they can and \ncan't afford.\n  People need to know about the deadly undertow associated with credit \ncard solicitations. Right now people know more about what is in a box \nof cookies by looking at the nutritional label than they know about \ntheir credit cards. We need something like nutritional labels for \ncredit cards.\n  I have previously proposed four important changes to the way people \nget and use credit.\n  First, companies should include in each bill to current cardholders \ninformation that details how long it will take that person paying only \nthe minimum to pay off the credit card debt. In addition, the \ninformation should indicate how much of the overall payment would be \ninterest.\n  Second, companies soliciting customers should provide the potential \ncardholders with an easy-to-understand worksheet to help them determine \nwhether they really can afford more debt. Such a worksheet might \ninclude calculations of a person's expenses--current unsecured debt, \nhome mortgage, rent, and other costs--and a simple formula to help \npeople see whether they can or can't afford another card.\n  Third, companies should tell people the basis of the offer of more \ncredit. When a person gets a preapproved credit card, he or she should \nknow that the credit card company has not fully evaluated how more \nconsumer debt could affect their overall financial health.\n  Finally, credit card companies should provide people who accept their \ncard a free copy of their credit report.\n  These simple things might help quite a bit. Too many people are \nwalking into consumer credit counseling bureaus, bankruptcy lawyers' \noffices, and bankruptcy court without any real understanding of their \nfinancial situation.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude on this note: I am proud to join \nSenator Grassley in introducing this bill and in trying to prevent \nabuses of the Bankruptcy Code. But I believe that we must also work on \nsomething infinitely more constructive--we must try to help prevent \nfinancial catastrophes. What I propose is a small step in that \ndirection which works on the principle that a well informed consumer is \nbest able to protect himself.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FAIRCLOTH (for himself and Mr. Moynihan):\n  S. 1302. A bill to permit certain claims against foreign states to be \nheard in United States courts where the foreign state is a state \nsponsor of international terrorism or where no extradition treaty with \nthe state existed at the time the claim arose and where no other \nadequate and available remedies exist; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n    the foreign sovereign immunity technical corrections act of 1997\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill \ncosponsored by my esteemed colleague, Senator Moynihan. This bill will \nclose a loophole in the law and provide a safeguard for American \ncitizens overseas. Last year, Congress amended the Foreign Sovereign \nImmunities Act to provide a remedy in U.S. courts to American citizens \nwho are victims of acts of torture and terrorism perpetrated by \nterrorist nations.\n\n  The bill I am introducing today would broaden these antiterrorism \nprovisions and send a forceful message to other foreign despots around \nthe world that the United States will not tolerate the abuse of human \nrights of its citizens.\n  Last year's legislation took an important step to deal with the \ncriminal act of terrorism and related human rights protections, \nhowever, because it targeted only those countries on the State \nDepartment's terrorist list, there is no available remedy for Americans \nunder the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act when governments of \ncountries not on the torture list brutalize U.S. citizens.\n  Granted, only a few renegade countries not on the terrorist list \nsystematically engage in torture. But our legislation will put these \ntyrants on notice that the United States will not let a legal \ntechnicality stand in the way of an American citizen bringing suit in \nthe United States against his or her tormentor. These ruthless acts \nshall be judged by a court of law and, ultimately, by the opinions of \nmankind.\n  Mr. President, I urge Congress to close this loophole. To some it may \nseem like a small detail and the circumstances for such an incident may \nseem improbable, but I have first hand knowledge of two incidents of \nsystematic torture, one of which involved a constituent from North \nCarolina living outside the protection of U.S. borders.\n  Mr. Scott Nelson was working in Saudi Arabia in 1984 as a systems \nengineer at King Faisal Specialist Hospital. In the course of his \ninspection duties, Mr. Nelson discovered a severe health hazard \ninvolving the valves that delivered oxygen during various medical \nprocedures. He immediately reported the irregularities to his \nsupervisors,\n\n[[Page S10892]]\n\nand recommended corrective action be taken.\n  To his surprise, Mr. Nelson found his warnings blatantly ignored. \nAfter taking this to the highest managerial level of the hospital, he \nwas summoned to a hospital office, arrested, imprisoned, and ultimately \ninterrogated. When he arrived in the interrogation room, Saudi \nofficials shackled Mr. Nelson and ultimately tortured him, causing \nlifelong disabilities.\n  Mr Nelson was thrown into a rat infested cell where he was denied \nfood, water, and sleep for days. At some point, Mr. Nelson was \npresented a document in Arabic and ordered to sign it. Under a Saudi \nthreat to arrest Mr. Nelson's wife and child, he signed the document.\n  At no time during his 39-day detention was Scott Nelson informed of \nany charges or given the due process right of having his situation \nbrought before a court or tribunal.\n  After 39 days of this most horrible experience, Mr. Nelson was \nreleased. He immediately returned to the United States in grave need of \nmedical treatment and surgery to his left knee. Since that time, he has \nhad five additional surgical procedures.\n  Additionally, Mr. Nelson has been diagnosed with diffuse nerve injury \nand posttraumatic stress disorder with symptoms rated as catastrophic. \nEight physicians and psychologists who have examined Scott are \nunanimous in their judgment that the severe physical and psychological \ninjuries from which he suffers are entirely consistent with his \nallegations of torture.\n  Mr. President, had this torture taken place in Iraq, Libya, North \nKorea, or any of the nations the State Department has designated as \n``terrorist'' states, he would be entitled to seek damages in a United \nStates court. Because Saudi Arabia, like so many other countries, is \nnot officially considered a terrorist nation by our State Department, \nthere is no remedy for American citizens to seek legal redress for \ninjuries resulting from torture.\n  Mr. President, Scott Nelson has suffered enough. It is time for his \ngovernment to provide him with a vehicle for relief. The legislation I \npresent today is a simple and indisputable proposition: The United \nStates shall not tolerate any country in the world to violate the basic \nrights of her citizens. I believe this is legislation that everyone in \nthis body can support without hesitation.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I rise as an original sponsor of \nthe Foreign Sovereign Immunity Technical Corrections Act of 1997. This \nlegislation will extend a provision signed into law as part of the \nAnti-Terrorism Act (Pub. L. 104-132) allowing individuals who are \nvictims of terrorism and other violations of international law to file \nsuit for damages in United States court.\n  The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, enacted in 1976, recognizes \nthat except in the most egregious cases, foreign states are immune from \nsuit by a citizen of the United States. The bill Senator Faircloth and \nI are introducing today establishes the principle that terrorism, \nextrajudicial killing, and other gross abuses of human rights are not \nprotected acts of state and are not entitled to sovereign immunity. \nWhile the Anti-Terrorism Act expanded the Foreign Sovereign Immunities \nAct to allow for suits against countries designated by the Department \nof State as a sponsor of terrorism, this bill would expand the list of \nstates to include countries which do not have an extradition treaty \nwith the United States, or which do not have an adequate available \njudicial remedy. This provision recognizes that while foreign states \nenjoy immunity from most legal action by individuals, there are certain \nfundamental principles of international law that cannot be violated \nwith impunity.\n  Two examples of citizens who would gain legal standing by this \nlegislation are James Smrkovski and Scott Nelson, Americans who were \ntortured by agents of their foreign state employer, a nation not on the \nlist of terrorist states. They survived harrowing experiences only to \nbe barred by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act from even attempting \nto obtain redress. When the United States Supreme Court said that the \nForeign Sovereign Immunities Act did not permit Mr. Nelson any legal \nrecourse, it made clear that a remedy must come from Congress.\n  And so, Mr. President, the Senator from North Carolina [Mr. \nFaircloth] and I are introducing this measure so that Americans who \nhave been victims of terrible crimes perpetrated by foreign governments \nhave legal recourse. I urge my colleagues to support and cosponsor the \nbill, and I hope it can be adopted without undue delay.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Kerrey, and Mr. \n        Murkowski):\n  S. 1303. A bill to encourage the integration of the People's Republic \nof China into the world economy, ensure United States trade interests, \nand establish a strategic working relationship with the People's \nRepublic of China as a responsible member of the world community; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             THE UNITED STATES-CHINA RELATIONS ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am honored to be joined by my \ndistinguished colleagues Senators Hagel, Kerrey, and Murkowski to \nintroduce the United States-China Relations Act of 1997. I would also \nlike to thank Congressman Bereuter whose bill H.R. 1712, we have \nincluded in this act. The United States-China Relations Act of 1997 is \nlegislation that will set us on a course toward more fully integrating \nChina into the international community of nations while protecting our \nnational economic and political interests and preserving our values.\n  We are at a critical juncture in our relations with the People's \nRepublic of China. How we choose to manage China's emergence as a major \nglobal power will profoundly impact the shape of the international \nsystem in the 21st century, a situation not dissimilar to the late 19th \nand early 20th centuries when Germany, Japan, Russia, and the United \nStates emerged to challenge Britain and France for world leadership.\n  British and French diplomacy failed although their task was not an \neasy one. Two terrible wars stained the history of this century. We \nmust try to do better. We must work to establish an acceptable \nframework for peacefully integrating China into the evolving \ninternational economic, security, and political systems. And the core \nquestion is whether to continue on our current path of cooperation and \nintegration or choose the path of containment and isolation.\n  During this session there has been much debate about which direction \nwe should take in our relations with China. Most of the legislation \nthat has been introduced regarding China has assumed the worst, \ncentered on containment, and favored economic sanctions to remedy a \nhost of Chinese transgressions. This policy of containment is \nultimately premised on a view that China will be our next great enemy.\n  Some of my colleagues ask us to pass laws that use punishment as the \nprimary tool in our bilateral relationship. These proposals overlook a \nnumber of realities: the ineffectiveness and unproductiveness of \npunitive legislation in changing China; the importance of maintaining \nand fostering trust and confidence in such an important bilateral \nrelationship; the real potential for retaliation by China; and the \npotential upsides of a constructive relationship with China. \nUltimately, those bills proposing containment of China will neither \nachieve their stated aims of changing China's behavior nor promote \nAmerica's more general national and international interests.\n  The rest of the world will not join us in our effort to isolate \nChina. That makes containment improbable. Our best policy option is to \nwork to integrate China.\n  Before rushing to any conclusions about China's intentions, it is \nhelpful to take a closer look at its development over the past 20 \nyears. China has been engaged in a slow but steady effort to integrate \nitself into existing international systems. It has made efforts to be \nactive in the United Nations, it has participated in a number of \nmultilateral organizations, and has adapted some domestic institutions \nand policies to the demands of the international community.\n  I visited China last March with my friend and distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Connie Mack of Florida, and was struck by the \nrevolutionary changes occurring there. This time the revolution is \nbeing driven not by Mao's\n\n[[Page S10893]]\n\nlittle red book, but by the mass quest for cellular telephones and \npersonal computers, and incidentally, all the personal freedom of \ncommunication that goes with them.\n  The central government in China is still not tolerant of opposition. \nPolitical and religious dissidents are in jail. On the other hand, \naverage Chinese seem to have lost their fear of open and spirited \nconversations with Westerners. And Senator Mack found the Catholic \nchurches during that Holy Week before Easter packed with worshipers.\n  The Chinese Government has undertaken a slow but steady deregulation \nof the economy since it allowed for free enterprise in the countryside \nin 1982. Deregulation and the marketization of the Chinese economy has \nled to unprecedented improvements in the living standards--and \npurchasing power--of ordinary Chinese. In the past 15 years, China's \nper capita GDP has more than tripled, from $889 to $2,923, and is \nforecast to be $4,190 in 2000. Not uncoincidentally, China's demand for \nUnited States exports has increased in similarly substantial leaps. \nUnited States goods and services exports destined for China have \nincreased from $3.7 million in 1980 to $11.1 billion in 1995. China is \nnow America's fifth largest trading partner. Similarly, United States \nforeign direct investment in China has increased significantly.\n  On the other hand, we have a large and growing trade deficit with \nChina that is unacceptable. A prosperous and stable relationship will \nonly continue for as long as we have fair access to China's markets.\n  On balance, China's economic and political reforms are becoming more, \nnot less, consistent with American core values. The transformation of a \nsocialist command economy into a controlled market system has allowed \nfor the emergence of a new class of entrepreneurs and has promoted \nindividuals' freedom to decide what to consume, where to live, what to \ndo as a livelihood. The State sector of the economy has steadily \ndeclined, and increasing numbers of Chinese now work for employers that \ndo not answer directly to the central government or the Communist \nParty. This means that the Communist Party's ability to control and \nmonitor individual's social, political, and economic lives has \ndiminished substantially. Explicit political reforms have been fewer, \nbut today there are more local elections being held in China than at \nany other time in its modern history. The legal system has been \nreinvented over the past two decades, and has seen in recent years \nsubstantial, though still inadequate, improvements in criminal \nprocedure and judicial review of administrative abuses. It can be said \nin summary that, the reforms of the past two decades have led to \nincreased personal liberty, a strengthened legal system, and the \nbeginnings of a civil society, although there is still a very long way \nto go.\n\n  In the clearest and most significant vote about China this year, a \nbipartisan majority in the House of Representatives chose to continue \nChina's most-favored-nation trade status. But, after the vote, a flurry \nof bills were introduced expressing congressional opposition to China's \neconomic, military, and human rights record. It is unfortunate that the \nCongress is sending mixed messages about this very important bilateral \nrelationship.\n  To encourage China's current path of reform and development and to \nhelp ensure that China's inevitable transformation into a global \neconomic and strategic power occurs in a way not adverse to United \nStates interests or values, the United States must have an active China \npolicy that aims at integration instead of isolation, and relies on \ncarrots rather than sticks.\n  To ensure that our economic interests are met, we need to encourage \nChina's increasing integration into international trade and investment \nregimes on commercially viable terms. This should help promote further \nliberalization of the Chinese economy while at the same time increasing \nAmerican access to China's markets and thus decreasing the United \nStates-China trade deficit. At the same time, the United States \nGovernment can more actively promote bilateral economic ties with those \nregions in China where human rights and labor conditions have shown \nimprovement. Moreover, we should at every opportunity encourage China \nin the research and development of new energy efficiency and renewable \nenergy technologies.\n  China's integration in international regimes also promotes American \nstrategic interests. The bilateral strategic relationship can be \nstrengthened, however, by developing closer exchanges with the Chinese \nmilitary leadership. By opening ongoing lines of communication with the \nmilitary, we will be in a better position to obtain accurate \ninformation about China's military modernization program. Through such \nproactive measures we will be in a better position to make Beijing more \naccountable for its strategic weapons exports.\n  It is time for Congress to end the ambivalence and build a consensus \nfor a new China policy. Toward that end, along with my distinguished \ncolleagues Senators Hagel, Kerrey, and Murkowski, I am today \nintroducing the United States-China Relations Act of 1997.\n  This legislation assumes that China will emerge as a superpower in \nthe coming decades and become a nation with which the United States can \nand must have cooperative relationships --and that our relationships \nwill be more cooperative if our economic, strategic, human rights, and \nenvironmental relations are viewed as distinct components of a larger, \nmutually-beneficial whole. It is based on a conclusion that China today \nis different from the China of the Cultural Revolution two decades ago \nand the China of Tiananmen Square a decade ago.\n  Here are some of the key provisions of the United States-China \nRelations Act of 1997:\n  Require an annual accounting of our economic relationship with China. \nDespite the growing significance of our trade relationship, barriers to \nU.S. exports should not be tolerated. The President would be required \nto submit an annual Economic Balance of Benefits Study to the Congress. \nThe report would analyze the impact of existing bilateral trade \nagreements with China on United States employment, balance of trade, \nand United States international competitiveness.\n  Encourage China's integration into multilateral economic \norganizations. Just as it is important to have enforcement sticks, \nthere should be carrots to encourage China's international economic \nintegration. The bill requires the President to develop criteria for \nsupport of China's participation in the Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development and G-7 meetings, two groups that China is \nfar from being accepted into, but in which it aspires to membership.\n  Give China permanent MFN upon accession to the WTO. First, I would \nlike to credit Congressman Bereuter for this innovative idea. This \nprovision seeks to induce China to grant United States exporters \nadequate trade benefits and/or make significant progress toward WTO \nmembership by authorizing a tariff increase on imports from China if \nthose conditions are not met and by granting permanent MFN status once \nChina becomes a WTO member.\n  Require greater information on energy and national security issues. \nThe President should establish a bilateral United States-China \ncommittee on energy security and one for food security. These \ncommittees would help develop a bilateral policy for securing a stable \nsupply of energy from politically volatile regions and securing food \nfor China's large population. The bill also includes a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution that the President and Congress continue to expand \ncontact and exchanges between United States and Chinese national \nsecurity personnel.\n  Establish a commission to promote the rule of law, respect for \nindividual rights, religious tolerance, and civil society in China. \nThis includes a bilateral commission on human rights with China; an \nexchange of legal professionals, government staff and religious \nleaders; and multilateral action on human and workers' rights. This \nlast provision would include a prisoner information registry with \ninformation on all political prisoners, prisoners of conscience and \nprisoners of faith. The commission could recommend the imposition of \nspecified sanctions to the President for human rights violations.\n  There is one provision more than any other that characterizes the \ntone and thrust of this act. It calls for the formation of a commission \nto prepare a profile of China province by province.\n\n[[Page S10894]]\n\n This profile then would serve as a basis for consideration of \ntransactions with China by the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas \nPrivate Investment Corporation in those identified provinces.\n  This provision is particularly helpful in improving and strengthening \nour relations with China. By opening up OPIC programs to regions that \nhave acceptable human rights, labor, and environmental standards, we \nare increasing investment into China at the same time we are advancing \nour values. It is a provision that encourages China to improve its \nhuman rights record without punitive economic sanctions. It uses a \ncarrot instead of a stick.\n  America's economic and strategic interests, as well as our \nfundamental values, are best served by encouraging China on its path of \neconomic and political reform.\n  China's geopolitical and economic rise are inevitable developments. \nHow we react to China's transformation and manage the bilateral \nrelationship, however, is within our discretion. United States-China \nrelations are at a critical turning point, and the real challenge \nbefore us now is how to peacefully integrate China into the world \ncommunity, and work with China to ensure world prosperity and stability \nin the 21st century.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the United States-China \nRelations Act of 1997 which I am proud to introduce with Senators \nHagel, Kerrey, and Murkowski be placed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1303\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The People's Republic of China is the world's tenth \n     largest trading nation and the United States' fifth largest \n     trading partner. United States exports to the People's \n     Republic of China have quadrupled over the past decade. At \n     least 170,000 Americans owe their jobs to United States \n     exports to the People's Republic of China. Jobs related to \n     exported goods, on average, pay 13 to 16 percent more than \n     nonexport related jobs.\n       (2) The United States is the People's Republic of China's \n     largest export market. United States imports from the \n     People's Republic of China were nearly $51,500,000,000 in \n     1996 (or nearly 25 percent of the exports of the People's \n     Republic of China). By contrast, United States exports of \n     goods to the People's Republic of China stood at only \n     $12,000,000,000. While the large trade deficit with the \n     People's Republic of China is the result of many factors, the \n     People's Republic of China's multiple, overlapping barriers \n     to trade and investments are a serious concern.\n       (3) In the coming decade, the rapid economic expansion of \n     the People's Republic of China will exert a powerful \n     influence on the global economy. In order to be constructive, \n     the emergence of the People's Republic of China as an \n     economic power should be compatible with the existing \n     multilateral economic regime.\n       (4) Since the bilateral Memorandum of Understanding between \n     the United States and the People's Republic of China signed \n     in October 1992, the People's Republic of China has \n     eliminated import restrictions on more than 1,000 tariff \n     categories and opened its market to computers, heavy \n     machinery, and pharmaceutical products.\n       (5) However, the People's Republic of China still maintains \n     many barriers to the sale of foreign products and United \n     States firms still do not have access comparable to that \n     which the People's Republic of China enjoys in the United \n     States. Sectors such as agriculture, telecommunications, \n     insurance, distribution, audio-visual, advertising, and \n     maintenance and repair need to be opened to international \n     trade.\n       (6) Since 1995, the People's Republic of China has made \n     significant progress in concluding agreements in the \n     enforcement of intellectual property rights.\n       (7) Despite significant improvements in enforcement, \n     serious problems still remain. Piracy of computer software \n     remains at high levels. While market access for copyrighted \n     products has improved, further improvement is required for \n     legitimate products to be available to meet market demand.\n\n     SEC. 102. STATEMENTS OF POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to encourage a fair and equitable economic relationship \n     that ensures equal market access between the United States \n     and the People's Republic of China;\n       (2) to support the accession of the People's Republic of \n     China to the World Trade Organization on commercially viable \n     terms, which include commitments on opening up the \n     agricultural market of the People's Republic of China, \n     concessions on trading rights, lower tariffs, access to \n     distribution networks, and elimination of import inhibiting \n     standards;\n       (3) for importers of goods or services to affirm that such \n     products or services were not manufactured or procured in a \n     manner inconsistent with United States law or otherwise \n     incompatible with the values of the United States; and\n       (4) for United States persons conducting business in the \n     People's Republic of China to refrain from using oppressive \n     instrumentalities of the state to oppose worker's efforts to \n     organize.\n\n     SEC. 103. REPORTS TO CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the Trade \n     Representative shall, in consultation with the International \n     Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce, prepare and \n     submit to Congress a study showing the economic benefits that \n     existing bilateral trade agreements between the United States \n     and the People's Republic of China have on United States \n     employment, balance of trade, and international \n     competitiveness.\n       (b) Military Activities.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of State, in consultation \n     with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Commerce, and \n     the head of any other appropriate intelligence agencies, \n     shall, not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, and annually thereafter, prepare and submit to \n     Congress a report on the commercial activities of the \n     People's Liberation Army in the United States and the \n     People's Republic of China. The report shall highlight the \n     activities that provide off-budget revenue for military \n     modernization.\n       (2) Confidentiality.--The Secretary of Defense, the \n     Secretary of Commerce, and the\n\n[[Page S10895]]\n\n     head of any intelligence agency may separately submit \n     information regarding the report to Congress in confidence if \n     such Secretary or agency head considers confidentiality \n     appropriate.\n\n     SEC. 104. BILATERAL ECONOMIC RELATIONS.\n\n       (a) Investment Treaty.--Not later than 180 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Trade Representative shall \n     assess the feasibility of entering into a bilateral \n     investment treaty with the People's Republic of China and \n     shall advise Congress of the results of the assessment.\n       (b) Tax Treaty.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     assess the feasibility of entering into a bilateral tax \n     treaty with the People's Republic of China and shall advise \n     Congress of the results of the assessment.\n       (c) Report on Joint Commissions.--\n       (1) Review.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the President \n     shall review the functions and objectives of each United \n     States-China Joint Commission and shall submit for \n     congressional review a program plan that identifies the \n     objectives of each Commission and the resources required to \n     achieve those objectives.\n       (2) Joint commissions.--For purposes of this subsection, \n     the term ``United States-China Joint Commission'' means--\n       (A) the United States-China Joint Commission on Commerce \n     and Trade,\n       (B) the United States-China Joint Economic Commission, and\n       (C) the United States-China Joint Commission on Science and \n     Technology.\n\n     SEC. 105. MULTILATERAL ECONOMIC RELATIONS.\n\n       (a) Statement of Purpose.--It is the purpose of this \n     section--\n       (1) to authorize the President of the United States to \n     raise tariffs on imports from the People's Republic of China \n     to tariff levels in effect on December 31, 1994, if the \n     President determines, upon the expiration of the 1979 United \n     States bilateral agreement with the People's Republic of \n     China, that the People's Republic of China is either denying \n     adequate trade benefits to the United States or not taking \n     steps to become a full member of the World Trade \n     Organization;\n       (2) to provide a significant incentive for the People's \n     Republic of China to gain admission to the World Trade \n     Organization by eliminating the annual review of China's \n     trade status after it commits to a commercially acceptable \n     protocol and is admitted to the World Trade Organization;

CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States and the People's Republic of China \n     share mutual security interests in the Asia Pacific region \n     (including the Korean peninsula) as well as other areas of \n     the world such as the Middle East.\n       (2) While the People's Liberation Army poses no direct \n     military threat to the United States now, its sales of \n     weapons and weapons technology to sponsors of terrorism, such \n     as Iran, endangers the regional stability and global \n     interests of the United States.\n       (3) The People's Liberation Army is engaging in a military \n     buildup and an aggressive military modernization program, for \n     undisclosed purposes. In fact since 1992, military spending \n     by the People's Republic of China has doubled.\n       (4) The People's Liberation Army is engaging in commercial \n     activities both at home and abroad. The revenues from these \n     commercial activities are used for military expenditures and \n     obscure actual military expenditures by the People's Republic \n     of China.\n       (5) In March 1996, the People's Republic of China \n     demonstrated its capacity to blockade the international \n     shipping lanes of the Taiwan Strait and the air space over \n     Taiwan by the repeated launches of M-9 ballistic missiles in \n     the South China Sea.\n       (6) In May 1996, Poly Technologies, a People's Liberation \n     Army enterprise, and Norinco, a Chinese civilian defense \n     company, attempted to smuggle 2,000 AK-47's into Oakland, \n     California and offered to sell to Federal undercover agents \n     300,000 machine guns with silencers, 66mm mortars, hand \n     grenades, and Red Parakeet surface-to-air missiles.\n       (7) The People's Liberation Army's buildup, modernization, \n     and economic activities may pose a regional threat and a \n     threat to broader United States interests in the future \n     unless greater efforts are made to increase communication and \n     transparency of process.\n\n     SEC. 202. STATEMENTS OF POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to encourage the political and military integration of \n     the People's Republic of China into the Asia Pacific region \n     and the larger global community of nations;\n       (2) to maintain a strong United States presence in the Asia \n     Pacific region and to encourage cooperation between the \n     United States, the People's Republic of China, and other \n     nations;\n       (3) to encourage transparency in military funding in the \n     People's Republic of China to the greatest extent possible; \n     and\n       (4) to engage in confidence building measures between the \n     United States and the People's Republic of China in order to \n     reduce the risk of unintended conflict.\n\n     SEC. 203.

BILATERAL STRATEGIC RELATIONS.\n\n       (a) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the President should continue and expand contact and \n     exchanges between national security personnel from the United \n     States and of the People's Republic of China.\n       (b) Energy Bilateral.--The President shall take steps to \n     establish a bilateral committee with the People's Republic of \n     China in order to begin a dialogue relating to the \n     maintenance of stability in regions where there are energy \n     resources of mutual interest to the United States and the \n     People's Republic of China.\n       (c) Food Bilateral.--The President shall take steps to \n     establish a bilateral committee with the People's Republic of \n     China in order to begin a dialogue relating to--\n       (1) common interests in the People's Republic of China's \n     securing a stable and adequate supply of food, and\n\n[[Page S10897]]\n\n       (2) the interests of the United States as a supplier of \n     food to the People's Republic of China.\n\n     SEC. 205. MULTILATERAL STRATEGIC RELATIONS.\n\n       The President shall take steps to establish a multilateral \n     risk reduction protocol with the People's Republic of China \n     and other governments in East Asia. The protocol shall \n     provide policies and procedures that include--\n       (1) establishing a line of direct communication between \n     Washington and the People's Republic of China; and\n       (2) developing a protocol for naval encounters in \n     international waters.\n\n     SEC. 206. ENFORCEMENT OF THE IRAN-IRAQ NON-PROLIFERATION ACT.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the security and \n     stability of the Near East is threatened by any augmentation \n     of weapons inventories by Iran and Iraq and the President \n     should vigilantly enforce the provisions of the Iran-Iraq \n     Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992.\n                        TITLE III--HUMAN RIGHTS\n                     Subtitle A--General Provisions\n\n     SEC. 301. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Congress concurs in the following conclusions of the \n     Department of State regarding human rights in the People's \n     Republic of China:\n       (A) The Government of the People's Republic of China has \n     ``continued to commit widespread and well documented human \n     rights abuses, in violation of internationally accepted \n     norms, stemming from the authorities intolerance of dissent, \n     fear of unrest, and the absence and inadequacy of laws \n     protecting basic freedoms.''\n       (B) Nonapproved religious groups, including Protestant and \n     Catholic groups, experienced intensified repression.\n       (C) Overall in 1996, the authorities stepped up efforts to \n     cut off expressions of protest or criticism. No dissidents \n     were known to be active at year's end.\n       (2) Despite public assurances by the People's Republic of \n     China that it would abide by the principles of the Universal \n     Declaration of Human Rights and despite the United Nations \n     charter requirements that all members promote respect for and \n     observe basic human rights, the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China continues to place severe restrictions on \n     religious expression and practice.\n\n     SEC. 302. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to encourage the People's Republic of China to adhere \n     to internationally accepted norms for the rule of law, human \n     rights, and worker rights; and\n       (2) to develop a consistent multilateral response to the \n     record of the People's Republic of China on human rights and \n     worker rights.\n\n     SEC. 303. RADIO FREE ASIA; NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR DEMOCRACY.\n\n       (a) Radio Free Asia.--The President shall direct the \n     Director of the United States Information Agency and the \n     Board of Broadcasting Governors to increase the broadcast \n     hours of the Voice of America and Radio Free Asia to the \n     People's Republic of China and to broadcast to the People's \n     Republic of China in multiple Chinese dialects.\n       (b) National Endowment for Democracy.--In addition to such \n     sums as are otherwise authorized to be appropriated for \n     fiscal year 1998 for grants to the National Endowment for \n     Democracy, there is authorized to be appropriated for fiscal \n     year 1998, $1,000,000 for grants to the National Endowment \n     for Democracy which shall be available only for purposes of \n     programs relating to the People's Republic of China.\n\n     SEC. 304.

RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       Nothing in this resolution shall be construed to place the \n     National EMS Memorial Service under Federal authority or to \n     require any expenditure of Federal funds.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution for \nmyself and the two Senators from Virginia, honoring emergency medical \nservices [EMS] personnel across the country. I was asked by Martin \nSinger, chief of the bureau of emergency medical services in New \nHampshire, to submit this resolution, recognizing this important annual \nevent. I am pleased to be joined by my two colleagues from Virginia, \nMr. Warner and Mr. Robb, as original cosponsors.\n  In 1993, the Virginia Association of Volunteer Rescue Squads, Inc., \nand the Stanley Wise Foundation organized the first annual National \nEmergency Medical Services Memorial Service in Roanoke, VA. As the \nfirst State in the Nation to have a volunteer rescue squad, Virginia \nhas taken the lead in recognizing the importance of these members of \nour communities both through the establishment of a museum devoted to \nEMS personnel called To The Rescue and now a memorial service to honor \nthose EMS personnel who have died in the line of duty. They have opened \ntheir doors to communities across the Nation giving them the \nopportunity to honor these selfless individuals. It is time now that \nwe, as a Nation, recognize Virginia's efforts and let EMS personnel \nacross the country know that we appreciate their efforts and honor \nthose who have given their lives to save the lives of others with this \nnational memorial service.\n  The memorial service which has been held in Virginia annually for 5 \nyears has now honored 119 EMS personnel from 35 States. My own State of \nNew Hampshire has had three providers who had served our State honored \nfor their extraordinary service. Most recently, in the ceremony held on \nMay 24, 1997, Mr. Lawrence A. Volz of Newington, NH was honored. Mr. \nVolz lost his life in 1971 at age 48 while driving a community \nambulance. This memorial service lets the family and friends of these \nvery important people know that the ultimate sacrifice made by their \nloved ones for their fellow man is recognized and honored.\n  It is my hope that the introduction of this resolution will make this \nvery special service more widely recognized by the country as a whole \nto let all EMS personnel know that their dedication and contributions \nto their communities are greatly appreciated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/21/senate-section/article/S10898-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SENATE RESOLUTION 137--TO AUTHORIZE TESTIMONY\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

R. NOEL LONGUEMARE\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nprofessionalism, dedication, vision, and public service of Mr. R. Noel \nLonguemare, who is retiring from the Department of Defense [DOD] after \nserving 4 years as the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for \nAcquisition and Technology, and most recently as the Acting Under \nSecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology.\n  Mr. Longuemare's tireless support for improved acquisition management \npractices, work force empowerment, and reduced life cycle support costs \ndramatically improved the DOD's acquisition management. He was \ninstrumental in establishing Integrated Product Teams [IPT's] in all \nacquisition decisionmaking activities within the acquisition community. \nAs the acquisition work force has been significantly reduced, IPT's \nhave enabled commands to focus their expertise and to empower their \nmanagers in ways unmatched by traditional, functionally aligned \norganizations. Through his emphasis on IPT's, he has generated a \nclimate of cooperative problem solving between industry and its DOD \ncustomers.\n  Along with IPT's, Mr. Longuemare led the efforts to redefine the ways \nin which DOD specifies the products it acquires. He was the driving \nforce in the shift to performance specifications for complex defense \narticles. Through his\n\n[[Page S10900]]\n\nemphasis on what new systems should do rather than how they should \nlook, industry has enjoyed unparalleled opportunities to bring \ntechnical creativity to bear on the most complex requirements. Mr. \nLonguemare successfully ushered the reform of military specifications \nand standards. In fact, nearly 2,700 specifications and standards have \nbeen rescinded as formal acquisition requirements since the program's \ninception. Thus, barriers to industry's own rate of technology \nacceleration have eroded, and industry continues to improve the way \nthey do business with the Department of Defense.\n  In addition to his leadership through difficult institutional \nchanges, Mr. Longuemare personally pioneered many innovative \nacquisition concepts such as cost as an independent variable [CAIV] and \nthe single process initiative [SPI]. CAIV provides program managers and \nengineers a practical method for treating cost as a true systems design \ncriterion, and it directly supports the DOD transition to performance \nspecifications. The SPI approach, which replaces separate Government \nand commercial processes, is one of the most powerful techniques \navailable for reducing overhead and accelerating process proficiency.\n  Mr. Longuemare has been a champion within the DOD for more effective \ncommunications. He initiated a systems engineering directorate to \nbetter define this crucial, but often elusive, discipline within the \nacquisition system. He advocated continuing education for the \nacquisition work force and fostered significantly improved coordination \nbetween the military departments, particularly in the requirements \ndefinition process.\n  Mr. President, the work of this exceptional public servant will \ncontinue to have a lasting impact on the DOD for many years to come. \nMr. Longuemare has rightly earned the highest respect of all who know \nhim in Congress, the DOD, and private industry. I ask my colleagues to \njoin me in extending the Senate's best wishes to Noel, his wife Julie, \nand their daughter Maria.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/21/senate-section/article/S10899-4", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     OUTRAGE OVER MALAYSIAN REMARKS\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to express my outrage \nand disgust at recent comments by Dr. Mahathir Mohamad, the Prime \nMinister of Malaysia. According to reports by official Malaysian news \nagencies, the Associated Press, and Reuters, Dr. Mahathir speculated \nlast week that the collapse of Malaysian currency and the subsequent \nturmoil in its stock market may have been the result of an \ninternational Jewish conspiracy to oppress his predominately Muslim \nnation.\n  Malaysia is in the midst of an economic crisis. Its currency, the \nRinggit, has depreciated over 25 percent, which has sent its stock \nmarket to all-time lows. The Prime Minister has blamed the crisis on \ncurrency speculators, most notably the famous hedge fund manager George \nSoros, who is Jewish. Soros has denied trading extensively in the \nRinggit and most financial analysts agree that currency traders could \nnot have triggered the Ringgit crisis.\n  I do not want to mischaracterize Dr. Mahathir's remarks, so I will \nquote them directly, as reported by the Associated Press. According to \nthe AP, Dr. Mahathir said, ``The Jews robbed the Palestinians of \neverything, but in Malaysia they could not do so, hence they do this, \ndepress the Ringgit.''\n  Referring to the economic progress made by Malaysia over the past \ndecade, Dr. Mahathir said, ``Incidentally, we are Muslims, and the Jews \nare not happy to see the Muslims progress.'' Finally, he speculated \nabout a global anti-Malaysian conspiracy saying, ``We may suspect that \nthey [Jews] have an agenda, but we do not want to accuse.''\n  Mr. President, I was shocked by these comments. They are patently \noutrageous, hateful, and blatantly anti-Semitic. I thought it \nappropriate that the Simon Wiesenthal Center, which is based in Los \nAngeles, immediately demanded a clarification from the Malaysian \nGovernment.\n  Today, the Simon Wiesenthal Center shared with me a letter it \nreceived from Hashim Makaruddin, Press Secretary to the Prime Minister. \nRather than clarify Dr. Mahathir's remarks, Mr. Makaruddin's letter \nconfirms a hostile attitude among Malaysia's leaders.\n  Mr. Makaruddin denies that the Prime Minister specifically alleged a \nJewish conspiracy to stifle Malaysia's economic growth. He writes that \nDr. Mahathir ``was merely explaining that the currency crisis now being \nfaced by Malaysia was the doing of George Soros, who is a Jew, and that \namong the victims which suffered were Malaysia and Indonesia, which are \nMuslim countries. Because coincidentally Mr. Soros is a Jew and \nMalaysia and Indonesia are Muslim countries, there are people who \nthought that this currency manipulation was a Jewish `conspiracy' \nagainst the Muslim countries. This was what Dr. Mahathir told the crowd \nat the rally.''\n  Mr. President, in other words, the Prime Minister's explanation is \nthat he was not advancing his own anti-Semitic views, he was simply \nrepeating the anti-Semitic conspiracy theories advanced by others \nwithout refuting them. Clearly, it is wrong for any government leader \nto lend official credence to such anti-Semitic views by repeating them \nat a widely attended rally.\n  I find Mr. Makaruddin's explanation of the Prime Minister's remarks \nwholly unsatisfactory.\n  I call on Prime Minister Mahathir to apologize to those who have \ntaken offense at his remarks. I do not believe any other course of \naction can undo the damage done by these hateful and irresponsible \ncomments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/21/senate-section/article/S10900-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10900-S10901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             JOE CENARRUSA\n\n Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, integrity. That one word \nencompasses the life of Joe Cenarrusa. Today, family, friends, and the \npeople of Idaho bid farewell to a man filled with integrity whose life \nended tragically on September 9, 1997.\n  Joe Cenarrusa, the son of Idaho Secretary of State Pete Cenarrusa and \nhis wife Freda, was first and foremost a family man. But he was also a \nsuccessful businessman who was very active in his community.\n  Joe Cenarrusa was born on the family ranch in Carey, ID. He was Pete \nand Freda Cenarrusa's only son. Joe had a love for flying--a love which \nhe inherited from his father who was a Marine fighter pilot during \nWorld War II. At the age of 4, Joe would sit on his father's lap in the \ncockpit and Pete would let him take over the controls. It was clear \nfrom that early age that Joe would continue to soar to new heights.\n  The day he turned 16, Joe took his first solo flight. He then took \nhis FAA check rides for the instrument, commercial, and airline \ntransport ratings on the days he became age-eligible for them. Joe \ngraduated from the University of Idaho where he was a flight instructor \nand was also active in the skydiving club.\n  In 1974, he returned home to take over the ranch. He brought with him \nnew ideas and innovative techniques which turned the operation into one \nof the most successful livestock operations in Idaho.\n  Joe Cenarrusa never shied away from a challenge. ``You just can't \ntake; you also have to give.'' That's how Joe lived his life, always \nfinding ways to give back to his community--especially for causes that \nhelped children.\n  Joe felt every child needed a bicycle. A young child riding a bike \nwas only natural, but there were some children in the community whose \nfamilies couldn't afford bikes. So Joe decided to do something about \nthat. As the owner of Red Robin Restaurants, Joe would offer deluxe \nhamburgers for anyone who would donate a bicycle. Those bikes would be \nrefurbished by a friend, Mike Cooley, and then donated to needy \nchildren at the start of each school year. ``Burgers For Bicycles'' was \na program that made Joe happy. It made his friend Mike Cooley happy. \nAnd it made thousands of schoolchildren happy each fall.\n  Joe also had a place in his heart for battered and neglected children \nwho ended up at the Hays Shelter Home. He'd bring the children and \nstaff from the home down to his restaurant once a week and let them \norder whatever they wanted off the menu--including dessert. What a \nwonderful opportunity and a very visible sign to these neglected \nchildren that someone in their community cared.\n  Joe is remembered as a ``good, decent man, a visionary, a man of \nintegrity, a man who loved his family, and a man\n\n[[Page S10901]]\n\nwho, in the best tradition of America, gave generously to his \ncommunity.'' He never lost sight of his Basque values. He understood \nthe value of hard work, and he learned at an early age the importance \nof honor and integrity.\n  The measure of this man is reflected in the mission statement for his \ncompany which reads, ``We are a company committed to creating \nopportunities for success.'' Joe Cenarrusa's life was committed to \nhelping all around him succeed. And for that, each of us who knew Joe \nhave lived a richer life. My prayers are with his parents Pete and \nFreda, his wife Jean, and their two sons, Andy and Tyler.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/21/senate-section/article/S10900-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO THE COMMITTEE OF 200\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay special tribute \nto the Committee of 200, a distinguished professional women's \norganization headquartered in my home State, on the occasion of its \n15th anniversary the week beginning October 20.\n  The Committee of 200 is dedicated to promoting entrepreneurship and \ncorporate leadership among women of this generation and the next. The \ncommittee is comprised of 370 members from the United States and \nabroad, representing 70 different industries. Each member is an \naccomplished businesswoman, including entrepreneurs whose companies \ngenerate annual revenue of $10 million or greater and U.S. corporate \nexecutives who manage divisions that produce more than $50 million in \nannual revenue.\n  Recognizing the needs of young women who will soon be entering the \nbusiness world, the Committee of 200 established a foundation in 1986 \nto enhance its outreach activities. This foundation provides important \nassistance and scholarships for women business students and provides \ngrants to foster entrepreneurship among young women.\n  The Committee of 200 exemplifies the spirit of American business, \npromoting entrepreneurship, corporate innovation, and community \nawareness. It supports the careers of young women by giving them the \ntools to complete effectively in an intensely competitive environment.\n  Mr. President, the Committee of 200 has provided critical support \nservices over the last 15 years to business leaders and business \nstudents. It has distinguished itself as a preeminent professional \norganization for women. I am confident that over the next 15 years, the \ncommittee will continue to be a credit to American businesses and women \ncorporate leaders. I want to congratulate all the members of the \nCommittee of 200 as they celebrate this important milestone in the \norganization's history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/21/senate-section/article/S10901-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ASTRONAUT JERRY LINENGER\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Dr. \nJerry Linenger and his wife Kathryn and sons John and Jeffrey as they \ncelebrate their homecoming to Eastpointe, MI.\n  Astronaut Jerry Linenger has traveled a little farther than just the \nends of the Earth. Having been a crewmember of STS-64 aboard the Space \nShuttle Discovery and the recent STS-81 and STS-84 missions of the \nSpace Shuttle Atlantis, and a resident aboard the Russian Mir Space \nStation, Dr. Linenger has logged a total of 142 days in outerspace, \nclearly, he exemplifies the spirit of a modern-day American pioneer.\n  Dr. Linenger has made a profession of reaching for the stars, and now \nspends much of his time sharing his experience with the people of \nMichigan and of this great Nation. By bringing the stars to Earth, Dr. \nLinenger has inspired young minds to look beyond their immediate \nsurroundings and has offered them a vision of an even greater future.\n  Tonight, there is no doubt a young Dr. Linenger in the audience. As a \ngraduate of East Detroit High School, at one time walking in your \nshoes, he has shown us what can happen with hard work and commitment \ntoward a goal. I encourage you to view Dr. Linenger's accomplishments \nwith the thought in mind that you too may someday share the same \nexperience.\n  With all of his educational, personal and professional \naccomplishments, Dr. Linenger has truly proven to be an American hero \nfor his family, friends, all citizens of Michigan, especially the \ncitizens of the city of Eastpointe.\n  On behalf of the U.S. Senate, I congratulate Dr. Linenger and his \nfamily and wish them the best of luck in their future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/21/senate-section/article/S10901-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n JANE ALEXANDER'S RESIGNATION FROM THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Jane \nAlexander on her tenure as Chairperson of the National Endowment for \nthe Arts. Just a few days ago, she announced her resignation from the \nNEA and her plan to return to private life. I am truly saddened that \nthe NEA will lose such a strong and respected leader and that the \nNation will lose one of its most articulate and effective champions in \nthe effort to preserve the NEA.\n  I am proud to be a strong supporter of the arts. It is clear that \nfuture generations will remember us not for our gross national product \nor our stockpile of advanced weapons, but for the content of the \nartistic and cultural expression that characterizes our civilization. \nThe arts give us an opportunity to leave our mark on history.\n  Jane Alexander's tenure has not been easy. Her term has spanned four \nof the most challenging years in the NEA's history, filled with annual \nfights over its survival. Each year we have seen assaults mounted on \nthe arts and the NEA in particular. But the supporters of the arts in \nthe Congress have met each of these challenges and emerged victorious \nthanks to the leadership of Jane Alexander.\n  Perhaps as important as her leadership in these legislative battles \nhas been her efforts throughout the country as an articulate voice in \nsupport of the arts and a Federal role in supporting the arts. She has \nvisited schools and community centers as well as theaters and galleries \nacross the country and has reminded Americans of the strength and \nimportance of the arts.\n  Beyond these efforts on the national scene, she has proved an able \nand adept manager of the NEA. She has implemented the mandated staff \ncuts at the NEA and restructured the agency without compromising its \nmission. She has compensated for fewer resources by forming \npartnerships with other agencies and encouraging all arts organizations \nto work more closely together. In addition, under her leadership, \ngrant-making processes have been reorganized, accountability measures \nhave been put in place, investments in arts education have increased, \nand new communication tools including a website have been developed.\n  From the stage and the big screen to the halls of Congress, Jane \nAlexander has proven she is a remarkable individual, a great voice for \nthe arts in America, and a true national treasure. I thank her for her \ndedication and her tireless efforts, and I wish her the best of luck in \nher future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/21/senate-section/article/S10901-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10901-S10902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS MARKET ACCESS ACT\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would like to add my name as a \ncosponsor to S. 219, the Agricultural Products Market Access Act of \n1997 and to commend Senators Grassley and Daschle for their excellent \nwork on behalf of American agricultural exports.\n  S. 219 will set up a system for agricultural trade identical to that \nused to identify violations of intellectual property rights--the \n``Special 301'' procedure. Specifically, the bill requires the Office \nof the U.S. Trade Representative to annually designate as priority \ncountries those trading partners having the most egregious trade \nbarriers to U.S. agricultural products. USTR would then initiate a \nstreamlined 301 investigation of the trade practices of those countries \nidentified to determine whether their agricultural trade barriers merit \nsanctions or other retaliatory actions.\n  As many of my colleagues know, my home State of Washington is a major \nproducer and exporter of agricultural products. In fact, agriculture is \nWashington's No. 1 industry employing well over 100,000 people directly \nand accounting for 20 percent of the State's total exports. I and my \nconstituents, however, are continually frustrated by the unfair and \nirrational barriers erected to our agricultural exports in countries \nthroughout the world.\n\n[[Page S10902]]\n\n  The most recent example is Mexico's imposition of a 101.1-percent \nprohibitive duty on red delicious and golden delicious apples. This \ntariff hike is based on claims by Mexican apple farmers that United \nStates producers are selling apples to Mexico at half the fair price. \nThere is no factual basis for these claims, yet Mexico has successfully \nclosed the United States-Mexico border to apples and cut Washington \napple producers off from their largest export market. The \nadministration has pledged to work to resolve this impasse, but the \nprocess is likely to be long and hard fought with no guarantee of a \nsolution through the NAFTA or WTO dispute resolution process.\n  Japan too has continually used protectionist measures to lock \nWashington apples out of its domestic market. On questionable \nphytosanitary grounds, Japan has erected barrier after barrier to \nWashington apples. Under the current protocol for the export of apples \nto Japan, only red delicious and golden delicious varieties may be \nshipped to Japan. Since the Japanese market was first opened to United \nStates apples in 1994, Japan has required the cold treatment and \nfumigation of all United States apples. While scientific data supports \nthe United States contention that this type of treatment is \nunnecessary, Japan insists on subjecting all additional United States \napple varieties to the same costly and time-consuming tests.\n  Washington's wheat exports also face formidable export barriers. \nSince 1972, the People's Republic of China has maintained a nontariff \nbarrier on Pacific Northwest wheat affected by TCK smut. Over the past \n20 years, the United States has presented Chinese officials with \nscientific evidence that conclusively shows there is no risk of \nintroducing this smut into China, but the Chinese Government refuses to \nbudge. The continued ban on our wheat only adds to our large and \ngrowing trade deficit with China which has already reached $40 billion.\n  These are just a few of the most egregious examples of the seemingly \nendless obstacles to Washington's agricultural exports. The time has \ncome for the U.S. Trade Representative to take quick and decisive \naction against all nations that engage in unfair trade practices to \nlock out U.S. agricultural exports. S. 219 will give the administration \nthe tools it needs to do just that. If this legislation can accomplish \neven half of what the ``Special 301'' process has done to protect U.S. \nintellectual property, we will be well on our way to a freer, fairer \nsystem of international trade in agriculture.\n  Mr. President, Washington, and every State in the Nation engaged in \nagricultural trade will gain if this legislation is signed into law. I \ncommend my colleagues Senators Grassley and Daschle for their insight \nand hard work in devising this intelligent solution to a difficult and \npressing problem and am proud to join them as a cosponsor of S. \n219.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/21/senate-section/article/S10901-4", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO CARMEN WARSCHAW\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and \ncongratulate Carmen Warschaw on receiving the 1997 Heart of Gold Award \nfrom the Medallion Group of the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.\n  Through the years, Ms. Warschaw has shown her commitment to the \npeople of Los Angeles, and to the people of California. She has served \nher community with pride and dignity. I commend her on a job well done, \nand an honor richly deserved.\n  Ms. Warschaw has served on many governing boards and commissions, \nincluding the California Fair Employment Practices Commission, the \nNational Council of Women, the California State Board of Social \nWelfare, the Los Angeles County Election Security Commission, and the \n1996-97 Los Angeles County Blue Ribbon Budget Task Force. She is \ncurrently an active member of the State Central Commission of \nCalifornia.\n  Ms. Warschaw has also served as a delegate to the Democratic National \nConvention, chairperson of the Jewish Community Relations Committee, \nand National Vice Chairperson of the Anti-Defamation League. She has a \nlong tradition of supporting the arts: She was president of the Los \nAngeles County Art Museum, a founder of the Civic Light Opera, and a \nboard member of the Truman Library Institute. In 1968, she was a \nrecipient of the prestigious Los Angeles Times Woman of the Year Award.\n  In addition to these accomplishments and activities, Ms. Warschaw is \na mother of two and a grandmother of three.\n  There are many heroes among us: Men and women who, like Ms. Warschaw, \ngive something back to the world in which they live. They inspire and \nmove us. We may not always know their names, nor recognize their faces, \nbut their goodwill lives on in every life they touch. Their \nselflessness and courage is an example to us all.\n  I congratulate Carmen Warschaw once again, for her years of \ndedication and hard work on behalf of her city, her State, and her \ncountry. She is a true hero, and I salute her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/21/senate-section/article/S10902-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 AMERICAN LEGION AUXILIARY SCHOLARSHIP\n\n Mr. COVERDELL.

ORR\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the Sons of Union Veterans of the \nCivil War [SUVCW] is a congressionally chartered organization dedicated \nto preserving the memory of Union veterans and their sacrifices on \nbehalf of our Nation. Today, I rise to recognize an exceptional \nPennsylvanian, Mr. Richard D. Orr, who was recently elected commander-\nin-chief of the SUVCW.\n  Richard's forefathers answered the call to duty during the Civil War. \nHis great-great-grandfather, Pvt. Peter Paul Gallisath, served in the \n5th Pennsylvania Cavalry. Another great-great-grandfather, Sgt. Martin \nSchaefer, served in Pennsylvania Militia of 1863, which defended the \narsenal at Pittsburgh during the Gettysburg Campaign. His great-great-\ngrandfather, Sgt. David Orr, was a member of the 14th Pennsylvania \nCavalry. Other Union veterans in Richard's family include his great-\ngreat-great uncle, Capt. Bardele Gallisath of the 5th Pennsylvania \nCavalry, and Medal of Honor recipient Col. Robert L. Orr, of the 61st \nPennsylvania Volunteer Infantry.\n  Since joining the SUVCW on April 11, 1981, Richard has been very \nactive in the organization. A life member, Richard has served the \nPittsburgh Davis Camp as camp commander and treasurer. After attending \nhis first department encampment in 1982, he immediately took an active \nrole at the department level. He has served the Pennsylvania Department \nas patriotic instructor, junior vice commander, senior vice commander, \ncounselor, department council member, and department commander. In the \nnational organization, Richard has held the positions of committee \nchairman, trial commissioner, national treasurer, national counselor, \njunior vice commander-in-chief, and senior vice commander-in-chief.\n  I am pleased to note that Mr. Orr is equally active in his community. \nA former Eagle Scout, the new commander-in-chief continued his \naffiliation with the Boy Scouts of America as a volunteer for more than \n35 years. In fact, Richard was awarded the District Award of Merit for \nhis many years as a volunteer with the Boy Scouts. Similarly, the Boy \nScouts' National Court of Honor presented him the Silver Beaver Award--\nthe highest honor that can be conferred upon a volunteer. Likewise, the \nNational Catholic Committee on Scouting recognized his contributions to \nyouth with the St. George Award.\n  Mr. Orr is employed as an environmental health administrator by the \nAllegheny County Health Department\n\n[[Page S10903]]\n\n[ACHD]. He has worked for ACHD for the past 19 years in a variety of \nprograms including public drinking water, waste management, food \nprotection, housing, community environment, and emergency response. \nCurrently, he is responsible for evaluating, acquiring, and \ncoordinating the training needs for all ACHD employees. Richard has \nearned the respect of colleagues and subordinates alike for his \nuncompromising dedication to sound principles of environmental health \nand environmental protection. Others outside the ACHD have taken notice \nas well. Richard received two community service citations from the \nAllegheny County Board of Commissioners. Also, the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers presented him with the Planning Excellence Award for his role \nin the development of an intragovernmental plan to provide an \nuninterrupted supply of drinking water during environmental \nemergencies.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in extending the \nSenate's best wishes for continued success to Mr. Orr and his \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/21/senate-section/article/S10902-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10903-S10904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      FORWARD TO ETHICS IN LAW AND POLITICS BY SENATOR PAUL SIMON\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, our friend and former colleague in \nthis body, Paul Simon, has always been a man of exceptional integrity \nwho has demonstrated exemplary leadership on national issues. He \ncontinues to contribute to the national debate as the director of the \nPublic Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale.\n  Paul recently authored the foreword for the Loyola University of \nChicago Law Journal on the subject of ethics in law and politics. While \nthe Senate continues to investigate and debate the conduct of our \nfederally elected officials, Paul's foreword to this journal provides \nvaluable insight about political ethics and the public trust which I \nwould like to share with my colleagues.\n  I ask that Senator Simon's foreword be printed in the Record.\n  The forward follows:\n\n  [From the Loyola University of Chicago Law Journal, Volume 28, 1996]\n\n                  Foreword--Ethics in Law and Politics\n\n                        (By Senator Paul Simon)\n\n       Paul Simon was a Democratic member of the United States \n     Senate from the State of Illinois from 1985 to 1996. He has \n     also served as member of the United States House of \n     Representatives (1975-1984), Lieutenant Governor of Illinois \n     (1969-1972), member of the Illinois Senate (1963-1968), and \n     member of the Illinois House of Representatives (1955-1962). \n     In addition to his extensive years of service in the \n     political arena, Senator Simon is the author of numerous \n     works, including Lincoln's Preparation for Greatness (1965), \n     The Once and Future Democrats (1982), and The Glass House, \n     Politics, and Morality in the Nation's Capitol (1984).\n\n\n                            I. Introduction\n\n       I am pleased to introduce Loyola University of Chicago Law \n     Journal's special symposium issue on Legal Ethics. I may not \n     be the obvious choice for this honor since I am not a lawyer. \n     I am, however, the husband of an attorney and the father of \n     another; moreover, I work everyday with lawyers and have \n     drafted far more legislation than most attorneys in the \n     profession.\n       My years in state and federal politics have also provided \n     me with empathy for the legal profession. After all, \n     politicians and lawyers share at least one uneviable \n     distinction--they are both roundly criticized in America \n     today for their ethical shortcomings. The public's distrust \n     of lawyers and politicians can be traced to a common cause--\n     to a perception that both professions have failed to live up \n     to the full range of their responsibilities, and particularly \n     to a sense that both too often see their obligations in terms \n     of temporarily pleasing constitutents or clients and not \n     enough in terms of serving the national interest and the \n     public good. This pervasive attitude is harmful, not only to \n     the public standing of lawyers and politicians, but--more \n     importantly--to the well-being and moral strength of the \n     nation itself.\n\n\n                 ii. public trust and political ethics\n\n       For many years, I have warned of the increasing influence \n     of public opinion polls, focus groups, and political \n     consultants in Washington. Office-holders have become too \n     quick, when faced with issues of immense public importance, \n     to stick their finger to the wind to see which way the public \n     passions are blowing. It is easy to understand this \n     temptation. As a Senator, I know how appealing it is to do \n     the popular thing. Most elected officials enjoy their jobs. \n     We are treated with respect; we are listened to and \n     applauded; and we make decisions about matters which effect \n     the lives of thousands, if not millions, of people. \n     Naturally, we dislike casting votes that might jeopardize our \n     positions. And so political self-interest makes the office-\n     holder excessively sensitive to his constitutents' desires.\n       Certainly, the desire to please one's constituents is not a \n     bad thing in and of itself. Public accountability and \n     constituent service are a vital part of the democratic \n     process. But the legislator's duty is greater than simply \n     serving his or her constituents' immediate interests. A \n     representative also has an obligation, as James Madison \n     wrote, to ``refine and enlarge the public views,'' to use \n     independent judgment, and to serve the public good.\\1\\ Edmund \n     Burke declared, in his famous speech to the electors at \n     Bristol, that ``[y]our representative owes you, not his \n     industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of \n     serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion.'' \\2\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Burke sometimes spoke as if he believed elected officials \n     should concern themselves solely with the national interest \n     and not at all with local affairs.\\3\\ I certainly would not \n     go that far. Rather, I believe representatives have two \n     principal obligations--one to their constituents and one to \n     the broader public good. Fortunately, those obligations do \n     not generally conflict, and especially in matters of vital \n     national significance, they are often closely aligned. \n     Nonetheless, when they diverge, as they inevitably do at \n     times, conscientious politicians face an ethical dilemma--how \n     to balance the voice of their constituents with the call of \n     the conscience.\n       Representatives must resolve this tension as best as they \n     can. It is reasonable, in my opinion, for representatives to \n     defer to their constituents' desires when an issue is not \n     clear-cut and the stakes are not vital. But in fundamental \n     cases where justice is clear, politicians must have the \n     courage to vote their conscience. The lawmaker must recognize \n     this simple truth--that some things are more important than \n     being reelected.\n       The obligation to exercise independent judgment--rather \n     than to blindly follow public opinion--is strong in cases \n     affecting citizens marginalized by society, such as the poor \n     or minorities. These are people whom the general public is \n     prone to ignore; they are often powerless to defend \n     themselves in the ``court'' of public opinion. Frequently, \n     the legislator's independent sense of justice is all that \n     protects the underprivileged members of society from neglect \n     or isolation. If representatives are to be worthy of their \n     positions, they must have the courage to fight for the least \n     fortunate, even when doing so in unpopular.\n       The passage of the new welfare bill is only the most recent \n     and egregious illustration of Congress' increasing tendency \n     to choose expediency over principle. To be sure, the \n     political calculus in favor of the bill was clear. Welfare \n     has become a dirty word in America today. Proportionately few \n     welfare recipients vote, and the cases where welfare is \n     abused are highly publicized. President Clinton certainly \n     knew which way the political winds were blowing when he \n     signed the bill.\n       But ``ending welfare as we know it'' is not a noble goal. \n     ``Ending poverty as we know it'' is, and the latter goal \n     requires genuine welfare reform. But that cannot be achieved \n     without jobs for people with limited skill, without day care \n     for single mothers with small children, and without job \n     training for those who need it. We are pursuing ``welfare \n     reform on the cheap''--but the next generation will find it \n     very expensive. Real welfare reform will take an additional \n     initial investment but, in the long term, will save money, \n     reduce crime, and make America a more productive society.\n       The dangerous consequences of the ``welfare reform'' \n     measure have been well publicized. According to the Urban \n     Institute's estimates, the bill will push a million more \n     children into poverty. It will cut food stamps--basic \n     nutrition for the poor--by nearly 20% from already low \n     levels.\\4\\ This is an unconscionable act, a failure by \n     Congress to meet its essential obligation to protect those \n     who are neglected by society.\n       Candidates who yield to public passions and vote for this \n     kind of measure may gain some temporary increase in \n     popularity. But in the long run, citizens perceive the truth. \n     They come to view Washington as an arena for dividing spoils \n     among powerful factions and interest groups rather than as a \n     proper forum for deliberating over the common good. When \n     elected officials follow public opinion at the expense of \n     justice, they ultimately discredit themselves and their own \n     institutions.\n       By contrast, candidates who act against public opinion may \n     find themselves penalized in the polls. But my experience is \n     that over time the public comes to respect those men and \n     women of principle who vote their conscience. These \n     politicians gain an unexpected reward: a deep kind of public \n     respect. I had a small taste of this type of reaction in \n     1990, when I was running for reelection to the Senate. \n     Although I voted against the death penalty and spoke about \n     the need to raise revenues--two very unpopular positions--I \n     won the election by the largest margin of any seriously \n     contested campaign for Senator or Governor. Once, in Chicago, \n     a man approached me and said, ``Senator Simon, I don't think \n     I agree with you on anything. But I trust you, and I'm going \n     to vote for you.'' Citizens yearn for candor and for \n     officials they can trust. If all we can give them is blind \n     obedience to current polls, we as public officials have \n     failed our public duties.\n       Politicians should be distinguished by their willingness to \n     meet the full ethical obligations of their position--to \n     exercise independent judgment in matters of justice and\n\n[[Page S10904]]\n\n     to act on that judgment, even when it leads to unpopular \n     decisions. Walter Lippmann once wrote that a statesman \n     emerges whenever a politician ``stops trying merely to \n     satisfy or obfuscate the momentary wishes of his \n     constituents, and sets out to make them realize and assent to \n     those hidden interests of theirs which are permanent. . . . \n     When a statesman is successful in converting his constituents \n     from a childlike pursuit of what seems interesting to a \n     realistic view of their interests, he receives a kind of \n     support which the ordinary glib politician can never hope \n     for. . . . [O]nce a man becomes established in the public \n     mind as a person who deals habitually and successfully with \n     real things, he acquires an eminence of a wholly different \n     quality from that of even the most celebrated caterer of the \n     popular favor. . . .''\\5\\\n       Ultimately, the political profession will not redeem itself \n     in the public's eyes until a larger number of its \n     representatives begin to heed the call of their conscience \n     over the call of the polls.\n\n\n                  iii. ethics and the legal profession\n\n       Unlike the political realm, the legal profession has not \n     always been viewed with the scorn reserved for it today. in \n     words that may seem strange to us now, Alexis de Tocqueville \n     wrote that ``people in democratic states do not mistrust the \n     members of the legal profession, because it is known that \n     they are interested to serve the popular cause; and the \n     people listen to them without irritation because they do not \n     attribute to them any sinister designs.'' \\6\\ During the last \n     century, however, this picture of the legal profession has \n     too often been replaced by an entirely different one--a \n     picture of lawyers as parasites, hired-guns of large \n     corporations or grasping clients, motivated by greed and \n     neglectful of the public good. The legal industry--and it is \n     an industry--has become increasingly commercialized, with too \n     much emphasis on profits and the bottom line.\n       Paralleling this development has been the growth of a new \n     ideology within the legal culture itself, which one observer \n     has called the ``ideology of adversarial zeal.'' \\7\\ It is \n     more prevalent than it should be. This ideology tells lawyers \n     that they need not concern themselves with the public good or \n     the ordinary obligations of justice. Rather, their ethical \n     obligations are simply to serve their clients' desires and \n     commands.\n       When unrestrained, this ideology puts few ethical burdens \n     on the legal profession. Simply stated, it affirms that: \n     ``[l]awyers should not commit crimes or help clients to plan \n     crimes. They should obey only such ethical instructions as \n     are clearly expressed in rules and ignore vague standards. \n     Finally, they should not tell outright lies to judges or \n     fabricate evidence. Otherwise, they may, and if it will serve \n     their clients' interest must, exploit any gap, ambiguity, \n     technicality, or loophole, any not-obviously-and-totally-\n     implausible interpretation of the law or facts.''\\8\\\n       Like the norm of constituent service through polling in the \n     political realm, the ideology of adversarial zeal panders to \n     the lawyer's own self-interest. It enables lawyers to ignore \n     the effects of their work on the rest of society--\n     considerations that may detract from their profits but should \n     bother their conscience.\n       To be fair, the ideology of adversarial zeal may have value \n     in some contexts. For example, in criminal trials, there is a \n     strong temptation to pre-judge a defendant who stands before \n     the court of law, who often is a marginalized member of our \n     society, and who faces the awesome power of the state's legal \n     machinery. Public norms that encourage a fervent defense may \n     help to counteract this pressure and ensure that the \n     defendant has at least one committed defender. That defender \n     may be all that stands between the innocent individual and \n     the loss of his or her liberty.\\9\\\n       The finest legal traditions are followed when attorneys use \n     their zeal and skills in pro bono work, but today the \n     combination of federally assisted legal aid and pro bono work \n     still leaves far too many unserved or under served. In all \n     cases, there is a strong ethical argument for encouraging \n     lawyers to weigh the broader implications of their work for \n     society. Just as the politician must balance his \n     constituent's interests with the public interest, so too must \n     a lawyer balance client service with public service.\n       I do not know precisely how that balance should be drawn \n     today in the legal profession. But it certainly means that \n     lawyers--like candidates and office-holders--should hold \n     themselves to a higher standard of conduct than they \n     sometimes do now. It often means that lawyers should resist \n     the temptation to exploit loopholes in the law and instead \n     seek to ensure compliance with the spirit of the law. It \n     certainly means that a lawyer should not engage in a scorched \n     earth approach to discovery in order to overwhelm a less \n     resourceful opponent, even if that means sacrificing a \n     strategic edge in litigation. And it surely means working \n     with the political branches to improve and strengthen our \n     legal system, even if that effort may temporarily work to the \n     detriment of existing clients or the attorney's pocketbook. \n     Self-restraint is essential for a free society to function \n     effectively. We as a society should set our ethical goals \n     high, even the likelihood that many will inevitably fall \n     short.\n       We need, in other words, to revive an old ideology that \n     once permeated the legal profession, which Dean Kronman of \n     Yale Law School called the ideology of the ``lawyer \n     statesman.'' \\10\\ The lawyer statesman understands that \n     professional obligations extend far beyond the client's \n     interests to those of the nation at large, and that the Bar's \n     enormous power in American society comes with a great \n     responsibility to protect the common good. This is vital, in \n     part, because the legal profession plays such a basic role in \n     maintaining the nation's ideals. Professor George Anastaplo \n     has rightly spoken of the Bar's obligation: ``to mediate \n     between popular passions and informed and principled men, \n     thereby upholding republican government. Unless there is this \n     mediation, intelligent and responsible government is unlikely \n     . . . . The bar is, in short, in a position to train and lead \n     by precept and example the American people.'' \\11\\ Similarly, \n     Justice Louis Brandeis, who lived the noble ideal of the \n     lawyer statesman in his own life, spoke of lawyers ``holding \n     a position of independence, between the wealthy and the \n     people, prepared to curb the excesses of either.'' \\12\\\n       Not least of all, a resurgence in the ideal of the lawyer \n     statesman is important to our nation's future because, in the \n     United States, the legal profession has traditionally been a \n     training ground for many political aspirants. We will have \n     little hope of finding statesmen in the political arena, if \n     we are unable to cultivate statesmen in the legal sphere.\n       This is an extraordinarily difficult challenge. To change \n     the culture of the legal and political professions will \n     require a partnership among law schools, bar leaders, schools \n     of political science, and the public at large. But before we \n     can begin this task, we need to understand the reasons an \n     ideology of self-interest has too extensively replaced a \n     commitment to the public interest in both of our professions. \n     We need creative suggestions about how to reverse that trend. \n     For this reason, a symposium issue such as this one is so \n     timely and important to our national welfare. I congratulate \n     the Loyola University of Chicago Law Journal for taking on \n     this fundamental issue.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ The Federalist No. 10 (James Madison).\n     \\2\\ Edmund Burke, Election Speech at Bristol (Nov. 3, 1774), \n     reprinted in Burke's Politics 115 (Ross J.S.

The veteran stepped forward when the Nation \ncalled; it is time the Government stepped up to the plate and delivered \nthe benefits the veterans deserve.\n  Today, I would like to say ``thank you'' to the veterans for the \nsacrifices you made defending our country. Thank you for the time you \nspent away from your home and families to heed the call of our great \nNation.\n  Mr. President, we must never forget those brave men and women who \npaid\n\n[[Page S10905]]\n\nthe ultimate sacrifice by giving their lives for the United States of \nAmerica.\n  As the saying goes, ``If you love your freedom, thank a vet.''

CASEY TO BE U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE \n                 FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate majority \nleader has decided to take up the nomination of Dale A. Kimball to be a \nU.S. district judge for the District of Utah. Mr. Kimball has been \nengaged in the private practice of law for 30 years and is currently \nthe senior partner in the Salt Lake City law firm, Kimball, Parr, \nWaddoups, Brown & Gee. The ABA unanimously found him to be well-\nqualified for this appointment.\n  We received Mr. Kimball's nomination on September 5, 1997. He \nparticipated in a confirmation hearing on September 30 and was \nunanimously reported by the committee on October 9. Now, less than 7 \nweeks after receiving his nomination, the Senate has confirmed this \nnominee. Had the Senate not taken a recess last week, I suspect this \nnominee would have been confirmed in less than 6 weeks. Nonetheless, 7 \nweeks is a good benchmark against which to consider our progress on \nother judicial nominations.\n  I congratulate Mr. Kimball and his family and look forward to his \nservice on the U.S. district court.\n  I also congratulate Richard C. Casey on his confirmation as a \ndistrict judge for the Southern District of New York. Mr. Casey is both \nan accomplished legal practitioner and a true inspiration. He has been \nassociated with, and a partner of the law firm of Brown & Wood in New \nYork City since 1964. Remarkably, he has been practicing law without \nhis eyesight since the early 1980's--a congenital disease stripped him \nof his ability to see. Dedicated to serving the blind community of New \nYork City, Mr. Casey is a member of the board of directors for \norganizations such as Guiding Eyes for the Blind, Catholic Guild for \nthe Blind, and Ski for Light.\n  I congratulate Mr. Casey and his family and anticipate his \noutstanding service on the U.S. Federal Court.\n  We have experienced 115 judicial vacancies over the course of this \nyear. These are only the 20th and 21st nominees that the Senate has \nconfirmed. More than 50 additional nominees remain pending in committee \nand before the Senate. The Senate is not even keeping pace with \nattrition for since the adjournment of Congress last year, judicial \nvacancies have increased by almost 50 percent.\n  Another of the well-qualified nominees who has been delayed far too \nlong is Margaret Morrow. Her nomination has been pending before the \nSenate for over 16 months. Last year this nomination was unanimously \nreported by the Judiciary Committee and was left to wither without \naction for over 3 months. This year, the committee again reported the \nnomination favorably and it has been pending for another 4 months. \nThere has been no explanation for this delay and no justification. This \ngood woman does not deserve this shameful treatment.\n  Senator Hatch noted in his recent statement on September 29 that he \nwill continue to support the nomination of Margaret Morrow and that he \nwill vote for her. He said: ``I have found her to be qualified and I \nwill support her. Undoubtedly, there will be some who will not, but she \ndeserved to have her vote on the floor. I have been assured by the \nmajority leader that she will have her vote on the floor. I intend to \nargue for and on her behalf.''\n  I have looked forward to that debate since June 12 when she was \nfavorably reported to the Senate for a second time. This is a \nnomination that has been pending for far too long and that has been \nstalled here on the floor twice over 2 years without justification.\n  Meanwhile, the people served by the district court for the Central \nDistrict of California continue to suffer the effects of this \npersistent vacancy--cases are not heard, criminal cases are not being \ntried. This is one of the many vacancies that have persisted for so \nlong that they are classified as judicial emergency vacancies by the \nAdministrative Office of the United States Courts. There are four \nvacancies in the court for Los Angeles and the Central District of \nCalifornia. Nominees have been favorably reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee for both of the judicial emergency vacancies in this district \nbut both Margaret Morrow and Christina Snyder have been stalled on the \nSenate calendar.\n  This is a district court with over 300 cases that have been pending \nfor longer than 3 years and in which the time for disposing of criminal \nfelony cases and the number of cases filed increased over the last \nyear. Judges in this district handle approximately 400 cases a year, \nincluding somewhere between 40 and 50 criminal felony cases. Still \nthese judicial vacancies are being perpetuated without basis or cause \nby a Republican leadership that refuses to vote on these well-qualified \nnominees.\n  I am told that last week a Republican Senator announced at a speech \nbefore a policy institute that he has a hold on the Morrow nomination. \nThe Senator's press release stated that he had placed a hold on \nMargaret Morrow's nomination because he wants to ``be able to debate \nthe nomination and seek a recorded vote.'' I too want to debate the \nnomination of Margaret Morrow and have been seeking Senate \nconsideration of this outstanding nominee for many months. After being \non the Senate calendar for a total of 7 months, this nomination has \nbeen delayed too long.\n  I believe all would agree that it is time for the full Senate to \ndebate this\n\n[[Page S10906]]\n\nnomination and vote on it. I have inquired about a time agreement but \ngotten no response. Now that an opponent has finally come forward to \nidentify himself, I look forward to a prompt debate and a vote on this \nnomination in accordance with the apparent commitment of the majority \nleader. I look forward to that debate. I ask again, as I have done \nrepeatedly over the last several months, why not now, why not today, \nwhy not this week?\n  I again urge the majority leader to call up the nomination of \nMargaret Morrow for a vote. She has suffered enough. The people of the \nCentral District of California have been denied this outstanding jurist \nfor long enough. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee said last \nmonth that he had the assurance of the majority leader that she will be \ncalled up for a vote but neither has said when that will be. I hope \nthat the majority leader will proceed to the consideration of this \nnomination and that he will support Margaret Morrow to be a district \ncourt judge for the Central District of California.\n\n\n STATEMENT ON THE NOMINATION OF PAUL R. CAREY TO BE A COMMISSIONER OF \n                 THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise in emphatic support of the \nnomination of Paul R. Carey of New York to be a commissioner of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Carey, who has served since \n1993 as special assistant to President Clinton, is an inspired public \nservant who is exceptionally well qualified for this position.\n  I have known Paul Carey, boy and man. He was born in Brooklyn, the \nborough of churches. And indeed it was in a sort of church that we \nfirst met. It was in the summer of 1977. I was a newly serving Senator \nand Paul's father was New York's Governor. It was through Hugh Carey's \nheroic efforts that New York City was saved from bankruptcy. As I have \noften said elsewhere, Hugh Carey was New York's greatest Governor since \nAl Smith. Paul's father and I had gathered, along with several hundred \nothers at Siena College, to be present at the induction of Howard \nHubbard to serve as the bishop of the Diocese of Albany. Paul \naccompanied his father that day. He was still in grade school but he \nwas attentive throughout and his firm handshake alone identified him as \nhis father's son. We became friends and I shared his family's pride as \nhe progressed through high school, graduated from Colgate University, \nand entered the world of business and finance.\n  But I think he was always interested in public service. In 1991 he \nchanced upon my wife Liz in the Albany train station and said as much. \nHe joined the Clinton administration at the first. And he has just \nshone. Paul has exemplified what Alexander Hamilton called Energy in \nthe Executive. No bill has been too complex to yield to his \nexplanation. Few Senators are able to withstand his persuasive powers. \nHe has seen the President's program through. Paul has proved his worth \nand his talents have not escaped the President's notice.\n  If I may say Mr. President, Paul's time in the White House will serve \nhim well at the SEC. For despite being an independent agency, the \nCommission is withal a part of the national government. As such, it is \nuseful to have a Commissioner who knows intimately the workings of the \nlegislative and executive branches. Government has been called the art \nof the possible. Paul has over these last years learned what is \npossible and what is not. As the Commission confronts a world made more \ncomplex by technology and the globalization of finance, proposals will \nbe made for regulations and laws of great sweep and broad scope. Having \na Commissioner who knows what can be done as well as what should be \ndone will allow the Commission to better serve us all.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe there is any representative of the \nadministration who enjoys a higher degree of respect on Capitol Hill \nthan Paul Carey, as was demonstrated by the unanimous vote in favor of \nPaul's nomination by the Senate Banking Committee, and by the \nenthusiastic support of its chairman. Senator D'Amato.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senate to follow suit and confirm the \nnomination of Paul Carey by a unanimous vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/21/senate-section/article/S10905-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, United States versus Tara LaJuan Edwards and \nUnited States versus Robbin Tiffani Stoney are two criminal cases set \nfor trial in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, charging \nthe defendants, two former Senate employees, with financial misconduct \nduring their former Senate employment.\n  Three employees of the Secretary of the Senate not implicated in the \nalleged wrongdoing have been subpoenaed by the Government to testify at \nthese trials. This resolution would authorize these Senate employees to \ntestify, and would also authorize representation of these Senate \nwitnesses by the legal counsel. The resolution also would authorize the \nSecretary to release Senate records and documents relevant to these \ncases.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statements relating to the resolution appear at this point \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution (S.

Tomorrow, the Senate will be in a period of morning \nbusiness until the hour of 12:30, after coming in at noon. At 12:30, we \nwill go back to the ISTEA legislation. It is hoped that the Senate will \nmake some progress on this important legislation which authorizes the \nfunding for transportation projects and safety programs so essential to \nthe transportation infrastructure of this country.\n  As a reminder to all Senators, a cloture motion was filed this \nafternoon on the ISTEA legislation. Therefore, all second-degree \namendments must be filed prior to the vote on Thursday. In addition, a \ncloture vote will occur on Thursday, with the exact time to be \nannounced later, with the mandatory quorum being waived.\n  In addition, the Senate may turn to appropriations conference reports \nthat become available at any time and, of course, Members can expect \nvotes during the day tomorrow.\n  I know Senator Chafee, the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island, \nwould like very much to get on with the substance of this bill. I \nbelieve it is important legislation and that there is a growing desire \nto work together on this bipartisan issue, and I believe and hope that \nwe will get cloture on Thursday. If not, then we would have another \nvote on Friday, so that we could get to the germane amendments and deal \nwith this issue in a serious way.\n  It is my intent to continue to work with the members of the \ncommittee--they have done good work on this legislation, it was \nreported out of the committee unanimously--and complete action on it \nnext week so we will have this 6-year bill completed in the Senate. \nThen we can see what might happen at that point. Then it would be my \nintention, shortly after that, whenever that may be, late next week I \nhope, to go to fast track legislation.\n  This is ambitious, but these are very important bills that I believe \nmost Senators want us to act on. The President of the United States \ntoday personally asked me to try to move both of these bills, and I \nwill continue to work with Senator Daschle and other Senators to try to \nfind a way to move this process forward. We did have some good faith \nexhibited today. Our committees were allowed to meet. We did move some \nnominations that are required, needed for the administration in order \nfor it to be able to do its work. I hope we can continue in that vein.\n  So far we have not been able to get everybody to agree to a process \nwhereby we can move on to important, substantive legislation like ISTEA \nand fast track and Amtrak and adoption and foster care legislation. But \nit is certainly my intention to do everything I can to get to these \nserious issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/21/senate-section/article/S10907-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, it is often useful to compare the \npublic statements of Government officials with their private \nstatements. Such a comparison can say a great deal about an official's \ntrue motives, not to mention their character. Last week, in response to \na question I posed for the public record, the Department of the \nInterior provided me with a copy of a memo written by Deputy Secretary \nof the Interior John Garamendi to his boss, Secretary Bruce Babbitt. \nThis memorandum was dated February 21, 1996, and it concerns the Ward \nValley low-level waste disposal issue.\n  For those who do not know, Ward Valley is the site of a low-level \nradioactive waste facility licensed by the State of California under \nthe Federal Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act. The site sits on \nthe Bureau of Land Management land in a remote and sparsely populated \narea of the Mojave Desert. But the Department of the Interior reversed \nan earlier decision to sell the land to California, and has insisted on \nstudy after study to achieve endless delays.\n  Meanwhile, low-level radioactive waste is piling up at hundreds of \nurban locations all across California. It is stored in basements, \nstored in parking lots, stored in trailers, stored in warehouses, and \ntemporary shelters. It is on college campuses, it is in residential \nneighborhoods, it is in hospitals--sites that were not designed for \npermanent storage. As long as the waste in these temporary locations in \npopulated areas is where it is, it is subject to accidental radioactive \nrelease from, fire, earthquakes, and floods.\n  Governor Wilson is understandably concerned about the health and \nsafety of Californians. That is his job. He is frustrated by the delays \nCalifornia has faced in trying to get this facility open, and so am I.\n  I am further frustrated by the fact that the President's nominee to \nbe the Deputy Secretary of the Interior, Mr. John Garamendi, appeared \nbefore our committee, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, on \nJuly 27, 1995, and testified under oath that Ward Valley and the issue \nshould and would be quickly resolved. Mind you, this was July, 1995.\n  It may interest my colleagues to know that Ward Valley was \nscrutinized by two--not one, but two--environmental impact statements \nunder NEPA, and two biological opinions under the Endangered Species \nAct. Although all these environmental reviews have been favorable to \nthe Ward Valley facility, the Secretary of the Interior continues to \nopt for further studies rather than just transferring the land to \nCalifornia.\n  In 1994, having seemingly exhausted the studies available to delay \nthe process under NEPA and the Endangered Species Act, the Secretary \nturned to the National Academy of Sciences and asked for yet another \nstudy. But in May 1995 the National Academy of Sciences study was \ncomplete, and again it was favorable to the Ward Valley site.\n  Finally, it appeared that Secretary Babbitt had little choice but to \ntransfer the land, and announced his intention to do so in May 1995. \nEnvironmentalists bitterly complained. Greenpeace even picketed the \nSecretary. Movie stars and pop singers rallied against the facility. It \ndid not matter what the science said. The facts didn't seem to matter. \nIt was simply good politics in California to oppose a radioactive waste \nsite and I guess the Secretary did not like the unfavorable press he \nwas getting at the time.\n  Indeed, the politics of Ward Valley seems to loom large in another \nmemorandum that we have uncovered, going back to 1993. I have a \nmemorandum to the Secretary from October 19, 1993, that speaks to the \nprevailing mindset at Interior, and it says:\n  And I quote:\n\n       This memorandum addresses only the politics of Ward Valley. \n     I can imagine no scenario that allows us to go forward with \n     the land transfer and retain credibility with Boxer and the \n     enviros.\n\n  So to keep themselves out of hot water with environmental groups, \nDeputy Secretary Garamendi had to devise a new way to delay Ward Valley \nwhile simultaneously waging a public relations and political campaign \nagainst the site.\n  As far as John Garamendi was concerned, a new excuse for a new study \nand further delay simply had to be found.\n  So in February 1996, the Department of Interior evidently struck \ngold, or thought they had. A former low-level waste facility in Beatty, \nNV, was determined to be ``leaking.''\n\n[[Page S10908]]\n\n  Ignoring the fact the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey told him \nthat you could not relate Ward Valley with the Beatty, NV, site, Deputy \nSecretary Garamendi knew a good excuse for another study when he saw \none and a PR campaign to go with it.\n  So environmental and radiological factsheets were prepared by the \nDepartment for the press and the public, factsheets that were later \ncriticized by the chair of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the \nerrors and misinformation they contained.\n  Press conferences were held where Deputy Secretary Garamendi \nannounced that new tritium tests would be conducted, and another new \nEIS would be performed because of so-called new information about the \nBeatty, NV, site.\n  These new studies and the lawsuits that would surely follow might \ntake years.\n  But what were Interior's true motivations? Did Interior ever intend \nto transfer the site under their watch? Was Interior interested in the \npublic health and safety or good PR and political advantage?\n  Mr. President, I now have the internal memo that cuts through the \npublic statements and press releases to provide clear insight into the \nDepartment's motivations. Let me read this memorandum for my \ncolleagues. It is dated February 21, 1996, memorandum to Bruce Babbitt \nfrom John Garamendi. Subject: Ward Valley:\n\n       Attached are the Ward Valley [press] clips. We have taken \n     the high ground. Wilson--\n\n  Meaning Governor Pete Wilson--\n\n     is the venal toady of special interests (radiation business).\n\n  It goes further to state:\n\n       I do not think Greenpeace will picket you any longer. I \n     will maintain a heavy PR campaign until the issue is finally \n     won.\n\n  Mr. President, here is the Deputy Secretary of Interior engaged in a \nPR campaign to portray the Governor of California as a venal toady. For \nthose in this Chamber who may not know the precise definition of a \n``venal toady,'' it means a deferential, fawning parasite who is open \nto bribery.\n  A venal toady. That is Secretary Garamendi's characterization of the \nGovernor of California, or the goal of his PR campaign. I am not sure \nwhich.\n  Is this what Deputy Secretary Garamendi calls the high ground? Is it \ntaking the high ground to call for study after study and create delay \nafter delay while ignoring all the studies that show the site is safe \nso far?\n  Is it taking the high ground to keep radioactive waste spread around \n800 locations in California subject to some accidental release, a \nflood, fire or earthquake, where literally millions of people could be \nexposed to radioactivity, or finding a site and put it there, which we \nhave given California the authority to do?\n  Is it taking the high ground to say you are working to protect public \nhealth when you are, in fact, endangering the public's health?\n  Is it taking the high ground to pretend to be pursuing a careful \ndeliberative process following standards of good Government when, in \nfact, you are waging a ruthless PR campaign in which misstatements and \nhalf-truths are used?\n  Remember, I am not the one claiming that misstatements have been \nmade. President Clinton's own selection as chair of the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission, Dr. Shirley Jackson, has highlighted the \nInterior Department's misleading errors and misstatements in her letter \nto me of July 22, 1997, which I ask unanimous consent be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    United States,\n\n\n                                Nuclear Regulatory Commission,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 22, 1997.\n     Hon. Bruce Babbitt,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of Interior, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Babbitt: I am writing on behalf of the U.S. \n     Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to share our views \n     related to the Department of Interior's (DOI) actions \n     regarding the proposed Ward Valley low-level radioactive \n     waste (LLW) disposal facility in California. In February \n     1996, DOI announced that it would prepare a second supplement \n     to an environmental impact statement (SEIS) for the transfer \n     of land from the Federal government to the State of \n     California, for the development of the Ward Valley low-level \n     radioactive waste (LLW) disposal facility. We understand that \n     DOI has identified 13 issues that it believes need to be \n     addressed in the SEIS. DOI also stated that it would not make \n     a decision on the land transfer until the SEIS was completed. \n     NRC will actively serve as a ``commenting agency'' on the \n     SEIS in accordance with the Council of Environmental Quality \n     regulations in 40 CFR 1503.2 ``Duty To Comment.'' NRC's \n     interest in the Ward Valley disposal facility is focussed on \n     protection of public health and safety, and many of the 13 \n     issues to be addressed in the SEIS are related to our areas \n     of expertise. As a commenting agency, we will review the \n     draft SEIS, and provide comments based on the requirements in \n     federal law and regulations, and our knowledge of policy, \n     technical, and legal issues in LLW management. We would also \n     be available to discuss these issues with DOI, both before \n     and after publication of the draft SEIS.\n       On a related matter, it is our understanding that Deputy \n     Secretary John Garamendi of DOI held a press conference on \n     July 22, 1996, addressing the effect of Ward Valley facility \n     availability on the use of radioisotopes in medicine and \n     medical research. It was recently brought to our attention \n     that DOI distributed a document entitled, ``Medical, \n     Research, and Academic Low Level Radioactive Waste (LLRW) \n     Fact Sheet'' at the press conference. This Fact Sheet \n     contains several errors and statements that may mislead the \n     reader. To assist DOI, we have addressed these errors and \n     statements in the enclosure to this letter. Some of the \n     points contained in the Fact Sheet are useful and contribute \n     to the dialogue on this issue; however, NRC is concerned that \n     some of the subjective information of the document is \n     characterized as factual. We are particularly concerned by \n     the statement that the NRC definition of LLW ``. . . is an \n     unfortunate and misleading catch-all definition . . .'' In \n     fact, NRC's definition is taken from Federal law, \n     specifically the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of \n     1980, and the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments \n     Act of 1985 (LLRWPAA). Additionally, it is NRC's view that \n     some of the information that was referenced or relied on in \n     the Fact Sheet may not represent a balanced perspective based \n     on facts. For example, a table of the sources and amounts of \n     radioactive waste that is projected to go to the Ward Valley \n     facility is erroneously attributed to NRC, the U.S. \n     Department of Energy (DOE), U.S. Ecology, the Southwestern \n     Compact, and the Ward Valley EIS. Raw data from the sources \n     quoted appear to have been interpreted based on uncertain \n     assumptions about future activities of generators to produce \n     the figures in the table. Additionally, NRC noted that the \n     figures in the table are identical to those in a March 1994 \n     Committee to Bridge the Gap report.\n       With respect to the relationship between LLW disposal \n     policy and medicine and medical research, we note that the \n     National Academy of Sciences Board on Radiation Effects \n     Research has prepared a Prospectus for a study entitled, \n     ``The Impact of United States Low-Level Radioactive Waste \n     Management Policy on Biomedical Research.'' The study would, \n     among other things, ``Evaluate the effects of higher disposal \n     costs and on-site storage on the current and future \n     activities of biomedical research, including the effects of \n     state noncompliance [with the LLRWPAA of 1985] on \n     institutions conducting biological and biomedical research \n     and on hospitals where radioisotopes are crucial for the \n     diagnosis and treatment of disease.'' Thus, the issue of \n     medical uses of radioisotopes and how they have been affected \n     by the Ward Valley process is far less clear than the Fact \n     Sheet portrays.\n       Finally, since there are no formal arrangements that permit \n     NRC to review and comment on the technical accuracy of \n     various DOI documents on LLW and Ward Valley, we may not be \n     aware such documents exist, thus the absence of NRC comments \n     does not imply an NRC judgment with respect to the technical \n     accuracy or completeness of such documents.\n       I trust our comments will be helpful in your efforts to \n     address Ward Valley issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Shirley Ann Jackson,\n                                                         Chairman.\n       Enclosure.\n\n  NRC Staff Comments on the Department of Interior ``Fact Sheet'' \\1\\\n\n       1. The Fact Sheet contains a projection of LLW to be sent \n     to the Ward Valley disposal facility over its 30-year life, \n     and attributes the table to the Department of Energy, the \n     U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Southwestern Compact, \n     U.S. Ecology, and the Ward Valley environmental impact \n     statement. In fact, the figures in the table are identical to \n     those in a table from a March 1994 Committee to Bridge the \n     Gap report, are substantially different from California \n     projections, and are based on assumptions that are not \n     identified. The actual assumptions used are contained in the \n     Committee to Bridge the Gap report and minimize the amount \n     and importance of the medical waste stream.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ ``Medical, Research, and Academic Low Level Radioactive \n     Waste (LLRW) Fact Sheet.'' U.S. Department of Interior, \n     Office of the Deputy Secretary. Distributed at a press \n     conference of the Deputy Secretary on July 22, 1996.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       2. The Fact Sheet is incomplete in that it provides only \n     anecdotal evidence of the impact of not having the Ward \n     Valley disposal facility available to medical generators. \n     Although its arguments about short-lived\n\n[[Page S10909]]\n\n     radionuclides appear to be generally true, the Fact Sheet \n     downplays the effects on generators that use longer-lived \n     radionuclides. According to the Fact Sheet, there are an \n     estimated 53 research hospitals in California, out of some \n     500 hospitals overall. The Fact Sheet describes the impact at \n     three of these research organizations and concludes that they \n     can manage their waste, either by disposing of it at an out-\n     of-state facility (Barnwell or Environcare), storing it, or, \n     for sealed sources, sending them back to the manufacturer. \n     The Fact Sheet concludes that there is a no health and safety \n     impact from the approach, but does not address broader issues \n     such as the continued availability of existing disposal sites \n     as an option, and the fact that transferring a sealed source \n     to a manufacturer does not eliminate the problem, but simply \n     shifts it from one organization to another.\n       3. The Fact Sheet does not address the more complex issues \n     concerning use of radioisotopes in medicine, such as how \n     medical research in general has been affected by issues such \n     as disposal and storage cost increases, and the need to \n     switch from longer-lived radionuclides to short-lived \n     nuclides or non-radioactive materials. The National Academy \n     of Sciences Board on Radiation Effects Research has prepared \n     a Prospectus for a study entitled ``The Impact of United \n     States Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management Policy on \n     Biomedical Research.'' The study would, among other things, \n     ``Evaluate the effects on higher disposal costs and on-site \n     storage on the current and future activities on biomedical \n     research, including the effects of state non-compliance on \n     institutions conducting biological and biomedical research \n     and on hospitals where radioisotopes are crucial for the \n     diagnosis and treatment of disease.'' Thus, the issue of \n     medical uses of radioisotopes and how they have been affected \n     by the Ward Valley process is far less clear than the Fact \n     Sheet portrays.\n       4. The Fact Sheet characterizes the NRC definition of LLW \n     in 10 CFR Part 61 as ``unfortunate and misleading'' because \n     it includes both long-lived and short-lived radionuclides. It \n     fails to acknowledge that this definition is contained in \n     Federal law (the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of \n     1980 and the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments \n     Act of 1985) and that information on the kinds and amounts of \n     radionuclides contained in LLW for land disposal is widely \n     available in NRC regulations and/or NUREGS, and from DOE. In \n     developing Part 61 in the early 1980s. NRC sought public \n     comment on the proposed rule, and provided extensive \n     information on the assumptions, analyses, and proposed \n     content of the regulation for review. In developing the \n     regulations for LLW, including how different classes are \n     defined, NRC received and considered extensive public input. \n     Four regional workshops were held, and 107 persons commented \n     on the draft rulemaking for 10 CFR Part 61, which defines \n     LLW. In short, NRC encouraged public involvement in \n     developing the definition of, and defining the risk \n     associated with LLW.\n       The Fact Sheet focuses on the half-life of radionuclides, \n     but fails to discuss risk to the public from the efforts of \n     ionizing radiation and how they are affected by the half-life \n     of radionucludes. Public health and safety is measured in \n     terms of risk, not half-life. Risk is a function of radiation \n     dose, and the determination of risk depends on a variety of \n     factors, including the type of radiation emitted, the \n     concentration of radionuclides in the medium in which they \n     are present, the likelihood that barriers isolating the \n     radionuclides will be effective, and the likelihood of \n     exposure if radioactive materials are not fully contained. \n     The Fact Sheet is misleading when it states that the half-\n     life of \\123\\ used in medicine is 13 hours, and that of \\129\\ \n     from nuclear power plants is 16 million years and that it \n     remains hazardous for 160-320 million years. Either isotope \n     can be a risk to the public, depending upon the other factors \n     discussed above, and half-life by itself does not indicate \n     risk.\n       5. In the definition section, the Fact Sheet defines \n     ``radioactive half-life'' as ``The general rule is that the \n     hazardous life of a radioactive substance is 10-20 times its \n     half-life.'' This definition contains a new term (hazardous) \n     not used by the national or international health physics or \n     radiation protection communities, and not defined in the Fact \n     Sheet.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I might add, I did not seek this letter \nfrom the NRC. It came unsolicited. Perhaps one might give the \nDepartment the benefit of the doubt and recognize that it is human to \nerr. But then you encounter a memorandum such as that of February 21 to \nthe Secretary and the Department's intent becomes obvious.\n  This is nothing more than a political and public relations game. \nSecretary Garamendi seems to be saying: Let's not worry about the waste \nor danger it may pose. If nothing is done, that's fine. Let somebody \nelse take care of it on their watch. But let's just make the Governor \nof California look like a ``parasite open to bribery,'' as the \ndefinition of ``venal toady'' describes.\n  I believe that the Department of Interior has absolutely no intention \nof transferring the Ward Valley land until they are ordered to do so by \nthe Congress or the courts.\n  If the Senators from California and I cannot work out something with \nrespect to land transfer legislation, we will either have to have a \nfloor fight of some kind or be content to let the courts decide the \nissue.\n  I encourage my colleagues to recognize the significance of the \nadministration's attitude toward the Ward Valley issue and refer to the \nmemorandum that I have highlighted of February 21, 1996, from John \nGaramendi to Bruce Babbitt where he criticizes, in inappropriate terms, \nthe motivation of the Governor of California and suggests to the \nSecretary that he does not think Greenpeace will picket him any longer.\n  So again, Mr. President, the terminology, referring to the Governor \nof California as ``the venal toady of special interests,'' deserves \nreflection by my colleagues on the total inappropriateness of such a \nmemorandum from the Deputy Secretary, John Garamendi, to the Secretary \nof the Interior, Bruce Babbitt.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/21/senate-section/article/S10907-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10909]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ADJOURNMENT UNTIL TOMORROW\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
