The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 28 to Amendment No. 27\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk. This \namendment is being offered on behalf of Senators Reid and Bryan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for himself and Mr. \n     Bryan, proposes an amendment numbered 28 to amendment No. 27.\n       At the end of the matter proposed to be inserted, add:\n       ``Notwithstanding any other provision of this bill, \n     transportation of spent nuclear fuel or high-level \n     radioactive waste under the provisions of this bill to a \n     centralized interim storage site or to a permanent repository \n     shall not cross any state line without the express written \n     consent of the governor of the state of entry.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, during the last several years, in fact, \nduring the entire time I have been in Congress, there has been an \nexplosion of comment about returning matters to the States. This has \nbeen evidenced in a number of pieces of legislation we passed, \nincluding those in the last Congress dealing with immigration reform \nand especially that dealing with welfare reform.\n  Matters have been returned to the States. Why? Because there have \nbeen feelings of many that there was an accumulation of power here in \nWashington that had taken away from the basic foundation of our \nconstitutional form of Government. Too much power was being developed \nand too much power actually existed in Washington, DC, in the Federal \nlevel of Government.\n  Mr. President, as a result of that, we, most everybody in Congress, \nhave felt that we needed to return things to the States and have the \nchief executive of that State have the say of what goes on within the \nconfines of that State.\n  That is what this amendment deals with. If you are going to ship the \nmost poisonous substance known to man across State lines, then, of \ncourse, you should get permission of the Governor.\n  Many also in the majority have proclaimed that the 105th Congress, \nabove all other Congresses, be a States rights Congress, the mantra of \nthose avowed supporters of States rights, grounded in the notion that \nCongress has no right to impose costly and burdensome laws, rules and \nregulations on the States. In fact, I joined with the assistant leader \nof the majority, Don Nickles, in sponsoring an amendment to the \nregulation reform bill that came from the House last Congress, the \nNickles-Reid amendment. That passed. In effect, what that amendment \nsaid is that Federal agencies are promulgating too many regulations \nwithout Congress having any authority or say as to what regulations \nthey have promulgated.\n  What the Nickles-Reid amendment said is that if there is a regulation \npromulgated that has a certain financial impact, then it does not go \ninto effect for 60 days. If it has less than a $100 million economic \nimpact, it goes into effect immediately, but we have 60 days to review \nit. That was only one example of how we felt that Congress should have \nmore say in returning power to the people.\n  Mr. President, the mantra of the States rights Congress is grounded \nin the notion that Congress has no right to impose these costly rules, \nlaws and regulations on States. I respect this point of view, and that \nis the reason I joined with my friend, the senior Senator from \nOklahoma, in sponsoring this legislation that passed without a single \ndissenting vote. It did not have a dissenting vote when we offered the \namendment here; there was not a single dissenting vote when it came \nback from the House in conference.\n  That said, it is ironic that some who consider themselves stalwart \nsupporters of States rights are going to support this underlying \nlegislation. If there is ever a bill that abrogated abuse of States \nrights in a more terrible manner than the underlying legislation, I do \nnot know what that would be. It seems that when it comes to issues \ninvolving the most basic of States rights, the right to be free of \nliving with deadly nuclear waste, this Congress does not care. We, Mr. \nPresident, are directing this amendment not to the States that have to \nlive with nuclear waste, we are directing it to the States that are \nconcerned about their highways and railways transporting this poison.\n  It seems that we should care. How can anyone who considers themselves \nto be a supporter of States rights vote against this amendment? It is \nclear that States rights then, if, in fact, they do not vote for this \namendment, is as hollow as the arguments that they could make on any \nspecious legislation. The next time we hear moving oratory about the \nsanctity of the tenth amendment and the need to protect States rights, \nI will simply refer to this second-degree amendment and ask where those \nstrong voices were on this issue involving the most fundamental of \nStates rights.\n  This amendment offered by this Senator and my colleague from the \nState of Nevada is something that every Senate office should listen to \nand listen to very closely. Remember what we are saying is that if you \nare going to transport nuclear waste through a State, the Governor \nshould give the signoff. Why do I say that? What we are doing is saving \nthis country a lot of problems by saying, ``Let the Governors sign \noff.'' Nuclear waste will not be transported in the United States. It \ndoes not matter how many bills we pass, it will not happen.\n  I was in the House of Representatives this morning talking to one of \nthe Presiding Officer's and this Senator's former colleague when we \nserved in the other body, and he said to me, ``You know, I voted with \nCongress on Vucanovich,'' who supported this Senator's position on \nnuclear waste. He said, ``I did it for a simple reason. If everyone \nsays that nuclear waste can be transported safely, then, obviously, it \nis going to be safe where it is to begin with. Why not leave it where \nit is?''\n  The reason I say we are doing this country a favor with this \namendment is that nuclear waste is not going to be transported. Look at \nthe experiences they had in Germany recently with the transfer of \nalmost 500 canisters of high-level nuclear waste. They wanted to haul \nthis 300 miles to a remote place in Germany. We are talking about \nhauling it more than 3,000 miles.\n  What did it take in Germany to haul this nuclear waste 300 miles? It \ntook 30,000 police and military personnel. The average speed was 2 \nmiles an hour. It cost the German Government over $150 million. The \nGerman Parliament has said, ``We're not going to do this anymore. We \nare going to review what we are doing.''\n  As we speak, Germany's Parliament is reevaluating the entire program. \nThey shipped 8 of 420 casks of high-level nuclear waste, and they have \ngiven up; 30,000 military and police personnel, 107 injuries, \ndemonstrations everyplace, people dug holes in the road and put \nbarriers over them so the trucks would fall in them when they came \nback. It was absolute civil disobedience at its worst. Why? Because the \npeople of Germany are human beings, and they do not want this stuff \nhauled unnecessarily. That is what this amendment is all about.\n  The two people representing the very fine State of South Carolina \nwere Governors of that State. Two of the most--I am trying to find the \nword. When the history books are written about the U.S. Senate, the two \nSenators from South Carolina will be talked about, the senior Senator \nand the junior Senator. They have made history in this institution. But \nthey also, before they came here, were Governors. They know what the \npower of the Governor should be.\n  Shouldn't the Governor of a State, a sovereign State under our \nFederal system of Government, have the right and the opportunity to \nsay, ``We will let this stuff travel through, but I'm going to have to \nsign off on it first''? If the Governor of the State does not have that \nright to make sure that his citizens are safe and free of harm and that \nthey can have enough personnel--in the instance of Germany, it took \n30,000--shouldn't they have that right? That is what this amendment is \nall about.\n\n  I do believe, without any question, we are doing a service with this \namendment. We are doing a service because if\n\n[[Page S2953]]\n\nyou are going to believe in this form of Government that we have, we \nhave a central whole divided amongst self-governing parts--that is the \ndefinition of our Government under the Constitution, a central whole \ndivided amongst self-governing parts--those self-governing parts are \nStates, and shouldn't they have the right to determine whether or not \nwe are going to haul this stuff willy-nilly through the States? That is \nwhat this amendment is about. It is simple and direct. It says, if you \nare going to haul nuclear waste, let the Governor of the State through \nwhich you are going to haul it sign off on it.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, let me add, if I may, \nthe significance I find in this piece of legislation that we are \noffering today. This has for too long a time been characterized \nstrictly as a Nevada issue, and many of my colleagues have, obviously, \nfocused less time on this than my senior colleague and I, because \nNevada is targeted as the interim storage facility in this piece of \nlegislation. But the point that we have sought to make is that there is \na national impact in the transportation of 85,000 metric tons--that is \nthe emphasis, 85,000 metric tons--of nuclear waste in an order of \nmagnitude never before seen. There have been over the years 2,500 \nshipments, but we are talking about 17,000, and as the Presiding \nOfficer may recall from our debate earlier on this, those earlier 2,500 \nshipments involved a relatively short distance of about 900 miles or \nless.\n  By reason of the proximity of the Nevada test site, as contrasted \nfrom the origin of the nuclear waste itself at the reactors, we are \ntalking about thousands of miles. I think my colleagues will recall \nthat we are talking about rail and highway corridors that go through 43 \nStates. Forty-three States are involved. So it is not just Nevada. \nForty-three States.\n  To give you some idea of the size of each cask, although they have \nnot yet been designed, what is contemplated is that a rail cask would \nweigh 125 tons and a truck cask would weigh 25 tons. You will recall \nthat, in terms of the level of potential radioactivity, that is the \nequivalent of 200 bombs the size of Hiroshima. So many may wonder why \nwe are suggesting that we do this with respect to high-level nuclear \nwaste shipments. It is because the order of risk is so much greater and \nthe consequences of failing to provide for it is much, much greater.\n  The Presiding Officer represents the great State of Oklahoma. You \nwill note that in Oklahoma, we have at least three different corridors \nthat would be used. These are all rail corridors that would come \nthrough the State of the distinguished Presiding Officer. What we are \nsimply saying is, ``Look, can a Governor have a greater responsibility \nand obligation to the citizens of the State that he or she represents \nthan to make sure that adequate measures are taken to protect the \nhealth and safety of the citizens of that State?''\n\n  Mr. President, as you know, I was honored by the citizens of my own \nState to have been elected Governor twice. I have some idea of the \nresponsibilities that a Governor undertakes, and there can be no \ngreater responsibility than a Governor advocating on behalf of the \npeople he represents to make sure that any actions that are within his \nor her power are done for the purpose of protecting the health and \nsafety of the citizens.\n  So that is what we are doing. Not only is the Presiding Officer's \nState involved, we have Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Arkansas, \nLouisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, \nNorth Carolina, Tennessee, Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, Utah, \nCalifornia, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, Nebraska, Iowa, \nMinnesota, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, West \nVirginia--we can go on and on and on--Pennsylvania, New York, \nMassachusetts, Connecticut, to go on and on. My point is that each of \nthese Governors should have the ability to make sure adequate \nsafeguards are taken.\n  Let me just say, because this is an issue that has occurred out in \nthe West and may not be widely publicized and it came to a boiling \npoint during the recess, there is a series of shipments which are being \nreceived on the west coast from overseas nuclear reactors. They would \ncome in through the Port of Oakland in California, ultimately to be \nlocated at the facility in Idaho. California's Governor complained \nvociferously that there had not been adequate notice, not adequate \nsafeguards taken, and so he has filed, on behalf of the people of \nCalifornia, a lawsuit, or has directed the attorney general to do so, \nto challenge the adequacy of some of those provisions. My senior \ncolleague, Senator Reid, pointed out the problems that have occurred in \nEurope. So these are not theoretical or hypothetical, these are real-\nlife circumstances, and Governors ought to have the ability to do that.\n  All we are saying is, look, each Governor must be satisfied that \nbefore a shipment goes through his or her State that safeguards are \nneeded to protect the citizens of that State in literally hundreds of \nthousands of cities that this nuclear waste would go through. That \nstrikes me as not being unreasonable.\n  We talk a lot in this Congress of returning power to the States, not \nassuming all wisdom resides on the banks of the Potomac. Indeed, those \nwho work in the Federal bureaucracy are vested with no greater wisdom \nthan those who toil on behalf of a State government at the State level. \nI hear that time after time in many different contexts as we debate \nlegislation on the floor.\n  There is no greater opportunity that a Member can have than to say, \nin effect, ``I am implementing a policy that provides to each of the \nStates that which I have philosophically espoused, namely, giving the \nGovernor, as the chief executive officer of that State, the ability to \nundertake the necessary protections.'' I think that is a reasonable \napproach. I think it is something that every Governor would want. It is \nnot partisan. Democratic Governors and Republican Governors alike would \ncertainly want to be protected in terms of the 17,000 shipments that \nwould pass through their States, through thousands of cities in \nAmerica, small communities, and that is not unreasonable. And because \nthese routes are identified here, as we are pointing them out--there is \nno great mystery--so that the State Governors could be contacted long \nin advance of any proposed shipment to work out the necessary health \nand safety precautions.\n\n  I say to my colleagues that, however they come down on S. 104, this \ncertainly is a measure that everybody ought to embrace because this is \nhealth and safety and it provides the ultimate protection for a \nGovernor to take care of those persons in his or her State to the best \nof that Governor's ability.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we need to make it very clear that this \namendment, this second-degree amendment, is not directed toward Nevada. \nIt is directed toward this sovereign Nation made up of 50 separate \nStates.\n  For example, Governor Beasley of South Carolina, before nuclear waste \nmoves through that State, would have to sign off saying, yes, it should \ntravel through the State of South Carolina. Governor Hunt of North \nCarolina would have to sign off saying, yes, it can travel through the \nState. Governor O'Bannon of Indiana, Governor Romer of Colorado, \nGovernor Voinovich of Ohio--and we would go through the list--allowing \nnuclear waste to travel.\n  I would say to people who espouse some degree of returning matters to \nthe States, there is no better and more direct example than this. What \nwe are saying is that the Governor of the State, the Governor of a \nsovereign State, one of the 50 sovereign States in this Nation, should \nhave the right to determine if they want this stuff carried through \ntheir State. It is as simple as that.\n  If it is in the best public interest of that State, the Governor will \nallow it.\n\n[[Page S2954]]\n\nIt would be better, I think, that Governor Beasley, Governor Hunt, \nGovernor Romer, Governor O'Bannon, Governor Voinovich, Governor Wilson, \nGovernor Miller would sign off rather than some nameless, faceless \nbureaucrat making the decision.\n  So I think Members of this U.S. Senate are going to be put to a test \ntoday, a very simple test. Do they really believe in States rights or \ndo they not?\n  There will, of course, be one of the very clever things that has \ndeveloped, with precedent, over here--a motion to table. The managers \nof this bill will move to table our second-degree amendment. And they \nwill say to their friends, ``Well, you're not really voting against \nStates rights. This is a procedural matter. You'll never be bothered at \nhome.'' Well, there is no doubt in my mind that this will be something \nthat constitutional bodies--those who believe in the constitutional \nform of Government, I should say, will target this as a very important \nStates rights vote. This is it. You cannot run and hide from this. The \nmotion to table will not do it.\n  So I hope that everyone will understand that this is a basic States \nrights issue. If you want to carry, transport or haul nuclear waste \nthrough a State, all you have to do is go to the Governor and say, \n``Governor, it's in the public interest to do this. It's very important \nthat you allow nuclear waste to travel through your State. And you can \nweigh the good and the bad.'' Let the Governor decide, not somebody who \nworks in the bowels of the Department of Energy down here on \nIndependence Avenue.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 28, As Modified\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be a \nsubstitute allowed for the second-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to modifying the second-\ndegree amendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 28), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the matter proposed to be inserted, add:\n       ``Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, no \n     transportation of high level waste or spent nuclear fuel to a \n     facility authorized under Section 205 of this Act shall take \n     place through a State without the prior written consent of \n     that State's Governor.''\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wonder if the clerk would read the \namendment, the substitution, to clarify where we are here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 28, as modified\n\n       At the end of the matter proposed to be inserted, add:\n       ``Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, no \n     transportation of high level waste or spent nuclear fuel to a \n     facility authorized under Section 205 of this Act shall take \n     place through a State without the prior written consent of \n     that State's Governor.''\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Let me refer to a reality, and that reality is behind me in the \nchart, because all of us should recognize what is happening in the \nUnited States now.\n  This is where nuclear fuel is moving. It is moving through all of the \n48 States with the exception of Florida and South Dakota. Now, that is \njust a harsh reality. In this timeframe from 1979 to 1995, there have \nbeen 2,400 movements of nuclear material. They moved safely; they moved \nover the transportation system of our highways, as well as our \nrailroads, as indicated in the red.\n  This is a very dangerous amendment that would basically ensure that \npotentially no nuclear waste anywhere would move to any storage or \ndisposal.\n  Let me highlight what it does in the next chart, because in the next \nchart we have the locations of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste \nin the United States. And in it is, Mr. President, 81 sites in 40 \nStates. Is it safer to leave that waste in 80 sites in 40 States or \nmove it?\n  This is what this amendment is all about. This is a desperate tactic \non the part of my good friends from Nevada who simply do not want the \nwaste put in their State. That is the bottom line, make no mistake \nabout it.\n  But we have an obligation here. We have a problem here. We are either \ngoing to solve it by defeating the second-degree or we are going to be \nleft with this situation that has been created over the last couple of \ndecades.\n  That is the harsh reality of where we are. This amendment grants to \nthe Governor of a State the power to preclude any specific shipments of \nspent fuel or nuclear waste through that State to the temporary \nproposed shipment site in Nevada out in the desert.\n  Let me show you where we propose to put this. We propose to put the \ntemporary repository out in Nevada where we have had a series of tests \nfor some two decades. I have the chart coming in. It is important that \nwe grasp the significance of just what this amendment would do if they \nare successful in passing it. On the face of it, it may have some \nappeal, particularly to Senators like myself who have always been \nstaunch supporters of States' authority to determine matters which are \nwithin their State borders.\n  Now here, Mr. President, is where we propose to put the temporary \nrepository. This is an area in Nevada used previously for more than 800 \nnuclear weapon tests over an extended period of time. The other option, \nMr. President, again, if you look at the other chart, is leave it where \nit is. If we take action today to support the second degree amendment, \nwe are killing any effort to address a problem that we have put off far \ntoo long. When I say ``far too long,'' Mr. President, we have \ncontracted to move this waste next year from the reactors where it has \nbeen stored as it is exhausted from the nuclear powerplants, and the \nliability associated with this is going to be substantial. It is \nestimated to be somewhere between $40 and $80 billion.\n  The appeal, as I said, that is perhaps of some significance, \nregulation of transportation of any type of hazardous materials across \nState lines, has long been one of the primary examples of appropriate \nexercise of Federal jurisdiction. I question the constitutionality of \nprohibiting the movement on highways, but that is neither here nor \nthere. The principles of federalism on which this country was founded \nrecognize that the States' authority to govern matters within their \nborders, must give way to Federal authority when an issue is one of \nnational scope reaching beyond any particular State borders. Interstate \nshipments of hazardous waste such as spent fuel and other forms of \nnuclear waste clearly require a uniform framework of requirements that \nensure safety but also insure that the shipments can reach their \ndestination.\n  Transportation of these materials is currently regulated under the \nHazardous Materials Transportation Act, known as HAZ-MAT. That law is \nan intricate system for controlling hazardous materials and shipments \nacross the United States. The HAZ-MAT system was adopted to uniformly \nregulate all materials regardless of type, and in each case regulation \nof these materials allows the States limited authority to conduct \ncertain inspections and other activities related to the shipment.\n  Never do the HAZ-MAT regulations, however, allow a Governor to veto \nthe shipments altogether. That is what this second-degree amendment \nwould propose to do. If each State were allowed to impose its own set \nof safety requirements, it would very likely prove impossible to move \nany hazardous material from one place to another. So the alternative is \nto leave it where it is.\n  This amendment is even more restrictive than that. It would allow \nvirtually a veto over any Federal shipments of nuclear spent fuel or \nother\n\n[[Page S2955]]\n\nnuclear waste through any State whose Governor chooses to exercise the \nauthority, even if all safety requirements are met. Again, Mr. \nPresident, I implore those that have questions about this to recognize \nthat these Governors want to get this waste out of their State. That is \nwhat Senate bill 104 is all about, providing a place to put the waste.\n  Now, my friends from Nevada, if they were able to prevail, we simply \ncould not move the waste. Is that what the States want? Is that what \nthe Governors of these States want? No, they do not want it left in \ntheir State. They want it to be moved to a safe place that has been \nproposed, which is, obviously, the desert out in Nevada.\n  Now, this amendment would allow any single State to thwart a solution \nto a national problem, the very situation that was intended to be \nprecluded by the Framers of the Constitution. Even though the original \nSenate bill 104 included adequate measures to guarantee safe \ntransportation of nuclear spent fuel, we have accepted additional \nprovisions in the substitution regarding safety and training, to assure \nsafe shipments.\n  It seems obvious that safety is not the real issue here. The real \ninterest here and the real issue here is simply Nevadans, the Nevada \nSenators, do not want it in their State. I am sympathetic to that. But \nit has to go somewhere. This is the best place, out here in the desert, \nwhere, again, we have had more than 800 nuclear weapon tests over the \nlast 50 years. That is the best place we have found in the United \nStates. If we want to move it outside the United States, that is \nanother matter. But who will take it? We do not have a place in the \nAtlantic to put it. People in the Pacific certainly do not want it. \nScientists have said you can put it in the sea bed, perhaps, but that \nis not going to be a possibility. This is the possibility. This is all \nwe are talking about. This is the crux of it. We either put it there or \nwe leave it where it is.\n  That is something in this debate that my friends from Nevada have \nreally not addressed. We have a permanent repository out here under \nconstruction. That repository is not going to be ready until the year \n2015. Our pools are filling up. We face a crisis relative to the \nability of our nuclear industry to continue to generate the 21 to 22 \npercent of power that is generated by nuclear energy in this country, \nwhen their pools are filling up with the high level of waste that the \nGovernment committed 15 years ago to take and has to start taking next \nyear. The reality is that some of those reactors probably will have to \nshut down because they are out of space. Somebody says, ``Well, make \nmore space.'' The States have control of the licensing, and rightly so. \nThose pools where the high-level waste is stored were not designed for \npermanent storage. They were designed for temporary storage, until such \ntime as the Federal Government would take the waste.\n\n  You might say, why is the Federal Government so generous in just \ntaking the waste? I remind the President that $13 billion has been paid \nto the Federal Government by the ratepayer, collected by the nuclear \npower companies, paid to the Federal Government by the ratepayers, and \nnow the Federal Government is in breach of its contract. Some people \naround here say, ``Well, that is no big deal. If you are going to \ncontract with the Government, that is just an incidental.'' I think \nthat is a terrible precedent to take.\n  The Government is in breach of the contract beginning next year. \nThere are going to be damages. The taxpayer will pick it up. How big? I \ndo not know. Mr. President, $59 billion was the last estimate for \ndamages. We have to get on with this. The national interest of \nproviding safe central storage of disposal of nuclear spent fuel could \nnever, ever, be achieved if this amendment is adopted. I submit that \nthis is the only purpose for which its proponents have offered it.\n  Again, I refer to the chart. If you look where it is, it is all over. \nThere are 80 sites in 41 States. If you don't want to leave it there, \nyou have to move it. This second-degree amendment would prohibit you \nfrom moving it. It would keep it where it is.\n  So, I implore all Senators representing the States that are affected \nhere to recognize what this amendment would mean. This amendment really \ndoes not pass the straight-face test, if we are serious about resolving \nthe nuclear waste issue. As a consequence, I think it speaks for \nitself.\n  I am going to read for the Record an editorial that appeared April 8 \nin the Chicago Tribune. The headline is, ``Honoring a Pledge on Nuclear \nWaste.''\n\n       From the start of commercial nuclear power, Washington \n     decided to make the storage of high-level radioactive waste a \n     Federal responsibility.\n\n  They are right. We did. We made it a Federal responsibility. We voted \non it. We passed it.\n\n       Fourteen years ago, Congress ordered the Federal Government \n     to begin taking control of nuclear waste in 1998 and storing \n     it at a permanent storage site in Nevada.\n\n  Where? In Nevada, right there, out in the desert.\n\n       Despite spending billions and extending deadlines, \n     Washington won't be ready to accept any waste for another 10 \n     years or so.\n\n  As a matter of fact, it is the year 2015, according to the previous \nSecretary of Energy, Hazel O'Leary.\n\n       Meantime, the stuff keeps piling up at nuclear power plants \n     in Illinois and around the Nation.\n       The Senate this week can begin to correct \n     this unconscionable malfeasance. It will consider a bill \n     to build a temporary waste storage facility in the Nevada \n     desert, about 100 miles from Las Vegas. It passed similar \n     legislation last year, but not by enough votes to override \n     a threatened veto by President Clinton, who agreed to \n     oppose it if Nevada's Democratic Governor and two Senators \n     supported his reelection.\n\n  This is a quote from the Chicago Tribune, Mr. President.\n  Well, it further states:\n\n       The election is over, but Clinton again is promising a \n     veto. Nuclear waste, he argues, shouldn't be shipped to a \n     temporary facility until it's known for certain whether a \n     permanent site can be built at nearby Yucca Mountain. \n     Temporary storage, he contends, will drain funds from Yucca \n     and make it likely the underground facility will never be \n     completed.\n       The Senate should end this political gamesmanship by \n     passing the bill by a veto-proof margin. For national \n     security and environmental safety, it makes more sense to \n     have the waste stored in a well-protected central location \n     than at scattered sites near major cities or bodies of water \n     like Lake Michigan, which are filling up rapidly. It will \n     also keep electricity users from shelling out twice for the \n     waste storage.\n       If Washington continues to slough off its obligation, it \n     will be forced to build additional above-ground storage \n     facilities at their nuclear plants and try to pass the cost \n     on to the consumers. For more than a decade, ratepayers have \n     chipped in billions to a private fund created by Congress to \n     help pay for permanent storage facility, some of which has \n     already been spent on research and study at Yucca.\n\n  ``A Federal appeals court''--this is important, Mr. President, \nbecause it is right on--``A Federal appeals court has ruled the Energy \nDepartment is contractually obligated to begin accepting the spent fuel \nnext year. That deadline is unrealistic, but a temporary storage site \nshould be designated so that the Government can begin receiving waste \nexpeditiously. Someone in Washington must honor past promises and quit \nputting different decisions off on future generations, and the Senate \ncan begin this week.''\n  I think that is right on target.\n  Now, I understand that there are those who have concerns about \ntransportation of spent fuel to a central facility. That is why this \nbill has 12 pages of language providing transportation, training, and \nnotification provisions.\n  Let me read from selected portions of the bill, section (2):\n\n       . . . not later than 24 months after the Secretary submits \n     a licensed application under section 205 for an interim \n     storage facility shall, in consultation with the Secretary of \n     Transportation and affected States and tribes, and after an \n     opportunity for public comment, develop and implement a \n     comprehensive management plan that ensures safe \n     transportation of spent nuclear fuel and high-level \n     radioactive waste from the sites designated by the contract \n     holders to the interim storage facility site.\n\n  Further, requirements:\n\n       A shipping campaign transportation plan shall--\n       (A) be fully integrated with State and tribal government \n     notification, inspection, and emergency response plans along \n     the preferred shipping route or State-designated alternative \n     route identified under subsection (d) . . .\n  Further, under ``Transportation requirements.''\n\n       (b) State Notification.--The Secretary shall abide by \n     regulations of the Commission regarding advance notification \n     of State and\n\n[[Page S2956]]\n\n     tribal governments prior to transportation of spent nuclear \n     fuel or high-level radioactive waste under this Act.\n       (2) No shipments if no training.--(A) There will be no \n     shipments of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive \n     waste through the jurisdiction of any State or the \n     reservation lands of any Indian Tribe eligible for grants \n     under paragraph (3)(B) unless technical assistance and funds \n     to implement procedures for the safe routine transportation \n     and for dealing with emergency response situations under \n     paragraph (1)(A) have been available to a State or Indian \n     Tribe for at least 3 years prior to any shipment.\n\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, this is a dangerous amendment. This is \nan amendment that freezes nuclear waste where it currently is, in those \n41 States, 80 sites. Some of them are near neighborhoods, some are near \nschools. Just reflect on the significance if this second-degree \npasses--this stuff won't move. Of course, as I said before, my friends \nfrom Nevada simply don't want it to move to their State. That is really \nwhat this debate is all about. Nobody wants the stuff. You have to put \nit somewhere. Every State should accept the responsibility. In \nConnecticut, we build nuclear submarines, and that, I am sure, from the \nstandpoint of the delegation from Connecticut, is very attractive from \nthe economics associated with shipbuilding. But do they have a \nresponsibility as a State? They generate the prosperity, but they don't \nhave to put up with the actual disposal of the submarines when they are \ncut up and the reactors that are sent to Hanford in the State of \nWashington and go up the Columbia River.\n  I think every State has an interest in this. Colorado has waste out \nin their State. Do they want to keep that military waste there, or do \nthey want to move it out? This second-degree amendment will ensure that \nit will stay in Colorado. I don't think the Governor or the Colorado \ndelegation want that to happen. They want to move it out. The reality \nis, Mr. President, that nobody wants it. I don't know whether the \nNevada delegation would consider some kind of a creation of this area \nout there in Nevada, dispense it from the State and put it under some \nkind of an original Federal enclave that is no longer part of the \nState. For all practical purposes, its structure is it's Federal land \nout in a State. But, clearly, the Federal Government does not have the \ndisposition because it is still in a State. But the reality is, rather \nthan go down that rabbit trail too long, no one of the 50 States wants \nto be named as either a permanent or temporary repository for the \nwaste.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, at an appropriate time, I will move to \ntable this amendment. It is my understanding that there are other \nMembers who intend to speak in opposition of the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Bryan].\n  Mr. BRYAN. Let me respond to a couple of things that the chairman of \nthe Energy Committee has said that I think bears correction. First of \nall, the amendment, as cast--\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Will my friend yield for a unanimous-consent request \nfrom the leadership?\n  Mr. BRYAN. Yes.\n\n\n                       Unanimous-Consent Request\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote \noccur on or in relation to the pending Reid-Bryan second-degree \namendment, No. 28, at 11 o'clock today.\n  Mr. BRYAN. This is the first I have heard of this.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thought it had been cleared.\n  Mr. BRYAN. It has not been. I want to assure the chairman that it is \nnot our intent to be dilatory, but this is the first I have been made \naware of that proposal.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I certainly apologize, because I checked and asked, \nand they said it was. I withdraw the unanimous-consent request at this \ntime and yield back to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I appreciate that. The Senator has been very fair, in \nterms of affording us the opportunity to do what is permitted under the \nrules. Perhaps what may have occurred is that we were asked by our \nstaff to be given adequate time before a vote was taken, and someone \nsaid 11 o'clock would be that adequate time. That may have been \nmisconstrued, I say to my friend. As to an agreement for a time certain \nfor the vote, that was not my intention, and I accept what the chairman \nsaid.\n  Let me make a couple of points, if I may. One is that this amendment \napplies only to the shipment of waste to the interim facility. So we \nare not talking about the ultimate shipment that may go to a permanent \nrepository if indeed that repository would be found acceptable. I know \nthe distinguished occupant of the chair, in his own legal background, \nwould appreciate that what we are trying to say to his State and to \nevery other State--Alabama has a great many routes that are going to be \nmajor corridors for the transshipment of nuclear waste. Most of those \nappear on this map to be hideaway corridors. I confess not knowing the \nState as he does, but there are at least four different corridors that \nwould be involved, as I see it, by rail. That is the blue line. Much of \nthat would come from Florida and Georgia, it would appear. Some would \ncome from Tennessee, perhaps, I don't know. Then there is a major \nhighway that appears to come across the top of his State. So what it \nwould simply say is that the Governor of Alabama, before shipments \nwould cross his State, would say, ``Look, I want to have the \nopportunity to review and look and see if indeed all of the safety \nprecautions are there.'' Then if the Alabama Governor said he was \nsatisfied, no problem, that's fine. We are trying to provide States \nwith the opportunity to defend and protect themselves.\n\n  The basic premise, Mr. President, is that we ought not to be moving \nthis stuff all over the country, back and forth. Somehow there has been \nthis fallacious assumption that there has been a determination that the \nNevada test site is preeminently qualified to serve as an interim \nstorage facility. That simply is not true. There has never been a study \nthat reaches such a conclusion. There are probably a thousand places in \nthe country that would be acceptable for interim storage. The only \nreason the Nevada test site has been chosen is the premise that the \npermanent repository at Yucca Mountain will meet the test. That is what \nthis debate is about. We will talk much more about that in a different \ncontext.\n  I want to, also, if I may, set the record straight. The Chicago \neditorial that the distinguished chairman read is absolutely replete \nwith misinformation and errors. As the chairman read the article and \nindicated that 14 years ago it was determined that Nevada was the site, \nMr. President, that is simply not true. Fourteen years ago, I believe \nthe Congress attempted to pass a reasonable and balanced piece of \nlegislation--the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982--which was signed \ninto law by then President Reagan in the early part of 1983. What it \nsaid was that we will look across the country and try to find the best \nsites. We will look at formations that consist of granite; we will look \nat the salt domes; we will look at welded tuft, which is what we have \nin Nevada. No region in the country will have to bear it all. There \nwill be a balance. And, indeed, three sites would ultimately be \nsubmitted to the President of the United States after the study--three \nsites--and the President would select among those three sites.\n  Now, that made some sense, in terms of the scientific approach and, \nindeed, I think that most people in my own State, as well as across the \ncountry, to the extent that they followed this, said that was balanced.\n  Here is what happened. No sooner was the ink dry than the \nPresidential campaign of 1984 began to heat up and the President was \ntelling people in the Southeast, ``Don't worry, it is not going to be \nsalt domes.'' Then the Department of Energy said, ``Well, my gosh, \nlocating something in the East is going to create a lot of political \npressure for us, so we will abandon that site.'' Then, in 1987 came the \nultimate rejection and repudiation of anything that purported to have \nany kind of scientific basis at all; it is a bill that is known in \ninfamy in Nevada as the ``screw Nevada'' bill. It said, without so much \nas a scintilla of science, that we will only look at Nevada. That \nwasn't what the law said in 1984. It said we would look at three, we \nwould look all over the country. Maybe Nevada would be the short straw. \nWe would not like that. I am sure the occupant of the chair would not \nlike it if it were Alabama. I understand that.\n\n[[Page S2957]]\n\n  Now, somehow the editorial suggested that the President entered into \na crass political quid pro quo with my distinguished colleague, the \nsenior Senator from Nevada, with me and the Governor, and said, ``Look, \nif you support my reelection that had absolutely nothing to do with \nit.'' We made our argument based on merit--that is, that there should \nnot be a shipment of interim waste to an interim storage facility until \nsuch determination of a permanent facility could actually be \ncharacterized. That was the whole scientific predicate. The President \nof the United States, in reaching his conclusion, followed the \nrecommendations and conclusion of the Nuclear Waste Technical Review \nBoard, a body constituted by this Congress, which said there is \nabsolutely no need to have an interim storage facility at this point.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator agree that President Clinton would be \nbetter off politically if he had gone along with the majority?\n  Mr. BRYAN. Absolutely. If you are looking at this in terms of the \npolitical consequences, there are four electoral votes in Nevada. Many \nStates have many more. So if it was a political calculus made, the \nPresident's math was poor indeed. He supported the position argued by \nnot only those of us in Nevada, but those who were following the \npremise of the act, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, and the \npoint made by the Senator from Arkansas the other day that we ought not \nto be transporting this across the country until we have the permanent \nsite. Does it make any sense at all? I believe that was the basis.\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. BRYAN. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. As to the present state of the law, I ask the Senator, what \ndoes it say about whether or not you can locate a permanent repository \nand a temporary repository in the same State?\n  Mr. BRYAN. The present state of the law, enacted by the Congress, \nprohibits a State that is being considered for a permanent facility to \nbe the site of an interim or temporary facility. Moreover, at the \nrequest, as I recall it, of the Tennessee delegation some years ago, it \nprohibits the location of an interim facility until an application for \nlicensure is made for the permanent facility. Now, that was sound \npolicy. No. 1, no State, frankly, should have to bear the burden of \nboth. That was the philosophy and the remnant of what was a fair act in \nthe beginning--to look all over the country. The interim ought not to \nbe located before the permanent, because we know that kind of tends to \nbe de facto permanent. That was good policy, I say in answer to my \nfriend.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator allow me to ask another question?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I will.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding, belief, and knowledge that you, \nlike the two Senators from South Carolina, have been the chief \nexecutive of the State of Nevada, the Governor.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Yes, we share that history together. I was elected twice \nas Governor of my State.\n  Mr. REID. Is it true that one of the philosophies that you had while \nyou were Governor was to protect the rights of the State of Nevada?\n  Mr. BRYAN. It was indeed. Every Governor takes an oath of office in \nwhich he or she indicates they will indeed uphold those rights and \nresponsibilities, and I did so, as each and every Governor has done not \nonly in Nevada but throughout the country, I am sure.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator further respond? It is my understanding \nthat the Senator has a law degree from the University of California \nHastings College of Law, was Nevada's first public defender, and was a \nprosecutor and in the district attorney's office. He was also in \nprivate practice. How many times was the Senator elected attorney \ngeneral of the State?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I was elected attorney general once.\n  Mr. REID. During that period of time, the Senator was the chief \npolitical officer of the State of Nevada. Is that true?\n  Mr. BRYAN. That is true.\n  Mr. REID. And the chief function was to handle the legal questions \nthat came to the State of Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. That is, to advise all of the State agencies that were \nconstituted by the State legislature or established in our \nConstitution, and to represent, protect, and defend the people of the \nState. That was my obligation.\n  Mr. REID. Based upon the Senator's experience as Governor of the \nState of Nevada and as its chief legal officer, the Attorney General of \nthe State of Nevada, and based upon other legal experiences, does the \nSenator from Nevada think it is an appropriate function of this \nCongress to adopt this amendment protecting the States rights in all 50 \nStates?\n  Mr. BRYAN. It is indeed. This I would say to my friend from Nevada is \na litmus test of whether we just talk the talk or walk the walk. This \nis all about States rights. I cannot conceive of any attorney general \nor any Governor in America who would not want the ability to provide \nfor the protection of his or her State by simply saying, ``Look, before \nwe ship this 25-ton cask that someday will be provided by rail''--the \n25-ton casks that are going to be mounted on some type of highway \ntransport with the equivalency of 200 Hiroshimas in terms of its \nradioactive potential--I would think that any Governor, or any attorney \ngeneral who has taken the same kind of oath of office that I and others \nhave taken, would say, ``Look. I would like the ability to provide that \nprotection. I would like to see what it is that is coming.''\n  I say in response to my friend's question about the protections that \nare purportedly built into this S. 104 that deals with transportation \nissues that it seems to me this is a logical extension of that.\n  Mr. REID. I say in further questioning of my friend, if in fact this \nsubstitute, this bill that we are working under now, has all of the \nprotections that we have heard about here for the last several days--\nthat they are going to train people and have all of these protections--\nbased upon the Senator's experience as attorney general and Governor of \nthe State, and as a U.S. Senator, doesn't it seem to make sense that if \nall of those protections are built in you could go to a Governor and \nreasonably explain that this is such a great piece of legislation, and \nsay ``You are protected, sign on, Governor''? Could the Senator see \nthat happen?\n  Mr. BRYAN. Absolutely. Indeed, I would go further. It seems to me \nthat it would be incumbent upon the department that wants to shift \nthis, talking about 835,000 metric tons--we are talking about 17,000 \nshipments over a period of a number of decades--it would seem to me \nthat the department would have the burden of going to Governors who \nhave concerns, talk with them, and to say, ``Look. This is what we are \ndoing. This is how we propose to protect the shipment route to go \nthrough your State.'' That seems to me to be a reasonable basis.\n  I know that there are others who want to take the floor and will have \na chance to discuss this some more. But I would like to conclude by \nsaying that this is something that gives every Governor an opportunity \nto protect his or her citizens. And I say with some measure of envy \nthat the Senator from Alaska can speak with a far greater degree I \nsuppose of comfort level because whatever occurs or does not occur in \nthis body, his State is thousands of miles from the field of action. I \nwish I were so fortunate. But it becomes my responsibility representing \nthe people of Nevada who I represent, and who are my primary \nresponsibility, to make sure that we provide all of the protections \nthat can possibly be secured for their health and safety. And I will \ncontinue to do so.\n  This is an offer by my colleague from Nevada and I to try to provide \na safe piece of legislation, if indeed this is to be enacted into law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I stand on the floor today to speak against \nthe Reid-Bryan amendment as it relates to Governors' authority on \ntransportation of materials through their States.\n  My colleague from Nevada, who is not only a U.S. Senator but a former \nGovernor of that State, just said something that I found fascinating in \nthe\n\n[[Page S2958]]\n\ncontext of this legislation or this amendment. In a dialog with his \ncolleague, the other Senator from Nevada, he suggested that with all of \nthe safeguards and the protections put in, couldn't you go to a \nGovernor and logically argue with him and, therefore, convince him to \njust sign off, Governor?\n  My guess is that as a former Governor of the State of Nevada or a \nGovernor today in Nevada, with all these safeguards, he wouldn't sign \noff--not because of the science, not because of the engineering, but \nbecause of the politics. Plain and simple politics is what is dictating \nthe argument on the floor today--not science, not engineering, not the \nfacts. So, sign off, Governor. Just sign off, and everything will be \nfine. And the Governor looks over his back shoulder, he looks at the \npolls, and he sees that the citizens of his State do not want nuclear \nwaste stored in their State no matter how good the science, no matter \nhow good the engineering, no matter how good the record, no matter how \ngood the history of that record. What does he do? Is he the statesman \nthat he should be? Not at all. He is the politician that he is. He \nsays, ``My reelection is in trouble if I do thus and so.''\n  Why do I speak in this manner? Because Idaho went through that very \nexperience. Idaho has a large amount of interim storage of high-level \nnuclear material. And a former Governor of our State got a Federal \ncourt order to stop the shipment of that waste coming into the State. \nBut could he get the Federal court to ultimately say no waste movement \nto Idaho? No; what he could get, what any Governor can get, what our S. \n104 provides, and what current law provides is that he could assure \nthat the condition in which that waste would be stored both long-term \nor short-term would be safe, would be environmentally sound, and would \nnot put at risk or put in danger the citizens of that State.\n  Why could the Governor not absolutely say, ``It cannot cross my \nborders''? Because we are no longer a confederation of States. We \nalmost fell apart as a nation when we were a confederation. We are now \na union bound together by a Constitution that speaks very specifically \nto interstate commerce, and the ability of a Governor or a State to \nblock the movement of materials or commerce across its border. But what \nwe do say--and what we defend and what S. 104 clearly spells out--is \nthat the Governor of the State and the State itself can condition the \nmovement of materials across its border.\n  That is exactly what the State of Idaho did. My Governor over the \nlast several years has signed agreements with the Department of Energy \nunder a Federal court order that conditions the waste that still comes \nto Idaho across many borders up the rails from Norfolk, VA, to Idaho--\n2,500-plus miles, 600 shipments over 30 years, and never an accident--\nwith never a human put at risk by the spill of radioactive activity.\n  I am not suggesting nor am I attempting to impugn the integrity of \nthe Senators from Nevada. They will do what they must do because they \nhave the right to do it. But let me suggest they do not have the \nscience, and they do not have the engineering. They only have the \npolitics.\n  When you look at the amendment that they proposed and at the \nlegislation that the Senator from Alaska, I, and the committee crafted, \nwhen you talk about the intricacies of laws, when you look at the \nlegislation that is now law, the Hazardous Materials Transportation \nAct, known as HAZMAT which involves the States, which assures that \nStates and Federal transportation of hazardous materials is in concert, \nthat humans are safe and humans are protected, but the reality is that \nto provide greater protection for the broader good and for the national \ninterests sometimes State borders must be crossed. The HAZMAT system \nhas adopted a uniform, regulated approach toward handling materials \nregardless of their type. Regulations of these materials allow States \nauthority to conduct certain inspections, and we have even extended \nthat. We have created greater authority in this legislation because \nseveral of our Senators--and rightfully so--are concerned about the \nmovement of radioactive materials across their States. And I am \nconcerned when States are not generators of it. My State is a partial \ngenerator but a much larger store in a temporary way of waste.\n  This second-degree amendment is not just some conditioning amendment. \nThis kills S. 104. This changes the whole character and the context of \nwhat the bill itself would do. The Senator from Alaska, the chairman of \nthe committee, has so clearly said that this gives every Governor in \nevery State absolute authority to cancel, stop, or otherwise terminate \nmovement across State borders. We have really never given States that \nauthority. And we should not here. But we have continually done it. And \nI have argued for it on many occasions under many different examples \nand legislation that is now law. States have very clear rights. They \nhave 10th amendment rights. And those rights are very strong as it \nrelates to the ability of States to govern themselves and control \nthemselves, and not have the Federal Government impugn that authority, \nor dictate that authority, or change the character of that authority. \nBut one thing that a State cannot do is lock and block its borders.\n  That is, of course, the reason that 208 years ago many of what we now \ncall our Founding Fathers joined in Philadelphia to try to figure out \nhow to get our States back together because we were falling apart \nlargely because States had that kind of absolute authority. The States \nof Maryland and Virginia were shooting at each other across the Potomac \nRiver, or at least some of their interests were. And the Confederation \nwas falling apart. That was one of the early parts of a Constitution, \nto make sure that commerce could flow.\n\n  I think all of the Senators on the floor would argue that this isn't \nthe best form of commerce, and this isn't like what we would like to \nthink of as commerce. But we clearly recognize that in the national \ninterest, when it comes to the rights of States, that the principles of \nfederalism on which our country was founded recognize States' authority \nto govern matters within their borders but must give way to Federal \nauthority when an issue is one of national scope reaching beyond the \nparticular boundaries of a given State. This is an interesting \ncombination.\n  This is not only an issue of national scope. This is a Federal \nmaterial going to a Federal property--not a private property, not a \nState-owned property, but Federal land in the State of Nevada. The \nSenators from Nevada and I are oftentimes very perplexed because we are \nrepresentatives of States that have very large Federal domains. \nSometimes we wish a great amount of that land could either be public-\nState land, and in some instances private land, but that is not the way \nit is, and that is not the way our States came into the Union. As a \nresult, we are talking about building an interim storage facility, \nafter viability determination, facilitating a deep geologic repository, \nlong term. And it is not true that this is just going to happen and the \nNevada test site was just chosen. Certainly this argument deserves \nmerit. I know it can have the emotion, and I certainly know it has its \npolitics because I live with nuclear radioactive politics in my State \nevery day because we are a repository temporarily of large volumes of \nhigh-level waste from our nuclear Navy. I also know that it has been \nhandled safely for decades, and it is a sound place to store it on a \ntemporary basis until such time as a permanent repository is developed.\n  As I have mentioned, over 600 shipments have moved across numerous \nState borders from as far away as from Norfolk, VA, to the deserts of \nIdaho. And it has been done safely, soundly, and responsibly because of \nour country's recognition of the risk and the liability to human \nsafety. And we have never compromised a human, and we never will.\n  We cannot kill S. 104. I hope that when the Senator from Alaska \nplaces the tabling motion that our colleagues will join with us to \ntable the second-degree amendment because there is no question about \nits intent. I believe it is not a constitutional amendment. But then \nagain we don't judge the Constitution here on the floor. We only try to \nlive with it and live under it. That is not ours to make that judgment. \nBut I do not believe the courts of our country would allow the Governor \nof the\n\n[[Page S2959]]\n\nState of Nevada or Idaho the privilege of absolute cancellation, or \nabsolute border blockage. And that is, of course, in my opinion, what \nthis amendment ultimately does. So I would ask my colleagues to join \nwith us, those who support S. 104, in the need to recognize the \nimportance of the building of a national deep geological repository for \nhigh-level materials and high-level nuclear spent fuel and that they \nwould vote down the second-degree amendment and vote for the tabling \nmotion.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the senior Senator from Idaho articulated \nthe position that we have felt for several years. He did it clearly and \nconcisely and directly when he said nuclear waste is safe. If that is \nthe case, leave it where it is. That is what we say. If it is so safe, \nleave it where it is. There is no reason to change the law, to go \naround, to short-circuit, to sidestep the present law. Last year, $200-\nplus million were spent characterizing the site at Yucca Mountain. What \nthis underlying bill does is just throw all that money away and goes \nand pours a cement pad on top of the ground and dumps all the spent \nfuel rods on the cement pad.\n  The amendment that is now before this body says that if you are going \nto transport nuclear waste through a State, the Governor must allow \nthat to happen. We certainly, under this Constitution, this \nConstitution that we all live by and talk about, have the obligation, \nwe have the right to set standards as to how the flow of commerce will \ntake place.\n  The senior Senator from Idaho said that you are moving Federal \nproperty. Certainly, doesn't the Federal Government, the Congress of \nthe United States have the ability and the right to determine how \nFederal property is going to be moved? That is an inherent right we \nhave, to determine the flow of commerce over our sovereign borders.\n  Continually, there have been efforts to say this is only a Nevada \nproblem, this is just a couple of Senators from Nevada carping about a \nprovincial interest; nobody else in the world cares about this other \nthan the Senators from Nevada.\n  Madam President, every environmental organization in America opposes \nthis legislation, and I say every. I also say that we only need look \naround. The United Transportation Union, you would think that this \nunion would be really enthused about hauling large cargo. No, they are \nnot real enthused. In fact, in a letter of April 8 of this year, the \nnational director of this union, with a copy of a letter to the \ninternational president, C.L. Little, states:\n\n       In its present form, S. 104, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act \n     of 1997, advocates a reckless and unsafe shipping campaign of \n     spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.\n\n  Madam President, the United Transportation Union, to my knowledge, \ndoes not have a local. It does not have a local union in Nevada. If it \ndoes, I do not know about it. There may be one up in the northern part \nof the State where the railroad goes through, but I really doubt it. \nThis letter is not driven by Nevada interests. It is driven by the \nUnited Transportation Union that cares about its members and wants safe \ntransportation of products. The letter goes on to say:\n\n       The Chairman of the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board \n     has testified to serious deficiencies in the transportation \n     planning and preparation that are so necessary to execute \n     this campaign safely . . .\n       Serious questions remain regarding containment integrity of \n     the transportation canisters that would have to be designed, \n     tested, evaluated, certified and procured. Presently the \n     country has only a few shipping containers that were \n     developed and tested a number of years ago.\n\n  I was going to say a long time ago, which is, in fact, the case.\n\n       These have apparently proven durable under some accident \n     environments.\n\n  And we talked about that. If the accident occurs and you are not \ngoing more than 30 miles an hour, you are in pretty good shape. If the \nfire isn't burning more than 1,400 degrees, you are OK. Of course, \ndiesel burns at 1,800 degrees. They go on to say:\n\n       The NRC certification requirements for newly manufactured \n     containers have raised serious concerns regarding their \n     integrity.\n\n  That is the ones that are now in existence.\n\n       A program of design and full-scale testing is desperately \n     needed to generate confidence that the transportation \n     campaign could be done safely.\n\n  This is the not driven by Nevada interests. This is driven by \ninterests of a national union that is concerned about what is shipped \nacross the railways of this country.\n  Now, I know there are Baptist churches in Nevada, but I have to tell \nyou, I do not have enough power over the Baptist churches in Nevada to \nhave them prepare a letter from the entire Baptist ministry of this \ncountry opposing this legislation. I wish I had that ability, but I do \nnot.\n  In spite of that, Madam President, just a few days ago they wrote a \nletter to every Senator in this body saying, among other things:\n\n       S. 104 would require the premature transportation of \n     nuclear waste, placing communities in some 43 States at risk. \n     Current cask regulations fail to consider the full range of \n     plausible accident conditions and do not require compliance \n     testing of full-cask models.\n\n  I did not make this up. I did not write this letter. This is written \nfrom the National Ministries of the American Baptist Churches USA.\n\n       The American Baptist Churches USA, a denomination of over \n     one million members in all 50 States, regards the right to a \n     secure and healthy environment, clean air, pure water and an \n     Earth that can nurture and support present and future \n     generations as a human right. This right is rooted in the \n     Biblical revelation that God cares for the good of all, has \n     delivered us from sin and intends that we express love toward \n     our neighbors. Our concern for persons and the earth we share \n     compels us to support efforts to transport and dispose of \n     hazardous and radioactive waste in a safe and secure manner. \n     S. 104 fails to meet this criteria for safety and security. \n     For these reasons, I urge you to oppose S. 104.\n\n  The director, Curtis W. Ramsey-Lucas, National Ministries of American \nBaptist Churches USA.\n  Madam President, this is not a Nevada letter. There are Baptist \nchurches in Nevada. I am very thankful for that. Here is a group of \nmillions of people who are interested in this issue but only as it \nprotects people, and this legislation does not protect people.\n  We have from the State of Missouri two members from the other party. \nThey do not represent this side of the aisle, but yet the Missouri \nCoalition for the Environment writes a letter saying:\n\n       Missouri would surely be one of the primary States that \n     would suffer a high percentage of the train and truck \n     shipments because of its central location and the relatively \n     well-maintained conditions of its rail tracks and roads.\n       Political leaders may seek to comfort their urban \n     constituents by promising that these shipments would avoid \n     highly populated areas. However, such areas are precisely \n     where the best transit routes cover. Because industrial job \n     centers receive the greatest number of train and truck \n     shipments, the roads, rails and bridges are maintained better \n     than more isolated routes.\n       Although no one knows exactly which routes the railroad and \n     trucking companies would choose, current computer analyses \n     predict that all but seven States would be affected by this \n     massive--\n\n  Listen to this word--\n\n       fruitbasket upset.\n       Because all irradiated nuclear power plant fuel contains \n     plutonium--a primary component of nuclear bombs--the Nuclear \n     Regulatory Commission requires that when shipments transit \n     cities of over 100,000 either by rail or highway, two armed \n     escorts--\n\n  Now, this does not say armed guards, two armed escorts--\n\n       must accompany every shipment of the irradiated fuel in an \n     effort to protect against terrorists.\n       Until a permanent repository is built and in operation, we \n     believe the wisest, safest move would be to prevent any move \n     of America's high-level radioactive waste through our cities \n     and towns.\n\n  Madam President, the point I am making is this is not a Nevada issue \nonly. This is an issue that is here because it is being driven by big \nmoney. Utilities making, as we indicated, over 17 percent profits, they \nwant to shun the responsibility that they have created with nuclear \ngarbage and get it out of their hands.\n  All the talk about having to do it by next year is poppycock. The \ncourt case was very clear. If the responsibility is that of the Federal \nGovernment, and they are the reason that the repository is not ready \nand it is their fault, then they will have to pay the damages. What are \nthe damages? It is the cost of\n\n[[Page S2960]]\n\nstorage. We have already established that the cost of storage is almost \nmeaningless. On-site storage costs almost nothing, and it is safe, as \nindicated by the Missouri Coalition for the Environment, by the \nNational Ministries of the Baptist Church.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. And by the United Transportation Union. I would be happy to \nyield.\n  Mr. BRYAN. We have heard considerable debate in the Chamber here \nabout the horrendous liability that may exist out there because \neveryone concedes that the Department would not be able to physically \naccept possession of the waste in 1998. I thought I understood the \nSenator to indicate that there is at least some measure of damages \nprovided. We have heard all kinds of billions and billions of dollars. \nI wasn't sure that I heard the Senator's comments.\n  Mr. REID. I would answer my friend's question. We have made, since \nthis bill came up, we have made $21 billion for the country. The figure \nwas originally $80 billion. You heard the remarks of the proponents of \nthis legislation. They said it is down to $59 billion. The truth is it \nshould be down in the low millions, because to store this substance \nonsite costs almost nothing. The average cost per site is $5 million. \nLet us say we have 100 sites. We have 109 sites. We are talking about \n$50 million or whatever it is. Significantly less than $59 billion.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Am I correctly informed that each of the utilities has \nentered into a contract with the Department of Energy dating back to \nthe enactment of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act? Is that the Senator's \nunderstanding?\n  Mr. REID. Absolutely true. It is by contract.\n  Mr. BRYAN. By contract. And there are provisions, if I understand it, \nthat specifically relate to the scenario that is going to occur, \nnamely, that nuclear waste, its physical possession cannot be accepted \nin 1998, and there are specific provisions in that contract, if I \nunderstand correctly.\n  Mr. REID. Absolutely. And the court, in making its decision, like \nmany courts do, said let us send this back and take a look at what the \ncontractual provisions are. And the contractual provisions are very \ndirect and concise. This is not going to generate a lot of lawsuits.\n  Mr. BRYAN. And the measure of damages, as I recall, that is in that \ncontract, it is additional cost that the utilities will incur, and that \nadditional cost would be the provision of additional storage during \nthat period of time, if I am correctly informed.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is absolutely right. If they decided to leave \nit in the cooling ponds, whatever the cost of that would be during that \ninterim period of time for the storage ponds. If they decide to do the \nright thing, which is probably dry cask storage containment, then it \nwould be an average of $5 million per site.\n  Mr. BRYAN. And they could use that as an offset in terms of what they \nare paying into the Nuclear Waste trust fund right now.\n  Mr. REID. Absolutely right. In preparation for a permanent \nrepository. And that is why I say to my friend from Nevada and everyone \nelse, this is not a Nevada-only issue. We are here espousing what we \nfeel is appropriate to protect the State of Nevada. But that is only \nsecondary to the issues that affect this whole country and that is why \nthe Baptist Ministries, the United Transportation Union and the people \nfrom Missouri--and I only picked a few of the letters. As you know, \nthere are several hundred organizations that we know of--oppose this \nlegislation, which is so unsafe for the environment and so unnecessary, \nand only being driven by the gluttonous utilities of this country.\n  Mr. BRYAN. So the argument that we have heard in the Chamber that \nratepayers will pay twice is specious, because to the extent that after \n1998 nuclear waste would not be taken physically from a site, it cannot \nbe under any scenario, the ratepayers would then be protected because \nany additional costs that the utilities would incur would be deducted \nfrom the payments that the utilities would have to make into the \nnuclear waste trust fund, so there would be no double payment.\n  Mr. REID. I would respond to my friend, that is absolutely correct. A \nfirst-year law student not even having taken a course in contracts \nwould read that and understand that it is one of the most simple \ncontracts ever written, and that is why the court did not spend a lot \nof time on that issue.\n  Mr. BRYAN. It strikes me as curious, if I am hearing the Senator \nrespond, that, indeed, the senior Senator and I have introduced for a \nnumber of years legislation that would accomplish the same provision \nthat exists in the contract; namely, to the extent that there is not \nthe ability to physically take possession, the utility would be \nentitled to a reimbursement in the form of the reduction in the \npayments made to the nuclear waste trust fund.\n  Mr. REID. I would respond to my friend, we did that prior to the \ncourt rendering its decision. Probably now the legislation is \nunnecessary, but we could certainly do that. And I think it would make \nthings a little clearer. But it is really unnecessary now because the \ncourt, in effect, has ruled that way.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. So, Madam President, what we are saying is that this \namendment simply establishes what should be the law of this land. That \nis, if you are going to haul, as indicated in the chart behind the \nmanager of the bill and the chart behind my colleague from the State of \nNevada, showing all these routes all over the country, what we are \nsaying is this product, if it is going to be transported through a \nState, the Governor should give the OK.\n  We have been told here for several days now that transporting this \nproduct is going to be just as safe as carrying a quart of milk from \nthe store to your home. If that is the case, the Governors that I have \nmentioned, Beasley, Hunt, Romer, O'Bannon, Voinovich, Wilson from \nCalifornia, Miller from Nevada--and all the other fine Governors, chief \nexecutives of the States, they should be able to sit down with their \nstaffs, it should be explained to them how safe this is, they would \nsign on the dotted line, and their constituents would feel happy that \nthe government was protecting their interests.\n  If we do not do this we are going to wind up with a situation that \nhas already occurred in recent days in Europe where, to move this \nproduct in the country of Germany, 300 miles, you had to call up 30,000 \npolice and armed guards to transport at the rate of 2 miles an hour. \nThey had to go 2 miles an hour because people had dug huge holes under \nthe roadways and put in, in effect, disguised covers so these vehicles \nwould fall into them--2 miles an hour. There were 170 people injured, \nhundreds of people arrested. And Germany's parliament said we are not \ngoing to do this anymore. We are going to reassess our situation.\n  That is what we should be doing here, but we cannot reassess the \nsituation because the utilities, with all of their money, are dictating \nwhat is going on here on the Senate floor. That is what this amendment \nis all about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I think it is appropriate that we \nmove on to vote as soon as possible. But I would like to make a couple \nof points that I think are pertinent to the debate that is at hand.\n  First of all, I think we have to recognize the premise that nobody \nwants to take the waste. On the other hand, I think we also have to \nrecognize the reality of those who have the waste. Currently, we have \nin the State of Washington, at Hanford, a significant abundance of \nspent fuel, about 2,133 metric tons over here at Hanford. I have been \nout there. It is right on the edge of the Columbia River. These were \nthe first graphite reactors; and the first generation of nuclear bombs \nthat were used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki were created there.\n  The State of Washington has also, at that Hanford facility, 61 \nmillion gallons of liquid, high-level waste in 177 tanks. That is just \nthe harsh reality. Savannah River, in South Carolina, 206 metric tons \nof high-level spent fuel, 33 million gallons of liquid waste. There is \nmore that comes in every day. It comes from overseas and from our \nresearch reactors. How does it come? It comes through a transportation \nnetwork, 2,400 shipments from 1979 to 1995.\n\n[[Page S2961]]\n\nEvery State has had shipments with the exception of Florida and South \nDakota.\n  So, when we talk about transportation, we have a transportation \nsystem. Why is it not news? Because nothing is happening. It is safe.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield on the issue of transportation?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will be happy to yield to my friend from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Senator from Nevada said you and I portrayed the \ntransportation as safe as transporting a quart of milk home from the \nstore. I think the record ought to be corrected. The transportation \nsystem for nuclear waste is safer than transporting a quart of milk \nhome.\n  Have you ever dropped a quart of milk on the floor of the supermarket \nor on the floor of the kitchen? I have, and I have burst the container. \nYou can drop these containers 50 feet onto a piece of concrete and they \ndo not burst. That is the characteristics of the container.\n  I think, when we also get in our car at the supermarket and drive \nhome, we do not have a police escort in front of us and behind us, \nmaking sure that the road is perfectly clear so someone does not \nsideswipe us at the intersection or hit us as we are leaving.\n  I know what the Senator from Nevada was trying to do. But the reality \nis, the transportation of high-level radioactive materials in this \ncountry is, by far, much safer than transporting a quart of milk home \nfrom the supermarket. There is a lot of milk spilled between the \nsupermarket and the kitchen of the average residence in our country. \nBut to our knowledge not one curie of radioactivity has ever been \nspilled going from a reactor to a storage site, once it was \ncontainerized and in its mode of transportation.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding. That is an important correction. \nWe ought not make light of our arguments here because the facts are \nvery clear when it comes to transporting this critical material.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Let me point out to the Senator from Idaho, this is a \ntypical cask that has been used since 1964 for shipping by truck \ntransport. These are designed according to a very, very technical and \nhighly engineered requirement that would associate itself with whatever \nthe exposure is of a wreck, dropping from a high level. They have \ntested these. They have tested them with a railroad car at 60 to 70 \nmiles an hour, dropping them from various levels. So the technology is \nhere.\n  These are the facts, as we look at this chart of where the waste is \ncurrently, and the position our friends from Nevada have taken, which \nis ``Do not put it in Nevada, leave it where it is.'' To highlight, \nagain, the transportation chart, the one that shows the network, you \njust cannot reflect reality, and that is reality, 2,400 shipments. It \nhas been safe. We have never had an accident that resulted in any \nexposure of any kind. We had a couple of minor trucking accidents, but \nclearly the cask withstood whatever the exposure was.\n  Let me add one more consideration relative to where the significant \nareas of waste are. In addition to Savannah River and Hanford, at Oak \nRidge, TN, we have 1 metric ton of spent fuel in storage and what we \nhave there are some tailings and low-level waste as well.\n  The Senator said it was not my State of Alaska that was affected, and \nthat is true. But I would like the Record to note that we, in Alaska, \nat Amchitka, had the two largest underground nuclear explosions ever \ninitiated and we are still monitoring those areas, relative to any \nwaste that might be depleting into the landmass.\n  So, the point I want to make here is that everybody shares in the \nconcern of what we do with our nuclear waste. That is what this \nlegislation is all about, what we do with the waste.\n  There has been some discussion about what the damages, relative to \nthe inability of the Government to perform on its contract to take the \nwaste in coming years, what that might be. The lawyers are going to \nmake that determination. But let us be realistic and recognize what the \ncourt said. The court ruled the Department of Energy had an obligation \nto take the spent fuel in 1998. And they promptly rejected the DOE's \nattempt to file a motion to dismiss. As a consequence, the Federal \nGovernment is clearly liable.\n  How much are the damages likely to be? Again, that is like giving the \nlawyers a license to go after damages or full employment. The cost of \nthe storage of spent fuel is estimated to be about $20 billion. That is \nthe cost. That is the cost to the Government, when the Government fails \nto perform on its contractual obligation starting next year. The return \nof nuclear waste fees--they have to return what they collected from the \nratepayers, about $8.5 billion. The interest on that for the last \nseveral years, as a consequence to it building up to $13 billion, is \ngoing to be somewhere in the area of $15 billion to $27 billion and the \nconsequential damages associated could amount to an estimated shutdown \nof 25 percent of the nuclear plants due to insufficient storage--\nanother $20 or $24 billion.\n  I do not think there is any point, necessarily, to try to sharpen up \nthe figures on what the damages are. Clearly there are going to be \ndamages as a consequence of the Government's inability to respond to \nits contractual agreement.\n  What I wanted to say, relative to the point of Nevada being the best \nplace for this, showing the Nevada chart again, is we have had 800 \nnuclear weapons tests in this area for approximately 50 years. And the \nproposed location for the interim repository is here as well as, \nhopefully, the permanent repository that we spent approximately $6 \nbillion on. We will probably spend as much as $30 billion to finally \nget it licensed.\n  I have a couple of other comments relative to points that have been \nmade, that I think need to be cleared up. I read a copy of the \neditorial in the Chicago Tribune of April 8. There was a reference to a \npossible association with regard to support for President Clinton, who \nagreed to oppose the legislation if Nevada's Democratic Governor and \ntwo Senators supported his reelection. That is obviously literary \njargon, but, by the same token, I noted in the debate, time and time \nagain, a reference that none of the environmental groups support this \nbill. Of course, I think it is fair to say the President received \nalmost unanimous support from America's environmental groups relative \nto their particular policies.\n  What we have here from the standpoint of the environmental groups is, \nmany of them, their objective is to simply shut down the nuclear \nindustry as we know it today. They do not accept the responsibility for \npicking up on where we would generate the offset of energy as a \nconsequence of shutting down the nuclear industry. They do not give any \ncredence to reducing greenhouse gases as a consequence of the \ncontribution that nuclear energy can bring to lessening or eliminating \nemissions.\n  No consideration is given to the reality that many of the nations \nthat we compete with internationally are going to achieve their \nreductions of particulates and emissions as a consequence of moving \ntoward nuclear power. France is already 98 percent nuclear power. Japan \nis actively moving into the area and they are beginning to reprocess. \nSo I think it is fair to say as we stand still and debate on and on, \nendless discussions about the issue of what we are going to do with our \nwaste, other countries are moving into advanced technology and \nreprocessing the waste.\n  This particular second-degree amendment talks about States rights, \nand we are all sensitive to that aspect.\n  However, the reality of States and the interest of States has to be \naddressed in the consideration of the major chart which shows where the \nwaste is and the reality that we want to move this waste to one site. \nAs a consequence of that, I think it is fair to note we have some \ninconsistencies relative to the statements that have been made by my \ngood friends on the other side.\n  There has been a reference that we all have to do a certain amount of \nsacrifice relative to States storing nuclear waste and nuclear waste \nfuel, and that certainly has been done by the State of Nevada. They \nwere chosen for reasons unknown to me, but nevertheless chosen as the \nideal site for nuclear explosions over those some 50 years. But there \nwas a reference made that suggested that the transportation of nuclear \nfuel was an eminent right of a State to make a determination that it \nwas or was not in the best interest of\n\n[[Page S2962]]\n\nthat State. But that concept defeats the logic of what we are \nattempting to achieve here, and that is to get it out of the States, to \nmove it to one central repository.\n  As far as the history of at least some Members of the Nevada \ndelegation, let me again refer to action that was taken some time ago. \nAgain, I refer to this picture of the Nevada test site, where the last \nunderground explosion occurred in approximately 1991. Underground tests \nare still being performed there with nuclear materials being exploded \nwith conventional explosives.\n  During this time, the Nevada delegation, we assume, has not rejected \nthat continued activity, but it is even more interesting to note that \none of the Senators during his association with public service from \nNevada supported storing nuclear waste at the test site. If you are \ngoing to support it, Madam President, you are going to have to get it \nthere. So, if you support it, the realization of how you are going to \nmove it across this network of States gets to the very crux of where we \nare in the second-degree amendment.\n  Let me read a relative portion of the Nevada Assembly Joint \nResolution No. 15, and this is a chart of the entire resolution dated \nFebruary 26, 1975, and the appropriate portion:\n\n       Whereas, the people of southern Nevada have confidence in \n     the safety record of the Nevada test site and in the ability \n     of the staff of the site to maintain safety in the handling \n     of nuclear materials;\n       Whereas, nuclear waste disposal can be carried out at the \n     Nevada test site with minimal capital investment relative to \n     other locations;\n       Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Assembly of the State \n     of Nevada jointly that the legislature of the State of Nevada \n     strongly urges the Energy Research and Development \n     Administration to choose Nevada test site for the disposal of \n     nuclear waste.\n\n  This resolution passed the Nevada Senate by a 12-to-6 vote, aided by \none of the Senators from Nevada, who is here today, and signed by the \nGovernor of Nevada, Mike O'Callaghan.\n  I do not know what has changed. The Nevada test site out there \ncertainly has not changed. It is the same as it was. It still has a \ntrained work force, and it still has an infrastructure for dealing with \nnuclear materials. The geology of the site certainly has not changed, \nand, obviously, some of the Senators thought it was the best place to \nstore nuclear waste in 1975 or they probably would not have voted for \nit back then.\n  So that is the reality relative to this issue, that nobody wants it, \nthat it is stored in 80 sites in 41 States, and the answer is to move \nit to one safe site. If you do not move it, it is going to sit where it \nis, and that is not acceptable. As a consequence, we are at a time \nwhere it is imperative that we recognize that adoption of the second-\ndegree amendment would simply kill the legislation, kill the bill and \nleave the waste where it is, and I do not think that is in the interest \nof the 50 States.\n  Madam President, I propose to move to table the Reid-Bryan amendment.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Will the chairman just allow a brief response?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Sure.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I appreciate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Madam President, I appreciate that, and I will be brief. I \nwant to respond to the comments about the resolution adopted by the \nNevada Legislature in 1975. I think we have to put things in context. \nIn 1951, we were assured that the detonation of nuclear bombs in the \nair 60 miles from Las Vegas was a very safe thing to do; you can rely \nupon us; you can trust us; we will never do anything. The scientific \ncommunity embraced that, or at least we were told that at the time, and \nNevadans agreed to do that. No scientist in the world would suggest to \nany community that to detonate a nuclear bomb within 60 miles of a \nmetropolitan area is absolutely safe, and, in point of fact, we entered \ninto an atmospheric nuclear test ban in 1963.\n  If Nevadans can be faulted, they can be faulted because they relied \nupon representations of their Government which they believed to be \ntrue. We were all in America less sophisticated about the risk inherent \nin detonating bombs in the air.\n  So, too, it was in 1975. If Nevadans can be faulted, we were less \nsophisticated. But I point out to the chairman and others that the \nworld is dramatically different today than it was in 1975, and we know \na lot more about the risks.\n  Prior to 1979, I am sure that it would have been asserted not a \nchance in the world that any of the reactors in America would ever have \na problem; we have the most preeminent, highly qualified, most \nsophisticated people in the world. Nobody today believes that to be \ncategorically true. Three Mile Island occurred, and our naivete about \nthe risks of nuclear power have been irreparably shattered, and nobody \naccepts those representations today.\n  Before the worldwide devastating impact in Chernobyl, I am sure \neverybody was assured there was no problem with any of these reactors, \nthere was no risk, no danger. My point is that we are all more \nsophisticated today, and Nevadans fully understand the risks that are \ninvolved with storage of nuclear waste, and they have rejected it both \nby the State legislature since that period of time, and Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, in the most recent survey, in numbers in excess of \n70 percent categorically reject that storage.\n  So I think it is somewhat unfair to suggest we be judged by an \nearlier time, less sophisticated, more naive and perhaps, if we can be \nfaulted, more trusting.\n  Let me just say by way of conclusion, this is a highly technical \ndebate. Much of it is arcane, much of it is not easy to understand, and \nfor that reason, I am indebted to the senior Senator from Idaho, \nbecause I think he has framed the issue that all of us can understand.\n  If you believe that the shipment of nuclear waste, 125-ton casks by \nrail, 25-ton casks by truck, containing the equivalent radioactivity of \n200 bombs the size dropped on Hiroshima, is as safe as the \ntransportation of milk from the market to your home or across the \ncountry, let me just say you should vote against the Reid and Bryan \namendment. But if you believe, as I believe most Americans do, that \nwhen you are shipping nuclear waste, 85,000 metric tons, 17,000 \nshipments, for decades to come over thousands and thousands of miles \nthrough 43 States where 51 million Americans live within a mile, then I \nthink you might think that it is a little bit more risky than shipping \nmilk from point A to point B. I believe that the logic of the Reid-\nBryan amendment is inescapable, and I believe that you want to support \nus and to protect the citizens of your State. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 27\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is amendment 27, offered \nby the Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Thurmond].\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to ask for passage of the \nThurmond-Hollings amendment to the pending Nuclear Waste Policy Act \nbill. The pending bill includes a prohibition against storing \ncommercial spent nuclear fuel at the Hanford site in Washington State. \nThis amendment would include an exemption for the Savannah River site \nand an adjoining site in Barnwell County, SC.\n  Mr. President, the purpose of the amendment is to level the playing \nfield among all states, should the Department of Energy have to select \nan alternate interim storage site.\n  There are three sites under the jurisdiction of the Department of \nEnergy which currently have facilities that might be capable of \naccepting spent nuclear fuel. They are the Hanford Nuclear Reservation \nin Washington, the Idaho National Environmental and Engineering \nLaboratory in Idaho, and the Savannah River site in South Carolina. Let \nme note that these facilities are near their capacity and would require \nmany significant upgrades to take on a commercial mission.\n  The pending bill explicitly exempts the Hanford site from being \nselected for interim storage. The State of Idaho has a legally \nenforceable court order prohibiting importation of new wastes into the \nState. This leaves South Carolina as the only other State with \nfacilities capable of accepting spent nuclear fuel.\n  Passage of the amendment is not intended to impact the overall \nsuccess or failure of this legislation. It is only intended to ensure \nthat if the Department finds that the Yucca Mountain facility is not \nsuitable for spent fuel storage, that all States would then be placed \non an equal footing for the siting and construction of a new state-of-\nthe-art storage facility.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I believe both sides are ready to accept the amendment \nby voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 27) was agreed to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 26\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nMurkowski substitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  Yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this month we observe the 52d \nanniversary of the beginning of the end of World War II, and the \nliberation of victims of the Holocaust in Europe. Just 2 years ago, the \n50th anniversary of the war's end, there were many ceremonies, \nmemorials, books, articles, and television programs marking the events \nof 1945. Now, much of the world's attention seems focused on the coming \nmillennium, and the beginning of the 21st century.\n  But we must not allow ourselves to forget those events of the 20th \ncentury that continue to shape our lives. And we must never allow \nhumanity to forget the awful truth of the Holocaust, for if we do, we \nrisk unleashing the horror of that time on the world once again. The \nact of remembrance becomes more difficult with each passing year, for \nthere remain fewer and fewer eyewitnesses to history. Fewer survivors \nof the Holocaust remain. Fewer\n\n[[Page S2964]]\n\nliberators are alive to tell what they saw with their own eyes.\n  And so it falls upon us, the children of the survivors and the \nliberators, the victims and the witnesses, to carry this burden into \nthe new century, to tell our own children all we know about the horrors \nvisited upon the world a little more than five decades ago, and to pray \nthat what is our history remains history.\n  Mr. President, a short while ago, a distinguished American statesman, \nPaul Wolfowitz, said, ``Our goal, as we enter the 21st century, is to \nmake sure that it does not repeat the 20th century,'' which is to say \nthe two world wars, the cold war, and all that occurred within it.\n  Today, I wish to speak briefly about one event in the history of the \nHolocaust and World War II, and that is the liberation of Dachau, the \nanniversary of which falls less than 3 weeks from today. And I will do \nso in the words of the 42d Rainbow Infantry Division's ``History of \nWorld War II,'' written shortly after the war's end:\n\n       That word, Dachau, is one which few men of the Rainbow will \n     ever forget. They had heard of Nazi concentration camps and \n     believed or half-believed the stories of the SS atrocities \n     and brutalities conducted in them. Soon they were to see the \n     most famous of all German horror prisons. The oldest such \n     camp in Germany, its very name was feared. Men and women who \n     entered those massive stone gates as prisoners never came \n     out. Inside them was practiced systematic murder. Men who had \n     seen friends die and witnessed all the horrors or war were to \n     turn pale and sick at what they saw at Dachau . . .\n       As the first American entered the prison the 33,000 inmates \n     went wild with joy and at the same time joined in the battle \n     against the SS, some of whom had changed into prisoners \n     striped uniform in an attempt to escape.\n       The first hysterical group to see the Americans rushed and \n     were pushed into an electrified fence which surrounded the \n     principal enclosure and several of them were killed. As the \n     Americans entered the enclosure they rushed to them and tried \n     to throw their arms around them. . . .\n       The men of the Second Battalion began moving through the \n     camp. Everywhere they saw sights which filled them with \n     horror.\n       Drawn up on sidings outside the camp itself they found 50 \n     boxcars, each one filled with about 30 men who had either \n     starved to death in these cars or had been killed by the \n     machine guns of the guards when they tried to escape. . . .\n       In the camp itself there were bodies everywhere. The \n     majority of the guards had fled the night before the \n     Rainbowmen arrived, but before they left they had roamed \n     through the camp killing important prisoners or persons \n     against whom they bore a grudge. . . . Then the guards \n     decided this method was too slow and they turned their \n     machine guns on the inmates. Before they stopped and fled \n     they had killed more than 2,000 in an orgy of murder. Inmates \n     of the camp had gathered these bodies into piles, stacking \n     them up like cordwood. . . .\n       Toward the end [of the war] . . . the Nazis had run out of \n     coal and had no way to cremate the bodies, but still the \n     business of murder by gas continued and hundreds of others \n     died of starvation. These bodies the Rainbowmen found dumped \n     into open graves or thrown into the moat until they dammed \n     the water. The stench of the camp was nauseating and in the \n     huts in which the inmates lived the odor was overpowering. \n     Beaten, tortured and starved by the guards, some of these \n     people had become little more than animals. . . .\n       Dachau was a nightmare to all the men of the Division who \n     saw it . . . but it was also a lesson. ``Now I know why we \n     are fighting,'' man after man said. ``The Nazis who conceived \n     such a place as that were madmen and those people who \n     operated it were insane. We cannot live in the same world \n     with them. . . .''\n\n  Mr. President, I have had the honor of meeting some of the veterans \nof the Rainbow Division, and they have always carried with them the \nterrible memory of Dachau. And yet, as heroic as their work in fighting \nthe Nazis and liberating the victims of the Holocaust was, to a man \nthey deny any special attention. Like so many men of their generation \nwho did their duty, they simply say, ``we had a job to do, and we did \nit.'' In so doing, they defended not only the security of the United \nStates of America. They demonstrated that to be human was to be capable \nof great acts of courage and goodness, even in the face of unspeakable \ncowardice and evil.\n  Mr. President, I have had the honor of meeting several of the \nveterans of that Rainbow Division, and they have always carried with \nthem terrible memories of Dachau. Yet, as heroic as their work in \nfighting Nazis and liberating the victims of the Holocaust was, to a \nman they denied any special attention. They pushed it aside like so \nmany men in our generation who did their duty. They simply say over and \nover again, ``We had a job to do and we did it.'' In so doing, they \ndefended not only the security of the United States of America; they \ndemonstrated that to be human was to be capable of great acts of \ncourage and goodness, even in the face of unspeakable cowardice and \nevil.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I would like to make special mention of \ntwo people involved in this one story of the Holocaust and the \nliberation of Dachau. One is a constituent, Robert T. Kennedy, of \nWallingford, CT, who at age 32 was drafted into the Army, in part \nbecause of his expertise in radio technology, and despite the fact he \nhad a heart condition. Like so many others of his generation, he \nanswered the call of duty, even though it meant leaving his wife, \nBeatrice, and 6-month-old son, Bobby, at home. Young Bob was nearly 3 \nwhen his dad finally returned from the war. Sergeant Kennedy was a \nmember of the Rainbow Division, and he witnessed the horrors of Dachau. \nAnd he made sure to tell his children all about the concentration camp, \neven at an age when they could barely grasp its meaning. He spoke of \nthe rage he and his fellow soldiers felt for those who made torture and \nmurder a way of life, and he told of how the men of the Rainbow forced \nthe civilian townspeople of Dachau to march up to the nearby camp and \nsee for themselves what most, if not all, of them surely must have \nknown was occurring for so many years. Sergeant Kennedy passed away in \n1976, but the memory of his service lives on in the hearts of his \nfamily.\n  Another person who was there, in that same dark corner of the Earth \nat the same moment in history as Sergeant Kennedy and the men of the \nRainbow Division, was Ella Wieder, an inmate first at Auschwitz, and \nthen at Dachau-Allach, a subcamp of Dachau also liberated at the end of \nApril 1945. Apparently, it was her work as a slave laborer that, \nfortunately, stood in the way of her termination long enough for her to \nsurvive the Holocaust. After the war she returned to her native \nCzechoslovakia, and met Rabbi Samuel Freilich. They married, and soon \nthereafter gave birth to a daughter, Hadassah, who is my wife, and the \nmother of our child, Nana.\n\n  Mr. President, I tell this story with some feeling today particularly \nbecause for the last 17 years Sgt. Robert Kennedy's son, Jim Kennedy, \nhas been my spokesman, my press secretary, my communications director, \nmy muse, and, best of all, my friend.\n  Tomorrow, after these 17 years in the movement of life that is \ninevitable, Jim Kennedy, who for the first time is sitting by my side \non the floor, is leaving the service of the U.S. Government, and, more \nparticularly, work at my own office, to go on to a wonderful \nopportunity in the private sector in New York.\n  I cannot thank him enough, and I appreciate the opportunity to do so \npublicly, not just for the extraordinary eloquence and hard work that \nhe has brought to our work together but to the profound sense of values \ncarrying on the heroism of his father and his family that he has \nbrought to his work with me, to his personal life, to his marriage, and \nto his fatherhood. I cannot thank him enough. I will miss him. But I \nwish him all of God's blessings in the years ahead.\n  I know that, though we will not be working together, our friendship \nwill go on for as long as the Good Lord gives us the opportunity to be \nalive on this Earth.\n  Mr. President, life goes on, despite the efforts of the Nazis and so \nmany others to snuff it out. With this tremendous yearning and quest to \nrealize the rights that our Constitution and Declaration of \nIndependence enshrines to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness \nwe prevail. And with those rights, however, comes the responsibility of \ncaring for the lives of others. That means remembering the past and its \nshameful secrets in a way that secures a more hopeful future. It means \ncarrying forth the lessons of the 20th century into the 21st, and \ntelling the stories of the heroes, like Sgt. Kennedy, and the villains \nof this time in hopes that future generations will never know the \nenormous terror that once ruled in the dismal environs of Dachau not so \nlong ago. And it means being grateful to all those here at the\n\n[[Page S2965]]\n\nSenate, like Jim Kennedy who helped people like me give service to the \npublic, and hopefully in that service make this a freer, better country \nand world.\n  I thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to join 19 of my \ncolleagues as a cosponsor of the tax limitation amendment, a proposed \namendment to the Constitution to require a two-thirds vote of the House \nand Senate to raise taxes.\n  I stand here as an elected representative of the State of Oregon. A \nState that last year added a three-fifths vote of its legislatures as \nan amendment to its State constitution in order to raise taxes.\n  This requirement stipulates that when Government seeks to raise \ntaxes, to increase what it takes out of its citizens pocketbooks, there \nought to be more than a narrow agreement--and, indeed there ought to be \na broad consensus.\n  Oregonians believe that before there is to be an increase in taxes, \nthere has to be a firm belief by a supermajority of its elected \nrepresentatives that this is necessary. That is why we amended the \nState constitution to require just such a supermajority in \n1996. Further, a two-thirds vote requirement fits with the spirit of \nthe Federal Constitution. Supermajority voting requirements are found \nthroughout the Constitution. Some people say to me, ``Well, you don't \nneed a supermajority voting requirement. We rule by majority in this \ncountry.'' But the truth is our Founding Fathers knew there were times \nwhen it had to be otherwise. That is why in articles I, II, V, VII, \nVIII, IX, and XXV there are supermajority voting requirements. These \nare applied to things like motions to consent to a treaty, to override \na Presidential veto, or to vote in the case of a Presidential \ndisability.\n\n  Further, the 16th amendment, which provided for the Federal income \ntax, had to be approved by a vote of two-thirds of Congress and three-\nfourths of the States. It is logical that an amendment to extend this \ntax burden would require a supermajority vote.\n  Our Founding Fathers saw reason to check the simple majorities used \nin deciding issues in a democracy. In the Federalist Papers, Hamilton, \nMadison, and Jay all cautioned that simple majorities can lead to mob \nrule.\n  Indeed, our Founding Fathers were particularly sensitive to \nprotecting our citizens from unjust taxation. Indeed, our break from \nGreat Britain stems from a fight over unjust taxation.\n  Ours is a nation born out of a tax rebellion. And the spirit of that \nrebellion still beats in the heart of Americans.\n  Now some may say we don't need this amendment because the people can \nsimply vote against lawmakers who keep increasing taxes.\n  In the Federalist Papers--Federalist 51--however, James Madison said: \n``A dependence on the people is no doubt the primary control on the \ngovernment; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of \nauxiliary precautions.'' And that's what this proposed amendment is: an \nauxiliary precaution against overtaxation.\n  I believe it is imperative, now that the balanced budget amendment \nhas been defeated, that any action to increase taxes require a \nsupermajority of both Houses. In my opinion, without this two-thirds \nrule, politicians too easily fall back on tax increases in order to \nbalance the budget.\n  Really, there are just three options for balancing the budget: You \ncan cut discretionary spending, cut entitlement spending, or you can \nraise taxes.\n  As for No. 1--there simply isn't enough discretionary funding to cut, \nin order to balance the budget.\n  As for No. 2--entitlement costs are spiraling out of control and each \nyear the Clinton administration shows that it is unwilling even to \neducate the American people as to the hard choices that lie ahead.\n  This leaves No. 3--raising taxes--as the last option. And that option \nis the one I would like to see made more difficult to undertake. Yet at \nthe moment it only takes a simple majority--50 plus 1 in the Senate--to \nraise taxes.\n  Indeed, the 1993 Clinton tax bill, the single largest tax increase in \nthe Nation's history, passed by this slim margin of 50 Senators, plus \nthe Vice President acting as President of the Senate.\n  As I have said, many States have already passed similar legislation \nto make it harder to take more in taxes out of the citizen's \npocketbook. This legislation works on the State level. It is needed at \nthe Federal level. And this fact is unmistakable.\n  In most of those States where a supermajority is required to raise \ntaxes, taxes as a proportion of personal income have declined. In those \nStates without the supermajority, taxes as a proportion of personal \nincome have risen.\n  I think most Americans believe they are already paying too much in \nFederal income taxes. What some call tax day--April 15--is next week.\n  Let me take a moment and put things in perspective for you--how taxes \nhave risen over the last few decades.\n  What we call tax freedom day--the day that the money you earn starts \ngoing into your own pocket and not the Government's, has changed. In \n1950 it was April 3.\n  This year it will be sometime in mid-May.\n  In fact, today the average family pays more in taxes each year than \nit does in food, shelter, clothing and medical care combined.\n  Add up the taxes--local, State, and Federal--for most it takes half \nof what people make. Can't we in Government discharge our legitimate \npublic obligations on such a percentage? I think we can, I think we \nshould, and we must.\n  I want to see our Government balance its budget. But I also want to \nsee this trend of increasing taxation come to an end. I believe that \nthis tax limitation amendment is the surest way to do that.\n  And I urge my colleagues to support the tax limitation amendment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today is the day known as Kick Butts \nDay. It is a day when kids all over the country will express their \nopposition to cigarette addiction and the dangers that it poses to \nhealth. They are resisting tobacco company efforts to target them as \nconsumers and ensnare them in a lifetime of addiction.\n  That is why I want to spend a few minutes today to discuss the \nsubject of the possible legislative settlement of claims against the \ntobacco industry. It has been suggested that perhaps the example set by \nLiggett & Myers, the company that agreed to reveal its innermost \ndocuments to tell the public at large everything that went on in the \nsecret meetings of their company and other companies with whom they \nwere working, has apparently been an inducement for other companies \nthat think perhaps now that the pressure is on the tobacco industry \nmaybe they can affect a settlement. Well, this is no time for that kind \nof thing.\n  On Tuesday of this week, I introduced the Tobacco Disclosure and \nWarning Act, which would require the tobacco companies to disclose the \ningredients and the carcinogens in their products and place larger and \nclearer warning labels on their packs. These new labels would send a \nmore effective message to kids about the dangers of smoking.\n  Yesterday, I spoke in the Chamber about the Joe Camel advertising \ncampaign by R.J. Reynolds. This advertising campaign uses cartoons to \nmarket cigarettes to kids. Senators Durbin, Wellstone, Harkin, Kennedy, \nMurray, and Wyden have joined me in\n\n[[Page S2966]]\n\nsending a letter to the chairman of the FTC asking him to bring an \nunfair advertising case against R.J. Reynolds for the Joe Camel ads.\n\n  In a stunning development several weeks ago, this cloak of deception \nthat shrouded the activities of the tobacco industry was removed when \nthe Liggett group settled 22 State lawsuits because they admitted that \nsmoking causes cancer and other diseases, that nicotine is addictive, \nand that the tobacco industry targets underage smokers. It also agreed \nto a 25-year payment schedule to the States, to release internal \ndocuments providing evidence of the above claims, and to accept FDA \nregulation along with stark new warning labels on its cigarettes. This \nsettlement that was worked out between Liggett and the State attorneys \ngeneral is truly historic. It will open up the floodgates of \ninformation about tobacco. The truth is that smoking is addictive and \nit kills.\n  The documents that will become public as a result of this settlement \nwill help expose the conspiracy of deception and intimidation tobacco \ngiants have engaged in for years. They have used this deception to \nthwart claims against them in court, to derail reasonable attempts at \nregulation, and to curb public education programs to protect the public \nhealth.\n  It is rumored that the tobacco industry, or at least some firms, will \nnow seek protection from Congress, asking for a ``global settlement'' \nof claims against them. I hope that every Senator will maintain a \nhealthy skepticism about any proposed legislative settlement of legal \nclaims against the tobacco companies.\n  The bipartisan group of attorneys general pursuing these lawsuits \nhave shown enormous courage and tenacity in the face of tobacco \nindustry stonewalling. We should not undercut them. Nor should we \nintervene to help the companies in pending litigation brought by \nindividual Americans who suffered harm as a result of the industry's \ndeadly and deceptive practices. We should not hinder the ability of the \nStates and the taxpayers that they represent, or individuals, to \nreceive just and fair compensation for the harm or expense that they \nsuffered.\n  I hope Members of this body will be very analytical as they hear this \nappeal and resist efforts to bail out the tobacco industry in Congress.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as you know, I have come to the floor each \nday this week to talk about what I think is the critical need for the \nSenate to move forward with bipartisan Medicare reform. I believe there \nis a unique window of opportunity now for action, a window built around \nthe proposition that our economy is moving forward in a positive way. \nCertainly, we are a few years away from the demographic earthquake that \nis coming, and I believe it is possible to fashion a bipartisan package \nthat will also achieve real savings to advance the cause of enacting a \nbalanced budget.\n  I come to the floor today to reflect for just a few moments on some \nof the discussion over the last few days as it relates to Medicare and \nthe budget. It is my view that Senator Domenici, the chairman of the \nSenate Budget Committee, said it very well a number of weeks ago when \nthe Budget Committee first began hearings on this year's budget, when \nSenator Domenici said, with respect to Medicare, policy must drive the \nbudget numbers. Unfortunately, that has not been the case in the past, \nand I am concerned, based on the discussions that have gone on in the \nlast couple of days as well, that we are moving away from the need for \nstructural Medicare reform that is in the interests of both seniors and \ntaxpayers.\n  In the last Congress, I think we did see a numbers-driven approach to \nMedicare. Over in the other body, there was a judgment made that \nspending for Medicare had to be reduced $274 billion. Others in my \nparty proposed reducing Medicare spending by a smaller sum. In both \ninstances, I do not think enough attention was paid to the need to come \nup with sensible policies that would really show how you could get to \nthose kinds of budget savings proposed by either party in a way that \nwas good for both seniors and for taxpayers.\n  If we look at the debate over the last couple of days, we see some of \nthe discussion again moving just to the question of a budget number. I \nam convinced that it is possible over the next 5 years to save about \n$100 billion as it relates to the Medicare Program and do it in a way \nthat protects the interests of older people and also will help to \nreduce the deficit.\n  But I think it is even more important--even more important, Mr. \nPresident--that this body understand that the big challenge is to lay \nthe foundation for 21st century Medicare and that that challenge goes \nfar beyond the question that has driven discussions the last couple of \ndays. What we have to do is start bringing choice and competition to \nthe Medicare Program. That is what is driving progress as it relates to \nhealth care reform in the private sector, and, obviously, choice and \ncompetition is what Members of this body enjoy through the Federal \nemployee plan.\n  I think it is possible to do this in a way that protects the rights \nof patients and makes sure that as we look to the future with more \nchoice and more competition, that it is a future that does not involve \nhealth plans with gag clauses, does not strip seniors of their rights \nto appeal a denial of benefits, makes sure that their grievance \nprocedures include what are called ``report cards'' so that our country \ncan find out if people who sign up for health maintenance organizations \ndrop out a few months later because service is unacceptable.\n  The Congress now, as we move to try to develop a budget resolution, I \nthink can find an opportunity to generate real savings.\n  I do not want to, in any way, minimize the importance of that task in \ngetting a budget. But we can do it in a way that will also ensure that \nthe kind of structural changes in Medicare are made and we put this \nprogram on a solid footing. If that is not done, Mr. President, we will \nsee a continuation of the kinds of problems that Chairman Grassley \ndemonstrated this morning at the Senate Committee on Aging.\n  Senator Grassley held a very important hearing as it related to \naccountability in the Medicare Program and particularly as it related \nto managed care. What Senator Grassley's hearing pursued was making \nsure that older people could have access to good information so they \ncould make choices in their Medicare.\n  In this country, we have, unfortunately, because Medicare has not \nbeen modernized, a situation where older people either have no choices, \nwhich goes on in rural parts of the United States, such as the area \nthat the Presiding Officer represents and I represent, or, as we saw \nthis morning in Chairman Grassley's hearing, places like Los Angeles \nwhere there is kind of a blizzard of information offered and it is not \npossible for older people to compare the policies that are offered to \nthem in an intelligible kind of way.\n  I said at Mr. Grassley's hearing that as we go forward with Medicare \ndiscussions let us make sure that his work, which is designed to \nempower consumers and is certainly not going to be a budget buster \nbecause it is largely an effort to try to force disclosure and \ncomparability of these various plans--I urged that Chairman Grassley's \nwork be included in a final bipartisan package.\n  Suffice it to say, you do not hear much discussion in terms of the \nbudget\n\n[[Page S2967]]\n\ndiscussions about the work that Chairman Grassley is doing or about the \nrole of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. And, unfortunately, \nthere has not been enough focus on how the Medicare Program rewards \nwaste and penalizes frugality. The private sector consigned that kind \nof approach to the attic years ago but that is how Medicare does \nbusiness today.\n  Mr. President, and colleagues, I think that as these discussions go \nforward--and certainly yesterday they dominated the debate about the \nbudget--we have to remember that it is critical that Medicare be part \nof an effort to help address the financial challenges that our \nGovernment faces. I think that that can be done in a way that is good \nfor seniors and good for taxpayers, but that it is even more important \nthat the bipartisan changes in Medicare focus on the structural and \nunderlying concerns that are plaguing this program.\n  In much of the United States, the Medicare Program is a bureaucratic \nTin Lizzie. It is clunky. It is inefficient. It is volume driven. And \nit is doing all the kinds of things that if another agency, such as the \nPentagon, was doing, there would be a vast outcry.\n  But we are not making the changes that the Medicare Program needs so \nas to make it secure for the 21st century, so as to make it secure for \nboth seniors and for taxpayers. And that is why I come to the floor \ntoday, to say that this debate that we have seen in the last couple of \ndays about budget numbers is important, but it is even more important \nto talk about the underlying and structural changes that the program \nneeds for the 21st century.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that I think that this \ndebate about Medicare has been a bit like a high school sock hop where \nin effect everyone looks at the dance floor and no one really wants to \ngo first. And I believe that now, if we put a focus on bipartisan \nstructural changes in Medicare, a focus that says that the old debate \nabout just trying to find a budget number for purposes of the budget \nresolution is not the way to proceed, but that we have a bigger \nchallenge which is to get this program on track for the 21st century, \nthat that kind of approach will allow us to make real progress.\n  I have enormous admiration for Chairman Domenici who has made it very \nclear that he wants to proceed in a way that does help to reform \nMedicare policy for the 21st century. I think it is very clear that the \nClinton administration has in some of their Medicare proposals reforms \nthat would also help to advance a bipartisan compromise.\n  I tried to take, in my legislation, the Medicare Modernization and \nPatient Protection Act, some of the key principles that both political \nparties had advanced in recent years. I believe that if the Congress \ndoes not get stuck in the old debate about just finding a budget \nnumber, regardless of the implications for the program long term, we \ncan, in this session of Congress, get the Medicare Program ready for \nthe 21st century.\n  That is what I am committed to doing, Mr. President. It is a \nbipartisan challenge. And I intend to come to this floor on an ongoing \nbasis, as I have done today, to talk about the key issues with respect \nto Medicare reform. And the events of the last couple of days, which \ntake us back, in my view, to just a budget question rather than making \nsure the policy changes are made, are exactly what we have to tackle. \nThere is the opportunity now to get Medicare on the right course for \nthe 21st century.\n  As I have said, Mr. President, I have visited the floor each day this \nweek to talk about Medicare reform, and the brief window of opportunity \nI believe this Congress may have to effect strong, stabilizing, and \nsensible structural reforms in this program.\n  This should be about more than saving a targeted number of dollars in \nspending over the next 5 years, or adjusting the Medicare part B up or \ndown to accommodate short term fiscal goals.\n  To quote my friend Senator Domenici, the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, this should not be about numbers driving policy, not for \nsomething as important as the long-term integrity of the Medicare \nProgram.\n  We have the opportunity in the 105th Congress to begin turning this \n30-year-old, Tin-Lizzie style program into a 21st century, \ncomprehensive seniors health system, employing the tools and the \ninnovations that have already marked much of the rest of American \nhealth care for the better.\n  The reformed Medicare Program I envision, and which I believe is \nwithin our grasp, is a health plan that is about choice, quality, and \naccess, and also about the efficiencies that characterize much of our \nNation's private health care marketplace.\n  Over the last few days, the conversation about Medicare reform has \nfor the most part revolved around the negotiations between the White \nHouse and the congressional budget committees, and whether we can get \nclose enough on a 5-year savings figure in order to proceed with \nmarking up what we all hope will be a bipartisan budget resolution for \n1998.\n  I hope we can.\n  And I commend all the parties involved in trying to hammer this out. \nI know it is tough. It is obvious from my limited involvement in this \nprocess that the determination of the Medicare piece may be the single \nmost important function of putting together a Federal budget, or \nfailing in that effort, this year.\n  But I would go beyond that.\n  I believe that my colleagues and I will be spending years together \ntalking about Medicare as the major piece of the Federal budget \nprocess. I say this because Medicare threatens to be the monster that \ndevours the budget, and with it the prospect of a health and secure \nfuture for millions of future retirees.\n  And quite obviously, the longer we wait to put the brakes to the run \naway spending aspects of this program, the greater the political crunch \nwe face in terms of dealing with the economic impact of the 75 million \nbaby boomers--this demographic tsunami--that is set to begin hitting \nthe program in the year 2013.\n  During the next 30 years, we will see a society shift from the \ncurrent four taxpaying wage-earners supporting each retiree to just two \nworkers for each retiree.\n  You do the math. The prospect is far from pretty.\n  And that picture doesn't get better by merely formulating a number \nfor spending reductions over the next 5 years. We can and must do \nbetter.\n  If we focus merely on the short-term problems--and I agree that they \nare substantial--we risk losing the chance to change Medicare's \nessential structure to deal with the long-term, and much tougher \nproblems to come.\n  And that is why I must say that I am disappointed in certain aspects \nof the President's budget--I think this Congress can do better.\n  Specifically, we are given in the President's Medicare reform ideas a \nmethod of adjusting rates in our payments to Medicare managed care \nplans which will No. 1, not focus a significant and targeted reduction \nin the rates of payment that we make to vastly over-paid plans in many \nof our large metropolitan areas, and No. 2, continues the ``starve-'em, \nand kill-'em'' approach to paying for coordinated plans--and for \nencouraging choice, in rural areas around the country, and in areas of \nhigh health care efficiency like my home State of Oregon.\n  I've said it before, earlier this week.\n  I will say it again.\n  This is not the way to bring 21st century medicine to our Nation's 38 \nmillion Medicare eligible citizens.\n  It is not the way to begin the long-term restructuring of the \nMedicare necessary to establishing a humane, cost-efficient and choice-\nrich program that will maintain financial equilibrium well into the \nnext century, and not for just the next half dozen years.\n  Mr. President, we must look to what is happening in the private \nhealth insurance market in this Nation in order to chart the new course \nfor Medicare. Over the last decade, run away cost-growth in that market \nhas been reduced to rises in per capita spending that are now just \nabout steady with the increase in the consumer price index--a massive, \nmassive change.\n\n  No employer, now, will tell you that health care is cheap. But \ncertainly, far fewer employers are now saying that the cost of health \ncare provided to employees is putting them out of business.\n\n[[Page S2968]]\n\n  Our business is the Federal budget.\n  We have a fiduciary responsibility to keep the Government solvent.\n  I ran my election campaign on the promise that I would work my \nhardest--and bear my share of the heavy lifting--to balance the budget \nand end deficit spending.\n  And I know that all of us, every one of us, Democrat and Republican, \nrealizes that balance can't be bought cheaply or painlessly.\n  Addressing Medicare's long-term financial problems in ways that \nmaintain the program's long-standing commitment to a defined package of \nbenefits, no matter how sick or poor the senior, must be at the top of \nour Federal budget agenda.\n  Mr. President, today I want to conclude my floor statements this week \nwith a short list of basic principles which I believe must under-line \nMedicare's restructuring effort this year, and which I am convinced a \nbroad, bipartisan consensus may be reached.\n  I am not arguing that this is the entire reform menu.\n  And many will note that there's a lot of spinach on the bill of fare \nbefore you get to the desert portions.\n  But I do believe that this is a square-meal reform agenda:\n  First, I believe that we have to agree in a bipartisan fashion that \nMedicare remains a defined benefits program, first, last, and always.\n  We should never turn Medicare into an exercise where elderly and \nfrail beneficiaries, most often single women living on their own on \nlimited fixed incomes, are given a check once a month and told, \n``here's your benefit, your voucher--go out and buy health care you \nneed and if the benefit runs out I hope you can find help, elsewhere.''\n  This would be an egregious retreat from a basic social contract with \nour Nation's senior citizens, and one for which I think there is little \njustification given the kinds of savings we can extract from the \nprogram by requiring better management, better plans and more choice.\n  Second, we must develop spending controls that guarantee access, but \nat the lowest possible cost to the program and the beneficiaries. \nMedicare must employ prospective payment systems, putting providers on \na daily reimbursement diet, for skilled nursing facilities and for home \ncare, and for other portions of fee-for-service Medicare as \nopportunities present themselves.\n  I have introduced a bill that would in part save approximately $20 \nbillion over 5 years from these kinds of management systems in home \ncare and skilled nursing facilities. Similar gatekeeping ought to be \nconsidered for other portions of Medicare that are now driven totally \nby volume.\n  Third, the current system of paying for Medicare managed care plans, \nbased primarily on the local cost of fee-for-service Medicine, makes no \nsense, and we've got to fix it.\n  We have the strange situation where the highest-cost, volume-driven \nportion of the program determining how we pay, or reimburse, the part \nof the program designed to operate as a managed, cost-efficient model.\n  Our purpose is defeated by trying to marry two completely \nantagonistic systems. And there are very unwholesome results in the \nform of beneficiaries in vast numbers of counties where Medicare \nmanaged care payments are either dramatically too low, or horrendously \ntoo high.\n  In California alone, the U.S. General Accounting Office has estimated \nthat this leads to over-payments to plans as high as $1 billion per \nyear.\n  We have to de-couple the cost of fee-for-service medicine from the \nformula we use to determine payments to Medicare managed care plans.\n  Fourth, in a world where we hope that Medicare beneficiaries will \nhave many more choices for health care, Medicare must work much harder \nto empower those consumers to make appropriate choices.\n  And this is about better information about the plans available to \nthem, and tools by which consumers can make informed choices about \nwhich plan is best for them.\n  Mr. President, today I spent some time at a Senate Select Committee \non Aging hearing that focused on this very issue. We heard testimony on \nthe horrendous difficulty beneficiaries had in places where choice \ncurrently exists, trying to figure out what each available plan might \nprovide. The plan brochures are confusing and filled with \ntechnicaleeze. And most importantly, it's obvious that there's no way \nmost consumers are going to be able to sit down at a kitchen table and \ncompare one plan against another.\n  That's got to change. We need a system for Medicare beneficiaries not \nunlike the system we have in the Federal Employees Health Benefits \nProgram where plans are required to present themselves using conforming \nlanguage so that comparisons can be drawn.\n  And we need qualitative analysis by HCFA regarding how well \nindividual plans perform--report card grades, if you will, on items \nranging from disenrollment, to how long doctors stay with plans, to how \nmany grievances are filed by beneficiaries.\n  Fifth, beneficiaries must be reassured that improving consumer \nprotection is still a front-burner issue.\n  Appeals processes on denial of services must be streamlined. Medicare \nsupplemental insurance laws must be reformed to guarantee issue of \nMedigap policies to seniors.\n  HCFA should employ more ombudsmen to help seniors navigate through a \nMedicare system that will offer more choices, and necessarily will be \nsomewhat more complicated than traditional Medicare.\n  Five points--a modest agenda. But one that can begin creating huge \ndividends for our most important social program if we begin our work, \nnow.\n  There is, I know, a great deal of attraction in subcontracting the \njob of reforming Medicare to a bipartisan commission. I have a great \ndeal of respect for my colleagues who have made this argument.\n  Indeed, the conventional wisdom is that Congress simply does not have \nthe political will to tackle this tough question.\n  I have had a number of conversations with colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle, however, and surprising as it may seem there appears to be a \nhunger to attempt Medicare reform, now. I think there's a general \nrecognition that we enjoy a window of opportunity that is characterized \nby rapidly falling budget deficits, strong employment and a growing \neconomy, and that the general environment for fixing Medicare may not \nget much better for an awfully long time.\n  And finally, let me remind colleagues that the ideas offered here \ntoday are not radical, and are really not out of left field.\n  This model of a competitive, choice-rich Medicare that is efficient \nwhile maintaining quality has been road-tested--indeed it exists \ntoday--in Oregon, where low-cost, high-quality, coordinated care \nMedicare now embraces almost 60 percent of the Portland metropolitan \narea market, and where the highest reimbursement rates for such care \nare still almost 20 percent below the national average.\n  We have seen the future.\n  It works.\n  It is time for this Congress to begin implementing changes in \nMedicare that transforms the national program along the lines of what \nhas worked for thousands of seniors in Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/10/senate-section/article/S2966-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2968-S2969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CHEMICAL WEAPONS\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, this morning, millions of Americans \nawoke to some startling revelations, news that was particularly painful \nto thousands of veterans of the Persian Gulf war. Yesterday the Central \nIntelligence Agency released a report that stated that as early as 1984 \nit had intelligence reports warning that chemical weapons held by the \nmilitary of Iraq were stored at a previously undisclosed chemical \nweapons site.\n  Indeed, in 1986, the CIA had received even more specific reports and \nobtained a copy of an Iraqi chemical weapons production plan that \nmentioned large storage facilities and the exact location and even the \ntypes of chemicals and other weapons that were being stored at that \nlocation.\n  Despite each of these reports and the existence of this detailed \ninformation in the very files of the Central Intelligence Agency, the \nPentagon was not informed at any level on any basis of any of this \ninformation when the ground war commenced in the Persian Gulf in \nJanuary 1991.\n  Without this information, tragically, American ground forces entered \nthe specific chemical weapons storage facility named within Central \nIntelligence Agency files in March 1991.\n\n[[Page S2969]]\n\n Fully 20,000 American soldiers were in the vicinity and potentially \nwere exposed to the residue of those chemicals when this facility was \ndestroyed.\n  Two days later, after the destruction of the facility, potentially \nafter 20,000 American soldiers were exposed to these chemical weapons, \nthe Central Intelligence Agency informed the Pentagon of this \ninformation and a possible exposure.\n  Mr. President, yesterday Dr. Robert Walpole, a CIA agency official \ninvestigating this incident on behalf of the Central Intelligence \nAgency, issued an apology to the Nation's veterans. It is not good \nenough. This Nation for several years has been agonizing about the \ncause of unknown illnesses among our soldiers. During all of that \nstudy, during all the long nights of wonder and doubt and pain, this \ninformation was not supplied to the President, the Congress, the \ncommission studying this information or, most importantly, those \nveterans whose lives may have been permanently changed and damaged. And \nnow we are given an apology.\n  Mr. President, this is more than a failure in a single instant. It is \nanother example of the fact that the American people and this \nGovernment are not being adequately served by the American intelligence \ncommunity.\n  Dr. Walpole stated the reasons, in his judgment, for this failure. He \nsaid, first, that there was tunnel vision in the American intelligence \ncommunity; second, that there had been an incomplete search of the \nfiles; and, third and perhaps most chilling to all of us who share \nthese concerns about the role of the American intelligence community in \nworking with our military and civilian personnel, he said there was a \nreluctance by some CIA officials to share some of its most sensitive \ninformation with Government officials.\n  It appeared that some CIA officials knowingly and consciously weighed \nthe sources of their information with the potential of sharing that \ninformation with the U.S. military and made the wrong judgment, making \nvictims, potentially, out of our own soldiers.\n  Mr. President, this is not an isolated failure of intelligence \npolicy. It is indicative of a continuing plague of bad judgment, and it \nis an indication of a need for large-scale institutional reform of how \nthe intelligence community conducts its business, makes its judgments, \nand shares its information with elected officials and the U.S. \nmilitary.\n  We are experiencing again not only a failure of leadership, but an \ninability to share at the proper time in the proper manner with the \nleadership of this Government sensitive intelligence information.\n  The intelligence community was created in this country to ensure that \nelected officials had the best information to make the right security \njudgments for this country, so that the U.S. military would have the \nbest possible information to both prevail in conflicts and minimize \ncasualties. Neither can be accomplished if officials of the \nintelligence community do not feel a responsibility, indeed, are not \ndriven by the need to share the best information with the leadership of \nthe U.S. Government.\n  An apology has been issued to the Armed Forces of the United States \nand those who may have suffered as a result of this incident. It is not \nonly inadequate, it is a disservice to every man and woman who wears \nthe uniform of this country. The President of the United States and \nthis Congress must respond to this latest incident by beginning \ninstitutional reform in the organization, the leadership and, indeed, \nthe mission of the Central Intelligence Agency.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and thank you for your indulgence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/10/senate-section/article/S2968-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2969-S2970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  MISSISSIPPI'S ENVIRONMENTAL SCORE CARD: ``LOUISIANA QUILLWORT 1 AND \n                          TIMBER INDUSTRY 1''\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, finding a new species of plant in America \nbrings mixed reactions. From scientists, it brings the excitement of \nbiodiversity and more opportunities for scientific investigation. But \nfor many Americans, an endangered plant listing often places strict \ncontrols on the use and resources of the land where the plant is found. \nWhen an endangered plant is found in a national forest, it can curtail \nthe multiple use mission of the U.S. Forest Service. Its mere \noccurrence can stop the timber harvesting, which is so important to the \nrejuvenation of the entire forest habitat. And when trees are not cut, \nthere are dramatic economic consequences for the community that lives \nnear the forest and depends on it for jobs.\n  You can be sure that enthusiasm was not over flowing when Mr. Steve \nLeonard, Camp Shelby's Heritage Inventory Botanist, announced that the \nLouisiana quillwort was found in the DeSoto ranger district in Perry \nCounty, MI on May 24, 1996.\n  Mr. President, let me tell you about Perry County. Perry County has \nonly three towns and roughly 11,000 citizens. Perry County contains \n410,000 acres, 162,000 of which--over 39 percent--are national forest \nlands. The employment opportunities are limited primarily to the timber \nindustry. The harvesting and marketing of forest products in the county \nhas created over 1,800 jobs, of which 330 are involved in timber sales \nin the national forest. Currently, the unemployment rate is 7 percent. \nThis year, Perry County's payment from the U.S. Forest Service for \ntimber sales was cut by $1.5 million. This money would have been used \nby Perry County's schools to offset the loss of tax revenue received \nbecause of the large land ownership by the Federal Government.\n  Now along comes the quillwort. This county is already absorbing the \neconomic impacts of repeated and failed government attempts to \nestablish habitats for the endangered red cockaded woodpeckers in the \nDeSoto National Forest. And let's not forget the restrictions for those \ngopher tortoise.\n  The residents of Perry County love the environment and many make \ntheir living from the environment, but the ever growing restriction on \nland use challenges their commitment.\n  The Louisiana quillwort is a very small grass-like plant with just a \nfew strands--smaller than this ballpoint pen--whose scientific name is \nIsoetes Louisianensis. It was first discovered 5 years ago on private \nproperty in just two parishes of Louisiana. It was promptly listed as \nendangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, but since then, there \nhas been no monitoring of its population. To this day, there still \nremains huge scientific factual gaps on the known and potential threats \nto this plant.\n  There is one thing I know for sure. There is a lot of this quillwort \ngrowing on the edges of stream beds in Mississippi's DeSoto National \nForest. It may be scarce in Louisiana, but Mississippi clearly has more \nthan our fair share. This is not unlike many other aspects of the ever-\ncontinuing rivalry with our neighboring State. I say this with great \nrespect for my friend and colleague Senator John Breaux, but maybe the \nname of this species should be changed.\n  Mr. President, today I am here to honor the dedicated efforts of the \nU.S. Forest Service employees who walked over 200 miles of stream beds \nthis past winter in order to locate quillwort populations and to ensure \nthere would be no disruptions of timber sales. This was no easy task. \nThe heavy winter rains left boot-sucking mud everywhere.\n  Mr. President, at the end of my remarks I would like to submit for \nthe record the names of all 48 U.S. Forest Service personnel involved \nin this effort. I want to recognize them and to thank them. And I know \nthe citizens of Perry County want to thank them.\n  This was more than an effort by the U.S. Forest Service. It is the \nstory of the individual leadership and excellence of Mr. Don Neal and \nMs. Kim Kennedy, two very able U.S. Forest Service employees. They did \nan outstanding job of determining the environmental consequences \nand developing a plan of action. Thanks to their efforts, the plan \nminimized economic impact without compromising the required protection \nnecessary for the quillwort's habitat.\n\n  This is also the story of two Federal agencies--each with partially \nconflicting missions. It took 4 years following the quillwort's initial \ndiscovery for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to approve a recovery \nplan. Fortunately, it took the U.S. Forest Service only 2 months to \nissue implementing directives. This swift action occurred under the \nwatchful eye of Mr. Robert Joslin,\n\n[[Page S2970]]\n\nthe regional forester in Atlanta. He is to be commended not only for \nhis actions when faced with the quillwort, but for his many years of \ndedicated leadership for balanced forest management throughout the \nSoutheast. The forests have thrived. Thank you, Bob.\n  The quillwort protection plan established a 165 foot buffer zone on \neither side of a streambed. Limiting timber harvesting within this zone \nmaintained a heavy overhead canopy and filtered the light reaching the \nstream's surface. The cutting restriction also curtailed sedimentation \nand changes to drainage patterns. The quillwort seems to like small \nintermittent streams.\n  This protection plan created a real challenge for Don and Kim \nbecause, at that time, there were 25 active timber sales in 51 \ncompartments of the DeSoto ranger district. Four even had loggers on \nsite.\n  Due to the lack of factual knowledge about the quillwort's habitat--\nespecially since it was now newly discovered in Mississippi--\ndetermining which drainage to survey proved difficult. The U.S. Forest \nService stepped up to the plate and made the decision to survey all \ndrainage within or immediately adjacent to cutting units. And, to err \non the side of caution, the survey was 20 percent wider than the 165 \nfoot buffer suggested in the recovery plan.\n  The DeSoto district established an incident command system team to \norganize and survey 137 miles of streams on all active timber sales and \n88 miles of streams in sales planned for next fiscal year. Timber sales \nwere prioritized for survey in the following order: those with loggers \non site; sales with open payment units; sales which had not been \nopened; and finally next year's planned sales.\n  It took 34 days of slow slogging up and down streambeds--both sides.\n  More quillwort was found. Louisiana quillwort was found on four \nactive timber sales, three of which required modification before being \nreleased for cutting. It was also found on seven sales planned for next \nyear, two of which were modified before the sales were finalized. The \nrest of the Louisiana quillwort was located in existing set aside \nbuffer zones.\n  Throughout the survey process, Ms. Kennedy maintained constant \ncontact with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service offices in Jackson and \nVicksburg. Her persistence ensured that the appropriate NEPA documents \nwere amended and the timber sales were modified. Without this level of \nattention, the sales could easily have experienced bureaucratic \ndisruptions.\n  Mr. President, this is clearly an environmental success story for \nall. An endangered plant was found. The habitat around identified \npopulations was protected. Trees were still cut.\n  I believe a mutually successful coexistence occurred. The quillwort \nwon. Perry County won. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service won. The U.S. \nForest Service won. I applaud the U.S. Forest Service for protecting \nthe quillwort's habitat with a flexible rapid response. They did not \ntake the easy route and stop all contracts.\n  I'd also like to note that this process has allowed the Forest \nService to significantly expand the scientific knowledge about this \nquillwort species. With all these new and frequently large finds, it \nmakes me wonder just how endangered this plant really is? I hope the \nagency charged with monitoring the livelihood of the quillwort will not \nignore this information.\n  Mr. President, there is another question that cannot be overlooked \nwhen talking about the DeSoto National Forest. Why has the annual \nforest regeneration program dwindled down to less than 1 percent of the \ntotal acreage while over 33 percent of the forest has pine trees well \nbeyond rotation age? And why is only 35 percent of the annual growth \nbeing harvested? This only causes these pine forests to get older.\n  Mississippi's largest cash crop is timber. Every Mississippian has \nbeen behind a log truck on its way to a mill at some point, and every \nMississippian knows a little about silviculture. We know that pine \nforests should be rotated and harvested to maintain their health. We \nalso recognize that old trees are vulnerable to the pine beatle which \njeopardizes healthy sections of the forest. Good silviculture prevents \na pine forest from getting too old. Good silviculture encourages \nselective tree harvesting. Good silviculture creates healthy forests. \nGood silviculture creates an economically thriving community in all \nsectors.\n\n  I want to challenge the U.S. Forest Service to give me a credible \nresponse to this question: Why are we only harvesting a small \npercentage of the annual growth? I do not want my inquiry to be \ndismissed with the weak excuse that we just did not have enough people \nto prepare a sale. The quillwort drew 48 Forest Service employees. How \nmany Forest Service employees worked on timber sales during this \ntimeframe? Recent claims that budget reductions have curtailed the \ntimber sale program only go so far. In Mississippi, mature pine trees \nare ready to be cut. And the school district, county government, and \ntimber farmers of Perry County who depend on these revenues are \nanxiously awaiting that day. The citizens of Perry County deserve no \nless. I urge a full, honest, and equal commitment to all of the U.S. \nForest Service's missions.\n  It is a sad fact that the U.S. Forest Service does not even live up \nto its existing and approved forest management plans nationwide. It \nrepeatedly disregards programmed sales, making it impossible for \ncounties like Perry County to plan its school budgets. I view forest \nplans as a contract between the Forest Service and each county. I do \nnot expect these contracts to be broken. When these contacts are \nbroken, the schoolchildren are the big losers.\n  I would like to personally invite the new head of the U.S. Forest \nService to visit Mississippi's national forests to discuss his plans to \nhonor his agency's commitments to Perry County and Mississippi.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I want to reiterate my appreciation for \nthe extraordinary efforts of the regional forester in Atlanta and the \ndistrict ranger and his employees in the Desoto district. They reflect \ngreat credit upon the proud tradition of the U.S. Forest Service. A \nproper balance was struck --a plant was protected and the interests of \nthe citizens it affected were equally protected. This proves a mutually \nbeneficial coexistence can occur.\n  Mr. President, I request unanimous consent to list the names of the \n48 DeSoto National Forest employees who walked the streambeds in search \nof quillworts.

Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports \nthat for the week ending April 4, the United States imported 8,330,000 \nbarrels of oil each day, 1,534,000 barrels more than the 6,796,000 \nimported during the same week a year ago.\n  Americans relied on foreign oil for 56.5 percent of their needs last \nweek, and there are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before \nthe Persian Gulf war, the United States obtained approximately 45 \npercent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil \nembargo in the 1970's, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of \nAmerica's oil supply.\n  Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil--by \nU.S. producers using American workers? Politicians had better ponder \nthe economic calamity sure to occur in America if and when foreign \nproducers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of \nimported oil flowing into the United States--now 8,330,000 barrels a \nday.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor at this time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, in the course of resolving the status \nof Senate bill 104 and recognizing that we have just concluded a vote \nand the vote was 72 to 24, and it was a tabling motion which would \nhave, had it passed, invited every State Governor to prohibit the \ntransfer and transportation of nuclear waste through those States, I \nwill discuss a few States at random, Mr. President. I hope the Members \nin their offices will reflect on these charts because there are just a \nfew States where the problem exists today. The point of this \nexamination is to simply state that the alternative is to leave the \nwaste in these States or provide an alternative.\n  Now, again, I want to refer to the major chart which shows where the \nwaste lay currently. There are 80 sites in 41 States. The commercial \nreactors, shut down reactors, spent fuel on site, commercial spent \nfuel, nuclear storage facilities, it is non-DOE reactors, it is Navy \nreactor fuel, it is Department of Energy--all in spent nuclear fuel and \nhigh-level radioactive waste. That is where it is, Mr. President.\n  The question is, Do we want to leave it there or do we want to move \nit? Now, the next chart again will attempt to show our experience in \nmoving waste through the country because we have done it for an \nextended period of time. We have had 2,400 movements all over the \ncountry. As soon as the chart comes, it will show that it has moved \nthrough all States with the exception of South Dakota and Florida.\n  Now, again the choice that we have relative to an alternative is \nleave it where it is. We have here the chart which shows the \ntransportation routes of the waste moving across the United States, and \nit has not been a big deal. The reason is because there have not been \nany incidents. It has moved safely. It has been moving in containers \nsubject to State and Federal law from 1979 to 1995. So to suggest that \nit cannot be moved safely or to suggest that we are suddenly thrust \nupon some kind of a crisis because we are about to move the waste to a \ntemporary repository in Nevada--facts dictate otherwise. It is moved by \nrail, indicated by the red, it is moved by highway, as indicated by the \nblue network. Every State but Florida and South Dakota have escaped. \nThat is the reality.\n  As we look at the argument here, to a large degree, the \ntransportation argument has little validity. This would be the same \ntype of waste that we would be moving from our reactors. Where do we \npropose to move it? From all the sites I showed on the previous chart, \nto one site out in the Nevada test site used for over 50 years for more \nthan 800 nuclear weapons tests. I have yet to have anybody come to the \nfloor and suggest there is a better place.\n  I recognize the reality that nobody wants it but we will look how \nthis dilemma affects a few States. Take Connecticut, for example--and \nit is significant in Connecticut because nuclear energy makes up 70 \npercent of the energy that is produced in Connecticut--those ratepayers \nhave paid $521 million over the last 12 years, or thereabouts, into a \nfund which the Federal Government has taken and put into a general fund \nfor the specific purpose of taking Connecticut's waste. That was a \ncontractual commitment. It is due next year. Connecticut should, under \na contractual agreement, be relieved of its waste. The ratepayers have \npaid, as I said, $521 million. In Connecticut, there are four units, \nthe Connecticut Yankee and the Millstone 1, 2 and 3. Those reactors \nhave stored 1,505 metric tons of waste. It is stored in Connecticut. If \nthis bill does not pass, it will stay in Connecticut. A portion of it \nis Department of Energy defense waste.\n  Now, the significant thing here, Mr. President, is that Millstone 1 \nwould be full by 1998. Now what does that mean? It means their storage, \nthe pools adjacent to the reactors, will be full. What will they do? \nEither build more storage and get new permits, because the Federal \nGovernment is not going to be able to take it, or the other alternative \nis to shut down the reactor. Millstone 2 and 3 will be filled up by the \nyear 2000. What will they do then? Shut down the reactor? Haddam Neck \nwill be filled up in the year 2001. These are factual circumstances \nsurrounding the state of the industry in Connecticut.\n  Now, if I was representing Connecticut, I would want to get the waste \nout of there, because two things will happen. One is if this bill \npasses, the waste will get out. If it does not, the waste is not going \nto get out, and when these reactors shut down because storage is at \ncapacity the waste is still going to be there. It will be sitting there \nuntil somebody does something with it. And to do something with it, you \nhave to move it. Otherwise, it will stay there.\n  Again, we have a location. I am sure my friend is getting tired of me \nshowing the desert of Nevada where for 50 years we have had testing.\n  Now, looking to another State, moving south a little bit, the State \nof Georgia. Now, Georgia is dependent 30 percent on nuclear power. The \nresidents of Georgia paid $304 million into the waste fund. They paid \nthat basically to the Government to take the waste. The Government \ncannot do it. We have four units, Hatch 1 and 2 and Vogtle 1 and 2. The \nwaste stored in Georgia is 1,182 metric tons at the Savannah River \nsite. The waste stored is 206 metric tons over on the South Carolina-\nGeorgia border. Hatch 1 and 2 reactors will be filled by 1999, and \nVogtle 1 and 2 will be filled by the year 2008. Again, we have a case \nwhere State ratepayers have paid it, and what have they gotten from the \nFederal Government? Nothing, other than a chance to continue to store \ntheir waste. How long? It is indefinite if this bill does not pass, \nbecause nobody can agree on where to put it. The alternative is to \nleave it where it is, and it will stay there after the reactors have \nshut down because we do not have anyplace to put it.\n\n  Moving on, Mr. President, to Illinois. This is even a bigger set of \nrealities. The State of Illinois is 54 percent dependent on nuclear \npower. You say ``dependent''--what does that mean? It means 54 percent \nof the energy comes from nuclear power. There are alternatives, sure, \ncoal-fired, oil-fired plants. They all cost money, all take permitting \ntime. Illinois has paid into the waste fund, the residents have paid \n$1.36 billion, paid to the Federal Government to take the waste next \nyear. The Federal Government will not do it, and they have 13 units in \nIllinois: Braidwood 1 and 2, Byron 1 and 2, Clinton, Dresden 2 and 3, \nLaSalle 1 and 2, Quad Cities 1 and 2, and Zion 1 and 2. They have 5,215 \nmetric tons of waste in Illinois. A DOE research reactor is fueled \nthere, with an additional 40 metric tons. A State that is 54 percent \ndependent.\n  Looking at their reactors when they have to shut down, because the \nstorage pools are filled: Dresden 3, the year 2000. Dresden 2, the year \n2002. Clinton,\n\n[[Page S2972]]\n\nthe year 2003. Quad Cities 1 and 2, the year 2006. Zion 1 and 2, 2006. \nLaSalle, 1 and 2, 2013. Byron 1 and 2, 2015. Braidwood 1 and 2, 2019. \nThat is a reality. What will Illinois do? Perhaps they will try and buy \nenergy from other States, but that will deplete, if you will, the \navailability of supply. This is a crisis.\n  This is the reality, that somebody else before this body had another \nplan to relieve, if you will, these States of the storage that is \nlicensed. They cannot just store beyond their capacity. They store to \ntheir designing capacity. They are prepared to do that but they exceed \nthat capacity in those years. And their ability to increase, that is \ngoing to be very, very difficult because for one thing the \nenvironmental community is opposed to any nuclear power generation and \nis going to object. They do not give any credit for the contribution \nthat nuclear energy brings to air quality, including lessening \nemissions and reducing the greenhouse effect. It is one thing to \ncriticize, but the environmental community has an obligation to come up \nwith alternative and, their alternative is ``no nuclear.'' They like \nalternative energies, which I do, too, except they are not ready and \nthey are not economic and are not here.\n  In the meantime, the residents of Illinois are entitled to and will \ndemand energy. What will happen in Illinois is they will have to shut \nreactors and maybe they will not have air conditioning. Maybe they will \nhave brownouts. This is an obligation that we have in this body to \naddress now because if you do not move it out of there it will stay, \nthe reactors are shut down, and they are stuck with storing high-level \nenergy that is not producing anything, not producing power anymore, and \nthe dilemma is, well, that is a problem for Illinois.\n  We have an opportunity to correct that today. That is what Senate \nbill 104 is all about--taking that waste. Remember, when you talk about \ntransportation, to take it, you have to move it. We have moved it \nsafely, and we can.\n  Now, in the State of Louisiana, my good friend, Senator Bennett \nJohnston, whom I worked with so closely over the years on the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee--and I might add Senator Johnston \nsupported this legislation the last time around because he is a realist \nand he recognizes we have a crisis. We have to address it. We cannot \nsimply ignore it. The difficulty is we have to put it somewhere. That \nsomewhere, unfortunately, is the desert in Nevada.\n  In the case of Louisiana, the ratepayers have paid $135 million over \n12 to 13 years. There are two units, River Bend 1 and Waterford 3. How \nmuch waste? Mr. President, 567 metric tons. When do they run out of \ncapacity? Waterford 3, in the year 2002. River Bend 1, the year 2007. \nThe State is 24 percent dependent on nuclear energy. You can say, well, \nwhy the hurry? Remember, we have been 15 years in this process now. \nYucca Mountain, when completed, will not be ready until the year 2015, \nso if we do not address this today, there is no answer. We are just \nputting it off.\n  Now, looking at Michigan, Mr. President. Ratepayers in Michigan have \npaid $510 million into the fund. There are five units: Big Rock Point, \nCook 1 and 2, Fermi; 1,500 metric tons of high-level waste are stored \nthere. This State, 26 percent, a quarter of the power, is generated \nfrom nuclear energy. Palisades goes down in 1992; Big Rock Point in \n1997; Fermi 2 in 2001; Cook 1 and 2 in 2014.\n\n  If I was from Michigan, I would be very concerned about the reality \nof two points. One, continuing to have a source of power within my \nState, which means my reactors have to continue to operate, which means \nI have to relieve my storage capacity. I would be very concerned. I \nwould be very concerned about losing that power base and what I am \ngoing to do without it. I would be even more concerned if I didn't get \nsome relief and I could not move it and it just sat there after my \nreactors shut down. That is what is going to happen in Michigan, and in \nevery other State that is in a crisis relative to storage. As I have \nindicated, there are several.\n  Let's look at New Jersey. The ratepayers in New Jersey have paid $382 \nmillion into the waste fund. What have they gotten for it? Absolutely \nnothing. The Federal Government promised in 15 years to have a \nsufficient repository ready by next year to take the waste. The \ncitizens of New Jersey have acted in good faith. They paid the price. \nThe Federal Government has not honored its commitment. They paid $382 \nmillion. They have four units: Hope Creek, Oyster Creek and Salem 1 and \n2. They have 1,369 metric tons of waste sitting in New Jersey. Their \nonly hope to get it out is to have a designated repository, designated \nin time to address reality. Reality is that Oyster Creek is in crisis \nnow. That is full now. What are they going to do? Hope Creek will be \nfull in the year 2007, Salem 1 in the year 2013, Salem 2 in 2018. New \nJersey is 62 percent dependent on nuclear power. If I was from New \nJersey, I would be pretty concerned about that. I would be pretty \nconcerned about reality, pretty concerned about the Federal Government \ncommitting to its contractual agreement so that I could relieve my \ndependence before I have to shut down, and pretty concerned that, if I \ndon't get it, I am going to be stuck with the waste in my reactor pools \nwith no relief in sight and no generating capacity. I would say New \nJersey is in a crisis.\n  Well, let's go out West, to Oregon. It is a little less out there. \nRatepayers in Oregon have paid $76 million. They have one unit, Trojan. \nWaste stored is 424 metric tons. Across the Columbia River from Oregon, \nwhich divides the two States, we have the Hanford site. Waste stored \nthere is 2,133 metric tons. Trojan is closed for decommissioning. What \ndoes that mean? It means the waste is still there. I don't know whether \nthe delegation from Oregon is satisfied to just leave it there. But \nunless we have a place to put it, it is going to stay there. We have \nproved that we can transport it throughout the country. I am sure that \nthe State of Washington would not be anxious to take it. Hanford \nalready has over 2,000 metric tons. So here, again, is a case of \nanother State that acted in good faith. The ratepayers have paid in. \nThe reactor is closed for decommissioning. There is no place, Mr. \nPresident, to take the waste.\n  The last exhibit--and I could go on and on, but this gives you an \nidea of the crisis proportion we are in--the State of Wisconsin, the \ndairy State. Nearly a quarter dependent on nuclear power--22 percent to \nbe exact. The residents paid $219 million into the waste fund. What do \nthey have to show for it? Nothing. The Federal Government, when it \ntakes this money, doesn't put it in escrow to have it ready to meet its \nobligation. It goes into the general fund. So what we would have to do \nnow is appropriate funds to meet our obligation. Nevertheless, it has \nbeen paid in. There are three units: Kewaunee and Point Beach 1 and 2. \nAbout 967 metric tons are stored in Wisconsin. The status of the Point \nBeach 1 and 2 plants, I gather, is that they are full now. They have a \ncrisis there right now. Kewaunee will be full in the year 2001.\n  I don't know what the residents of Wisconsin know or whether they \nunderstand or whether they care. But Point Beach 1 and 2 is at \ncapacity. They had to initiate some relief by dry cask storage adjacent \nto the reactors. This is something new and innovative that takes \nlicensing. Well, you could say, ``let's leave it there.'' If you want \nit left in Wisconsin, then don't vote for S. 104. Kewaunee, in the year \n2001. If I were from Wisconsin, I would want to move this stuff out. I \nwould want the Federal Government to respond to the $219 million from \nthe ratepayers. I would not want to run the risk of leaving it there. \nNow we are taking it out of the pools and putting it in areas adjacent \nto the reactor, dry cask storage. The State's electricity relative to \nits dependence is 22 percent.\n  So, there you have it, Mr. President. Those are a few reasons why it \nis critical that we act now, a few reasons why it is critical that \nthese States and the Members of this body from those States recognize \nthat this offers relief from leaving it where it is and putting it out \nin the desert where we have a trained work force, we have security, we \nhave the very real likelihood that the permanent repository is going to \nbe determined to be there. But it is not going to be ready until the \nyear 2015. So this provides the relief that is needed now, and it \nprovides a responsible consideration relative to the necessity of a \ndecision being made now.\n\n[[Page S2973]]\n\n  I think it is fair to say, finally, Mr. President, that to not act on \nthis matter now is to not only disregard the responsibility we have \nhere to minimize the risk to the taxpayers relative to the liability \nthat is going to pile up next year when we can't take the waste, but I \nthink it is also very important to recognize that we are doing a \ndisservice to these States by not providing them with an alternative \nother than leaving the waste where it is, in 41 States at 80 locations.\n  I wish there were some other way that we could put it in some other \narea that would not raise opposition. But I can tell you, Mr. \nPresident--and you have observed the debate--the reality is that \nwhatever State we put it in, we are going to get a similar reaction--an \nextended objection from representatives of that State. Let's recognize \nthe problem for what it is.\n  Where, of all the places, is the best place to site a temporary \nrepository? I will conclude by referring again to the area that has \nbeen polluted for 50 years with 800 nuclear weapons tests, an area that \nmeets as many of the geological applications that are preferred \nrelative to storage, both permanent and interim, of any that have been \nidentified. So let's not wait any longer, Mr. President. I know there \nare a few more amendments that are pending on this legislation.\n  I will conclude my remarks by thanking the Chair, and I will indicate \nthat it is my intention to proceed through the remaining amendments \nwith the cooperation of my good friends from Nevada.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the senior Senator from \nNevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to briefly respond to my friend, the \nmanager of this legislation. I say that it appears that, if we continue \nto work the way we have today and yesterday, we should be able to work \nsomething out on a final disposition of this at a time when the leaders \nwish that to be done.\n  The one thing I want to make very clear, Mr. President, is that we \nhave to respond to a statement of my friend from Alaska that this is a \ncrisis that we are dealing with. The only crisis we are dealing with is \nthe pocketbook of the utilities--not that they are going to be burdened \nwith huge costs, but it may cut down some of their profit margin. These \ncompanies are making huge profits, as was indicated in the chart \nyesterday, which is now spread across the record of this Senate. The \nutilities are making huge amounts of money to generate electricity by \nvirtue of nuclear power.\n  There is no crisis, as far as needing to undercut or circumvent the \npresent law. The present law says that at Yucca Mountain in Nevada--\nthey are characterizing a mountain, Yucca Mountain. In that mountain, \nwe have a huge tunnel that is being bored by a big boring machine. The \ncost of that hole in the ground is $60,000 a foot. That has now gone \nalmost 5 miles through that mountain. When I say ``through the \nmountain,'' it is in a horseshoe shape almost 5 miles long.\n  This Government appropriated almost $200 million last year for the \npurposes of continuing the characterization of that mountain. The work \nat Yucca Mountain has been going on now for more than a decade. It \nseems to me rather strange that we would waste all the money, billions \nof dollars, to determine if in fact that site is suitable.\n  What this legislation does is simply say that we are going to pour a \ncement pad in the middle of the desert and dump this stuff on top of \nthe ground, not protect it from the weather, the elements, or anything \nelse.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, who would you rather trust, \nthe hundreds of organizations that oppose this legislation, including \nthe Baptist Ministry and the United Transportation Workers, who have to \ndeal with products on a daily basis traveling across this country, and \nthe Missouri Alliance, which I read from this morning, organizations \nlike that, or nuclear utilities? Nuclear utilities are the only \norganizations pushing this legislation.\n  I have mentioned a number of times that one of the most important \nelements of policy is public confidence that the Government knows what \nit is doing and their interests are being accommodated. Nuclear waste \ndisposal efforts have, time and time again, demonstrated that we, the \nGovernment, don't know what we are doing. We have rewritten policy any \nnumber of times. We have abandoned the notion of characterizing more \nthan one site because it was too difficult to decide which sites to \nstudy. We have changed the acceptance criteria in midstream because it \nwas too difficult to prove that Yucca Mountain would be acceptable.\n  I just think that this policy is bad. To think that we are now going \nto transport this stuff over 3,000 miles because utilities want us to \ndo it is ridiculous. We can't transport nuclear waste. We don't have \nthe containers to do it safely. We don't have the transportation routes \nto do it safely. Why are we doing this mad rush to satisfy the \ngluttonous utilities? I don't think there is a good reason in public \npolicy to do so.\n  So I hope that my colleagues will understand that there is no \nemergency. There is no crisis to transport nuclear waste. As indicated \nby one of the sponsors of this legislation, the senior Senator from \nIdaho, it is safer--I am not paraphrasing it--it is safer to transport \nnuclear waste than it is to buy a carton of milk at the store and take \nit to your home. It is safer to transport nuclear waste. Well, if that \nis the case, then I think we should go one step further in safety and \nleave it where it is. If the cooling ponds are filled and there is no \nmore room for spent fuel rods, then do what they are doing at a number \nof sites in this country. Reuse the dry cask storage--use the \ncontainment policy. It is cheap and extremely efficient while we await \nthe determination as to whether or not Yucca Mountain is a suitable \nsite.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I know this all gets \npretty arcane and esoteric. But I think the presentation made by the \nSenator from Alaska would maybe give the impression that somehow \nratepayers would be victimized under the present system. I think some \nclarification needs to be made. I think it is important to understand \nthat each of the reactors that he referenced will have a period of time \nin which they shut down. That is because each reactor is licensed for a \nfixed period of time. So if one looks at all of the reactors across the \ncountry, the last reactor to shut down is in the year 2033. And between \nnow and the year 2033 all of the reactors which have been referenced in \nthe charts which the Senator from Alaska has called to our attention \nwill shut down depending upon the period of their license.\n  So the point I seek to make is that over the next 40 years, or 36 \nyears, each of the reactors will be licensed.\n  I mention that because the responsibility of the nuclear waste fund \nexists long after the last reactor shuts down. That is to say there \nwill continually be a responsibility until it is estimated the year \n2071 to deal with the issue of nuclear waste because as reactors close \ndown fuel will be moved into the ponds or the pools. Then ultimately in \ntheory they will be transported to a permanent repository.\n  So you can see it here. This is the mill fee presently under the law. \nEach utility is paying one mill for each kilowatt-hour generated by a \nnuclear reactor. That is the current payment schedule. That mill fee \npayment will decline. As you can see here, here is 1995, but you can \nsee going out to the year 2033, or thereabouts, it will be zero. The \nreason for that is that the mill fees being paid into the nuclear waste \ntrust fund are only generated by kilowatt-hours generated by nuclear \nreactors. So you can see here that the balance of the nuclear waste \ntrust fund peaks up here sometime around the year 2010. So in all of \nthis buildup referenced in the fund, that buildup is going to be \nnecessary because of the outyears, after 2033 when not 1 cent will go \ninto the nuclear waste trust fund because there will be no reactors \ngenerating electrical energy. You will need the money to take care of \nit in the outyears.\n  So what is occurring now was contemplated in 1982 when the Congress \npassed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act; namely, that there would be a mill \nfee payment system in which the mill fees would go into the nuclear \nwaste trust\n\n[[Page S2974]]\n\nfund, that it would build up to a substantial surplus, and that surplus \nwould be needed in the outyears when the responsibility to handle the \nwaste continues even though no money is going into the nuclear waste \ntrust fund.\n  A ratepayer can make a legitimate complaint or a grievance in 1998, \nas we have all agreed on the floor. There is no permanent repository \nopen. There is no type of storage that will be available under any \nscenario. Whatever ill-conceived form S. 104 could possibly be enacted \nin, there is no way that there will be any storage space available at \nany kind of an interim facility in the year 1998.\n  Having recognized that, this Senator has offered legislation over the \nyears that says in effect that after 1998, when utilities may incur \nadditional costs because they had expected that a nuclear waste \nrepository would be opened, a nuclear utility could incur additional \nexpense. I concede that. The additional expense may be that they have \nto provide some dry cask storage, and they may have to reconfigure the \nspace where they currently have the fuel assemblies racked. There could \nbe some additional costs. And that would be unfair to the ratepayer \nbecause the system of mill fee payments did contemplate that in 1998 \nthere would be storage facilities open.\n  So the solution to any contention of inequity is to simply say that, \nif the legislation which I have introduced on a number of occasions is \nto the extent that a utility incurs any additional expense after 1998 \nbecause the permanent storage is not available, that utility should be \nable to offset its additional costs by reducing its payments into the \nnuclear waste trust fund. That is fair, Mr. President. But the notion \nthat somehow the utilities have paid all of this money in and they are \nnot getting what they bargained for is simply not the case. It is true \nthat there is no permanent storage in 1998. We recognize that in the \nlegislation which I have introduced, and we simply provide the \nutilities an offset.\n\n  I urge my colleagues, those who may have an interest in this, to look \nat the ``Nuclear Waste Fund Fee Adequacy and Assessment.'' This is a \ndocument prepared by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Civilian \nRadioactive Waste Management. That has the full schedule of what is \ncontemplated by way of receipts into the fund as well as the expenses \nthat would be incurred after 2033.\n  Finally, let me make a point. If we are truly talking about being \nfinancially responsible, this fund, according to the General Accounting \nOffice, is underfunded by as much as $4 billion to $8 billion. That is \nto say every bit of this buildup, plus an additional $4 billion to $8 \nbillion, will be necessary in order to handle the waste out to the year \n2071 when there will still be responsibilities under the time schedule.\n  So I think it is misleading to suggest that in some way the utility \nratepayers are being dealt with unfairly. They certainly would be dealt \nwith unfairly if they are not able to offset the expense.\n  I must say I am rather surprised that this legislation, S. 104, does \nnothing to deal with the fact that there will be additional costs \nincurred by the utilities after 1998. That is the legislation that has \nbeen pending before the Congress for a number of years.\n  I would also point out to my colleagues that as recently as this past \nmonth the newly confirmed Secretary of Energy has indicated he is \nwilling to sit down and talk to the utilities about compensation in the \nform of additional expenses that they may incur. So when you look at it \nin that context, this has nothing to do with unfairness to the \nratepayers. It has nothing to do with double payments. We can and \nshould responsibly deal with that issue. This is again the siren's call \nthat the industry has invoked now for two decades. ``We just want to \nget this stuff moved. Let's get it on a train. Let's get it on a truck. \nLet's get it out of town today, tomorrow, and we could care less what \nmay occur.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I will be very brief. There are a \ncouple of points I want to make relative to the continued debate. One \nis the reference to the profits of the utilities. Most utilities are \nheavily regulated, and as a consequence the States have a considerable \ninfluence on determining the return on investment. I am not going to \nargue the merits of just what that return is. I think it varies within \nthe industry, and it varies by the producer of power, their power lot, \nand it has to do with incurred debt and the ability to amortize that \ndebt. But one thing that wasn't mentioned is that these utilities have \nprovided reliable power to the residents of the individual States since \nthey came online-- reliable power from a source that emitted no \nemissions, contributed nothing to greenhouse gases, and basically the \ncleanest source of power that we know today on a significant magnitude \nto maintaining air quality. So the environmental contribution by \nnuclear power from the standpoint of its emissions is really beyond \ncompare.\n\n  So let's acknowledge, indeed, that the utilities have done a job. \nThey have provided power which is reliable and clean. Without them \nthere is no considered replacement that has been identified.\n  The issue of containers continues to come up. If we can ship high-\nlevel waste from Europe to the United States, military waste from \nEurope to the United States and to Russia--we watch the British, we \nwatch the French, we watch the Japanese move waste from Japan to France \nfor reprocessing and back--to suggest that we are not going to build \nsafe containers is simply unrealistic.\n  The point has been made that we are in some of these reactors storing \nour waste on site in casks on the surface suggests just one thing. We \nare preparing to basically leave it where it is, leave it with 41 \nStates at the 80 sites, and that is the answer that the other side has \nfor relief. Leave it all over the place. If it is safe enough to leave \nat a reactor in a cask on the surface, certainly it is safe enough to \nleave it out in the desert in an area where we have had 50 years of \nnuclear explosions, where we have a work force that is trained, \nsecurity force, and so forth.\n  So I just do not buy that argument. That is just an argument for \nleaving it where it is, and that is just not good enough. It is not \ngood enough for the Senator from Alaska, it is not good enough for the \nStates that are affected.\n  If you look at the schedule, the viability assessment is anticipated \nto be completed by the end of next year. I am told the odds of that \nbeing favorable are about 90 percent. This is relative to a permanent \nrepository at Yucca being completed.\n  So when that viability assessment is done next year, we will begin to \ninitiate the process of developing the EIS on the temporary repository. \nThen the President has to determine the viability. That is going to \ntake place in 1999. If the Nevada test site is determined it will be \ndetermined at that date, approximately March 1999, and by April 1999 \nthe license application will be presented to the NRC and we anticipate \nthe EIS to be completed on the temporary repository by the year 2000. \nConstruction can begin when the EIS is done. Construction would begin, \nwe anticipate, when we get the license from the NRC, in roughly 2001, \nand we could accept the casks coming from the nuclear reactors into the \ntemporary repository out in the Nevada desert no later than the year \n2000.\n\n  So there is the schedule relative to the timeframe under which we can \nbegin to accept spent fuel into the Nevada desert temporary repository. \nThe alternative to that--and that is what the other side would have you \nsuggest--is to wait until Yucca Mountain is done, and that is the year \n2015.\n  We have a theme here that has been around for a long time and we \ncontinue, and it is here today and it is a legacy of broken promises. I \nthink it is time that the Government start keeping its promises. It was \n15 years ago that Congress passed a law that made a deal with America's \nelectric consumers, and here was the deal. People who bought \nelectricity from nuclear power plants would pay a small additional \ncharge on their electric bills. In return, the Department of Energy \nwould build storage and disposal facilities for used nuclear fuel from \nthe nuclear power plants that supply 22 percent of our Nation's \nelectricity--22 percent--second only to fossil fuels, coal. These \nfacilities, as I have indicated, would be\n\n[[Page S2975]]\n\nready in 1998, at which time the Department of Energy would begin \nremoving used fuel from the nuclear power sites.\n  The consumers paid their money, but as it now stands the DOE is not \ngoing to hold up its end of the bargain.\n  I think it is a travesty that we still are here today trying to get \nthe Department of Energy to fulfill its responsibility to build a \nfacility to manage this radioactive waste. In 15 years and nearly $13 \nbillion in consumer funding for this program, it is pretty hard to see \nthe progress that we have made. All consumers have in exchange for the \nbillions of dollars so far is a legacy of broken promises from the \nFederal Government. Worse yet, the Energy Department says it cannot \nbegin accepting fuel in the permanent repository until the year 2015, \nand that is if everything goes as planned.\n  If you will bear with me, I would like to wander through the legacy \nof broken promises. Let us go back to 1984. This was a clear promise. \nDon Hodel, then Secretary of Energy, affirmed that the Energy \nDepartment is obligated to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel from \nnuclear power plants in 1998 whether or not a permanent disposal \nfacility is ready.\n  Nineteen eighty-seven, 3 years from 1984. Congress then designates \nYucca Mountain, NV, as the only site to be evaluated--the only site to \nbe evaluated. Congress, that is us, Mr. President. The Energy \nDepartment announces a 5-year delay in the opening date for a disposal \nfacility, from 1998 to the year 2003. We went on from 1987 to 1989, \nanother delay, another promise. The Department of Energy announces \nanother major delay in the opening date for a permanent disposal \nfacility until the year 2010 this time.\n  Well, moving on; 1991 comes. We have mounting concerns. And the first \nsign of concerns appear over the Energy Department's ability to meet \nits obligation under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. So the State of \nMinnesota tells Energy Secretary James Watkins that it is highly \nprobable that the Department of Energy will experience significant \ndelay in meeting its obligation to begin taking high-level radioactive \nwaste in 1998.\n  May 1992. What do we have? More promises. Secretary of Energy Watkins \ntells Minnesota that the DOE is committed to fulfill the mandates \nimposed by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. The Department has sound, \nintegrated program plans that should enable them to begin to receive \nspent fuel at an MRS--monitored retrievable storage--facility in 1998.\n  December 1992, yet another promise. Energy Secretary Watkins \nacknowledges that attempts to find a volunteer host for an MRS facility \nhave not succeeded. Another disappointment. He promises whatever is \nnecessary to ensure that the Energy Department is able to start \nremoving spent fuel from nuclear power plant sites in 1998.\n  Well, moving on to May 1993, we get an affirmation from Secretary of \nEnergy O'Leary that there is a moral obligation that the Department of \nEnergy has to the electric utilities and their customers. And I quote: \n``If it does not have a legal obligation, then it has a moral \nobligation.''\n  Well, I do not know whether you can make soup out of that. In May \n1994, notice of inquiry. The Department of Energy publishes a notice of \ninquiry to address the concerns of affected parties regarding the \ncontinued storage of spent nuclear fuel at reactor sites beyond 1998. \nThe energy agency says in its preliminary view it does not have the \nstatutory obligation to accept spent nuclear fuel in 1998 in the \nabsence of an operational repository or suitable storage facility.\n  In May 1994, 14 utilities and 20 States sue the Department of Energy. \nA coalition of 14 utilities and public agencies in 20 States file \nseparate but similar lawsuits seeking clarification of the Department \nof Energy's responsibility to accept spent nuclear fuel beginning in \n1998.\n  April 1995. Here we go. Here is the Government's first \nacknowledgement of their policy. In April 1995, after starting this in \n1984, 11 years, it comes out and says they have no obligation to take \nthe fuel. Talk about a copout. They state that the Federal Government \nhas no legal obligation to begin accepting high-level waste in 1998 if \na repository is not open--according to the Department of Energy's \ninterpretation of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and its contracts with \nutilities.\n\n  Fortunately, the court took another view. In July 1996, the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals ruled that the Department of Energy is obliged to take \nfuel in 1998, and it is a legal as well as a moral obligation. So we \nfinally got some action. That came out in July.\n  In December 1996, the Department of Energy decides not to challenge \nthe court ruling and admits failure and admits liability. The DOE \nacknowledges that it will not be able to meet its commitment to take \nwaste in 1998.\n  January 1997, the DOE's liability. Well, 46 State regulatory agencies \nand 33 electric utilities file new action for escrow of nuclear waste \nfees. That means they did not want them to go into the general fund \nanymore. They want this to go into an escrow fund so they will be \navailable for the Federal Government to meet its obligation and order \nthe DOE to take spent fuel in 1998.\n  In March 1997 the court rejects the Department of Energy motion to \ndismiss before it is filed. The court tells the Department of Energy \nthat a motion to dismiss would be inappropriate in this case and sets \nthe case for damages and hearing of the merits.\n  The Energy Department must have clear direction to develop an \nintegrated system that will fulfill its obligation to manage the \nNation's commercial and defense nuclear waste. S. 104 provides that by \nrequiring construction of a central storage facility for used nuclear \nfuel and continued scientific investigation of a proposed repository at \nYucca Mountain. The legislation also includes appropriate safeguards \nfor the public and the environment at every step and provides consumers \nwith a solution for the billions of dollars they have already paid into \nthe program.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this comprehensive \nsolution to one of the Nation's most pressing environmental issues and \nend the string of broken promises.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 36 to Amendment No. 26\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I send an amendment to the desk. It is an amendment to \nthe Murkowski substitute beginning on page 49.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Chair recognizes the junior Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, the amendment being offered by the Senator \nfrom Alaska is designed to address a point of order that would lie with \nthis bill with respect to the budget process. We have heard almost \nendlessly on the floor that the poor ratepayers are not getting this, \nthey are not getting that. We have tried to respond by saying we think \nthe ratepayers have a legitimate issue to raise after 1998, and that \nthere should be a reduction in the payments into the fund because some \nadditional costs are going to be incurred before a permanent repository \ncan be made available under any scenario that one would choose to \nfantasize.\n  This is kind of another budget gimmick, and it is technical, but let \nme just say very briefly that what this does is it deals with nuclear \nwaste that was accumulated prior to 1982, in which the utilities would \nincur an obligation to pay for that. There were several options \navailable. A number of utilities elected not to make that payment until \nnuclear waste was actually being received by the permanent repository. \nSo we are not talking about an inconsequential sum, and ratepayers may \nbe interested to know that their utilities, or at least some of them, \nare going to be paying $2.7 billion before they would otherwise have \nbeen required to do so under the previous agreement to deal with the \nbudget. This is designed, it is a budget gimmick, so it does not result \nin being vulnerable to a budget point of order.\n  It does, apparently--we are going to have this reviewed--it does, \napparently, deal with the budget point of order the senior Senator from \nNevada and I were about to make. But I think the point needs to be \nmade, anybody who has this compassion and concern for ratepayers, what \nthis does is trigger the obligation to pay that $2.7 billion before any \ninterim repository could possibly be opened anywhere, under any \nscenario, before any permanent repository.\n  Somehow I do not see how this is a better deal for the ratepayers who \noriginally were led to believe that they would have until after nuclear \nwaste was initially received before this $2.7 billion obligation.\n  So, it looks to me like the ratepayers are on the short end of this \none.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the senior Senator from \nNevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if there is anyone in this body who is \nconcerned about dollars and budgetary numbers, they should be concerned \nabout what is taking place here. They should run from this bill. This \nis another reason that we should be so thankful we have a \nconstitutional form of government and we have a President who is \nwilling to veto bad legislation. This is bad legislation, getting worse \nevery hour we spend on this floor.\n  Now the numbers are changing. We are not talking about a few dollars \nhere and a few dollars there; we are talking about $2.7 billion that \nthe ratepayers are going to have to cough up early. This is another \nexample of the gluttonous nuclear utilities taking advantage of the \ngeneral public. We know we do not have the numbers, as has been proven, \nbecause the utilities seem to have a lock on this bill. They are the \nones marching it through this Congress. But 16 blocks away, on \nPennsylvania Avenue, we have someone who is going to veto this \nlegislation. That is all we have left, because it is very clear that \nthe nuclear utilities have a lock on this legislation that is getting \nworse by the hour.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am going to call for a voice vote, \nbut let me very briefly explain our position with regard to the action \nthat is pending before the Senate.\n  This provision requires the payment of a one-time fee due to be paid \nin fiscal year 2001. The one-time fee is the fee paid for fuel used \nbefore the Nuclear Waste Policy Act was enacted. Most have already paid \nthis fee. The timing of the payment was optional: Immediately or when \nthe fuel was taken. If paid when the fuel was taken, then interest must \nbe paid by the utilities. Most utilities that have not paid the fee put \nit in escrow, and this simply requires that the fee be turned over to \nthe Federal Government so it can be used as an offset to the user fee \nimplemented by S. 104.\n  So the amendment simply corrects a technical issue with regard to the \nfee provision of the substitute. We had been previously advised by CBO \nthat the provision had no Budget Act impact and, as a consequence, this \naction basically makes us in conformance with the Budget Act.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I certainly am not going to object to a \nvoice vote on this, but might I ask the chairman a question on this?\n  I do not intend to offer an objection, but I think it would be \nhelpful for those who have been listening to the debate, am I not \ncorrect this one-time fee, which I am told is $2.7 billion, was not due \nuntil the time at which the utilities actually had the waste removed, \nwhich would have been 10 or 15 years, whatever the case may be? This \ndoes require an accelerated payment by them in order to comply with the \nBudget Act; is that not correct?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may, I am told that was the deadline for paying \nthe\n\n[[Page S2977]]\n\nfee. But if you paid earlier, you do not have to pay the interest.\n  Mr. BRYAN. But the option was whether the utilities--if I am \ncorrectly informed, and I certainly stand to be corrected--can take the \noption not to pay, which would mean that it would be years before that \npayment would be due.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is true, but they would have to pay the penalty \nof the interest.\n  Mr. BRYAN. They would have to pay the interest.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. So it is beneficial, since in most cases they have it \nin escrow, to simply pay it.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I simply say, not to be argumentative with the chairman, \nbut if the utilities had elected not to make that payment--one would \nassume they are acting in their own self-interest--this will now compel \nthem to make the payment before they have the benefit of the interim or \npermanent storage. That is the only point I sought to make.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. My understanding is, if the utilities agree to pay it, \nit seems to be in their own best interest to pay it and be relieved of \nthe interest. Mr. President, I ask for a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n36 offered by the Senator from Alaska.\n  The amendment (No. 36) was agreed to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. For the benefit of all Senators, I should advise them \nit is our intention to try to work toward a time agreement with some \nfinality relative to the pending amendments.\n  It is my understanding that there are two Wellstone amendments that \nare left, one Bingaman amendment----\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will be happy to.\n\n\n                   Amendments Nos. 29 and 30, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. REID. I, Mr. President, pursuant to a request from Senator \nWellstone, who is unable to be here today because of floods in his \nState, offer at this time, with unanimous-consent, two amendments. It \nis my understanding that it is part of the unanimous consent agreement \nthese amendments will be debated on Monday.\n  I send these two amendments to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Wellstone, \n     proposes, en bloc, amendments numbered 29 and 30.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 29 and 30), en bloc, are as follows:\n\n                            amendment no. 29\n\n     (Purpose: To ensure that emergency response personnel in all \njurisdictions on primary and alternative shipping routes have received \n    training and have been determined to meets standards set by the \nSecretary before shipments of spent nuclear fuel and high-level nuclear \n                                 waste)\n\n       On page 22 of the substitute, line 5, after ``(3)(B)'' \n     insert ``until the Secretary has made a determination that \n     personnel in all state, local, and tribal jurisdictions on \n     primary and alternative shipping routes have met acceptable \n     standards of training for emergency responses to accidents \n     involving spent nuclear fuel and high-level nuclear waste, as \n     established by the Secretary, and''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                            amendment no. 30\n\n    (Purpose: To express the Sense of the Senate regarding Federal \n         assistance for elderly and disabled legal immigrants)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.     . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING FEDERAL ASSISTANCE \n                   FOR ELDERLY AND DISABLED LEGAL IMMIGRANTS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should take \n     steps to ensure that elderly and disabled legal immigrants \n     who are unable to work, will not be left without Federal \n     assistance essential to their well-being.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if we could get a short explanation.\n  Mr. REID. I also ask unanimous consent that the amendments be laid \naside.\n  The amendments--one of them deals with immigration and the other \ndeals with setting standards for training of people who deal with \nnuclear waste.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my friend for the explanation. I have no \nobjection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I would also say to my friend, the manager of the bill, \nthat it appears that we are trying to work to get a finite number of \nthese amendments, and, hopefully, after the next vote, maybe we can \nhave an agreement--although I guess we are not going to have any votes \ntoday, so I withdraw that--maybe after completing the debate on the \nThompson amendment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may interrupt to complete my understanding, for \nthe benefit of other Senators, we have the two Wellstone amendments \npending at a time to be determined by the leadership, which is intended \nto be debated on Monday. Is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Minnesota has indicated he would be \nwilling to accept a time agreement of 1 hour on each amendment, equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am sure we would accept that. And then there is the \ndisposition of the Bingaman amendment.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding, I say to my friend from Alaska, \nthere are two Bingaman amendments. He may not offer both of them. But \nhe would like to reserve two. He also indicated that he would be \nwilling on those amendments to agree to 1 hour evenly divided.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. On the two amendments?\n  Mr. REID. That is right.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That would also take place Monday.\n  Mr. BRYAN. If the Senator would yield, I am informed that Senator \nBumpers has an amendment, the nature of which I do not know. And \nSenator Domenici has two amendments that I have just been made aware \nof. I did not know that until a few moments ago. This is just to inform \nthe chairman. There are some things we are going to have to work \nthrough.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I was distracted. Did the Senator from Nevada say \nSenator Bumpers?\n  Mr. BRYAN. Senator Bumpers has an amendment, and there are two \namendments that may--I underscore the word ``may''--be offered by the \nSenator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici. I do not know what his intent \nmay be with respect to them. But apparently those are among the \namendments that have been filed, I would advise the chairman.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my friend.\n  It is my understanding, then, there will be an attempt to get a time \nagreement so we can conclude disposition of all amendments at a time \nMonday that would be determined in a time agreement and that the \nleadership would affix a vote on those amendments which require it; is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. BRYAN. Yes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. With that understanding, it gives the Members an idea \nof what we might anticipate for the balance of the day.\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 37 to Amendment No. 26\n\n  (Purpose: To provide that the President shall not designate the Oak \nRidge Reservation in the State of Tennessee as a site for construction \n                    of an interim storage facility)\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Frist and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Thompson], for Mr. Frist, \n     for himself, and Mr. Thompson, proposes an amendment numbered \n     37 to amendment No. 26.\n\n       On page 28, line 16, after ``Washington'' insert ``or the \n     Oak Ridge Reservation in the State of Tennessee''.\n\n\n[[Page S2978]]\n\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise to offer this amendment today \nbecause I am concerned about that section of the bill dealing with what \nhappens if Yucca Mountain is not deemed to be a suitable permanent \nrepository to store spent nuclear fuel. In that event, under this bill, \nall work on an interim storage site in Nevada would cease and the \nPresident would have 18 months to name an alternate site for an interim \nstorage facility.\n  What I am concerned about is that the bill goes on to say:\n       The President shall not designate the Hanford Nuclear \n     Reservation in the State of Washington as a site for the \n     construction of an interim storage facility.\n  So the President will have one less option when he is looking for \nalternate sites under that scenario. My colleagues from South Carolina \nhave offered an amendment which has subsequently been adopted that \nwould exempt two sites in their State from consideration as well.\n  Our concern is that Tennessee has been selected before as a site for \nan interim storage facility. However, it was later soundly rejected as \na storage site both by the Congress and the courts. We may be facing \nthe possibility that Tennessee again will be selected as an interim \nstorage site under the scenario I just outlined.\n  In 1986, the Department of Energy recommended three sites for the \nlocation of interim storage facility for spent fuel. All three of those \nsites were in Tennessee. Given that history, we may be at the top or \nnear the top of the list again, especially if Hanford and Savannah \nRiver are taken off the table. Removing Hanford and Savannah River from \nconsideration makes it more likely that Oak Ridge would be selected as \nan interim storage site.\n  We should make it clear again today that Tennessee is not an \nappropriate site to store this waste, just as Congress did in 1987. I \nassume we will do the same thing today. Oak Ridge itself is a \npopulation center. The city of Oak Ridge has 28,000 residents. Oak \nRidge sits directly between two major population centers in our State--\nKnoxville, with a population of 175,000, and Chattanooga, with a \nmetropolitan area population of approximately 424,000--and it is just \n175 miles from the capital of Tennessee, Nashville.\n  Oak Ridge also sits at the center of three major interstate \nhighways--I-40, I-70, and I-81. Thus, it is an extremely heavily \ntrafficked area.\n  In addition, Oak Ridge is just 5 miles from the Melton Hill Dam and \njust 15 miles from Norris Dam. In other words, it sits in close \nproximity to major waterways and dam facilities.\n  I would like to think that my concern is not well placed, and it may \nnot be well placed, but as this deliberation has proceeded, it has \nbecome more and more a matter of relevant concern. So out of abundance \nof caution, I think this Congress should make clear what a past \nCongress made clear--that Oak Ridge is not a suitable place as a \nstorage facility. For this reason, I urge the adoption of the \namendment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Let me advise the Senator from Tennessee, we are \nprepared on this side to accept his amendment. And I am not sure what \nthe disposition is on the other side.\n  Mr. BRYAN. The Senator from Nevada would not be prepared to accept it \nand will be asking for a rollcall vote. I would like an opportunity to \nrespond to some of the comments the Senator from Tennessee made. If he \nneeds a little more time, I am happy to allow him to go first, but I \nwant to respond to some of his comments that he made on behalf of his \namendment.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. No. I am finished at this time.\n  If the Senator has comments to make, please do so.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I understand the concern that my friend from Tennessee \nhas. It is a concern that Nevadans have had for many years. Let me say \nwhere I respectfully disagree with him is that if he is concerned about \nthe movement of nuclear waste to an interim storage facility, the most \neffective protection that the State of Tennessee and all States have is \nthe existing law--is the existing law.\n  There are two provisions in the existing law. One of them is \nspecifically in reference to the Senator's concern from the State of \nTennessee and, indeed, is a product of the Tennessee State delegation's \nactions on the floor a decade ago.\n  Under the present law, no interim storage anywhere in any State can \nbe located until an application for license of a permanent repository. \nSo his State under the current law is absolutely protected, as is every \nother State. And the reason why that was inserted in the legislation at \nthat time was a policy consideration.\n  Our colleagues then recognized the great temptation that an interim \nor temporary facility might become a permanent repository de facto, a \nconcern which the Senators from Nevada are very gravely concerned \nabout. So every State that is concerned about it being a potential \ntarget for interim storage under the present law has no need to worry \nat all. That is the ultimate protection.\n  The law right now precludes the location of interim storage until the \napplication for licensure for the permit. You cannot have a better \nprotection than that. So if that is the Senator's concern from the \nState of Tennessee, as I know it is the Senators' from many States, \nthat is the best protection that the State of Tennessee and others \nhave.\n  Let me just explain to my colleagues what the Senator from Tennessee \nis asking. The Senator from Tennessee, in the amendment, is asking that \nhis State be exempted from any consideration.\n  Under the provisions of S. 104, if the President finds there is a \nreason to reject the permanent storage at the Yucca Mountain facility, \nthen the President is given a time to choose an alternative location \nfor interim storage. And if he does so, that decision has to be \napproved by the Congress at a subsequent time.\n  So, in effect, the President would be required to make a choice as to \nanother location around the country, and that decision would have to be \nratified by an act of Congress, signed into law by the President.\n  We believe that S. 104 is unnecessary and unwise, so that our view is \nthat we ought not to be in that position in terms of the legislation, \nthat we ought to reject that because it is unnecessary and unwise and \nwe ought to proceed on the present course, which is to continue the \nsite characterization process that is occurring at Yucca Mountain.\n  But let me just say, again, with great respect to my friend, who I \nadmire greatly, from Tennessee, he is asking his State to be exempted, \neven though in 1987 when the Department of Energy--one can assume based \nupon scientific considerations--had made a determination that three \nsites in Tennessee would be the best sites in the country for interim \nstorage. If you look at the history of this act, that is the essence of \nwhat has gone wrong, why this act, which was originally conceived with \nsome sense of balance and fairness, has gone so far astray.\n  The original law in 1982, signed into law by the President in 1983, \nwas that we would search the entire country and look for the best site \nfor a permanent repository.\n  That is pretty hard to argue in principle--nobody exempt, everybody \non the board. And we look for the best site. It was also contemplated \nthere would be some regional balance, that we would look into different \ntypes of geology--granite, salt domes, welded tuff, perhaps others as \nwell--and that then three sites would be studied, and the President of \nthe United States, from those three sites, would make the decision that \nhas at least some pretension of being rational and fair and scientific.\n\n  Here is what happened: Not science, but politics. The 1984 election \nilluminates the year after the Nuclear Waste Policy Act is enacted into \nlaw. Immediately, the incumbent President and his supporters assured \npeople in the Southeast, ``Don't worry. We'll never choose the salt \ndomes.'' It had nothing to do with science. That is all politics. That \nwas one of the first corrupting acts that in effect destroyed any \npretense of science, balance, fairness, objectivity.\n  And then fast forwarding, the Department of Energy began to gather \ndata, and their internal memorandum said, look, the folks in the \nNortheast are going to object to this, there will be strong political \nopposition, and the Department of Energy unilaterally\n\n[[Page S2979]]\n\nabandoned any pretense of a search for a site in a granite formation. \nNothing to do with science. Absolutely nothing.\n  Then what remained of the act was that we would provide the President \nof the United States, whoever that person might be, with three choices. \nThat was emasculated in 1987, when the ``Screw Nevada'' bill was \nenacted, having nothing to do with science. Nobody argued Yucca \nMountain should be considered solely and exclusively to the exclusion \nof everything else except the nuclear utilities and their supporters.\n  I do not believe you can find a scientist worth his or her salt that \nwill tell you that we ought to have all of our nuclear eggs in one \nbasket. It would be better to have some options on the table to \nconsider other locations and then let the process go forward from \nthere. That is what has made this entire siting process so utterly \ndevoid of any kind of credibility, because the politics has worked \nthrough it.\n  We need the South, so we assured them, in 1984, you will be home \nfree. The DOE looks at political opinion and reaction in the \nNortheast--no, we are sure not going to look at you. And then the \nutilities come in and say, look, we do not like the idea of having \nthree sites studied; let us just study the Nevada site--having \nabsolutely nothing to do with science.\n  Now, fast forward to 1997. I invoke the aid of deity in praying to \nGod we do not get S. 104 enacted into law, and I believe we will not \nbecause of the President of the United States, who is taking, in my \njudgment, the right policy and trying to restore some credibility to \nthe process. However, if S. 104 were enacted into law, the President of \nthe United States is mandated, if he finds Yucca Mountain unsuitable, \nto make another choice for interim storage. That would have to be \nsubmitted to the Congress for approval.\n  Now, what we are saying is no, we should not allow the President to \nmake that choice.\n  We ought not to exempt Tennessee, as my friend from Tennessee would \nhave us do, or this morning as our colleagues from South Carolina got \ntheir State exempted, and previously the State of Washington. That has \nabsolutely nothing to do with science. That has everything to do with \npolitics.\n  If you believe for one moment that S. 104 has any merit at all--and \nin my view it has none, and I oppose it strenuously on a number of \ngrounds that we will get into at a later time during the debate--should \nnot the President of the United States, who is being directed to make \nother selections with respect to interim storage, have a full range of \ndiscretion as to where he should tentatively make that choice, which is \nalways subject to approval by the Congress. We have the right to \ndisagree. But, in effect, what we want to do with these series of \namendments that we have dealt with this morning--the Washington \nexemption, the South Carolina exemption, and now the exemption of my \nfriend from Tennessee--we want to load the deck. It is a stacked deck. \n``You cannot look at us; we are in Tennessee.'' ``You cannot look at \nus; we are in South Carolina.'' That does not have any policy \njustification at all, in my judgment.\n  I understand the concern of the able Senator from Tennessee about \ntransporting all this nuclear waste through his State. It would be \nsubstantial and extensive. That is why I wish he were allied with us, \nbecause if he were, the State of Tennessee and other States would be \nimmune and protected from the irresponsible course of conduct which S. \n104 directs us to do.\n  It is for that reason I find myself in opposition to his amendment, \nNo. 1, on the basis of policy; and No. 2, I believe that makes this \nlegislation, if it is possible, even less defensible than it is in its \npresent unamended form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate my able \ncolleague's comments. He is eloquent in defense of his position. I \nrespectfully disagree with him with regard to the history of this \nmatter in some respects. It seems often when we agree with a decision, \nit is based on scientific evidence and when we disagree, it is based on \npolitics.\n  In this particular matter, the decision not to have the Tennessee \nsite designated as a storage facility actually was also addressed by \nthe courts at that time, and they determined that the DOE at that time \nin making that decision, violated the Nuclear Waste Act in failing to \nconsult with the State before selecting the sites in Tennessee. So \nbefore Congress even got involved in the matter, the courts had \naddressed the matter and enjoined the DOE from putting the facility in \nTennessee.\n  In listening to my colleague, I am more and more concerned because he \nmakes a case, for his belief anyway that Tennessee apparently would in \nfact be the logical place once you eliminate all of the other sites \nthat have already been eliminated.\n  Talking about objective criteria, I think population is one. As I \nmentioned, the city of Oak Ridge is a city of 28,000 people, in sharp \ncontrast to a place like the Nevada test site, which has a population \ndensity of one-half person per square mile. That is subjective \ncriteria. This is not raw politics by any stretch of the imagination.\n  I am not saying that this site-by-site consideration is the best way \nto proceed. We simply find ourselves in a situation where we do not \nwant the dagger pointed at the heart of the State of Tennessee, when \nall the dust settles and find, instead of a place where the facility \nought to be, which is embodied in the body of this bill, that we find \nsomeplace that the Congress has already rejected in times past as not \nbeing meritorious.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the statement of the Senator from \nTennessee is valid, and I am confident that it is, then the Senator \nshould oppose this legislation, because if he believes that there is \npotential damage to residents of the State of Tennessee, then certainly \nhe should understand that there is significant risk to the people of \nNevada. The State of Nevada, people think of as a big wasteland. The \nfact of the matter is that not far from the Nevada test site are over a \nmillion people.\n\n  We have significant problems. But not only are there problems in \nTennessee and in Nevada; what about the entire route of this \ntransportation? If the Senator from Tennessee is concerned about \ntransportation of nuclear waste within the State of Tennessee, he \nlikewise should be concerned about the transportation of nuclear waste \nacross this country.\n  We have established, Mr. President, that there are significant groups \nwho are opposed to this legislation. We have yet to find anyone other \nthan utilities companies who favor this legislation, and the utility \ncompanies that favor it are necessarily nuclear facilities, with some \nexceptions.\n  We have talked this morning and been given a few examples on this \nfloor about the Baptists who oppose this legislation and the United \nTransportation Workers and an organization in Missouri. We could give \nhundreds of examples. But I thought it would be appropriate because \npeople believe--I hope they believe--if you are going to side with the \nBaptists or the nuclear utilities, you should go with the Baptists. But \nin case someone is concerned about that, we will look at the \nEvangelical Lutheran Church in America. They wrote a letter to every \nSenator in this body on March 20 of this year, where they have said, \n``Don't support S. 104.''\n\n       In addition to the risks of S. 104, it is objectionable \n     because it weakens environmental standards for nuclear waste \n     disposal by carving loopholes in NEPA, preempting other \n     environmental laws and limiting licensing standards for a \n     permanent repository.\n\n  That, Mr. President, really says it all. If, on March 20, they felt \nthat environmental standards were being weakened and loopholes were \nbeing carved into the legislation, look what this legislation now is. \nEvery hour that goes by there is a new loophole. We raise a point of \norder with the Budget Act. Well, what we will do, we will make the \nutilities and the ratepayers pay $2.7 billion a little early. We want \nto carve another loophole here for Washington. We will do one for South \nCarolina, one for Tennessee.\n  The Evangelical Lutheran church in America opposes this legislation, \nnot because of the Senators from Nevada but because of the Members of \ntheir ministry throughout this country. This is some of the worst \nlegislation--and I have been in this Congress for going on 15 years; I \nknow a lot about this legislation--that has ever come through\n\n[[Page S2980]]\n\nthis body. You talk about special-interest legislation; this is it. The \nCongress has been appropriating for about 15 years a couple hundred \nmillion dollars a year, sometimes more than that, examining, \ncharacterizing Yucca Mountain. This legislation just basically throws \nit out. That is what the Evangelical Lutheran church says. This \nlegislation wipes out the legislation for a permanent repository, which \nis the only hope of having a safe place to store it if, in fact, that \ncan happen.\n  If the Senator from Tennessee is concerned about safe transportation, \nhe and the other Members of this body should revisit what has taken \nplace in Europe. I repeat, 30,000 troops and soldiers to carry six \nnuclear waste canisters 300 miles in Germany--30,000 troops.There were \none hundred seventy people injured. Many went to the hospital. And it \ncost $150 million to move it at the rate of 2 miles an hour. In \naddition to that--you think we have concerns about Chattanooga and Oak \nRidge being close to a proposed nuclear site?--look what happened in \nGermany. I am reading from the letter.\n\n       The transport of these 6 casks required 30,000 police and \n     $150 million, more than 170 people were injured, more than \n     500 arrested. Even the police have called for an end of the \n     shipments. They no more like arresting demonstrators, who \n     many sympathize with, than they like guarding highly \n     radioactivity waste casks.\n\n  The writer goes on, ``I measured the radiation of these casks at 15 \nfeet.''\n  Mr. President, that distance is from this Senator to the Presiding \nOfficer. The radiation at 15 feet was 50 times higher than background \nlevels, an amount no one should be voluntarily exposed to, and pregnant \nwomen and children should never be exposed to. The police, of course, \nstand much closer than 15 feet, and for hours at a time. No wonder the \nGerman parliament has abandoned and suspended the transportation of \nnuclear waste in Germany. Why? Because you cannot do it.\n  So if the sponsors of this amendment are concerned about the safety \nof the people from Tennessee, then they should be concerned about the \nsafety of the people of this country.\n  What is the answer to the nuclear waste problem? Leave it where it is \nin dry cask storage containment or in the cooling ponds. As the \nrepresentative from the State of Oregon told me this morning in the \nHouse, that is why he sided with Representative Vucanovich. If it is \nsafe to transport these nuclear casks, these dry casks--which it is \nnot, we have already established--if it is so safe, leave it where it \nis. That is why he supported Representative Vucanovich in the past.\n\n  This amendment is special legislation, and my friend from Tennessee \nshould be concerned, as I know he is concerned, about the people of \nthis country in addition to the people of Tennessee. That being the \ncase, this amendment shows how fallacious and weak and unsupportable \nthis bill is. It is a bill that is rife with gluttonous nuclear utility \nindustry. That is the only reason it is here and the only reason it is \nbeing pushed. This legislation is faulty. It is fake. It is insincere. \nI said this legislation; I did not say this amendment.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, my colleague from Tennessee, Senator \nFrist, wanted to make a statement on this matter, but he is chairing \nthe Subcommittee on Science and Technology, a subcommittee of the \nCommerce Committee, so if it is in order, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent this vote be set aside until \nsometime the two leaders agree would be appropriate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I think, again, we have to address the \nquestion of informed speculation, and the reference made a few minutes \nago by my friend from Nevada to what happened in Germany mixes apples \nand oranges. The issue was not spent fuel leaving Germany. It was \nvitrified waste coming back to Germany. There is a substantial \ndifference. What happens in the vitrifying process is that they recover \nthe radioactive material and mix it with a glass form. It is \nradioactive. There is no question about it. But to suggest, as my \nfriend from Nevada would, that this is the same stuff as shipping spent \nfuel, that's the apples and oranges issue.\n\n  I think what we have seen today proves my point, which is that nobody \nwants this. I am not being critical of my friends from Nevada. It \ndoesn't make any difference whether it be the State of Michigan--and \nVermont has been suggested as having one of the best types of granite-\nbased rocks, from the standpoint of stability and geology. But I am \nsure if that were a selected site for a permanent repository, or \ntemporary repository, we would have the delegation from Vermont right \nwhere the delegation from Nevada is. That is the reality of this. We \nhave had representatives from the West exempt Washington, and for \nreasons that Washington says they are fed up, they have had enough \nwaste. They continue to have waste, several hundreds of tons of waste, \nthousands of tons of waste. They don't want any more. The reason they \ndon't want any more is there is no way to dispose of it. They are \nbeginning to start a vitrification process.\n  The same is true in South Carolina. They don't want any more. They \nhave it there now. The reason they don't want any more is there is no \nway to dispose of it. They are vitrifying now. The vitrification is, \nfor the most part, military waste. They are recovering liquid waste \nfrom the tanks. I have been out to Hanford and I have been to South \nCarolina. Now, we are seeing Tennessee. Tennessee has high-level \nnuclear waste stored there. Idaho does, too. I am kind of surprised we \ndon't have every Senator down here exempting his or her State. That is \none way to ensure that they are not going to get it. Then where are you \ngoing to put it if you can't put it in one of the 50 States? Are you \ngoing to put it on the Atlantic coast? No. Are you going to send it to \nCanada? They don't want it. You might be able to send it to Europe for \na fee, I don't know. So you move to the Pacific. What do you have \nthere? You have some islands. Maybe we have some Indian reservations \nthat might be interested. But, undoubtedly, that would not be suitable \nto the State governments. We have Palmira off of the Hawaiian islands \nbeing mentioned from time to time. There is a group, as a matter of \nfact, that was promoting it--for a fee. They said they owned the \nisland. They have islands in the South Pacific. Some of them are \nindividual nations, and they have been interested in doing it, perhaps, \nfor a fee. But that is a bit dangerous, Mr. President, because we are \nnot sure what the proliferation capability might be in that kind of \nsituation.\n  So what has happened today on the floor of the U.S. Senate proves my \npoint, which is that nobody wants it. So we have seen three States \nexempt themselves. The unfortunate part is that we are still left with \nour friends from Nevada. I was here when the decision was made to put a \npermanent repository in Nevada. Several of the staff members were there \nat that time. There was a Republican Senator from Nevada, who is not \nhere anymore, perhaps as a consequence of that decision being made by \nthat body to put a permanent repository at Yucca Mountain. He fought \nvaliantly, he fought hard, and he is not back here. He lost. That is \njust the reality of being honest with the facts. The facts are that we \nhave to put it somewhere.\n  Now, the Nevadans would have you leave it where it is. Well, there is \na democratic process around here. Nobody ever said it was fair. I \nconvey that in all humility, relative to the reality of what it means. \nBut Nevada has had an extraordinary experience with nuclear weapons \nover a long period of time. It has been named as a permanent \nrepository. The reality is that when that permanent repository is done, \nthe waste at the 80 sites in 41 States will be transported there. It is \nrather inconsistent that we don't hear from our colleagues in Nevada \nthe objection about the continued expenditure that is going into Yucca \nMountain; $6 billion has been expended and 4\\1/2\\ miles of tunnel is \nalready done, and they continue to work on the tunnel and continue to \nspend money. And $30 billion is probably going to be expended before it \nis licensed and opened. That has some benefit. But what it really says \nis that the decision that\n\n[[Page S2981]]\n\nwas made by Congress many years ago to site the permanent site at Yucca \nMountain, as it progresses, will become a reality and, indeed, Nevada \nwill be the site of a permanent repository.\n\n  Virtually everybody is in agreement that we need a permanent \nrepository for our waste, unless we abandon our current policy of \nburying our high-level nuclear waste. It is kind of interesting because \nwe are one of the few nations that continues to pursue burying waste \nwith plutonium in it. The French and the Japanese recover it through \nreprocessing. That is how you get rid of the proliferation threat. But \nthere is a mentality and a group of environmental organizations that \nsimply think that that would foster and expand the nuclear power \nindustry in this country and advance nuclear development. I am not here \nto argue that point today, Mr. President. But that is the harsh \nreality. We are still talking about burying it. The rest of the world \nis developing a technology that says it is too valuable to bury. We \ndon't want the proliferation threat, so we reprocess it in MOX fuel and \nburn it in our reactors. We even have the technology in the United \nStates at Palos Verdes. I was out there in Arizona. That reactor was \nbuilt to take MOX fuel. We could do that. If there was ever a crack in \nthe administration's armor relative to nuclear waste, it is their \nreluctant acknowledgment that they must begin vitrification of military \nwaste in this country. Whether that will lead, ultimately, to the \nrecovery of plutonium and putting that back in the reactors, we have \nyet to see. So we are proceeding under the tired old argument that we \nhave to bury it.\n  We are committed on that path, and we are going to spend $30 billion \nand we are going to put that site in Nevada when it is licensed. So we \nhave a democratic process, we have 50 States, and we have to put it in \none of them. Now, we talk about praying to the Lord and the comment \nthat the President is likely to veto S. 104. Well, if anyone would ask \nthe administration, as I have done--I have sent three letters to the \nPresident in response to the assertion that the administration doesn't \napprove of S. 104 --for what their proposal is, the truth is that they \nhave no proposal. You have heard it. Leave it where it is. Leave it \nwhere it is until Yucca is done in the year 2015.\n  I have extensively gone through an explanation of how many of our \nreactors would have to shut down, what percentage of the 22 percent \ntotal power generated by nuclear power contributes to this country. We \nhave reactors that are shutting down now. We have some that will shut \ndown next year. We are going to lose power in various States. Maybe we \ncan temporarily put that high-level waste in casks on the surface. But, \nremember, these areas were not designed for permanent storage. These \nreactors are in areas of population. They weren't designed to carry \nlong-term high-level waste in the adjacent areas surrounding them.\n  This needs to be in one place, not 80 sites. Nobody has come up with \na better site than the Nevada desert. So when we talk about the \nadministration's plan, there is no plan. During the confirmation of \nSecretary of Energy Pena, the best we could get was a commitment that \nthe problem of disposal of nuclear waste was ``in his portfolio.'' \nWell, that is a gracious acknowledgment. Of course it's in his \nportfolio; he's the Secretary of Energy. We have had no input from the \nadministration about what to do because the administration has yet to \nperform under the contractual agreement that is due next year. I \nsuppose it is a stacked deck, if I could respond to my friends from \nNevada. But it could be a stacked deck against West Virginia, or a \nstacked deck against Vermont, or a stacked deck against Alaska. But to \nleave it where it is, it is a stacked deck against 41 States. That \nsimply is not an alternative, Mr. President.\n  That is where we are in this debate today, and that is where we have \nbeen from the beginning. We wander in and out of concerns relative to \ncasks. Good Heavens, if American engineering can't develop casks \ndesigned to withstand whatever the threat is--if the British, the \nSwedes, the Germans, the Japanese and the French can do it, we can do \nit.\n\n  One more time, if I may, let me show you what has happened in this \ncountry. It speaks for itself. There is the transportation network, \n2,400 shipments. Do you think those were shipped in rubber bands? Those \nwere shipped, according to Federal and State law, in approved \ncontainers. To suggest that we don't have approved containers to ship \nout, we will get what we have to have. You are not going to build these \ncontainers and these casks until you have permission to move it. But \nthese are moving now in approved vessels, just as they would be if they \nare placed in a temporary repository at Yucca Mountain; they would be \nplaced in appropriate casks. They would either be within a cask, a \ntransportation cask, and removed out there, or left in a double cask, \nor put in a semipermanent cask.\n  So what we have here, Mr. President, is a lot of informed \nspeculation, which I guess this place has an abundance of, whether it \nbe spring, winter, or fall. But let's be honest with one another. Where \nwe are in this debate is to either leave it where it is or move it to \nNevada where, clearly, my friends don't want it moved. I admire their \nconviction, diligence and commitment. It is almost like they are \nwilling to lay their lives in the path of whatever movement is \noccurring on this side. But, unfortunately, that is just the way it is \nbecause there is no other alternative. I believe my friend from \nTennessee may want to speak a bit on the pending business. Am I correct \nin my assumption?\n  Mr. FRIST. Not right now.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I guess I am incorrect. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator from Tennessee waiting to speak now?\n  Mr. FRIST. I will just take about 3 minutes in 3 or 4 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. While the Senator is getting ready, I would like to say a \nfew things.\n  First of all, there is no question that the two Senators from Nevada \nare doing everything we can to protect the State of Nevada. But in the \nprocess of preparing, as we have for years, for this debate, we have \nalso come to the conclusion that this is not a Nevada issue; this is an \nissue for the well-being of all the people of this country. That is why \norganizations throughout this country support opposition to S. 104--\nchurches, environmental groups, and cities are passing resolutions.\n  The only supporters of this legislation are the very powerful nuclear \nindustry who generate electricity. For example, there has been some \ntalk in this debate that the facility in Connecticut, the Haddam Neck \nreactor fuel pool would be full by 2001 and the plant might have to \nclose. There has been testimony before the Natural Resources Committee \non February 5 that Haddam Neck permanently closed on December 4, 1996, \nfor reasons that had nothing to do with waste disposal issues.\n  Mr. President, fuel fill-up dates have been exaggerated for reactors \nthat have been examined. This is just all part of the game played by \nthe individuals who do not have rules--the nuclear power generating \ncompanies. They change the rules. They change the rules in the very \nmiddle of the ball game. They change the rules during timeouts. It \ndoesn't matter. Whatever meets their greedy financial interests they \nsatisfy that by changing the rules in the middle of the game.\n  Right now we have 109 operating reactors in the United States. All of \ntheir waste is stored on site. In effect, S. 104 would create 110 \nstorage sites for nuclear waste using the same technology that is \nalready used at some reactor sites and is available to all the reactor \nsites.\n  Why in the world would we want to create another site when we are \nspending $200 million a year trying to determine if Yucca Mountain is \nsuitable?\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question? I \nthought I heard the Senator say that if S. 104 is enacted we would have \nnot 109 reactor sites but 110 reactor sites. I invite the Senator's \nattention looking at this chart. If I understand the point he is trying \nto make, before S. 104 would be enacted--these would be the various \nreactor sites--every site prior to its enactment is still there and we \nadd one more at Yucca Mountain, or at the Nevada test site. So we have \n110.\n  Mr. REID. That is right. Although after S. 104, not only would you \nhave the additional site near Las Vegas, but in addition to that you \nwould have a\n\n[[Page S2982]]\n\nsignificant number of other temporary sites caused because of \naccidents, traffic jams, and protests. I mean that is what is not on \nthe bottom chart. Not only do we have the proposed temporary repository \nnear Las Vegas but you will have several temporary sites as a result of \nthe chaos that will ensue with this legislation.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Will the Senator agree that S. 104 holds out a false \npromise, that somehow, if it were enacted, everything would disappear \nand wind up near Las Vegas?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Nevada, we would have to show on \nthis chart after S. 104 massive traffic jams. Remember, to move it in \nGermany recently, it took 30,000 police. In addition to the 30,000 \npolice, it required medical personnel to haul the people to the \nhospital. Five hundred people were arrested. The waste only went 300 \nmiles. Think about what would happen if they were to move it 3,500 \nmiles from the State of Maine to the State of Nevada.\n  So I appreciate the question. The chart is very graphic and shows the \npotential danger of not having 109 sites but maybe having 125 sites \nbecause of what would occur as a result of moving this.\n  I repeat. Mr. President, if in fact these casks are so good, leave \nthem where they are. In fact, it has been said during the debate here \ntoday that the present technology of the casks indicate you can haul \nit, but in a crash of more than 30 miles an hour the container might be \nbreached, or if you had a fire that occurred as you are hauling that \nand the fire burns at more than 1,400 degrees you are in big trouble. \nAnd the big trouble would occur because diesel fuel burns at 1,800 \ndegrees. That is what propels trains and trucks.\n  So the question is asked all the time. What do you want to do with \nit? You leave it where it is until there is a determination made that \nwe can transport it safely and there is a site to accept it.\n  I also am compelled to respond to a number of things said earlier \ntoday by my friend from Idaho. In fact, the description was used of \npicking up a quart of milk at a store and taking it home. He said no, \nno. Nuclear waste is safer to transport than that. Well, try to explain \nthat to the people that have really transported nuclear waste. If you \nlook at what has gone on in this country, you will find that Japan is \nactively pursuing a nuclear program based on reprocessing of nuclear \nfuel with the aim of becoming energy independent. We understand why. \nThey have no natural resources. But the facts speak volumes of \ndifferent language. A serious accident at the Honshu breeder reactor, \nthe flagship of the Japanese reprocessing program, in December 1995, \nended all thoughts that Japan could breed its own nuclear fuel. Honshu \nto this day has not been restarted and probably will never restart.\n\n  A second serious accident at the Tokyo reprocessing facility in March \n1997, just a few weeks ago, ended all thoughts of reprocessing as a \nserious option, in Japan. In fact, Japan cannot site any new nuclear \nplants due to overwhelming public opposition. This fact has been \nacknowledged in numerous newspaper accounts. The Japanese Government is \nnow laying aside all hopes for nuclear expansion, and with reprocessing \nno longer a viable option Japan now faces a problem. But to think it \ncan be transported safely is just not true.\n  I would also respond to my friend from Idaho. There has been talk \nhere by him and others that there have been several thousand shipments, \na couple of thousand shipments of high-level nuclear waste made in the \nUnited States up to this date. Of course, these shipments, mostly of \nnaval reactor fuel, were not only far smaller than any shipment \ncontemplated under this bill but carried a radioactive inventory of \nthousands of curies rather than tens of millions of curies that would \nbe carried by each cask from a commercial reactor.\n  These shipments typically travel far fewer miles. There were seven \naccidents in these 2,400 shipments. A ratio of one accident for every \n343 shipments. I say to my friend from Nevada. It has been established \nhere that there has been one nuclear accident for every 343 trips. I \nask my friend. Is it not true that there is contemplated at least \n17,000 shipments of nuclear garbage under this bill?\n  Mr. BRYAN. The Senator from Nevada is correct; 17,000 shipments of \napproximately 85,000 metric tons, shipments that would occur over a \nperiod of several decades. So, in effect, what we would have, wherever \nyou live in America, nuclear waste would be streaming into your \ncommunity and into your State from virtually every point on the \ncompass, not just for a brief period of time but for decades as \ncontemplated.\n  Mr. REID. I also ask my friend. Then, if it has been established that \nthere would be 2,400 shipments and that we would have 7 accidents, a \nlittle math indicates to me that there would be about 50 accidents if \nthe same ratio is maintained hauling these 17,000 shipments. Wouldn't \nthat be about right?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I have never challenged the Senator's math. That was not \nthe subject that I either excelled in or like. But it seems to me that \nthe Senator is right. I remind my senior colleague that we had an \naccident, as I recall in 1982, in Livingston, LA. If we use a computer \nmodel to determine whether the proposed standards of these casks have \nno problem at all--these are casks not yet in existence but the \nproposed casks that would be used for this transit--that the \ntemperatures generated in that accident--not a nuclear accident--but \nthe temperatures were so high and so intense for such a long period of \ntime that the cask design would fail. That indicates that there would \nbe a release of radioactivity. That is not a theoretical, or \nspeculative, or conjectural accident. That is one that actually \noccurred. If one uses a computer model in terms of the standards being \nproposed for these casks, those casks would have failed. That means \nthose people in that community--I don't know the area--would have been \nplaced at considerable risk for an extended period of time.\n  So, as the Senator is suggesting, multiplying the number of accidents \nthat may occur over the course of several decades, many communities \ncould face that kind of exposure, and that is a legitimate concern, it \nseems to me, for each of us as we contemplate this very dangerous \nsituation.\n  Mr. REID. I ask my friend. On the maps that he has on the chart to \nhis left, contemplate with me, if he will, where he thinks the 50 \naccidents will be.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. I would say to my senior colleague, his guess is as good \nas mine. But we know this. We know that there are 43 States that have \ncorridor routes. I envy our friend from Alaska with whom we have been \nengaged in this debate over the last few days. He is fortunate that his \nState is not among them. But most of the rest of us are.\n  So this is not just a Nevada issue. You have 43 States. You have \nthousands and thousands of rail and highway miles involved. I remind my \ncolleague that we have 51 million people who live within 1 mile of \nthese rail and highway corridor routes. These are existing routes. \nNothing is going to be done new in the context of any construction, or \nan attempt to bypass communities. We are talking about existing rails \nand highway corridors.\n  So when the Senator asks the question of where those would be, may I \nsay with great respect--and not trying to be flip about it--throw a \ndart at the map of the lower 48 States in America and his guess and my \nguess would be as good as any that could be conjectured.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in short, S. 104 is bad policy. As I have \nindicated with this amendment, what is being done is a further attempt \nto worsen this bill. S. 104 is an environmental nightmare. It is a \nfinancial and public safety threat to America.\n  Is it any wonder that every environmental group in the United States \nsupports the defeat of S. 104? In addition to churches as has been laid \non the Record, transportation unions believe that this legislation is \ntruly a nightmare.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in support of the underlying \nlegislation, with one hesitation, and that is as it regards an \namendment introduced by my colleague from Tennessee on behalf of both \nof us about 45 minutes ago. I do not want to rehash the various points \nthat have been made thus far, but I would like to speak to the \nimportance of that amendment, the purpose of\n\n[[Page S2983]]\n\nwhich was to provide that the President shall not designate the Oak \nRidge Reservation in the State of Tennessee as a site for construction \nof an interim storage facility. The Oak Ridge Reservation is best known \ninitially for its history in the Manhattan project during the Second \nWorld War, but its evolution since that time has truly been amazing.\n  I had the opportunity to be there 3 days ago with my distinguished \ncolleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, and we really had a good \nexamination of the ongoing projects in Oak Ridge. Oak Ridge is not \nsimply a semi-idle nuclear site nor a remnant of cold war strategic \narms mission. But it is home now to our Nation's largest civilian \nnational lab, a functioning weapons stockpile stewardship and \nmanagement facility, and a variety of other user facilities for our \nnational research and development effort. As a physician by training, \nit is poised as a particular interest to me, and is really on the edge \nof some exciting breakthroughs in the life sciences in genetic \nresearch.\n  Oak Ridge simply would be an unwise location for storage of high-\nlevel waste from a purely environmental standpoint. I know earlier \nreferences were made in the debate talking about the fact that it had \nbeen recommended in the 1980's as a potential site, and that the courts \nstruck that down. But I think it is very important to say that, even \nthough those recommendations had been made in the 1980's, things are \nvery different today, in addition to the fact that they were struck \ndown.\n  It would simply be an unwise location from an environmental \nstandpoint. The area lies in a geological zone typified by what is \ncalled karst topography, which is distinguished by limestone bedrock \nwith water flowing through caverns and underground rivers very close to \nthe surface.\n  The danger here is that clearly any seepage into the groundwater \ncould potentially put into jeopardy the water supply of several States.\n  The reason I was not in the Chamber 30 or 40 minutes ago is that I \nwas chairing another hearing, and Dr. Arch Johnston, professor and \ndirector of research, center for Earthquake Research and Information at \nthe University of Memphis, testified just an hour ago to the fact that \nin the 1980's, because of concerns of earthquakes in that area, the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission undertook seismic studies, and over the \ncourse of that year they demonstrated that through that region of east \nTennessee--and it is called the southern Appalachian seismic zone--\nthere were earthquakes noted, but they were noted 2 miles deep and not \non the surface. Dr. Johnston said that this is a problem in this zone \nof the southern Appalachian region, which includes Oak Ridge, because \nyou cannot study it on the surface. Only two zones exceed its level of \nactivity, according to Dr. Johnston, with 90 percent of this is in east \nTennessee.\n  I say all this because the purpose of this amendment, especially in \nlight of this earlier recommendation in the 1980's, is to say that a \nlevel playing field would not be established because of the chance that \npeople would look back to that study and put Oak Ridge back on the \ntable, which was clearly inappropriate.\n  We have the geological arguments, we have the environmental \narguments, and I again will not go through the debate that was made by \nmy colleagues--we had the argument of population. Several million \npeople today live within a relatively short distance of Oak Ridge, and \nalthough that was not clearly true in 1942 when it was an locally \nisolated region, it today is within a metropolitan area of nearly a \nmillion people.\n  Thus, in summary, my colleague from Tennessee, Senator Thompson, and \nmyself have introduced this amendment, which says that the Oak Ridge \nreservation should not be considered as a site for the construction of \nan interim nuclear storage facility for environmental, geological, and \npopulation reasons.\n  I thank you very much. I will urge support of the underlying bill if \nwe can ultimately have this amendment attached.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we are somewhat optimistic that we are \ngoing to have a time agreement soon, and it is my understanding that \nthe leaders are addressing that matter now, so I hope to have some \ninformation for Senators very soon.\n  Let me make a few comments relative to accidents, which, of course, \nare of concern as we contemplate moving nuclear waste throughout the \ncountry. But let us take a look at facts because again we have been \ngraced with a good deal of informed speculation.\n  Let me refer first to the NEI fact sheet dated June 10, 1996, from \nthe Nuclear Energy Institute, an objective evaluation on the question \nof accidents. The question was: Have there been accidents that exposed \nthe public to radiation from spent fuel cargo? And the answer is on \nabsolutely no occasion between 1971 and 1989 has any person been \nexposed to radioactivity or radiation from spent-fuel cargo or \nassociated accidents.\n  Let us talk about the accidents, Mr. President, because this is what \nit is all about.\n  Seven accidents occurred in the movement of 2,400 shipments from 1979 \nto 1995 as indicated by the chart. None caused any release of \nradioactivity. The most severe of these, and it was severe, occurred in \n1971 in Tennessee. We just heard from the Senator from Tennessee. We \nhad a tractor trailer carrying a 25-ton spent-fuel shipping container \nswerve to avoid a head-on collision. It went out of control and \noverturned. The trailer with the container still attached broke free \nfrom the tractor and skidded into a rain-filled ditch. The container \nsuffered minor damage but did not release any radioactive material.\n  Now, how many chemical spills have we had where the tank car was \nbroken open or spilled or punctured in some way? The difference between \nthe two exposures are obvious. These are designed to withstand \naccidents, and they have. So again we can reflect on the rhetoric, but \nif we look at reality nothing is risk free, Mr. President, nor is \nnuclear transportation relative to high-level waste.\n  A lot of people assume that if there is a penetration, there is going \nto be a calamity of some kind. Obviously, there would be radiation. But \nwe have technology that addresses that radiation, just as it is \naddressed when the rods are taken out of the pools. You would think \nthere is some magic here. These nuclear rods sit in the pools. What are \nin the pools? Water. They come out of the pools. They are exposed. They \nare placed in a cask. There is exposure there, but it is regulated and \ncontrolled.\n  We have a statement by Mr. Robert M. Jefferson. Who is Mr. Jefferson? \nHe was manager of the Transportation Technology Center at the Sandia \nNational Labs in the early 1970's, distinguished in his knowledge and \nexpertise on the matter of transportation of high-level radioactive \nwastes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that his letter of July 16, 1996, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              Albuquerque, NM,\n\n                                                    July 16, 1996.\n     Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Energy and Natural Resources Committee, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murkowski: I have been informed that the High-\n     Level Radioactive Waste Bill (S-1936) will be considered on \n     the floor of the Senate this week. I have also been informed \n     that there are concerns about the resulting transportation of \n     spent fuel through various regions of our country. based upon \n     my work in this field over the past 35 years, this fear is \n     unfounded. Let me offer this information for your \n     consideration.\n       As Manager of the Transportation Technology Center at the \n     Sandia National Labs in the early 70s, I was asked, and \n     subsequently conducted an extensive testing program to both \n     validate the computational tools for evaluating spent fuel \n     shipping containers (casks) and to measure their performance \n     in real world situations. Up until I retired in 1985 Sandia \n     had conducted about 1,500 tests on shipping casks and their \n     sub-systems. Five of these tests were conducted on real casks \n     in simulated accidents. In addition, both DOE and NRC funded \n     studies to evaluate the historical experience and to develop \n     risk assessment models to predict shipping cask safety.\n       As a result of these efforts we reached the conclusion that \n     the transportation of spent nuclear fuel in casks designed to \n     meet the NRC standards, evaluated and certified by the NRC, \n     would never encounter a transportation accident severe enough \n     to challenge\n\n[[Page S2984]]\n\n     the integrity of the container. Specific among these studies \n     was a review of all severe transportation accidents in this \n     country which reached the conclusion that there has never \n     been an accident that would seriously threaten one of these \n     casks. Coupled with the historical experience in this country \n     and around the world I believe there is no safer \n     transportation activity ever undertaken.\n       Because transportation of spent fuels has been proven safe \n     by history, analysis and test and should not be a factor in \n     the consideration of this bill, and because of the importance \n     of this bill to the future of our country, I implore you to \n     pass this legislation as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Robert M. Jefferson,\n                                                       Consultant.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am just going to read the reference to the question \nof exposure on transportation. He is responding to the questions \nrelative to his area of responsibility in cask design and \ntransportation, and I quote:\n\n       As a result of these efforts we reached the conclusion----\n\n  And this is the National Sandia Laboratories----\n\n       We reached the conclusion that transportation of spent \n     nuclear fuel in casks designed to meet NRC standards \n     evaluated and certified by NRC would never----\n\n  Now, this is something----\n\n       Would never encounter a transportation accident severe \n     enough to challenge the integrity of the container.\n\n  This is a pretty broad statement by a professional who stands behind \nhis statement with his career.\n\n       Would never encounter a transportation accident severe \n     enough to challenge the integrity of the container.\n\n  Some of these accidents, I am told, involved flat tires. Well, I am \nnot going to get into all seven accidents.\n  One other reference, and that is to the Japanese situation.\n  Yes, there was a leak in the sodium liquid coolant associated with \nthe Honshu reactor in Japan. That reactor is currently shut down. \nAgain, like with all mechanical devices, accidents can occur. In this \nparticular case the accident was addressed by a professional procedure. \nNo one was exposed to radioactivity. And to suggest Japan is somehow \nabandoning its commitment to nuclear power defies reality.\n  Outside of Matsue, Japan, is a place called Rekosha. The Japanese are \ncommitted to spend $24 billion. I went in the plant. I physically saw \nit. It is absolute state of the art--$24 billion to initiate a fueling, \nreprocessing mox fuel facility which would be the most advanced in the \nworld. The reason the Japanese are pursuing this, they obviously have a \ngreat deal of sensitivity to nuclear radiation based on their \nunfortunate experience in the Second World War, but they feel nuclear \npower generation is appropriate for Japan. It addresses the concern \nthey have over air quality, and it addresses an economic concern they \nhave on dependence on oil from the Mideast. So they have made their \ndecision, Mr. President.\n  It is important that we keep facts in mind as we address where we are \nin this debate. Again, the debate boils down to my point: Nobody wants \nit. We have to put it somewhere. Unfortunately, Nevada seems to be the \nsite that has been selected for the permanent repository.\n  Mr. President, I am told that there is a colloquy pending which \nwould, I believe, wind up our side's discussion for now.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized for 3 minutes as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  MR. INHOFE. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Inhofe pertaining to the introduction of S. 556 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, for the benefit of all Senators, I am \nadvised by the leadership that we can expect a vote very soon on the \ndisposition of the Thompson amendment, followed by at least one vote on \nthe Bingaman amendment and a vote on the Bumpers amendment yet tonight.\n  Mr. BRYAN. May I inquire of my friend, it is my understanding, not at \nthe request of the Senators from Nevada, but my understanding that \nthere was at least a tentative understanding that we would not be \nhaving rollcall votes on these pending amendments until next week. \nMaybe there is some change.\n  I emphasize for the benefit of all Senators and my colleagues, that \nis certainly not at the request of the Senators from Nevada, certainly \nnot at the request of the Senator from Alaska, either. But if there has \nbeen a change, I think we need to make others aware of that.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I certainly concur with my friend from Nevada. I was \nadvised by our leadership that agreement has been proposed and, in \neffect, that is what the leader plans to do. I cannot comment relative \nto the position on the other side, but I think Senators should simply \nbe aware of the possibility, knowing the way this place works, seldom \ndoes the possibility occur. In reality, just the opposite may occur. \nFor anybody who is listening, that appears to be the intent of the \nleadership, at least as many as three votes yet tonight.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I would like to, if I may, utilize \nthis opportunity for a few moments to discuss this whole issue of S. \n104, the ramifications and some of the particulars of S. 104, and in \ndoing so, I would like to direct a few questions, if I may, to the \nchairman of the Energy Committee.\n  I also want to acknowledge that I think the Senator from Alaska, who \nis the chairman of the Energy Committee, and my colleague from Idaho, \nthe senior Senator, Senator Craig, have done a tremendous job on this \nlegislation.\n  Does this problem exists today? Absolutely. Are we trying to find a \nsolution? Well, we certainly should, and I commend the Senator from \nAlaska and the senior Senator from Idaho bringing forward what is a \nsolution.\n  With that, let me ask the chairman, is it true that in July 1996, the \nU.S. Court of Appeals affirmed the Department of Energy's contractual \nobligation to take title to the commercial spent nuclear fuel by \nJanuary 31, 1998?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator from Idaho is correct, the court made that \ndecision.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. And is it also true then, Mr. President, that the \nofficials at the Department of Energy decided not to appeal this \ndecision?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is my understanding the Department of Energy \nindicated that they would not appeal the ruling of the court.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. So we have an affirmation by the courts that title is \nto be taken by the Federal Government, and we have the Department of \nEnergy that has not sought to appeal that and, in fact, I remember, the \nAssistant Secretary of Energy, Tom Grumbly, had indicated the Federal \nGovernment is going to take title to this.\n  Is it also true that the Department of Energy has informed the \nutilities that it will not be able to meet its contractual and legal \nobligation to take title to this spent nuclear fuel as called for in \nthe court's ruling?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is my understanding. The Senator from Idaho, I \nthink, has projected the position very clearly, that is correct.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Is it also true that ratepayers and utilities across \nthe country have paid approximately $13 billion to the Federal \nGovernment to dispose of this waste?\n\n[[Page S2985]]\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator from Idaho is correct. It is a figure in \nexcess of $13 billion at this time.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. That has already been paid by the ratepayers.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator from Idaho is correct. It is my \nunderstanding it is going into the general fund. It does not remain in \nescrow. When the Federal Government takes the waste, they will probably \nhave to appropriate it.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I appreciate that. Is it true that utilities \ncurrently store spent nuclear fuel in temporary--I underscore \ntemporary--storage facilities that were never intended for long-term \nstorage?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. There are basically two types of storage. One is in a \npool adjacent to the reactor which is temporary and, in many cases, \nthat is full. At least one power company is beginning to store their \nfuel in casks on the surface, they simply have run out of space, and \nthe Senator from Idaho is correct in his assessment that those \nfacilities were not designed to be of a permanent or long-lasting \nnature, they were to be of a temporary nature pending the movement of \nthat out to a central site.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I further ask the Senator from Alaska, in light of \nthe Federal Government's failure to meet its contractual obligation, \nnumerous utilities across the country expect to run out of space, just \nas you have indicated, to store spent nuclear fuel in the near future. \nThese utilities have two options, as I understand it: they can either \nshut down operations or they can build additional storage space on \nsite. Are those the two options that currently exist?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator from Idaho is correct. However, it should \nbe noted that there may be limitations placed on any further storage \ncapacity associated with what they are currently licensed for, and that \nwould be a combination of Federal and State licenses that must be \nobtained. It is theoretically possible that there may be a \ndetermination that the areas are inadequate to store additional fuel \nand the reactors will have to shut down.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. To demonstrate, Mr. President, the fact this is a \nserious problem for many States, I ask the chairman of the Energy \nCommittee, is it true that many States, such as Vermont, Connecticut, \nMaine, New Jersey, South Carolina, Illinois, New Hampshire and \nVirginia, generate between 80 percent to approximately 50 percent of \nthe energy needed by their States through nuclear power?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator is correct. I think New Jersey is up \naround 70 or 75 percent dependent on nuclear power.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. And if utilities in these States are forced to shut \ndown nuclear powerplants because there is no place to put the \nadditional spent nuclear fuel, is it true that these States will have \nto look to alternative sources of energy which has been part of your \ndiscussion, such as perhaps burning coal, oil and gas to meet the \nenergy needs of these States?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator from Idaho is correct, there may be a \npossibility of purchasing excess energy from Canada, and some of the \nStates adjacent to the Canadian border. Clearly, there is not an access \nin those areas. It would have to be created.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I ask the Senator from Alaska, and point out the \nSenator from Alaska and my friend from Idaho, Senator Craig, have \nwarned the Senate, in light of the Department of Energy's admission \nthat it will not be able to meet its legal obligation to take title to \ncommercial fuel, the court may rule that the Federal Government is \nliable for the cost of storing this waste. Is it true that some \nestimates indicate that it may cost between $40 billion to $80 billion \nto store this waste?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is my understanding that the figure is in that \nrange of $40 billion to $80 billion. There was a more precise figure. \nIt was figured at about $59 million. I think it is important for the \nSenator from Idaho to note evidently there was a meeting recently \nbetween the Secretary of Energy and some representatives of the nuclear \npower industry where the Department of Energy offered to pay the \nnuclear power companies for storing the fuel at the sites of the \nreactors.\n  It is my understanding the industry declined to accept or pursue that \nproposal any further because it would simply leave the fuel in those \ntemporary areas and would not solve the problem of getting rid of the \nfuel. It would simply transfer, if you will, a funding mechanism. I \nthink it is rather ironic the administration would make that kind of a \nproposal when, clearly, the intent of Congress is to provide a \npermanent repository or, as this bill provides, a temporary repository \nuntil such time as Yucca Mountain is predetermined to be suitable.\n  So what they are doing is kind of, on the one hand, acknowledging \ntheir financial responsibility by offering to reimburse them, and \nacknowledging that they, in 1998, have to take title to the fuel but \nphysically not wanting to take it because they have no place to put it. \nThat is why I have been so critical of the administration's lack of any \nsubstantive suggestions on, as they opposed S. 104, what they are for, \nand they have yet to communicate to this Senator what they are for or \nwhat their proposal is relative to the immediacy of these reactors that \nare facing maximum capacity and potential shutdown.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I appreciate the response from the Senator from \nAlaska. Let me further ask, is it also true, in addition to the \ncommercial fuel we have been discussing, S. 104 will address the \nnational problem of naval fuel and defense high-level waste which is \nalso currently stored in temporary facilities across the country?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Also, as I read S. 104, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act \nof 1997, I see it will not interrupt the scientific assessment \nregarding the suitability of Yucca Mountain to serve as a permanent \nrepository for spent nuclear fuel. Indeed, is it true, I ask the \nSenator from Alaska, that under your bill, the Nevada test site is not \ndesignated as an interim storage site until after Yucca Mountain is \ndetermined to be suitable to serve as a permanent repository?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator from Idaho is absolutely correct. We would \nnot anticipate accepting fuel until into the year 2001 or possibly \n2002. So that verification must take place. So there would be the \nassurance that, indeed, Yucca Mountain would be closer to the reality \nof being a permanent repository.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. In fact, is it not true that S. 104 gives the \nPresident 18 months to designate another interim storage site if Yucca \nMountain is found unsuitable for a permanent repository?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator from Idaho is correct, and the reason for \nthat is, it was felt it was necessary to either have Congress address \nthe responsibility of a temporary repository at Yucca Mountain or the \nPresident designate it, and if the President chose not to designate it, \nit would be at Yucca Mountain.\n  What we have attempted to do by this legislation is basically close \nthe box so we simply could not walk out of here after a week of debate \nwithout a definitive solution to putting our waste, at least in a \ntemporary repository, until Yucca Mountain is done. And we spent a \ngreat deal of time discussing and fashioning the bill and felt it \nimperative that we had to conclude some solid solution as opposed to \nsimply finding ourselves going through an extended debate and leaving \nit where it is at 80 sites in 41 States.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. So just to reiterate, if it is determined that Yucca \nMountain is not to be the permanent repository, then this legislation \nwill not designate Yucca Mountain for the temporary repository, and, \ntherefore, the transportation of the nuclear waste would not be coming \nto Yucca Mountain?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Is it true that Senate bill 104 contains an amendment \noffered by Senator Craig which directs that at least 5 percent of the \nwaste shipped from storage sites shall be defense high-level waste?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator from Idaho is direct.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Is it true that under Senate bill 104 the interim \nstorage facility will be licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nand the Environmental Protection Agency and that they will establish \nthe radiation standards at the interim storage facility?\n\n[[Page S2986]]\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is my understanding.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Regarding the Nevada test site, I referenced this as \na member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. I am very familiar \nwith the important work previously done at this site.\n  For example, I believe the United States has conducted 100 \naboveground nuclear tests and 804 underground nuclear tests at the \nNevada test site.\n  So I ask the chairman of the Energy Committee, is this the location \nproposed to serve as the interim storage facility under the Murkowski-\nCraig bill?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator from Idaho is correct. That is the general \nlocation.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Regarding the Nevada test site, in the current fiscal \nyear, Congress provided $230 million to maintain the site for possible \nunderground nuclear tests. The President's budget requested $226 \nmillion for the test-readiness program at the Nevada test site in \nfiscal year 1998.\n  In June of this year, the Department of Energy will conduct the first \nof two planned tests called the subcritical tests in the underground \ntunnels at the Nevada test site. Now these subcritical tests, which \ncost over $15 million a test, combine high explosives and plutonium to \nhelp scientists verify the safety and reliability of our aging nuclear \nweapons.\n  I will point out that we currently have the oldest weapons arsenal in \nour history. These subcritical plutonium tests are compatible with the \ncomprehensive test ban and they are supported I believe by the Senators \nfrom Nevada.\n  I would acknowledge too that the Senator from Nevada, Senator Bryan, \nhad been a member of the Armed Services Committee. And I had the great \npleasure of working with him in the committee, and was sorry to see he \nhad transferred to a different committee.\n  But when we look at this, I would believe then, asking the Senator \nfrom Alaska, we would see the transportation, in order to carry out \nthese tests, of plutonium shipments to Nevada to carry out these tests; \nwould that not be correct?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator from Idaho makes a very valid point. \nObviously, it is going to be shipped in. And it will be shipped in a \ncontainer that obviously meets the Department of Defense criteria, \nenvironmental protection criteria, and the necessary criteria to ensure \nthat the shipment is done in a safe manner and the interests of public \nhealth and safety are addressed, as has been the case in numerous other \nshipments, some 2,400 in the last 15 years.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Finally, if I may ask the Senator from Alaska, \nregarding transportation standards, because that has been a great \nportion of this whole debate, is it true that Senate bill 104 maintains \nthe highest health and safety standards for the transportation of this \nnuclear waste to the interim storage facility?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator from Idaho is correct. It even provides \nfor the training of personnel.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Again, if Yucca Mountain is determined to be the \npermanent repository, this material will go to Yucca Mountain.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is correct.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. If it is determined that Yucca Mountain cannot be the \npermanent repository, then your legislation states that Yucca Mountain \nwill not be the temporary repository?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The President would then decide another location. And \nif the President chose not to decide, it would theoretically go back.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I wish to thank the Senator from Alaska.\n  I would like to say, Mr. President, that there is a problem that \nexists today. Clearly, this is not a debate of whether you are \npronuclear or antinuclear. You have hundreds of metric tons of nuclear \nwaste in over 40 States throughout the United States. We are looking \nfor a solution.\n  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997 offers the Nation a safe and \nscientific verified solution to the problem of nuclear waste.\n  The Murkowski-Craig bill says, build a safe, central facility to \nstore this waste at a place where our Nation has tested hundreds of \nnuclear weapons at the same location.\n  The other side says, leave the waste where it is, in facilities that \nwere not constructed for long-term permanent storage.\n  One side says, deal with this national problem. The other side says, \nlet us hope the problem goes away.\n  The Senate and the Nation face a clear choice, and that is to deal \nwith this problem. I appreciate the approach that the Senators from \nNevada have taken. I understand where they are coming from with regard \nto this issue. But I look at all of the nuclear technology, scientific \nresearch that has taken place in the State of Nevada over so many, many \nyears. Again the 100 above-ground nuclear tests, the 804 below-ground \nnuclear tests, and that this is the same area that is being discussed \nin Senate bill 104 for the temporary storage of this nuclear waste.\n  I commend the Senator from Alaska, Senator Murkowski, and the Senator \nfrom Idaho, Senator Craig, for bringing this issue forward so that we \ncan finally deal with it so that we can finally have a solution to what \ndo we do with spent nuclear fuel, because currently there exists no \nsolution. And to do nothing continues that problem of no solution.\n  I thank the Senator from Alaska and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my friend from Idaho for that excellent \ncolloquy.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Would the Senator from Idaho yield for a question or two?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Is the Senator from Idaho aware of the fact that there has \nnever been a contemplated interim storage facility at Yucca Mountain? I \nunderstood part of the colloquy, that the Senator was suggesting Yucca \nMountain as the site for the interim storage.\n  And my question to my friend from Idaho is, does the Senator from \nIdaho understand that there has never been a contemplated interim \nstorage facility at Yucca Mountain?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I understand that. I understand that Senate 104 \nopposes that nuclear storage.\n  Mr. BRYAN. That was not the case, I say with respect. What is \ncontemplated is interim storage at the Nevada test site. The Nevada \ntest site and Yucca Mountain are two separate geographical areas. And \nthe Senator was asking our distinguished chairman a series of \nquestions.\n  Does the Senator understand that if the President of the United \nStates makes no finding with respect to suitability by March 31, 1999, \nthen automatically the interim storage is designated at the Nevada test \nsite automatically?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is right.\n  Mr. BRYAN. And if the President of the United States makes a \ndetermination that Yucca Mountain is not suitable and submits to the \nCongress an alternative site other than the interim storage site at the \nNevada test site, that if the Congress refuses to accept the \nPresident's recommendation then automatically the interim storage comes \nto the Nevada test site?\n  I know the Senator was distracted, and I will repeat that.\n  My question to my friend from Idaho is, does the Senator understand \nthat if the President of the United States makes a finding that Yucca \nMountain is not suitable and then under the bill is directed to make a \nchoice of an interim storage site, that interim storage site must be \napproved by an act of Congress, and if the Congress does not approve \nthat site then automatically the Nevada test site becomes the interim \nstorage?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BRYAN. The point being is, that we do not have a site-selection \nprocess here that has any rationale.\n  And I guess the last question I would ask, because the Nevada test \nsite has been an area that has been used, as the Senator correctly \npoints out, for testing, is the Senator aware that the equivalency of \n85,000 metric tons of nuclear waste which would be stored would require \n2.3 million atomic tests the size of the test at Alamogordo during \nWorld War II--2.3 million tests?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Yes. To the Senator from Nevada, you are probably \nmore aware of those numbers than I am, so I would not respond to that.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I appreciate the Senator may not have that.\n  But the point that I think needs to be made--if the testing schedule \nat the\n\n[[Page S2987]]\n\nNevada test site should continue at its historical rate, it would take \nbetween 10,000 and 100,000 years of that testing schedule to equal the \nradioactive comparability of the nuclear waste that is being stored in \nthe Nevada test site. I just wanted to make that point.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I appreciate that point by the Senator from Nevada.\n  Again, based upon this very series of questions and discussion I have \nhad with the Senator from Nevada, it demonstrates there has been a \ntremendous history and knowledge over dealing with the nuclear issue in \nthe State of Nevada. The millions and billions of dollars that have \nbeen directed to the State of Nevada by the Federal Government to deal \nwith this Federal issue is well documented. And certainly Nevada has \ndemonstrated that it has the expertise that is there to deal with this \nissue and is well suited, I believe, to help solve the nuclear issue \nfor the Nation.\n\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. We have been here now for several days. Every question that \nhas been asked by the Senator from Idaho has an answer that is much \ndifferent than the answer given by my friend from Alaska.\n  The fact of the matter is, that there are hundreds of nuclear tests \nat the Nevada test site. That was part of the national security of this \ncountry. Nevada did not run with open arms ``bring these aboveground \nnuclear tests and kill all our animals, make people have cancer.'' We \ndid not know at the time. But in spite of it, all of the nuclear tests \ndescribed by my friend from Idaho created 5 tons of nuclear waste--5 \ntons. They are talking about moving 85,000 tons to Nevada.\n  This is not a Nevada issue. Our friends on the other side of the \naisle are trying to make this a Nevada issue. It is not a Nevada issue. \nIt is an issue that affects our country, this Nation.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if my friend would yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Of course.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am the first to acknowledge the probability of some \n5 tons of nuclear waste being exposed to the air, the land, moving in \nwhatever moisture that may take place in that arid area. But that is \nunlike the high-level nuclear waste that would be stored there in a \ntemporary retrievable repository. That waste would be enclosed in casks \ndesigned to omit no radioactivity outside the cask.\n  So I would point out to my friend that there is a significant \ndifference when you talk about 85 tons of contained waste in many, many \ncontainers that are designed to hold it with no exposed radioactivity \noutside and 5 tons of nuclear waste that just went up. It is in the \ndust. It is in the air. And that is indeed unfortunate. I think it does \nexpress a difference.\n  Mr. REID. I would just say that is why, because of the aboveground \ntests, there was radiation which went various places because of the \ncloud.\n  The fact of the matter is we all know such explosions are very \ndangerous. That is why they should continue the characterization at \nYucca Mountain until they find a safe place to dispose of this \ngarbage. The transportation is a problem, a significant problem. We \nhave established that, I think, with substantive evidence today.\n\n  Mr. President, suffice it to say we believe that the record is clear \nin answering every argument that has been suggested by the Senator from \nIdaho. I hope staff Members and Senators have had an opportunity to \nlisten to this debate. We are where we are today because the nuclear \npower industry is trying to short circuit the system. There is no \nreason to transport nuclear waste to an interim storage site until \nthere is a permanent repository. Even then, we have to be careful about \nthe transportation.\n  I do not want to go over the same arguments we have talked about on a \nnumber of occasions. It is my understanding there is to be a vote, and \nafter that the leaders, hopefully, will be able to propound a unanimous \nconsent request.\n\n\n                        Vote on Amendment No. 37\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Under the previous order, having consulted with both \nleaders, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now resume amendment \nNo. 37. It is my understanding we are ready to vote on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the question is on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 37, offered by the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Grams] \nand the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Hutchinson] are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad], \nthe Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], and the Senator from \nMinnesota [Mr. Wellstone] are necessarily absent due to the severe \ndisaster in their States.\n  I further announce that the Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein] \nis absent due to illness.\n  I also announce that the Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 60, nays 33, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 37 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--60\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--33\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Glenn\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Torricelli\n\n                             NOT VOTING--7\n\n     Boxer\n     Conrad\n     Dorgan\n     Feinstein\n     Grams\n     Hutchinson\n     Wellstone\n       \n  The amendment (No. 37) was agreed to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I express my concern for the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997. I first want to reiterate my firm \nbelief that a permanent geological repository represents the most \nresponsible solution for the ultimate disposition of spent commercial \nnuclear reactor fuel.\n  Presently, this radioactive material sits in temporary storage at 70 \nor so sites around the country, including my State, Colorado. Colorado \nalso has several tons of the much deadlier plutonium haunting Rocky \nFlats, less 20 miles from Denver. So, I am no stranger to nuclear \nmaterial, the related hazards and costs. Nor is my view different from \nthat of any other Coloradan, or citizen of any other State--I want \nsafe, efficient, responsible solutions to the questions presented by \nnuclear technology.\n  But S. 104 does not present a safe, responsible solution to the \nquestion of commercial spent fuel and I cannot vote for it. First, S. \n104 would make Denver the crossroads of radioactive material on an \nalmost daily basis for the next 30 years. S. 104 will send much of the \nspent fuel and high-level nuclear waste from eastern States traveling \nwest through Denver on I-70, while trans-uranic waste from Idaho will \ntravel south through Denver on I-25 to New Mexico.\n  Therefore, my first point of concern is that Colorado would bear the \nbrunt of the risks of truck and train accidents and the risks of \nradioactive releases almost every day, for the next 30 years. This \ngives me great pause. Only with the utmost confidence in the \ntransportation details--the routing plans, the casks housing the spent \nfuel assemblies, the emergency response\n\n[[Page S2988]]\n\npreparedness--would I feel comfortable subjecting the residents of \nColorado to this great burden. I do not have that confidence yet. In \nfact, for example, the Colorado Highway Patrol has indicated that I-70 \nwest of Denver is simply not suitable for the safe transportation of \nradioactive materials. Federal preemption through S. 104, however, \nthreatens to override the CHP's designation and force the use of the I-\n70 corridor anyway.\n  I do not mean to suggest that this is my only concern with S. 104, or \nthat this concern in and of itself would be sufficient to cause my \nopposition. If the bulk of S. 104 represented a sound, responsible \nsolution to an urgent national problem, then my analysis would be quite \ndifferent. S. 104 is not such a bill, however.\n  Although no one can deny the growing problem of spent nuclear fuel \nthroughout our country, the problem is currently not one of safety, but \none of cost. It costs the utilities and, therefore, the ratepayers a \nlot of money to store this material in temporary facilities. Again, \nColorado is not immune. Many Colorado ratepayers contributed to the \nnuclear waste fund, which was established to finance the permanent \ndisposal of this material, and must pay to maintain storage. But, by \nall accounts, safety is not an urgent issue for temporary, onsite \nstorage in Colorado or any other State. Were safety an \nurgent consideration at this point, again, my analysis would be quite \ndifferent.\n\n  What concerns me most, however, is the chronology of disposal in S. \n104. This bill requires that the Energy Department construct an interim \nstorage site 100 miles north of Las Vegas, NV, and begin accepting \nspent fuel and high-level nuclear waste well before the permanent \nrepository at nearby Yucca Mountain, NV, is licensed, or even found \nsuitable for permanent disposal.\n  Consequently, there is the very real danger that, even if the \npermanent site is for some reason deemed unsuitable for disposal of the \nspent fuel, it will be used anyway simply because the waste would \nalready be nearby at the interim site. Worst yet, there is the danger \nthat the material would remain at the interim site indefinitely. \nFinally, there is the haunting specter that if Yucca Mountain is not \nfound suitable as a permanent repository, all the spent fuel then \nstored at the interim site would have to be shipped back across the \ncountry--through Colorado again--to some other site.\n  I am sympathetic to the pressures bearing on the nuclear utilities \nand the ratepayers who have paid once already to have this material \ndisposed of and who must pay again to store this waste while Yucca \nMountain is prepared. I also understand that the Energy Department is \ncontractually obligated to begin removing the spent fuel from the \nStates by 1998.\n  But, the safe, responsible disposition of material that will remain \ndeadly for many tens of thousands of years is simply not like buying a \ncar. If it takes some years longer than anticipated, if it costs more \nmoney than we thought at first, so be it. In finding a safe place in \nwhich to keep this material for a time longer in duration than all of \nrecorded human history, 5, 10, even 20 additional years should not \ndeter us. In the context of radioactive waste, truly, I would rather be \nsafe, than sorry. These words point the way to a better approach to a \ndaunting national problem. S. 104 does not.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I address this body to express my support \nof S. 104, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997.\n  Today, I wish to address specifically provisions of the substitute \namendment introduced yesterday by the chairman, my colleague from \nAlaska.\n  Before I discuss the details of our substitute amendment, however, I \nwould like to set the backdrop for my remarks.\n  This week, while debating the motion to proceed, you have heard my \ncolleague from Alaska, the able chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, invite those who say they cannot support \nprovisions of this bill, S. 104, to suggest alternatives.\n  I hope all of my colleagues heard this invitation and I know some of \nmy colleagues accepted this invitation.\n  The provisions of our substitute are a product of this invitation, to \nparticipate with us in solving this national problem--the problem of \nspent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste, and how to address this \nproblem in a timely manner.\n  We have listened to those who have expressed concerns about this \nlegislation.\n  In our effort to continue and enhance the strong bipartisan support \nfor this legislation, our substitute addresses, point-by-point, the \nconcerns expressed by the other side.\n  Let me discuss these changed provisions.\n  First, we had heard concerns that the schedule outlined in S. 104 for \nthe development of an interim storage facility is unrealistic.\n  Mr. President, our substitute now extends the schedule for siting and \nlicensing of the interim storage facility: from the original proposal \nof the year 1999, we now have a facility operating in 2003.\n  But let me talk about why we have extended the schedule.\n  The interim storage facility will be licensed by fully exercising all \nprovisions of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing process.\n  We have extended the schedule for environmental reviews.\n  We have extended the schedule for public involvement in this \nlicensing process.\n  Let me repeat this.\n  We have heard allegations that S. 104 does not allow for public \ninvolvement.\n  Public involvement during licensing has always been part of the S. \n104 process for an interim storage facility.\n  By extending our schedule to 2003, there will be even more time and \nample opportunity for the public to participate in the licensing \nprocess.\n  Another provision that is changed by our substitute is that we have \nshortened the license duration--the operating period--of the interim \nstorage facility from 100 years to 40 years.\n  We have also provided that the amount of fuel and high-level \nradioactive waste stored in the interim storage facility will be only \nthat amount needed to fulfill the Government's obligations until a \npermanent repository is available.\n  Mr. President, we are not looking for a blank check on this facility.\n  We propose to build only what is needed to stem the Government's \nlooming financial liability under the lawsuit and the contracts signed \nin 1982.\n  We have accommodated our critics on their concerns regarding pre-\nemption of other laws.\n  Our substitute now contains language virtually identical to the \npreemption provision of the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act.\n  I hope this finally puts to rest the entirely misguided allegation \nthat this legislation will gut environmental laws.\n  That simply has never been the truth.\n  The language of our substitute on the issue of preemption requires \ncompliance with applicable environmental laws and hopefully puts this \nissue to rest.\n  Finally, our substitute revises the approach to setting an \nenvironmental standard for the deep geologic repository.\n  S. 104, as introduced, set a standard of 100 millirem.\n  On Monday, I addressed this body and set this 100 millirem in the \ncontext of everyday risks, from day-to-day living.\n  I noted for my colleagues that we receive an annual radiation dose of \n80 millirem simply from working day-to-day in the Capitol Building--a \nproduct of the granite and other building materials here.\n  We have listened, however, to the concerns that this legislation \nshould allow a risk-based standard.\n  We have heard suggestions that this legislation should adopt the \nrecommendations of the National Academy of Sciences.\n  As I have stated, in our openness to enhancing the broad, bipartisan \nsupport already enjoyed by this legislation, we have listened to these \nsuggestions.\n  Therefore, our substitute now requires that the Environmental \nProtection Agency determine a risk-based radiation standard for the \nrepository.\n  Our substitute directs that the Environmental Protection Agency set \nthis radiation standard in accordance with the National Academy of \nSciences recommendations.\n  Mr. President, I commend my colleague, the chairman of the Energy and\n\n[[Page S2989]]\n\nNatural Resources Committee, the Senator from Alaska, in conducting a \nprocess for developing this legislation, and this substitute, that I \nbelieve to be unprecedented in its openness and its willingness to hear \nand respond to the concerns of our opponents.\n  When this substitute and the Committee amendments are considered in \ntheir totality, I can firmly state that this legislation will \ndecisively deal with the issue of spent nuclear fuel and high-level \nradioactive waste, and it will deal with this issue in the most \nstringent, most safe, and most environmentally sound manner.\n  S. 104, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997, will allow the \nGovernment to fulfill the contractual obligation it assumed, under the \nlaw passed by this body in 1982.\n  The deadline for action on this obligation is just 9 months away.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider thoroughly the changes made by this \nsubstitute, to consider the basis for any concerns they may have had.\n  I assert that, with these changes, there simply are no possible \nreasons for any action other than support of final passage of S. 104.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, for the benefit of all Senators, it is \nmy understanding that we very likely can dispose of three amendments in \nthe balance of the evening. One, as I understand it, is going to be \noffered by Senator Bumpers from Arkansas. I might ask how much time he \nwill require.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I suggest 20 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will accept that. A Bingaman amendment, we \nanticipate--we are not sure the Senator is on the floor at this time. \nWe will have to wait for Senator Bingaman. And we have a Domenici \namendment that we are prepared to take on this side. I believe there \nmay be an objection from the other side. That could be held over until \nMonday. One of the Domenici amendments we are prepared to take at this \ntime.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Can we do that now?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will take Senator Bumpers while he is in the mood. \nSenator Bingaman, as I understand, has agreed to 20 minutes on either \nside, so 40 minutes total. That gives you an idea of what to anticipate \nfor the remainder of the evening. We anticipate two votes.\n  I will ask unanimous consent that the time on the Bumpers amendment \nNo. 33--might I ask if I heard the Senator from Arkansas correctly, \nthat he wanted 2 minutes?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I said 20 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thought the Senator said 2 minutes. I ask unanimous \nconsent for the following agreement: That the time on the Bumpers \namendment No. 33 be limited to 20 minutes with no second-degree \namendments, equally divided, and that the time on the Bingaman \namendment be limited to 40 minutes----\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Make that 30 minutes, and I will take a little less.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Thirty minutes equally divided, and that no second-\ndegree amendments be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I do so \nonly to suggest that we stack the two votes and that they be held no \nlater than 6:45.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me make sure I understand what the \nchairman and the Democratic leader are working on here. We have two \nremaining votes here, and we would stack those at 6:45. Is the \nrecommendation both of those votes at 6:45?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Or earlier.\n  Mr. LOTT. Then that would only leave for consideration next week two \namendments on Monday, and we would have stacked votes. Are we ready to \nenter into this agreement?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is my understanding that we would have the two \nWellstone amendments pending on Monday, and we would have one Domenici \namendment, which is still in disagreement--\n  Mr. BRYAN. I believe we are going to be able to resolve this in a \nminute or two.\n  Mr. LOTT. I want to pursue the details of what would be left. It is \nmy intent that we have no more than three votes stacked on Tuesday \nmorning. We will need to work out the final agreement. I have no \nobjection to these two votes at 6:45.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I think it would be helpful if, in the \nnext 45 minutes, we worked out the final arrangement for the vote to be \ntaken on Tuesday. I amend my request to see if we can finish the votes \nat 6:30. I think if you take the time both Senators require, we could \naccommodate the Senators and still finish by 6:30. I amend my request \nin that regard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the majority leader respond in reference to the \npending question relative to Mr. Pete Peterson's confirmation as \nAmbassador to Vietnam?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, is this under a reservation, reserving the \nright to object?\n  Before I respond to that, Mr. President, if I could direct a question \nto the Democratic leader, to make sure I understand again what he is \nsaying, is that all debate will be concluded at 6:30.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is correct on the two amendments.\n  Mr. LOTT. That the vote begin.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. At 6:30.\n  Mr. LOTT. And, further, that all votes be concluded by a specific \ntime?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. No.\n  Mr. LOTT. Strictly at 6:30 we would vote. That is fine. I have no \nobjection to that.\n  With regard to the question, we are still working on trying to get \nfinal clearance on the Pete Peterson nomination to be ambassador. I am \nhoping that while we are having this final debate and getting the vote \non these issues that we will be able to bring that to the floor for \nconsideration this afternoon possibly on a voice vote. But depending on \nwhen we get done, it may require some time and a recorded vote. I \nbelieve we can get it up tonight. If we run into a snag on this \nagreement, it would be our intent then to try to do it during the day \nTuesday, probably. I would like to do it tonight. We are working on it. \nWe have asked the administration for some information that is critical. \nI believe we will have a response in the next 4 hours.\n  I thank the minority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, if I might engage the chairman of the \nEnergy Committee, on the two Domenici amendments, Senator Reid and I \nhave no objection. We are prepared to accept those.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I advise my friend from Nevada that one of amendments \nis satisfactory to us. We have a second degree on the second amendment \nwhich has been worked out I believe with the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Is the Senator aware of the second degree?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I am not. No. I am not aware of a second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. We would be happy to provide you with that. But in the \ninterest of moving this now, we will move the one that there is no \nobjection to.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 40 to Amendment No. 26\n\n (Purpose: To prevent ``double counting'' in the determination of the \n                                  fee)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 75, strike lines 4 through 8 and insert:\n       ``It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       ``(1) the Department of Energy has entered into contracts \n     with utilities for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel or \n     high-level radioactive waste, under section 302(a) of the \n     Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, based on the standard \n     contract in subpart B of 961 of title 10, Code of Federal \n     Regulations;\n       ``(2) the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of \n     Columbia Circuit, in Indiana Michigan Power Company v. DOE, \n     has interpreted the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to \n     require the Department of Energy to start disposing of the \n     utilities' spent nuclear fuel no later than January 31, 1998;\n       ``(3) the Department of Energy cannot begin to receive and \n     transport significant amounts of spent nuclear fuel by \n     January 31, 1998, because of delays arising out of causes \n     beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the \n     Department of Energy, including the following acts of \n     Government in its sovereign capacity--\n       ``(A) the failure of Congress to appropriate funds \n     requested by the Department in order to proceed expeditiously \n     with--\n       ``(i) the characterization and development of the Yucca \n     Mountain site, and\n       ``(ii) the design and development of associated systems \n     required to transport spent nuclear fuel;\n       ``(B) the enactment by Congress, since 1982, of additional \n     environmental statutes affecting the process of designing and \n     licensing the repository;\n       ``(C) the failure of the Environmental Protection Agency to \n     meet statutory deadlines in section 801 of the Energy Policy \n     Act of 1992 for the promulgation of radiation standards for \n     the Yucca Mountain site; and\n       ``(D) delays on the part of the State of Nevada in issuing \n     permits necessary for the Department to initiate exploratory \n     activities at the Yucca Mountain site;\n       ``(4) the enactment of this Act is intended by the Congress \n     to address the Department's inability to meet the January 31, \n     1998, deadline and to provide an adequate remedy to contract \n     holders by ensuring that the Department meets its obligations \n     under the contracts in paragraph (1) at the earliest \n     practicable time, consistent with the requirements of the \n     National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) \n     and applicable Commission regulations; and\n       ``(5) in any action alleging failure by the Department to \n     perform its obligation to start disposing of spent nuclear \n     fuel by January 31, 1998, under a contract based on the \n     standard contract in subpart B of part 961 of title 10, Code \n     of Federal Regulations, the court should take due account of \n     article IX(A) of such standard contract.''.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this is fairly simple and will only take \nabout 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, last July a D.C. circuit court ruled that the Waste \nPolicy Act of 1982 required the Department of Energy to take the \nutilities' nuclear waste in 1998. The utilities and the public service \ncommissions brought two separate actions, and the court consolidated \nthem. They argued that DOE was clearly under an obligation to take this \nwaste in 1998. And the court ruled in their favor saying--this is good \nnews for my adversaries on this amendment--``In conclusion, we hold \nthat the petitioners' reading of the statute comports with the plain \nlanguage of the\n\n[[Page S2991]]\n\nmeasure. * * * Thus, we hold that section 302(a)(5)(B) creates an \nobligation in DOE, reciprocal to the utilities' obligation to pay, to \nstart disposing of the [nuclear waste] no later than January 31, \n1998.''\n  You may think that the utilities have all the best of it as a result \nof that decision, and they may very well have. But as you know, there \nis a case pending now in the D.C. Circuit in which the utility \ncompanies are seeking a judgment seeking to have the fees that they are \npaying put in escrow. I am not sure what they get out of that. But the \npurpose of this amendment is very simple. The District of Columbia \nCircuit right now has this action of the utility companies under \nconsideration. As I said, the utility companies are asking that the \nfees they are paying, which is hundreds of millions of dollars a year, \nbe put in escrow. And in my opinion, in order for the court to rule on \nthat, the court is going to have to again look at the contract--not the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act, which they interpreted in last July's \ndecision--bear in mind we are talking about two different lawsuits. \nLast summer, in July, the court was interpreting the Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act of 1982. This time, in my opinion, they have to look at the \ncontract and see if the contract that was negotiated pursuant to that \nact requires the Department of Energy to take this waste.\n  So here is my amendment. It is written in the mother tongue, which is \nin English, so everybody here ought to be able to understand it. This \nis a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. It states that it is the sense of \nthe Senate that the Department of Energy's failure to meet the January \n1998 deadline was caused by Congress' failure to appropriate funds the \nprogram needed and other Government actions beyond DOE's control, and \nthat the court should take the contract's provisions on excusable \ndelays into consideration when it rules on the pending lawsuits.\n  As I said, that is the mother tongue, and it is not hard to \nunderstand. Look at the contract. See what the contract says. Is the \nUnited States, or the Department of Energy, under the terms of the \ncontract, excused for its inability to take this waste in 1998? Bear in \nmind that court last summer did not find DOE liable for a breach of \ncontract. A breach of contract is the failure without a legal excuse to \nperform the contract. All you brilliant lawyers here understand that. \nWe have a contract. That is what the court is going to be construing. \nThis is a sense of the Senate calling to the court's attention some \nlanguage that was in the contract. And I have not heard this debated \none minute since this debate started. The question is, was there a \nfailure to have a permanent repository ready to take this waste in \n1998? Was that their fault? I submit that it was not. But that is not \nwhat we are debating here. That is my opinion. My opinion is, and I \nreally defy anybody to say otherwise, that the reason they didn't have \nit ready is because the Government didn't appropriate the money fast \nenough to do it.\n  Listen to this. Here is what the contract says. The Government will \nnot be liable ``for damages caused by a failure to perform its \nobligations'' under the contract ``if such failure arises out of causes \nbeyond the control and without the fault or negligence'' of DOE.\n  That is simple enough. Anybody can understand that. The contract goes \non to state that ``acts of the Government''--that is us, colleagues--\n``acts of the Government'' that ``cause delay in scheduled acceptance \nor transport'' of utility waste shall be an excusable failure by the \nDepartment of Energy.\n\n  It says that DOE shall notify the utilities of such a delay and ``the \nparties will readjust their schedules, as appropriate, to accommodate \nsuch delay.''\n  I don't know how many lawyers there are in the U.S. Senate. But I \npromise you there isn't a lawyer here worth the powder of blowing you \nknow where that hasn't had cases exactly like this. All contracts \nprovide for excusable delays. What do you do if you have a delay that \nis beyond your control? What if you have a tornado blow a project away \nwhile you are right in the middle of it? Normally you would have \ninsurance to cover that. That is normally covered by contracts. Here \nthey simply say, if there is any justifiable reason for the DOE not \nbeing ready to take this fuel in January of 1998, that is a legitimate \nexcuse and that includes actions by the Government, and the actions of \nthe Government was we didn't appropriate the money to get the \nrepository built. Now the utilities are coming in and saying, ``We \ndon't care about the language of the contract. We want you to take it, \nor put our money in escrow.''\n  There have been all kinds of figures. I am not going to debate the \namount of money involved here. I have heard a lot of figures thrown \naround about what this is going to cost the Government by not taking \nthis spent fuel, and those figures are so exaggerated, if you look at \nthe details of what the cost is likely to be, it is exaggerated by a \nmagnitude of about 300 percent.\n  But it is not correct for Senators on the floor of the U.S. Senate to \nsuggest--indeed, openly state, as I heard some do--that this is already \na done deal and that DOE has already been found liable. That is not \ntrue. The contract is now under consideration by the U.S. Court of \nAppeals in Washington, DC. I submit to you that if anybody is to blame \nit is us. We are the ones who kept DOE from being prepared to take \nthis.\n  So, Mr. President, I think it is only appropriate. After all, we are \nnot trying to interfere with the judicial proceedings. We are simply \nsaying it is a sense of the Senate that this language which I just read \nto you should be very carefully considered by the court. There not only \nis not nothing wrong with that, there is everything in the world right \nabout it. And the court is going to interpret the contract, and here is \nthe clear language of it.\n  I say in my sense-of-the-Senate amendment that the court should take \nthe contract's provisions on excusable delays into consideration when \nit rules on the pending lawsuit.\n  Why wouldn't it? DOE didn't put that language in there just to make \nthe contract a little longer. They put it in there so that they would \nhave an out if there was an excusable delay. There has been an \nexcusable delay. All I am saying is it is the sense of the Senate that \nwe ought to call that to the attention of the court.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I appreciate the persuasive arguments \nof my friend from Arkansas who is a well-known lawyer. I happen to be a \nbanker and not nearly as well known. But I know what a contract is. A \ncontract is a binding commitment of performance. And the question that \nthe Senator from Arkansas raises in his amendment is the sanctity of \nthat contract. This is a subject of pending litigation. I think it is \ninappropriate to interfere in the sanctity of the Federal contracts. We \nhave a fair administrative process. The courts are involved in this. I \nthink it is important to look at a little history because the \nDepartment of Energy has been aware of its obligation since 1982.\n  My reading of the Bumpers amendment suggests that it is essentially \nrepresenting a determination now by Congress that the Department of \nEnergy is faultless in its default. I think it is the court's job to \nmake that determination. In my opinion, the Department of Energy has \nfollowed a consistent course of delay, a consistent course of avoidance \nincluding their failure to ask Congress for any additional funds or \nauthority needed to meet the obligation.\n\n  The Senator from Arkansas suggests that it is the responsibility of \nthe Congress because Congress did not appropriate any money. I am not \naware that the Department of Energy ever asked for any money.\n  Let us look at the history because I hope that my colleague from \nArkansas, when he clearly listens, will agree that this legacy of \nbroken promises is something that is reprehensible relative to a \nresponsible department addressing its contractual commitment. I think \nit sets, if you will, a norm on the issue of contracts. If a contract \nwith the Government is not binding, it sets a pretty poor example, a \npretty poor example for youth and a pretty poor example of how \nGovernment meets its obligations.\n\n[[Page S2992]]\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the Senator from Alaska yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I would be happy to yield for one question.\n  Mr. FORD. I just want to make one thing clear, and I am not a lawyer, \nnot even a famous banker.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That takes care of both Senators.\n  Mr. FORD. That takes care of both. I understand the Senator from \nAlaska says a contract is binding, but the content of the contract is \nwhat binds you. Therefore, if the contract says certain things, you are \nbound to what the contract says. I think the Senator is evading, in my \njudgment, the content of the agreement.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I appreciate the views of my friend from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. And this is from both Senators.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I think it is the responsibility of the court to make \nthe determination of what the contract says, not the Senator from \nArkansas or the Senator from Alaska or the Senator from Kentucky. And \nthat is what the court has done. And if the Senator will bear with me \nwhile I go through the history, I think he will agree.\n  Mr. FORD. But we have every obligation, because we pass the law, to \nbe sure that the legislative language, the legislative history is \nunderstood by the courts also.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I would certainly agree with my friend from Kentucky, \nand I hope he will agree after a short review of the history that that \nis exactly what happens.\n  Let me give you my version of the record because it goes back to a \nlegacy of broken promises starting in 1984. We had a commitment, a \nclear promise by Don Hodel, then Secretary of Energy, affirming that \nthe Energy Department is obligated to begin accepting spent nuclear \nfuel from nuclear powerplants in 1998 whether or not a permanent \ndisposal facility is ready.\n  Now, we went on a few years and got into 1987, a 3-year delay. \nCongress then, this body, designated Yucca Mountain, NV, as the only \nsite to be evaluated. Meanwhile, the Department of Energy announces a \n5-year delay in the opening date for a disposal facility from 1998 to \nthe year 2003. They did not ask for any money. They did not mention \nmoney. They simply announced a 5-year delay in the opening day.\n  In 1989, another delay, another promise. The Department of Energy \nannounces another delay in the opening date for a permanent disposal \nfacility until the year 2010. We are told now, of course, by the most \nrecent Secretary of Energy, Hazel O'Leary, that that cannot be ready \nuntil the year 2015.\n  We went on in 1991 with mounting concerns. The first sign of concern \nappears over the Energy Department's ability to meet its obligations \nunder the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. The State of Minnesota tells the \nEnergy Secretary, James Watkins, that it is ``highly probable that your \ndepartment will experience significant delay in meeting its obligation \nto begin taking high-level radioactive waste in 1998.'' Nothing about \nmoney.\n  So we move into 1992. More promises. Secretary Watkins tells \nMinnesota's DOE, and I quote, ``The DOE is committed to fulfill the \nmandates imposed by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. The department has \nsound, integrated programs and plans that should enable us to begin \nspent fuel receipt on an MRS, a monitored retrievable, storage facility \nin 1998.''\n  We move to December 1992, another promise. Energy Secretary Watkins \nacknowledges that attempts to find a volunteer host for an MRS facility \nhave not succeeded. He promised to do whatever is necessary to ensure \nthat the Energy Department is able to start removing spent fuel from \nnuclear power sites in 1998.\n  I do not know what my friend would think of the moral obligation, but \nit is interesting to note that Secretary O'Leary in May 1993 affirms \nthat the Energy Department ``has an obligation'' to electric utilities \nand their customers. ``If it does not have a legal obligation, then it \nhas a moral obligation.'' That really does not mean much other than \nacknowledgement of just a moral obligation.\n  But in May 1994 there was a notice of inquiry. DOE published a notice \nof inquiry to address the concerns of affected parties regarding the \ncontinued storage of spent nuclear fuel at reactor sites beyond 1998. \nThe energy agency says, ``Preliminarily, it's our view that it does not \nhave a statutory obligation to accept spent nuclear fuel in 1998 in the \nabsence of an operational repository or suitable storage facility.''\n\n  That is the first time they denied, if you will, that they had a \nstatutory obligation to accept the spent fuel.\n  Well, then we move over to May 1994 and 14 utilities and 20 States \nbring suit to the Department of Energy. A coalition of 14 utilities and \npublic agencies in 20 States file separate but similar lawsuits seeking \nclarification of the Energy Department's responsibility to accept spent \nfuel beginning back in 1998.\n  Then we go to April 1995. No obligation to take the fuel, the \nDepartment of Energy says. No obligation on the one hand. Previously, \nthey said they did not have a statutory obligation. In April, they said \nthe Federal Government has no legal obligation to begin accepting high-\nlevel waste in 1998 if a repository is not open, according to the DOE's \ninterpretation of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and contracts with \nutilities. Still no mention about funding.\n  In July 1996 we have a different view, a very different view. In July \n1996 the court ruled, and this is the U.S. Court of Appeals, that the \nDepartment of Energy's obligation to take the fuel in 1998 is a legal \nas well as a moral obligation. So there we have the dictate of the \ncourt, which I think addresses the concern of the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  In December 1996, the Department of Energy does not challenge the \ncourt's ruling and admits failure. The DOE acknowledges that it will \nnot be able to meet its commitments to take the waste in 1998.\n  In January 1997, the DOE's liability is addressed and 46 State \nregulatory agencies and 33 electric utilities file new action for \nescrow of nuclear waste funds and to order the DOE to take the spent \nfuel in 1998.\n  In March 1997, the court rejects the Department of Energy's motion to \ndismiss before it is filed.\n  So that is the last legal action. The court tells the DOE that a \nmotion to dismiss would be ``inappropriate in this case'' and sets the \ncase for damages for a hearing on the merits.\n  Mr. President, a deal is a deal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 41 to Amendment No. 26\n\n(Purpose: To strike all provisions relating to special consideration of \n            potential sites for an interim storage facility)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I understand it is appropriate at this \npoint for me to send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 41 to Amendment No. 26.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 28, strike the second sentence of section \n     204(c)(2).\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in order to describe what this amendment \ndoes, let me first just give my colleagues the context, the way this \nbill is structured so they understand what we are talking about here.\n  Under this bill, the way it is pending before us, we have the \nSecretary of Energy proceeding to go forward and study and analyze the \nappropriateness of using the Yucca Mountain site as a permanent \nrepository and doing what is called the viability assessment to decide \nwhether Yucca Mountain is going to be the right site, or an appropriate \nsite.\n  If the Department of Energy, the Secretary of Energy, advises the \nPresident and the President determines that Yucca Mountain is not a \nproper site, then at that point we go to plan B, and plan B says that \nthe President then has 18 months in which to choose another interim \nsite for the waste except that under the bill the way it now stands \nafter the last amendment and previous amendments that were adopted, he \ncan\n\n[[Page S2993]]\n\nchoose another site with some exceptions.\n  The exceptions are, first, the President shall not designate the \nHanford Nuclear Reservation in the State of Washington as a site for \nthe construction of an interim storage facility. The second exception \nis that he shall not designate the Savannah River site and any of \nBarnwell County in the State of South Carolina. And, of course, we just \nadopted an amendment saying that he shall not designate the Oak Ridge \nreservation in the State of Tennessee.\n  Mr. President, what this amendment does that I am offering right now \nis say let us strike those exceptions. If in fact the President \ndetermines that Yucca Mountain is not the right site for a permanent \nrepository, then we ought to all be in this thing together and the \nSecretary and the President should have full discretion to designate \nwhatever site they want. Otherwise, Mr. President, I as a Senator from \nNew Mexico have to answer the question from my constituents, why didn't \nI stand up and get some exceptions added for New Mexico.\n  For example, everyone in my State knows that we have a nuclear waste \nsite being constructed in New Mexico and not too far from being opened, \nthe WIPP site, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plan. Why didn't I stand up \nand offer an amendment to exclude the WIPP site? That would be a very \nlogical thing to do.\n  If I were representing Colorado, I think the citizens of Colorado \nwould have a very legitimate question that they could put to me: Why \ndidn't you, Senator, stand up and move to exclude Rocky Flats? That is \na contaminated site, just as contaminated as Hanford, just as \ncontaminated as Savannah River. Rocky Flats certainly should be on the \nlist of excluded sites.\n  If I was representing Idaho, why haven't I excluded the Idaho site? \nThere is great concern in the State of Idaho about the possibility of \nnuclear waste remaining in that State. Ohio, the mound site. There has \nbeen a lot of concern about contamination of the mound site. How could \na Senator representing the good people of Ohio explain to them why that \nsite was not also excluded? What about Florida? We have the Pinellas \nsite there which was a manufacturing site for components for nuclear \nweapons. Why haven't we excluded that site?\n  I would ask how any Senator here could stand and explain to their \nconstituents why we have not excluded all Superfund sites. Superfund \nsites would be very logical sites for the President to choose as an \nalternative to this Nevada site if in fact the President has to make \nthat determination.\n  What about shutdown military bases. Why shouldn't we exclude them? \nThere is a real danger in many of our States--we have been fortunate in \nNew Mexico. None of our military bases have been shut down, but there \nare many States in the country where military bases have been shut \ndown. If I was representing one of those States, I would want to be \nsure that shutdown military bases were not on the list that the \nPresident could choose from.\n  So, I think I have made the point fairly clear that it is very hard \nfor me to explain to people in my State why I am opposed to putting \nwaste in Tennessee, I am opposed to putting waste in South Carolina, I \nam opposed to putting waste in Washington State, but I do not mind \nputting it in our State. That is a very difficult argument to make.\n  So my amendment would say, look, let us eliminate the exceptions. Let \nus recognize that there is a certain amount of risk involved in the \nlegislation we are passing. The risk says if we determine, if the \nPresident determines, down the road that Yucca Mountain is not to be \nchosen, then we are all in this thing together and everyone is in the \nbarrel. We cannot just say this State is out, that State is out, the \nother State is out, and the other 47 are in the barrel.\n  I think that is only reasonable. I know we have a lot of so-called \nNIMBY amendments around the Congress--``not in my backyard'' is a NIMBY \namendment. We have three NIMBY amendments stuck in this bill so far. I \nam just wondering why we do not have 47 additional ones stuck in here \nso we can exclude all 50 States, if we are going to exclude 3. So my \namendment would say let us eliminate the three that are there. If we \nare going to go down this road, if we are going to adopt this bill, if \nwe are going to give the President discretion to choose an alternative \nsite, let us give him discretion to choose an alternative site wherever \nhe determines or she determines it makes sense to put this waste.\n  That is the sum and substance of the amendment. To me it is \nstraightforward. It is good government. It is good politics for any of \nus who represent States other than the three that are now excluded. I \nhope very much my colleagues will support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, if I may make a correction regarding \nwhat I believe is the intent of my friend from New Mexico. It does not \nexclude a State, but it does exclude sites. My State of Alaska has had \nthe experience of two underground nuclear explosions, the two largest \nthat have ever occurred. That is the limitation of our experience. I \ncannot speak for Senators from the State of Washington or Oregon. \nSenator Wyden, as you know, felt very strongly about eliminating the \nHanford site. He explained his rationale to me, that Hanford was still \nreceiving substantial quantities of waste associated with reactors that \nhad been cut up from the submarines, coming up the Columbia River. I \nhope he comes to the floor and speaks for himself, but on this matter \nhe explained that he felt that Hanford had taken enough waste and \nHanford is the largest current holder of spent nuclear fuel in \ninventory in tonnage, approximately 2,133 tons. Whether that satisfies \nthe Senator from New Mexico, I do not know.\n  Savannah River, SC, Senator Thurmond and Senator Hollings felt very \nstrongly about the continued responsibility of the Savannah River \nfacility to take additional waste, wastes coming in from Europe at this \ntime, waste that is being vitrified. They have approximately 206 metric \ntons.\n  At Oak Ridge, in Tennessee, Senator Frist and Senator Thompson have \nindicated their concern. They currently have 46 tons of spent nuclear \nfuel.\n  Whether those sites can be construed as different, I think you could \nprobably make a case, from the situation in your State--but I cannot \nspeak for your State and I will not. The only thing I can say is this \nis spent nuclear fuel. The theory, as the Senator knows, of this \nprocess of everybody coming in and eliminating his State could progress \non this floor. We could go through 47, 48, 49--whether we would get \nthem all and come full circle, I do not know. But I can express that \nthese sites have major cleanup operations ongoing, unlike other sites. \nThe Department of Energy is spending literally billions of dollars to \nattempt to stabilize these wastes. I have been out to Hanford. I have \nseen the efforts out there to generate the technology, to get the \ndestabilized waste out of the tanks. Some of those tanks are believed \nto be unstable and leaking.\n  I have seen the efforts at Savannah to recover the liquid waste from \nthe tanks. The spent fuel is in pools and corroding. I have seen that \nphysically. They claim they have a priority. I cannot make that \nscientific judgment. But the Senators from those States are obviously \nconcerned that these sites cannot handle the new job of dealing with \nmore commercial fuel and continuing their obligation to clean up sites \nthat have not been properly taken care of. So I think, if I can perhaps \nexpress the argument which I assume prevails among the majority of my \ncolleagues who have spoken on this subject--I would welcome the rest of \nthem to come down and speak for themselves. I reserve the remaining \ntime on our side to accommodate those Members.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is concluded at 6:30, so we have \nabout 9 minutes left.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is equally divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. To whomever uses the time first.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Is there any objection to splitting the remaining \ntime?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I will be glad to split the time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I propose we split the time, and I reserve the \nremainder\n\n[[Page S2994]]\n\nof my time for Members from those States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The time \nwill be so divided.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me respond. I certainly agree with \nthe Chairman's point that these Senators are greatly concerned about \nthese sites in their States. I compliment them for proposing and being \nable to get these amendments that they have gotten into this bill into \nthe bill. I think they have done very good work in representing their \nStates' interests. My point is that there are many other sites in this \ncountry which have an equal or perhaps an even greater claim to being \nexcluded. We need to either put those sites in or take these sites out. \nThat is the simple thrust of my amendment.\n  Much of the waste that is concerning people at Savannah River, Oak \nRidge, and Hanford--some of that waste will wind up in my State and not \non an interim basis. Under the proposal for the WIPP site, that is a \npermanent repository for transuranic defense-related waste. These \nSenators are providing that they will not have to take any additional \ninterim waste, and the plans are that much of the waste that they are \nnow complaining about having been put in their States will in fact \ntravel to my State of New Mexico in the future once the WIPP site is \nopen. So I have great difficulty agreeing with them that their States \nshould be excluded from possible consideration as a future interim site \nwhile my State should be included.\n  As I say, I would feel the same way if I were representing Rocky \nFlats in Colorado, if I were representing Ohio, the mound site there, \nor if I were representing the Pinellas shutdown facility in Florida. \nAnd, of course, as all of us know, there are a great many Superfund \nsites around the country which have been determined to be contaminated. \nI think all of those sites would be at great risk of being chosen by \nthe President and therefore they, their Senators, would want to stand \nup and get their States or their sites excluded as well.\n  Mr. President, I think this is a very difficult issue, where you put \nnuclear waste. But the only way I know to get from here to there, to a \nreasonable result, is to say we are all going to have to share the \nrisk. That is what my amendment would try to do.\n  I yield the floor. I ask, is there additional time on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Less than a minute.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I reserve that time and yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is my understanding the Senator from \nOregon wants to speak. We have about 6 minutes left. I yield 2 minutes \nto the Senator.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I suspect that there \nare some who now think this whole discussion is sort of a question of \n``not in my backyard'' run wild. I submit to my colleagues, that is not \nwhat is at issue. In fact, Hanford is in Washington State. It is not in \nthe State of Oregon. But I care greatly about this because there is \nalready more high-level nuclear waste now stored at Hanford than at any \nother Federal facility in the Nation. There is no place in the United \nStates where nuclear materials are stored under worse conditions than \nat Hanford. So, the fact is, if there are to be tens of thousands of \ntons of additional nuclear waste parked at Hanford, even though it is \nnot safely storing the waste it now has on site, there will be great \nproblems for the Pacific Northwest. So, I tell the Senate today, and \nSenator Smith also joins me in this effort, that I think this is a \ncritical public health and safety question that when, in fact, you have \nhigh-level nuclear waste stored there already and you cannot deal with \nthat safely, you certainly should not put additional waste there.\n\n  I thank Chairman Murkowski for yielding to me. I want to say to the \nSenate, this is not, in my view, a question of not in my backyard run \nrampant, but that there are really public interest reasons for ensuring \nthat additional problems are not foist upon the Pacific Northwest. I \nthank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I think my time is about up. I do not \nsee anybody rising to speak on it. I think each Member should evaluate \nfor himself or herself, relative to the question of whether or not \nthere is a certain uniqueness associated with the Hanford site, the \nSavannah site, and the Oak Ridge site. I hope we would not have any \nmore amendments coming up to address individual States, because I do \nnot think they could fall under the same category.\n  Mr. President, I ask that we vote first on the Bumpers amendment.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator asking to vote first on the \nBumpers amendment?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. First on the Bumpers amendment followed by the \nBingaman amendment. I ask for the yeas and nays on both. Is there any \nobjection to 10 minutes?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have no objection. I would like to \ntake my additional 30 seconds to conclude my debate on my amendment \nbefore we start the votes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent the second vote be a 10-minute \nrollcall vote to accommodate Senators.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Could we have a 2-minute period, equally divided, a \nminute each before the second vote to explain just what it is?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I have no objection.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Could we have a ruling on the request for the yeas and \nnays?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the first vote will be on \nthe Bumpers amendment.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will be very brief.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-five seconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Forty-five seconds? I will not take any longer.\n  I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Oregon and his concern \nfor the Pacific Northwest. I compliment him on getting this provision \nin the bill. I will only make the point that I represent the desert \nSouthwest, not the Pacific Northwest. And just as the Pacific Northwest \nought to be excluded, so should the desert Southwest. Therefore, I \nsuggest we have a level playing field and not exclude anyone. We all \nought to be in this barrel together.\n  When we get to my amendment, I will restate that position, because we \nwill have 2 minutes of additional debate on it.\n  I also support Senator Bumpers' amendment which we are going to vote \non right now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n\n\n                        Vote on Amendment No. 33\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Bumpers \namendment No. 33. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Grams] \nand the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Hutchinson], are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad], \nthe Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], and the Senator from \nMinnesota [Mr. Wellstone], are necessarily absent due to severe \ndisaster conditions in their States.\n  I further announce that the Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein] is \nabsent due to illness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my understanding is that the Bingaman \namendment is next; and there is 1 minute on both sides, I believe \nSenator Bingaman and then Senator Wyden.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By agreement there is 1 minute on each side \nprior to voting on the Bingaman amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment is straightforward. The \nbill, as it now stands before us, says that the Department of Energy \nwill go ahead and try to determine whether it can use the Yucca \nMountain site in Nevada for a permanent repository.\n  Mr. President, the Department of Energy will go ahead and try to \ndetermine if it can use the Yucca Mountain site. If the President \ndecides, before the deadline in here, in 1999, that Yucca Mountain is \nnot an appropriate site, then they cannot proceed with Yucca Mountain \nanymore.\n  The President is given 18 months to find another interim site for \nthis nuclear waste, except that the President--and this is in the bill \nnow--it says: The President shall not designate Hanford Nuclear \nReservation in the State of Washington and the Savannah River site in \nBarnwell County in the State of South Carolina or the Oak Ridge \nReservation in the State of Tennessee as a site for construction of an \ninterim storage facility.\n  Mr. President, what I am saying is, let us strike those exemptions. \nAll of our States, all of our sites, ought to be at risk if we decide \nto go this route.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 1 minute has expired.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I hope our colleagues will oppose the \nBingaman amendment. This is not a question of ``not in my backyard'' \nrun rampant. In fact, Hanford is in the State of Washington. It is not \nin the State of Oregon.\n  The reason that it is important to include Hanford in this \nlegislation is that there is no place in the United States where \nnuclear materials are now stored under worse conditions than at \nHanford. In fact, there is already more high-level nuclear waste stored \nat Hanford than at any other Federal facility in the country. I offered \nthis in the committee with Senator Smith of Oregon.\n  I hope our colleagues will reject the Bingaman amendment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, in \nlight of the recent agreement and the request to bring the nuclear \nwaste bill to a conclusion on Monday morning, I want to thank first of \nall, the Democratic leader for his cooperation in getting us to a point \nwhere we will get the final vote. The Senate, therefore, will not be in \nsession on Friday this week. The Senate will convene on Monday, and \nfollowing morning business the Senate will resume the pending nuclear \nwaste bill under the previous order for debate of the remaining \namendments. However, no votes will occur during Monday's session of the \nSenate.\n  The Senate will convene on Tuesday, April 15, and begin a series of \nback-to-back votes beginning at 9 a.m. Following those votes, which \nwould include final passage of the nuclear waste bill, the Senate will \nconduct morning business to discuss the significance of April 15, which \nis tax filing day. It is the hope of the leadership that the Senate \ncould consider the nomination of Alexis Herman to be Secretary of Labor \non Wednesday. Therefore, a vote is expected on that nomination during \nthe day, Wednesday, April 16, session of the Senate.\n  Also, we are very close, I believe, to getting an agreement with \nregard to the nomination of Pete Peterson to be Ambassador to Vietnam. \nOne of the Senators has had some concerns in reviewing a fax matter at \nthis point, and immediately after we hear from Senator Byrd, we hope to \nbe ready to proceed on that under a time limit agreement. If we could \nget 30 minutes equally divided on each side unless yielded back, and \nperhaps a voice vote, but we will determine that during the next very \nfew minutes.\n  Again, Mr. President, I thank all Senators for their cooperation. I \nknow it has been a very hard issue for the Senators from Nevada, and \nthey have been very tenacious, but they have been reasonable in their \napproach. I appreciate that and I want to thank Senator Murkowski and \nothers for their good work and thank you, Senator Daschle for your \ncooperation.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 42\n\n(Purpose: To ensure that budgetary discipline will apply to fees levied \n                            under this Act)\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nSenator Domenici.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott] for Mr. Domenici, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 42.\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, no points \n     of order, which require 60 votes in order to adopt a motion \n     to waive such point of order, shall be considered to be \n     waived during the consideration of a joint resolution under \n     section 401 of this Act.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nto send a second-degree amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 43 to Amendment No. 42\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the desk \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott], for Mr. Murkowski, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 43 to amendment No. 42.\n\n\n                            amendment no. 43\n\n       In the pending amendment, on page 1, insert at the end the \n     following:\n       ``Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, except \n     as provided in paragraph (3)(c), the level of annual fee for \n     each civilian nuclear power reactor shall not exceed 1.0 mill \n     per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated and sold.''.''\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank Senator Byrd for yielding at this \ntime and allowing me to complete these agreements.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my \nbrief remarks, the distinguished Senator from New York, Mr. Moynihan, \nbe recognized for 3 minutes, and following Mr. Moynihan, I ask \nunanimous consent that Mr. Levin be recognized for 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from West Virginia is \nrecognized for 3 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/10/senate-section/article/S2971-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2996-S3001]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             COURT RULING REGARDING THE LINE-ITEM VETO ACT\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in March of last year, the Congress passed \nthe Line-Item Veto Act. That law, for the first time in our Nation's \nhistory, gave the President the power to single-handedly repeal \nportions of appropriations or tax laws without the consent of Congress. \nI vigorously opposed passage of the act because of my deep concern over \nthe effects of that act on our system of checks and balances and the \nseparation of powers that has served this Nation so well for over 200 \nyears.\n  As I have told my colleagues on many occasions, I viewed the passage \nof that law as one of the darkest moments in the history of the \nrepublic. On January 2 of this year, I, along with Senators Moynihan \nand Levin, former Senator Hatfield, and Representatives Waxman and \nSkaggs, filed a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of Columbia challenging the constitutionality of the Line-Item \nVeto Act.\n  Today, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia handed down a ruling \ndeclaring the act to be unconstitutional. Among other things, Mr. \nPresident, the court held, ``Where the President signs a bill but then \npurports to cancel parts of it, he exceeds his constitutional authority \nand prevents both Houses of Congress from participating in the exercise \nof lawmaking authority. The President's cancellation of an item \nunilaterally effects a repeal of statutory law, such that the bill he \nsigned is not the law that will govern the Nation. That is precisely \nwhat the Presentment Clause was designed to prevent.''\n  As Judge Jackson also stated, ``Just as Congress could not delegate \nto one of its chambers the power to veto select provisions of law, it \nmay not assign that authority to the President.'' For the reasons set \nforth in his 36-page opinion, the court adjudged and declared \nunconstitutional the Line-Item Veto Act.\n  I am very pleased with the court's decision, which I believe to be a \ngreat victory for the American people, the Constitution, and our \nconstitutional system of checks and balances and separation of powers.\n  Mr. President, I express my deep appreciation to Mr. Moynihan, Mr. \nLevin, Mr. Waxman, Mr. Skaggs, former Senator Hatfield, for their \ncooperation, and to our excellent team of lawyers for their support, \nfor their dedication, and for their active and effective participation \nin this case.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues, I ask unanimous consent that the \nCourt's full opinion be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I understand the Government Printing Office estimates \nthat it will cost $1,916 to print this memorandum and order in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n [United States District Court for the District of Columbia, Civil No. \n                             97-0001 (TPJ)\n\nSen. Robert C. Byrd, et al., plaintiffs v. Franklin D. Raines, et al., \n                               defendants\n\n\n                          memorandum and order\n\n       This action challenges the validity of legislation entitled \n     the Line Item Veto Act, Pub. Law No. 104-130, 110 Stat. 1200 \n     (1996) (to be codified at 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 681 note, 691 et \n     seq.) (``the Act''), which empowers the President \n     unilaterally to ``cancel'' certain appropriations and tax \n     benefits after signing them\n\n[[Page S2997]]\n\n     into law. The Act represents an effort by Congress to enlist \n     presidential assistance in controlling rampant federal \n     spending by conferring upon the President what it termed a \n     species of ``enhanced rescission'' power, expanding the \n     authority he formerly possessed under the Impoundment Control \n     Act of 1974. Plaintiffs, four Senators and two \n     Congressmen,\\1\\ contend that the mechanism chosen by Congress \n     to its desired end contravenes the text and purpose of \n     Article I, section 7, clause 2, known as the ``Presentment \n     Clause'' of the Constitution. Rather than making expenditures \n     of federal funds appropriated by Congress matters of \n     presidential discretion, the Act effectively permits the \n     President to repeal duly enacted provisions of federal law. \n     This he cannot do. Accordingly, the Court will grant \n     plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, deny defendants' \n     motion, and declare the Act unconstitutional.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at end.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                                   i\n\n                  Operation of the Line Item Veto Act\n\n       Following years of importuning by successive Presidents and \n     vacillation by earlier Congresses, President Clinton approved \n     the Line Item Veto Act as passed by the 104th Congress on \n     April 9, 1996. Immediately after it became effective on \n     January 1, 1997, the plaintiff Senators and Congressmen filed \n     this action to declare it void. Named defendants are the \n     Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the \n     Secretary of the Treasury--the officials alleged, \n     respectively, to be responsible for executing the President's \n     ``cancellations'' of spending items and limited tax benefits \n     under the Act. The United States Senate and the Bipartisan \n     Legal Advisory Group of the United States House of \n     Representatives have appeared jointly as amici curiae to \n     defend the constitutionality of the Act.\n       The Act, which sunsets on January 1, 2005, allows the \n     President, after signing a bill into law, to ``cancel in \n     whole''--\n       (1) any dollar amount of discretionary budget authority;\n       (2) any item of new direct spending; or\n       (3) any limited tax benefit.\n\n     2 U.S.C. Sec. 691(a). ``Dollar amounts of discretionary \n     budget authority'' include any dollar amount set forth in an \n     appropriation law, including those to be found separately in \n     tables, charts, or explanatory text of statements or \n     committee reports accompanying legislation. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 691e(7). Thus the President's cancellation power applies \n     to legislative history as well as to statutory text itself. \n     ``Items of new direct spending'' generally include \n     ``entitlement'' payments to individuals or to state and local \n     governments. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 691e(8); H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 491, \n     104th Cong., 2d Sess. at 36 (1996). ``Limited tax benefits'' \n     are those revenue-losing provisions that apply to 100 or \n     fewer beneficiaries in any fiscal year, or tax provisions \n     that provide temporary or permanent transitional relief for \n     10 or fewer beneficiaries from a change in the Internal \n     Revenue Code. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 691e(9). The Act directs the \n     congressional Joint Committee on Taxation to identify limited \n     tax benefits contained in bills and joint resolutions, and \n     provides that those bills and resolutions may include a \n     separate section in which identified tax benefits are not \n     subject to cancellation. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 691f(a)-(c).\n       The most critical definition is found in Sec. 691e(4). The \n     term ``cancel'' or ``cancellation'' means ``to rescind'' any \n     dollar amount of discretionary budget authority or to prevent \n     items of new direct spending or limited tax benefits ``from \n     having legal force or effect.'' Id.\n       To exercise the cancellation power the President must first \n     determine that it will--\n       (i) reduce the Federal budget deficit;\n       (ii) not impair any essential Government functions; and\n       (iii) not harm the national interest. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 691(a)(A). The President effects a cancellation by \n     transmitting a ``special message'' to Congress within five \n     calendar days (excluding Sundays) after enactment of the \n     law containing the item(s) in question. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 691(a)(B). The Act spells out the content \n     requirements for a special message and provides that it \n     shall be printed in the Federal Register. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 691a.\n       Once an item has been canceled, no further action by \n     Congress is required; cancellation takes effect upon \n     Congress' receipt of the special message. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 691b(a). Congress may thereafter introduce a \n     ``disapproval bill'' to reenact any canceled items within \n     five days of receiving the special message, and must pass it \n     within 30 days.\\2\\ 2 U.S.C. Sec. 691d(b), (c)(1). The \n     President can, of course, exercise a conventional veto of any \n     disapproval bill, but Congress can then reinstate the status \n     quo ante by overriding that veto.\n\n                         Historical background\n\n       The Act is best understood against the historical backdrop \n     of the efforts of the President and Congress over the years \n     to control government spending and, in more recent times, to \n     reduce an ever-increasing federal budget deficit. It is a \n     product of many years of inter-branch conflict and compromise \n     over how to accomplish those goals. Since the outset of the \n     19th Century, American Presidents have labored to influence \n     Congress' spending habits, and many have lobbied in \n     particular for the authority to veto selected provisions of \n     bills presented for their signature. See 12 Op. Off. Legal \n     Counsel 128, 157-65 (1988). Congress has considered both \n     amending the Constitution and enacting several alternative \n     legislative measures to give the President the increased \n     authority he has sought and Congress has intermittently \n     resisted.\n       Although Presidents have uniformly acknowledged that the \n     Constitution affords no inherent authority for a line-item \n     veto \\3\\--indeed, as explained below, it clearly forbids \n     anything but rejection of a bill in toto--they have managed \n     to exert their will by ``impounding''--or simply not \n     spending--appropriated funds. In some instances, Presidents \n     have refused to spend money on measures that conflicted with \n     their foreign policy objectives, or that would advance an \n     unconstitutional purpose. Most of the time, however, \n     Presidents simply preferred not to spend the money for the \n     purposes for which Congress had allocated it. See e.g., David \n     A. Martin, Protecting the Fisc; Executive Impoundment and \n     Congressional Power, 82 Yale L.J. 1636, 1644-45 (1973). Some \n     impoundments have been challenged successfully in federal \n     court; others have either been judicially sanctioned or not \n     contested at all. See City of New Haven v. United States, 634 \n     F. Supp. 1449, 1454 (D.D.C. 1986), aff'd 809 F.2d 900 (D.C. \n     Cir. 1987).\n       Although presidential impoundments throughout the 19th \n     century occurred in a state of uncertainty as to their \n     legality, Congress has in this century conferred a measure of \n     legitimacy upon them and given some direction as to their \n     use. In the Anti-Deficiency Acts of 1905 and 1906, requiring \n     ``apportionment'' aimed at saving money for the end of a \n     fiscal year, Congress also allowed the President to waive \n     spending appropriations in the event of emergencies or \n     unusual circumstances. Act of March 3, 1905, ch. 1484, \n     Sec. 4, 33 Stat. 1257; Act of Feb. 27, 1906, ch. 510, \n     Sec. 3, 34 Stat. 48. When Congress amended the Anti-\n     Deficiency Act in 1950, it created a mechanism for the \n     Executive Branch to recommend the rescission of any \n     reserves not required to carry out the purposes underlying \n     an appropriation. General Appropriation Act of 1951, ch. \n     896, Sec. 1211(c)(2), 64 Stat. 595 (current version at 31 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1512(c)(1)).\n       Congress has not, however, always been sanguine about \n     Presidents' refusal to spend appropriated funds. During the \n     Nixon administration, for example, the President's extensive \n     resort to impoundment prompted many lawsuits. See City of New \n     Haven, 634 F. Supp. at 1454 (``by 1974, impoundments had been \n     vitiated in more than 50 cases and upheld in only four''). \n     President Nixon's reluctance to spend appropriated funds also \n     provoked passage of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (the \n     ``ICA''), Pub. L. No. 93-344, 88 Stat. 332, a statute \n     critical to an understanding of the present Act.\n       The ICA recognized two types of impoundment: ``deferral'' \n     and ``rescission.'' Deferral affects the timing of \n     expenditures, and is accomplished by ``withholding or \n     delaying the obligation or expenditure of budget authority \n     (whether by establishing reserves or otherwise) provided for \n     projects or activities,'' or any other type of Executive \n     action or inaction accomplishing the same result. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 682(1). Deferral is permitted for contingencies, to \n     effect savings achieved through changes or efficiency, or as \n     specifically provided by law. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 684(b). Under the \n     ICA, the President effects a deferral, just as he cancels an \n     item under the Line Item Veto Act, by transmitting to \n     Congress a special message containing statutorily required \n     information. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 684(a). Also like cancellations \n     under the Act, deferrals become effective upon Congress' \n     receipt of the special message; unlike cancellations, \n     however, they expire with the end of the fiscal year.\\4\\ Id.\n       A rescission, under the ICA, is the cancellation of budget \n     authority. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 682(3). In contrast to a \n     cancellation under the Line Item Veto Act, the ICA requires \n     the President to propose a rescission by transmitting a \n     special message to Congress, which Congress may enact or not, \n     as it chooses, within 45 days. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 683(b). The \n     perceived deficiency of the rescission process under the ICA \n     that inspired passage of the Line Item Veto Act was the \n     necessity of congressional acquiescence. Whenever Congress \n     neglected or declined to pass a bill enacting into law a \n     proposed rescission--a most frequent occurrence--the \n     rescission expired.\n       The cancellation procedure embodied in the Line Item Veto \n     Act thus came to be known as ``enhanced rescission,'' the \n     enhancement consisting of elimination of the need for \n     congressional action. Two principal alternatives to the Act \n     considered and rejected by the 104th Congress were \n     ``expedited rescission'' and ``separate enrollment.'' The \n     first, exemplified by S. 14 in the 104th Congress, would have \n     preserved the recommendation process but guaranteed that \n     Congress actually and promptly vote on the President's \n     rescission proposals. S. Rep. No. 9, 104th Cong., 1st Sess., \n     at 15 (1995). The second would have treated each item of \n     spending as a separate ``bill'' for the President to sign or \n     veto. Separate handling of hundreds of items appeared to \n     present insuperable practical obstacles, however, and \n     potential constitutional difficulties as well. See 141 Cong. \n     Rec. S. 4217, S. 4224-35, S. 4244 (daily ed. Mar. 21, 1995). \n     Both Houses of Congress also considered and rejected \n     proposed constitutional amendments to impart line item \n     veto authority. S.J. Res. 2, 14, 15, and 16, and H.J. Res. \n     4, 6, and 17, 104th Cong.

In a motion to dismiss the complaint \n     defendants contend that plaintiffs lack standing to press \n     their claim. They also assert that the case is not ripe for \n     judicial resolution, and that the ``equitable discretion'' \n     doctrine requires dismissal. None of these assertions is \n     correct under the law of this Circuit.\n\n                              Standing \\5\\\n\n       Defendants argue that plaintiffs fail to present a live \n     case or controversay, first, because separation-of-powers \n     considerations counsel against judicial intrusions into \n     disputes between officials of the political branches and, \n     second, because at this point no presidential cancellation \n     has yet been attempted or threatened, and there has, thus, \n     been no discernible injury.\n       The parties agree on the standard to be applied: plaintiffs \n     must allege, as ``an irreducible minimum,'' (1) an injury \n     personal to them, (2) that has actually been inflicted by \n     defendants or is certainly impending, and (3) that is \n     redressable by judicial decree. Valley Forge Christian \n     College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and \n     State, 454 U.S. 464, 472 (1982). See also Lujan v. Defenders \n     of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992).\n       Defendants acknowledge that, pursuant to this well-settled \n     standard, this Circuit has repeatedly recognized Members' \n     standing to challenge measures that affect their \n     constitutionally prescribed lawmaking powers. See, e.g., \n     Michel v. Anderson, 14 F.3d 623, 625 (D.C. Cir. 1994) \n     (Members had standing to challenge House Rule permitting \n     delegates to vote in Committee of the Whole based on its \n     alleged vote-diluting effect); Moore v. U.S. House of \n     Representatives, 733 F.2d 946, 950-53 (D.C. Cir. 1984) \n     (standing to assert violation of constitutional requirement \n     that revenue-raising bills originate in the House), cert. \n     denied, 469 U.S. 1106 (1985); Vander Jagt v. O'Neill, 699 \n     F.2d 1166, 1168-71 (D.C. Cir.) (standing to challenge \n     leadership's committee-seating assignments), cert. denied, \n     464 U.S. 823 (1983). In each case the D.C. Circuit found no \n     separation-of-powers impediments to adjudication of the \n     merits because, as in the present case, Members' alleged \n     injuries arose from interference with the exercise of \n     identifiable constitutional powers. See Moore, 733 F.2d at \n     951. Although the Supreme Court has never endorsed the \n     Circuit's analysis of standing in such cases, for this \n     Court's purposes these precedents are controlling.\n       Plaintiff's claim of injury in this case, namely, that the \n     Act dilutes their Article I voting power, is likewise of the \n     kind that suffices to confer standing under Article III. \n     Previously, when a Member voted for an appropriations bill \n     containing multiple items, he or she could be certain that \n     any variation of the package once passed would require \n     another vote by both chambers of Congress. Under the Act, \n     however, as plaintiffs describe it, the Member's same vote \n     operates only to present the President with a ``menu'' of \n     items from which he can select those worthy of his \n     approval, not a legislative fait accompli that he must \n     accept or reject in whole, as in the past. As one Senator \n     characterizes it, his vote for an ``A-B-C'' bill might \n     lead to the post hoc creation of an ``A-B'' law, an ``A-\n     C'' law, or a ``B-C'' law, depending on the President's \n     use of his newly conferred cancellation authority, for \n     which neither he nor his colleagues would have voted so \n     reconfigured. Thus, plaintiffs' votes mean something \n     different from what they meant before, for good or ill, \n     and plaintiffs who perceive it as the latter are thus \n     ``injured'' in a constitutional sense whenever an \n     appropriations bill comes up for a vote, whatever the \n     President ultimately does with it.\n       Circuit precedent has recognized only interference with the \n     ``constitutionally mandated process of enacting law'' as \n     sufficient to confer standing upon Members to maintain legal \n     action for redress. Moore, 733 F.2d at 951. According to \n     plaintiffs, their right to formulate an appropriations bill \n     that meets with the approval of a majority of both Houses \n     alone, ignoring presidential preferences, is mandated by the \n     Presentment Clause itself. Under the Act the dynamic of \n     lawmaking is fundamentally altered. Compromises and trade-\n     offs by individual lawmakers must take into account the \n     President's item-by-item cancellation power looming over the \n     end product. The Court concludes that plaintiffs have \n     standing because they allege that the Act ``interferes with \n     their `constitutional duties to enact laws regarding federal \n     spending' and infringes upon their lawmaking powers under \n     Article I, Section 7.'' Synar  v. United States, 626 F. Supp. \n     1374, 1382 (D.D.C. 1986), aff'd sub nom. Browsher v. Synar, \n     478 U.S. 714 (1986).\n\n                                Ripeness\n\n       Defendants' primary justiciability contention is that \n     plaintiffs must wait until the President cancels an item to \n     bring this lawsuit. Their facial challenge to the Act would \n     elicit an advisory opinion, defendants argue, because whether \n     the President will exercise his authority at all (and whether \n     various other consequences will follow) is entirely \n     speculative. Indeed, courts may not exercise jurisdiction \n     consistent with Article III where a dispute is so unformed as \n     to fail the ``case or controversy'' requirement. See Duke \n     Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc., 438 \n     U.S. 59, 81 (1978); Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, \n     419 U.S. 102, 138 (1974). And in constitutional cases, courts \n     must be particularly careful not to render decisions that are \n     unnecessary. See United States v. National Treasury Employees \n     Union, 115 S. Ct. 1003, 1019 (1995). The injury that gives \n     shape to a dispute need not have occurred, however, so long \n     as it is ``certainly impending.'' Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 \n     U.S. 149, 158 (1990).\n       In focusing solely on the President's actual exercise of \n     his cancellation power, defendants overlook plaintiffs' \n     allegation of ongoing harm that befalls them irrespective of \n     whether the President ever cancels an item.\\7\\ The Supreme \n     Court considered an analogous claim ripe in Metropolitan \n     Wash. Airports Auth. v. Citizens for the Abatement of Airport \n     Noise, Inc.,  501 U.S. 252 (1991), where a Board of Review \n     composed of Members of Congress possessed an as-yet \n     unexercised power to veto decisions of MWAA's Board of \n     Directors. ``The threat of the veto hangs over the Board of \n     Directors like the sword over Damocles, creating a `here-and-\n     now subservience' to the Board of Review sufficient to \n     raise constitutional questions,'' the Court held. Id. at \n     265 n.13. See also Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 727 n.5 \n     (1986). Because plaintiffs now find themselves in a \n     position of unanticipated and unwelcome subservience to \n     the President before and after they vote on appropriations \n     bills, Article III is satisfied, and this Court may accede \n     to Congress' directive to address the constitutional cloud \n     over the Act as swiftly as possible. \\8\\\n       Plaintiffs' declarations make clear that the budgetary \n     process is already underway. The President presented his \n     budget proposal in early February, and Members will consider \n     and vote on appropriations between now and October 1, 1997, \n     when the new fiscal year begins. Moreover, Congress is likely \n     to vote on supplemental appropriations for this fiscal year \n     in the next few months. To be sure, appropriations votes are \n     inevitable, and ``certainly impending,'' Whitmore, 495 U.S. \n     at 158.\n       Defendants' argument that the case is not ripe because \n     further factual development is required is also unpersuasive. \n     The issues in this case are legal, and thus will not be \n     clarified by further factual development. In what context and \n     when the President cancels an appropriation item is \n     immaterial. The Court will be no better equipped to weigh the \n     constitutionality of the President's cancellation of an item \n     of spending or a limited tax benefit after the fact; the \n     central issue is plain to see right now. \\9\\\n       Finally, defendants assert that plaintiffs' claim is not \n     ripe because the Act might be repealed, or suspended with \n     respect to particular appropriations; a disapproval bill \n     might subsequently vindicate a Member's vote as he intended \n     it; or, if not, Congress could override a presidential veto \n     of a disapproval bill. There are two answers to this \n     argument. First, it ignores the ``sword of Damocles'' effect \n     that pervades the process irrespective of whether the \n     President ever cancels an item. Second, just because Congress \n     as a whole can suspend or repeal the Act, or pass a \n     disapproval bill, does not mean that an individual Member's \n     injury is illusory. A Member cannot procure any such relief \n     on his own. Indeed, the possibility of relief from Congress \n     as a whole is just the sort of speculative prospect that the \n     Court would reject if it were instead offered in support of \n     standing. Just as the NTEU plaintiffs did not have standing \n     simply because the Act made certain injuries possible, 101 F. \n     3d at 1429-30, the present plaintiffs' standing is not \n     undermined by virtue of the fact that the Act makes certain \n     remedies conceivable.\n\n                          Equitable discretion\n\n       Defendants urge the Court to exercise its equitable \n     discretion to dismiss the complaint because of separation-of-\n     powers concerns, which apply not only in cases involving \n     internal rules of Congress, see Skaggs v. Carle, 898 F. Supp. \n     1, 2 (D.D.C.), appeal docketed, No. 95-5323 (D.C. Cir. Sept. \n     25, 1995), but also in cases involving challenges to the \n     validity of the legislation itself, see Riegle v. Federal \n     Open Market Comm., 656 F.2d 873, 881 (D.C. Cir.), cert. \n     denied, 454 U.S. 1082 (1981).\n       In this case, however, the Court's equitable power to \n     abstain from taking jurisdiction has been foreclosed by \n     Congress' own determination to invite a lawsuit. See 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 692(a)(1). There is therefore neither reason nor \n     occasion to exercise discretion by avoiding the case. See \n     Synar, 626 F. Supp. at 1382 (``Section 274 specifically \n     provides for [declaratory] relief to [Members of \n     Congress], thus eliminating whatever equitable discretion \n     might exist and leaving only the limitations of Article \n     III.'').\n\n\n                                  iii\n\n       The Court now turns to the issue presented, namely, whether \n     the Act's conferral of cancellation power upon the President \n     violates the Presentment Clause. The Act enjoys a presumption \n     of validity, and the Court may not undertake to evaluate its \n     wisdom. See INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 944 (1983). Even if \n     the Act were to appear salutary--or even exigent, given the \n     intractable (and interminable) budget controversy--that fact \n     cannot affect the Court's inquiry. Id. Though a court does \n     not lightly resolve to invalidate a law of the United States, \n     it must nevertheless vindicate the Constitution and the \n     governmental framework it envisions. ``The Framers recognized \n     that, in the long term, structural protections against abuse \n     of power were critical to preserving liberty.'' Bowsher v. \n     Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 730 (1986). Accordingly, the Supreme \n     Court has ``not hesitated to invalidate provisions of law \n     which violate [the separation of powers],'' Metropolitan \n     Wash., Airports Auth. v. Citizens for the Abatement of \n     Airport Noise, Inc., 501 U.S. 252, 273 (1991), and this Court \n     can do no less.\n\n[[Page S2999]]\n\n       This case is indisputably one of first impression. The \n     issue it poses will undoubtedly be finally resolved by the \n     Supreme Court, but at present such Supreme Court precedent as \n     can be found only intimates what the result will be. It is by \n     that jurisprudence, however, that this Court must be guided, \n     and the lesson of those cases appears to be that not even the \n     most beguiling of upgrades to the machinery of national \n     government will be countenanced unless it comports with the \n     constitutional design.\n       Shorn of its political and policy-laden implications, this \n     case turns on the narrow and subtle question of whether the \n     President's power under the Act is simply a present-day \n     enlargement of his historically sanctioned impoundment power \n     as it has existed from time to time, as defendants urge, or \n     rather a radical transfer of the legislative power to repeal \n     statutory law, as plaintiffs believe. As explained below, the \n     Court agrees with plaintiffs that, even if Congress may \n     sometimes delegate authority to impound funds, it may not \n     confer the power permanently to rescind an appropriation or \n     tax benefit that has become the law of the United States. \n     That power is possessed by Congress alone, and, according to \n     the Framers' careful design, may not be delegated at all.\n\n                         The Presentment Clause\n\n       The Presentment Clause requires that any bill making or \n     changing federal law must be first passed by both Houses of \n     Congress and then presented to the President in toto, in \n     which form he acts upon it, either to make it (or allow it to \n     become) a law, or to return it to Congress for \n     reconsideration.\\10\\ U.S. Const. art. I, Sec. 7, cl. 2. \n     Plaintiffs focus on the language of ``approval;'' the \n     President's primary duty under the Presentment Clause, they \n     say, is one of approval or disapproval. If he approves of the \n     bill, in toto, his signature is but a ministerial formality. \n     If he does not approve of it, in toto, his duty obliges him \n     to return it with his ``objections'' to the House in which it \n     originated, or at least to leave it be. If he signs it while \n     disapproving of it--or parts of it--as the act purports to \n     authorize him to do, then he does so, according to \n     plaintiffs, in violation of the Presentment Clause.\n       For defendants, the operative words are, ``he shall sign \n     it.'' It is the bright-line act of signing alone that \n     converts a bill into law. Approval is a highly subjective, \n     and a temporal, concept. A President may ``approve'' of a \n     bill for many reasons, not all of which import enthusiasm for \n     its legislative consequences. A President may sign a bill of \n     which he actually disapproves (as undoubtedly many Presidents \n     have done) for political, diplomatic, or other purposes \n     unrelated to his judgment of its merit.\n       The Court agrees with defendants that the act of signing a \n     bill is the critical requirement of the Presentment Clause. \n     The President's judgment of approval coincides with his \n     decision to sign a bill; it has no independent operative \n     significance. Whether a bill is or is not a law of the United \n     States cannot depend on the President's state of mind when he \n     affixes his signature. He may object to various \n     appropriations and limited tax benefits--that is, he may \n     disapprove of them--but nevertheless sign a bill and thereby \n     remain in full compliance with the Presentment Clause. \n     Likewise, no subsequent action by the President is capable of \n     retroactively undermining the approval he registered with his \n     signature. By that time the Article I approval process has \n     run its course, and the bill indisputably has become a law of \n     the United States. See United States v. Will, 449 U.S. 200, \n     224-25 & n.29 (1980); La Abra Silver Mining Co. v. United \n     States, 175 U.S. 423, 454 (1899); Burgess v. Salmon, 97 U.S. \n     381, 384-85 (1878).\n       Yet, although the court agrees that statutes subject to \n     cancellation will have been ``approved'' in accordance with \n     the Presentment Clause, the Act is vulnerable to the \n     additional charge that, following approval, a cancellation by \n     the President is a legislative repeal that itself must comply \n     with Presentment Clause procedures. The Court must resolve \n     this issue in light of the Supreme Court's admonishment that \n     ``[t]he legislative steps outlined in Art. I are not empty \n     formalities; they were designed to assure that both Houses of \n     Congress and the President participate in the exercise of \n     lawmaking authority.'' Chadha, 462 U.S. at 958 n. 22. It is \n     insufficient, therefore, for defendants to argue that, \n     notwithstanding the resemblance between a cancellation and a \n     statutory repeal, the Act should stand because the same \n     result could be accomplished through clearly constitutional \n     means. Rather, ``the purposes underlying the Presentment \n     Clauses . . . must guide resolution of the question whether a \n     given procedure is constitutional.'' Id. at 946.\n       Fundamentally, the Presentment Clause enforces \n     ``bicameralism'' and circumscribes the President's ability to \n     act unilaterally. See Field v. Clark, 143 U.S. 649, 692-93 \n     (1892). It embodies ``the Framers' decision that the \n     legislative power of the Federal Government be exercised in \n     accord with a single, finely wrought and exhaustively \n     considered, procedure.'' Chadha, 462 U.S. at 951. The \n     President's contribution to the process is his approval of \n     (or objection to) legislation as Congress presents it to him. \n     His is merely a qualified check on the will of the \n     legislature. See 1 The Records of the Federal Convention of \n     1787 at 97-105 (Max Farrand ed., 1987). The President must \n     consider the whole of the bill presented, which, in today's \n     world of omnibus appropriations and myriad riders, is an \n     undeniably difficult task. Nevertheless, upon considering a \n     bill, he must reach a final judgment: either ``approve it,'' \n     or ``not.'' U.S. Const. art I, Sec. 7, cl. 2. Once he has by \n     his signature transformed the whole bill into a law of the \n     United States, the President's sole duty is to ``take Care \n     that the Laws be faithfully executed.'' U.S. Const. art. II, \n     Sec. 3. See also Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 \n     U.S. 579, 587 (1952) (``[T]he President's power to see that \n     the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is \n     to be a lawmaker.'').\n       Where the President signs a bill but then purports to \n     cancel parts of it, he exceeds his constitutional authority \n     and prevents both Houses of Congress from participating in \n     the exercise of lawmaking authority. The President's \n     cancellation of an item unilaterally effects a repeal of \n     statutory law such that the bill he signed is not the law \n     that will govern the Nation. That is precisely what the \n     Presentment Clause was designed to prevent.\n\n    Delegation of spending authority vs. exercise of lawmaking power\n\n       Defendants dismiss the notion that the Act represents an \n     abdication of Congress' Article lawmaking I power, arguing \n     that it merely ratifies traditional impoundment authority of \n     the President in a novel form. Defendants and amici both \n     allude to a long history of presidential impoundments, many \n     of which have been tested by courts, and as to which the \n     issue has been confined primarily to whether Congress \n     intended to delegate discretion to the President not to spend \n     money it had appropriated; that is, whether its \n     appropriations were permissive or mandatory. See, e.g., Train \n     v. City of New York, 420 U.S. 35, 41 (1975); City of New \n     Haven v. United States, 634 F. Supp. 1449, 1454 n.6 (D.D.C. \n     1986) (citing cases), aff'd 809 F.2d 900 (D.C. Cir. 1987). \n     The effect of the ICA was to make all appropriations \n     presumptively mandatory. The Line Item Veto Act merely \n     reverses that presumption, at least for a period of five \n     days. During that limited period, the President has the \n     option to ``cancel'' any appropriation--he may not change it \n     in any manner--after which it remains in the law as he signed \n     it, to be faithfully executed with the remainder.\\11\\ If he \n     cancels it with an appropriate message to Congress, it is \n     extinguished, as if it had never been part of the bill, \n     unless Congress revives it with a new bill, passed like any \n     other by both Houses of Congress and presented anew to the \n     President. In the meantime no money can be spent for it, just \n     as would have been the case had it been ``deferred'' or \n     ``rescinded'' in accordance with the ICA. The Line Item Veto \n     Act is, therefore, according to defendants, merely an advance \n     delegation by Congress to the President of a brief period of \n     discretion to spend or not, as his judgment dictates, subject \n     to the broad injunctions that his decision not to spend \n     operate to reduce the deficit, and will not impair any \n     essential Government functions or harm the national interest. \n     It is, they say, ``evolutionary, not revolutionary,'' Def. \n     Motion for Summary Judgment at 3, in the perpetual contest of \n     will between Congress and the President in matters of the \n     federal budget.\n       It has long been held that Congress may--indeed, of \n     necessity, must--delegate vast authority to the Executive \n     Branch of government to make and to change rules for the \n     governance of national affairs, so long as they are in \n     furtherance of the will of Congress. When courts have \n     inquired into whether Congress has abdicated its legislative \n     function in cases of allegedly overbroad delegations, their \n     sole concern is whether Congress itself articulated \n     ``intelligible principles'' by which delegated authority is \n     to be exercised. See Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. \n     361, 372; J.W. Hampton, Jr. & Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. \n     394, 406, 409 (1928). Since 1935, the Supreme Court has \n     ``upheld, without exception, delegations under standards \n     phrased in sweeping terms.'' Loving v. United States, 116 S. \n     Ct. 1737, 1750 (1996). Defendants are therefore correct that, \n     if the Act's conferral of cancellation power, at least with \n     respect to appropriations, can be equated with a delegation \n     of impoundment authority, their burden under the delegation \n     standard is not ``a tough one.'' National Fed'n Of Fed. \n     Employees v. United States, 905 F.2d 400, 404 (D.C. Cir. \n     1990).\\12\\\n       But defendants are mistaken in asserting that Article I \n     concerns disappear once the President has signed a bill into \n     law, and, consequently, that the delegation doctrine is the \n     only hurdle for them to surmount. Their analysis assumes that \n     Congress conferred a delegable power. It did not; it ceded \n     basic legislative authority. The Constitution vests ``all \n     legislative Powers'' of the United States in Congress, U.S. \n     Const. art I, Sec. 1, including the power of repeal. Chadha, \n     462 U.S. at 954. As Chadha made clear, there are formal \n     aspects of the legislative process that Congress may not \n     alter. Just as Congress could not delegate to one of its \n     chambers the power to veto select provisions of law, it may \n     not assign that authority to the President. Before the \n     question of a delegation's excessiveness ever arises, then, a \n     court must be convinced that Congress did not attempt to \n     alienate one of its basic functions.\n       In no case where the Supreme Court decided that a \n     delegation of broad authority was saved by Congress' \n     articulation of intelligible principles was the Court faced \n     with an equivalent of the cancellation power given to the \n     President by the Line Item Veto Act. Cancellation under the \n     Act is simply not the same thing as impoundment, or any other \n     suspension of a statutory provision. Instead,\n\n[[Page S3000]]\n\n     cancellation is equivalent to repeal \\13\\--and ``repeal of \n     statutes, no less than enactment, must conform with Art. I.'' \n     Chadha, 462 U.S. at 954. Cancellation forever renders a \n     provision of federal law without legal force or effect, so \n     the President who canceled an item and his successors must \n     turn to Congress to reauthorize the foregone spending. \n     Whereas delegated authority to impound is exercised from time \n     to time, in light of changed circumstances or shifting \n     executive (or legislative) priorities, cancellation occurs \n     immediately and irreversibly in the wake of the \n     operationalizing ``approval'' of the bill containing the very \n     same measures being rescinded.\n       Thus the cancellation power conferred by the Act is indeed \n     revolutionary, as plaintiffs assert. Never before has \n     Congress attempted to give away the power to shape the \n     content of a statute of the United States, as the Act \n     purports to do. As expansive as its delegations of power may \n     have been in the past, none has gone so far as to transfer \n     the function of repealing a provision of statutory law. The \n     power to ``make'' the laws of the nation is the exclusive, \n     non-delegable power of Congress which the Line Item Veto Act \n     purports to alienate in part for eight years. That it can be \n     recaptured if Congress repeals the Act, or suspends it \n     (either in general, or in particular circumstances) does not \n     alter the fact that, until Congress does so by a separate \n     bill which the President signs (or as to which his veto is \n     overridden), the President has become a co-maker of the \n     Nation's laws. The duty of the President with respect to such \n     laws is to ``take care that [they] be faithfully executed.'' \n     U.S. Const. art II, Sec. 3. Canceling, i.e., repealing, parts \n     of a law cannot be considered its faithful execution.\\14\\\n       Moreover, if cancellation power could constitutionally be \n     delegated as to appropriations and limited tax benefits, \n     defendants have yet to show a tenable constitutional \n     distinction between appropriation and tax laws, on the one \n     hand, and all other laws, on the other. In fact, defendants \n     deny any obligation to suggest such a distinction at all. At \n     oral argument they insisted that there is virtually no limit \n     to the express Article I powers Congress may delegate if it \n     chooses, so long as it articulates ``intelligible \n     principles'' by which its delegate is to be guided. If that \n     is so--if Congress can delegate to the President the power to \n     reconfigure an appropriations or tax benefit bill--why can he \n     not also cancel provisions of an environmental protection or \n     civil rights law he disfavors, and upon exactly the same \n     ``principles'' as are to guide his exercise of cancellation \n     authority under the Line Item Veto Act?\n       As authority for the proposition that it is \n     constitutionally permissible for Congress to delegate to the \n     President the power to render a law of the United States \n     inoperable, defendants cite the case of Field v. Clark, 143 \n     U.S. 649 (1892). Aside from the fact that the presidential \n     action approved by the Supreme Court in Field v. Clark was \n     merely the ``suspension'' of duly enacted tariffs, not their \n     cancellation, the case is also distinguishable on the ground \n     that the Supreme Court recognized the practice of \n     ``legislating in contingency;'' that is, where Congress \n     itself determines in advance when conditions yet to occur \n     should cause the law to cease to be operate. The President is \n     merely the instrument of its will. Id. at 683-92. See also \n     United States v. Rock Royal Co-op, Inc., 307 U.S. 553, 577-78 \n     (1939); Currin v. Wallace, 306 U.S. 1, 15-16 (1939); The Brig \n     Aurora, 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 382, 388 (1813).\\15\\ The Line Item \n     Veto Act, in contrast, hands off to the President authority \n     over fundamental legislative choices. Indeed, that is its \n     reason for being. It spares Congress the burden of making \n     those vexing choices of which programs to preserve and which \n     to cut. Thus, by placing on itself the ``onus'' of overriding \n     the President's cancellations, see H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 491, \n     104th Cong., 2d Sess. at 16 (1996), Congress has turned the \n     constitional division of responsibilities for legislating on \n     its head.\n       The Court therefore agrees with plaintiffs. In those \n     Supreme Court cases which this Court finds most instructive \n     for its purposes, most notably Chadha, the Supreme Court has \n     repeatedly counseled that when the Constitution speaks to the \n     matter, the Constitution alone controls the way in which \n     governmental powers shall be exercised.\\16\\ The formalities \n     of the constitutional framework must be respected; the \n     several estates subject to it must function within the \n     spheres the Constitution allots to them.\n\n\n                                   IV\n\n       In passing the Act, Congress and the President addressed \n     the significant problem of runaway spending, striving to \n     create a more efficient process. But ``the Framers ranked \n     other values higher than efficiency.'' Chadha, 462 U.S. at \n     959. As the Court elaborated: ``With all the obvious flaws \n     of delay, untidiness, and potential for abuse, we have not \n     yet found a better way to preserve freedom than by making \n     the exercise of power subject to the carefully crafted \n     restraints spelled out in the Constitution.'' Id. Various \n     legislative alternatives remain available to give the \n     President a more significant role in restraining \n     government spending. For example, the ``expedited \n     rescission'' model favored by many Members of the 104th \n     Congress would retain the President's role as a \n     recommender of rescissions, see U.S. Const. art. II, \n     Sec. 3, and force Congress to vote on such proposals. And, \n     of course, Congress remains free to attempt passage of a \n     constitutional amendment if it determines that the \n     President should have unilateral revisionary power.\n       For the foregoing reasons, it is, this 10th day of April, \n     1997,\n       ORDERED, that defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint \n     and motion for summary judgment are denied; and it is\n       FURTHER ORDERED, that plaintiffs' motion for summary \n     judgment is granted; and it is\n       FURTHER ORDERED, that the Line Item Veto Act, Pub. Law No. \n     104-130, 110 Stat. 1200 (1996), is adjudged and declared \n     unconstitutional.\n                                          Thomas Penfield Jackson,\n                                              U.S. District Judge.\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ Senators Robert C. Byrd, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Carl \n     Levin, and Mark O. Hatfield, and Representatives David E. \n     Skaggs and Henry A. Waxman. All but Senator Hatfield are \n     currently sitting Members of the 105th Congress.\n     \\2\\ The President has no authority to cancel items contained \n     in an enacted disapproval bill; he must take it or leave it \n     as presented to him.\n     \\3\\ See, e.g., 33 Writings of George Washington 96 (1940) \n     (``From the nature of the Constitution, I must approve all \n     the parts of a Bill, or reject it in toto.''); William Howard \n     Taft, The Presidency: Its Duties, Its Powers, Its \n     Opportunities and Its Limitations 11 (1916) (``[The \n     President] has no power to veto parts of the bill and allow \n     the rest to become a law. He must accept it or reject it . . \n     .''); 12 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 128, 157-65 (1988) (reviewing \n     other Presidents' views and experience).\n     Although some commentators have argued that the Constitution \n     does provide inherent authority for a line item veto, see \n     Stephen Glazier, Reagan Already Has Line-Item Veto, Wall St. \n     J., Dec. 4, 1987, at A14, col. 4; L. Gordon Crovitz, The \n     Line-Item Veto: The Best Response When Congress Passes One \n     Spending ``Bill'' A Year, 18 Pepp. L. Rev. 43 (1990), most \n     scholars have concluded that the text of Article I, Sec. 7, \n     unequivocally precludes such authority. See, e.g., Bruce Fein \n     & William Bradford Reynolds, Wishful Thinking on a Line-Item \n     Veto, Legal Times, Nov. 13, 1989, at 30; Lawrence Tribe and \n     Philip Kurland, Letter to Sen. Edward Kennedy, 135 Cong. Rec. \n     S. 14,387 (daily ed. Oct. 31, 1989); 12 Op. Off. Legal \n     Counsel 128 (1988); 9 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 28 (1985). \n     Moreover, at least two courts have stated in dicta that the \n     President possesses no inherent item veto. See Lear Siegler, \n     Inc. v. Lehman, 842 F.2d 1102, 1124 (9th Cir.), reh'g en banc \n     ordered, 863 F.2d 693 (9th Cir. 1988), withdrawn on other \n     grounds, 893 F.2d 205 (9th Cir. 1989) (en banc); Thirteenth \n     Guam Legislature v. Bordallo, 430 F. Supp. 405, 410 (D. Guam \n     App. Div. 1977), aff'd, 588 F.2d 265 (9th Cir. 1978).\n     \\4\\ Originally, deferrals were automatically effective but \n     subject to a one-House legislative veto. 88 Stat. at 335. In \n     light of INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983), the legislative \n     veto component of the ICA was invalidated, City of New Haven \n     v. Pierce, 809 F.2d 900 (D.C. Cir. 1987), and Congress \n     subsequently amended the ICA to eliminate the offending \n     procedure.\n     \\5\\ Only Article III standing, as opposed to prudential \n     limitations, is at issue in light of Congress' creation of an \n     express right of action in Sec. 692(a)(1) of the Act.\n     \\6\\ Defendants rely on two concurring opinions by D.C. \n     Circuit Judges in arguing that plaintiffs' injury is not \n     sufficiently personal to create a justiciable controversy. \n     See Moore, 733 F.2d at 957-61 (Scalia, J., concurring); \n     Vander Jagt, 699 F.2d at 1179-82 (Bork, J., concurring). Yet, \n     as the three-judge court, of which then-Judge Scalia was a \n     member, recognized in Synar v. United States, 626 F. Supp. \n     1374, 1382 (D.D.C. 1986), aff'd sub nom. Bowsher v. Synar, \n     478 U.S. 714 (1986), this Circuit's cases unequivocally \n     establish that Members have ``a personal interest . . . in \n     the exercise of their governmental powers.'' 626 F. Supp. at \n     1381 & n. 7.\n     \\7\\ Even if an actual cancellation by the President were \n     required to cause injury, Article III arguably would not \n     require plaintiffs to wait for that event to invoke the \n     Court's jurisdiction. See Abbott Labs v. Gardner, 387 U.S. \n     136, 140 (1967); Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 117 (1976) \n     (challenge was ripe in anticipation of ``impending future \n     ruling and determinations'').\n     The President has expressed his intention to invoke his new \n     powers under the Act this year. See 141 Cong. Rec. S. 8202-03 \n     (daily ed. June 13, 1995) (containing letter from President \n     to Speaker of the House).\n     \\8\\ As in the case of standing, plaintiffs need only satisfy \n     the Article III component of ripeness because Congress \n     unmistakably declared the case fit for judicial review in \n     Sec. 692(c) of the Act. Accordingly, this Circuit's \n     conclusion in National Treasury Employees Union v. United \n     States, 101 F.3d 1423, 1431 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (``NTEU''), that \n     prudential (as well as constitutional) considerations made \n     the union's challenge to the Act not ripe in inapposite.\n     \\9\\ Moreover, fitness for review is a prudential component of \n     the ripeness doctrine, an inquiry Congress obviated by \n     calling for expedited judicial action. See Thomas v. Union \n     Carbide Agric. Prods. Co., 473 U.S. 568, 580-81 (1985); NTEU, \n     101 F. 3d at 1431. But even if the Court were to take into \n     account prudential ripeness factors, they actually militate \n     in plaintiffs' favor, because resolving the issue now will \n     avert the cloud that would hang over any canceled item that \n     Congress fails to disapprove.\n     \\10\\ In the Framers' words: ``Every Bill which shall have \n     passed the House of Representatives and the Senate shall, \n     before it become a Law, be presented to the President of the \n     United States; If he approve it he shall sign it, but if not \n     he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in \n     which it shall have originated, who shall enter the \n     Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to \n     reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration two thirds of \n     that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, \n     together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it \n     shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds \n     of that House, it shall become a Law. But in all Cases the \n     Votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and Nays, \n     and the Names of the Persons voting for and against the Bill \n     shall be entered on the Journal of each House respectively. \n     If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten \n     Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to \n     him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had \n     signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent \n     its return, in which Case it shall not become a Law.''--U.S. \n     Const. art. I, Sec. 7, cl. 2.\n     At the behest of James Madison, the Framers included the \n     following clause to ensure that Congress could not evade the \n     presentment requirement simply by passing legislation in \n     forms other than bills: ``Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to \n     Which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of \n     Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of \n     Adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the \n     United States; and before the Same shall take Effect, shall \n     be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be \n     repassed by two thirds of the Senate\n\n[[Page S3001]]\n\n     and House of Representatives according to the Rules and \n     Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill.''--U.S. Const. \n     art I, Sec. 7, cl. 3.\n     \\11\\ Defendants cite no analog, as a species of impoundment \n     or anything else, however, to the power to ``cancel'' limited \n     tax benefits found in the Act.\n     \\12\\ See, e.g., Skinner v. Mid-America Pipeline Co., 490 U.S. \n     212, 219 (1989) (upholding delegation of authority to \n     establish and collect pipeline safety fees); Lichter v. \n     United States, 334 U.S. 742, 778 (1948) (upholding grant of \n     power of recover excessive wartime profits), and Yakus v. \n     United States, 321 U.S. 414, 424 (1944) (upholding broad \n     delegation of price-fixing authority).\n     \\13\\ As noted supra, p.4, Sec. 691e(4) of the Act defines the \n     verb ``cancel'' as meaning ``to rescind.'' Webster's Third \n     New International Dictionary 1924 (G. Merriam Co. 1981) \n     defines the verb ``repeal'' as meaning ``1: to rescind or \n     revoke (as a sentence or law) from operation or effect.''\n     \\14\\ Defendants suggest that, in canceling future \n     appropriations, the President will, in fact, be faithfully \n     executing the Line Item Veto Act to reduce the deficit. But \n     the Act contains no mandate to the President to reduce the \n     deficit. It merely conditions cancellations for whatever \n     reason upon, inter alia, their having a deficit-reducing \n     effect.\n     \\15\\ As the Supreme Court further explained in J.W. Hampton, \n     Jr. & Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394, 407 (1928), 30 \n     years later: ``Congress may feel itself unable conveniently \n     to determine exactly when its exercise of the legislative \n     power should become effective, because dependent on future \n     conditions, and it may leave the determination of such time \n     to the decision of an executive, or, as often happens in \n     matters of state legislation, it may be left to a popular \n     vote of the residents of a district to be affected by the \n     legislation. While in a sense one may say that such residents \n     are exercising legislative power, it is not an exact \n     statement, because the power has already been exercised \n     legislatively by the body vested with that power under the \n     Constitution, the condition of its legislation going into \n     effect being made dependent by the legislature on the \n     expression of the voters of a certain district.''\n     \\16\\ See also Metropolitan Washington Airports Auth. v. \n     Citizens for the Abatement of Aircraft Noise, 501 U.S. 252 \n     (1991); Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714 (1986); cf. U.S. Term \n     Limits v. Thornton, 115 S. Ct. 1842 (1995).\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to state that this is a fine \nmoment in the history of the Senate. It has come about through the \nleadership of Senator Robert C. Byrd and his devotion to the \nConstitution of the United States. The court today ruled in the most \nexplicit terms. It said, ``* * * the Act effectively permits the \nPresident to repeal duly enacted provisions of Federal law. This he \ncannot do.''\n  Then with a grace note that I hope the Senate will appreciate, and I \nknow our distinguished occupant of the chair will, with Senator Byrd's \ngreat attachment to the history of democratic government and theory and \nits glorious origins in Greece, the court referred to the sword-of-\nDamocles effect: Not that the President would exercise this power, but \nthat he might do it. There is a sword still suspended in this Chamber, \nbut soon, I cannot doubt, to be taken down as a consequence of the \njudgment of the Supreme Court. I might add, sir, that there are some in \nCongress who are concerned that the courts interfere too much with our \nprocedures. This is a court defending the Constitution and the U.S. \nCongress in its responsibilities.\n  Finally, sir, may I state a moment of gratitude to the attorneys, our \nlearned counselors, who, on a pro bono basis, argued this case so \neffectively. I ask unanimous consent that their names be printed in the \nRecord at this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Councel for Plaintiffs\n\n       Charles J.

Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMichigan is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to announce officially that there \nwill be no further votes today.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from West Virginia. The \nSenator from West Virginia is the plaintiff in a historic lawsuit. This \nlawsuit has now taken the first step. Senator Moynihan and I, Senator \nHatfield, and a number of House Members are co-plaintiffs, and proudly \nso, with Senator Byrd. We are kind of the ``et al.'' Robert Byrd, et \nal. It is a position that we are proud to be in.\n  This lawsuit, we should be clear, tests a particular version of the \nline-item veto that is in that bill. What the court held, and what our \nlawyers argued, and what we feel passionately is that once the \nPresident of the United States affixes his signature to a bill, that is \nthe law of the land. Four magic words: ``Law of the land.'' When that \nbecomes the law of the land, it cannot be repealed unilaterally by the \nPresident or by us. It must be repealed according to the Constitution. \nThat is the fundamental, bedrock, black letter constitutional law, \nwhich the court affirmed today. It is pleasing to us that the court did \nso.\n  I want to thank our colleagues for making it possible for us to have \nan expedited process in the courts. Whichever side of this dispute we \nwere on, we agreed that we ought to resolve it promptly. The bill \nprovided that there be an early resolution in court. I think all of our \ncolleagues are to be thanked for making that possible.\n  The sword of Damocles is there, as the Senator from New York \nmentioned. It still hangs here until there is a final resolution, if \nthere is going to be an appeal to the Supreme Court. We hope now that \nthe Constitution will prevail. We think it is clear that the courts are \nthe right people to give the final interpretation of that Constitution. \nJustice Marshall's vision and holding prevails today, in that a court \nhas now ruled on the constitutionality of a law. Presumably, that will \ngo to the Supreme Court. We hope for a prompt resolution.\n  We are very gratified that what we believe is so fundamental in this \ncountry has now been reaffirmed by the district court that took the \nfirst look at this law. That principle, again, is that once that moment \ncomes when a Presidential pen is affixed to a bill, that bill binds all \nof us, every one of us, be it the President or any other citizen of \nthis land, and that bill cannot be changed. The law cannot be changed \nby the unilateral act of either the President or the Congress, but must \nbe repealed as laws are adopted, with the involvement of both the \nPresident and the Congress, as required by the Constitution.\n  Again, my thanks to Senator Byrd for the leadership he has shown in \nprotecting the Constitution of the United States. I know Senator \nMoynihan expressed this, and Senator Hatfield, if he were here, would \nsay the same, that we are very, very gratified to be on the same side \nof a very critical lawsuit with our good friend from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. If the Senator will yield, I wish to thank my dear friends, \nSenator Moynihan and Senator Levin, for their gracious remarks this \nafternoon. I also wish to thank the majority leader for his cooperation \nin this matter. I went to him about having a piece of legislation \npassed that would help to expedite this action. Although he did not \nagree with me in the matter itself, he was very cooperative in allowing \nthat action by the Senate to take place. I thank him for that.\n  Mr. President, I join Mr. Moynihan, also, in thanking counsel for \ntheir excellent services in this important matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/10/senate-section/article/S2996-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3001-S3010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the majority leader, after consultation with the \nDemocratic leader, may proceed to the consideration of Executive \nCalendar No. 34, the nomination of Pete Peterson to be Ambassador to \nVietnam. I further ask that the nomination be considered under the \nfollowing time limitation: 30 minutes equally divided between the \nmajority leader and Democratic leader or their designees. I further ask \nunanimous consent that immediately following the expiration or yielding \nback of the time, the Senate proceed to a vote on the nomination and \nthat, immediately following the vote, the President be notified of the \nSenate's action and the Senate then return to legislative session.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, is it the \nunderstanding of Senators on both sides of the aisle that this would \nnot require a rollcall vote?\n  Mr. LOTT. That is my understanding at this time, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that in the \nunlikely event that a rollcall vote is necessary, that it would take \nplace following the final vote on the nuclear waste bill next Tuesday.\n\n[[Page S3002]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I hope that, after all that we have done, we can get this \nconcluded tonight. I know that would be your preference. That is my \nunderstanding as to the parties that have been interested. I think we \ncan get it done tonight.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I make that unanimous-consent request, but I don't think \nit will be necessary.\n  Mr. LOTT. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. For clarification, there was no objection to the unanimous \nconsent request that I made, as amended by Senator Daschle.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I had no objection.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, with regard to Calendar No. 34, the \nnomination of Pete Peterson to be the Ambassador to Vietnam, I would \nlike to specifically thank the Senator from New Hampshire for his \ncooperation and for the very serious questions that he has raised, \nwhich needed to have proper attention. I believe that we have gotten \nsome progress made in that regard. We do have now a letter that has \nbeen sent to me, in response to our questions, from the National \nSecurity Council, Mr. Berger. Senator Smith has had a chance to review \nthat. I personally have had very serious concerns all along about the \nnormalization of relations with Vietnam. I think the certification has \nbeen flawed in the way it has been handled, and I think that those \npoints needed to be made. But I also felt that Pete Peterson was an \nexcellent choice for this assignment. And I appreciate the cooperation \nof Senator Smith in the way he handled this matter, and Senator McCain \nfor his cooperation. I know he has a personal involvement and interest \nin the nominee. I just wanted to thank them both for their efforts.\n\n  I would like to yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nNew Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield 3 \nminutes to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The nomination will be stated.\n\n\n   NOMINATION OF PETE PETERSON, OF FLORIDA, TO BE AMBASSADOR TO THE \n                     SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Pete Peterson, \nof Florida, to be Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the \nUnited States of America to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the nomination.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for all of his \nefforts in making this possible.\n  I also would like to especially thank my friend from New Hampshire \nwho is a dogged, a determined, a zealous, and a committed advocate of \nattaining a complete and full accounting of those who are still missing \nin action in Vietnam.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire and I have had differences of view on \nthis issue from time to time. But no one has ever questioned the \nabsolute dedication of the Senator from New Hampshire to the commitment \nto those fellow Americans for whom we still have not been able to \nobtain an accounting.\n  Mr. President, I thank him because if it had not been for him this \nvery important letter from the White House would not have come over to \nour leader signed by Sandy Berger, Assistant to the President for \nNational Security Affairs. It lays out a very important set of \npriorities for further actions that need to be taken by the United \nStates and by the Vietnamese so that we can finally put this very \ndifficult chapter behind us.\n  I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for his efforts in that \ndirection.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to wish, since I am confident \nthat Pete Peterson will be confirmed by the Senate, a dear friend, \nGodspeed. He is traveling back to a place that he found quite \nuncomfortable the last time he resided there, and I am very grateful \nthat we have an American like Pete Peterson who is willing to go back \nand serve his country in a very vital and important manner. And perhaps \none could argue that only Pete Peterson could do this job in the way \nthat it needs to be done in this very difficult and very critical time \nin our relations with Vietnam and Asia.\n  So we all wish Pete Peterson every success, and we are grateful that \nwe have someone like him who is willing to continue to serve his \nNation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the remainder of my time to Senator \nSmith.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from \nArizona for his kind words, and also for his cooperation in working \nwith me on this issue.\n\n  Mr. President, there were some concerns which I had raised, and they \nhave been addressed thanks to the cooperation of Senator Lott, Senator \nDaschle, Senator Shelby, Senator Bob Kerrey, and certainly Sandy Berger \nwith the National Security Council of the President of the United \nStates.\n  I think because of the willingness to address the concerns that I \nhave raised we were able to resolve this matter tonight.\n  Let me first of all say clearly and for all the world to see and know \nthat this issue has never been about the qualifications of Pete \nPeterson to be the Ambassador to Vietnam. It has been about the \naccounting process and how best to go about getting a fullest possible \naccounting for our missing.\n  In regard to former Congressman Pete Peterson, he was a POW in \nVietnam for a number of years, suffered greatly at the hands of the \nVietnamese, as did my colleague Senator McCain. I am sure the \naccommodations as Ambassador will be a little better than he had on his \nlast trip over there as a POW. But I have worked with him on the United \nStates-Russian Commission. I like him. I respect him. He is an \nhonorable and decent man, and he will be I believe a good ambassador.\n  My concerns have been addressed in the past on this floor in terms of \nthe problems that I believe we have with the Vietnamese. I am hopeful \nnow, with this clarification that we have been able to receive from the \nWhite House, and with the support of Senator McCain, Senator Shelby, \nand others, that Ambassador Pete Peterson will be able to seek this \ninformation and finally get this information from the Vietnamese.\n  It has always been my concern that rather than to say that the \nVietnamese are fully cooperating and then we will send an Ambassador \nover there, I think it is more honest to say we don't have all of the \ninformation, the Vietnamese can provide more information, and let's \nsend the Ambassador over there to get it. I think that is more honest. \nI believe that is what we have resolved here tonight.\n  Mr. Berger was kind enough to indicate by letter that the President \ncommits to continue to press the Government of Vietnam to cooperate on \nfull accounting, and that they have established the mechanisms to do it \nwith the Vietnamese to provide information that the Vietnamese have \nonly available to them. I interpret that to mean that there is a lot of \ninformation that the Vietnamese can unilaterally provide, as the League \nof Families has so often said under its leader, Andrew Griffiths, that \nwe want the information whatever that may be that the Vietnamese can \nunilaterally provide. We all know, and I think this compromise \nindicates, that there is information still that the Vietnamese can \nunilaterally provide. I hope that the Ambassador will be able to \nencourage the Vietnamese, and finally hopefully persuade the Vietnamese \nto provide it.\n  I want to be specific in four areas that I believe are the major \nareas of information.\n  One, the Politburo records concerning U.S. POW's: These records are \nimportant. Vietnamese officials have not provided them. And we believe \nthey can provide many of them. They may have lost some. But we think \nthere are some they can provide. DOD analysts have testified under oath \nthat access to these records has not been provided.\n  So I hope that Ambassador Peterson will pursue that venue very \ndirectly with the Vietnamese. I have ever assurance that he will.\n  Second, North Vietnamese military records on U.S. POW's and MIA's \nfrom the country of Laos: As you know, North Vietnam occupied Laos \nduring the war. We lost a lot of American fliers in Laos during the \nwar, and the Vietnamese have not been forthcoming about a lot of the \nshootdown records pertaining to U.S. losses in Laos.\n\n[[Page S3003]]\n\n  The so-called Group 559 shootdown record turned over in September \n1993 contains only summary information, and the DOD analysts--not \nSenator Smith--have concluded that ``It is clear that this record was \ncompiled after the fact from original records.'' So we need those \noriginal records. I hope that along the lines that the analysts have \ntestified in their testimony last year that we would be able to get \nthat information from the Vietnamese.\n  It is clear that the Vietnamese did have direct knowledge of these \nlosses. We know that. Hopefully now they will provide it. We deserve to \nknow the fate of these United States POW's who were shot down in Laos \nand captured by the Vietnamese, and in some cases killed by the \nVietnamese in this instance. But in the province in Northern Laos which \nI personally visited, none of them really in that area have been \naccounted for at all from the Communist side. We know that they have \ninformation because some of these people were captured and filmed.\n  Third, the unilateral action by Vietnam in 461 cases unaccounted for: \nThese are records that we believe based on our best information the \nVietnamese could provide more data, and we have had testimony from \nagain the intelligence community saying that they believe based on our \ninformation that they could get that information.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the prison camp records pertaining to U.S. \nPOW's: I think we are not interested in what somebody did as a POW or \ndidn't do as a POW in getting those documents. They can be screened and \ncarefully taken care of by the intelligence community, should we get \nthem. What we are interested in is what happened to some of these \npeople who were in the prison system who were not returned, who were \nseen on film and on tape--sometimes used for propaganda--and have never \nbeen accounted for. So we believe that the Vietnamese would know \nsomething about those people, and certainly what happened to them. We \nwould hope that they would provide that information.\n  So those are the four areas that I have focused on and on which I \nhope the Ambassador will focus on. I think that is what is referred to \nin the letter here from Mr. Berger.\n  I think also when the Intelligence Committee--I thank Senator Shelby \nfor his cooperation in this regard because basically he looked into \nthis matter for me and we have now come to a conclusion that there is \nfurther information that the intelligence community really didn't have \ninput into the certification process, and, therefore, they need to have \nthat information.\n  If you read the testimony on the House side and some other testimony \nwhere analysts have spoken, they have talked about the fact that this \naccess is important, and there are two documents--the so-called 735 and \n1205--that come out of the Russian archives which are very \ncontroversial. And we are now pursuing those in the United States-\nRussian Commission where Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, myself, \nand others were members, and Pete Peterson was a member. We are still \npursuing that information.\n  So I want to again conclude on a couple of points and then yield to \nanyone else who may wish to speak on this matter.\n  Pete Peterson is an outstanding public servant. He served his country \nwell. He went through hell in Vietnam, and the fact that he now is \nwilling to go back and pursue information on POW's, on his fellow \ncolleagues, POW's and MIA's, fellow comrades in arms, I think is a \ntribute to him and the type of person that he is.\n  I want to say again what has been distorted, as usual in the media so \nmany times, specifically the Boston Globe, and other places where \napparently untruths were hyped by the papers, they had it all wrong. I \nwas never opposed to Pete Peterson in any way, shape, or form being the \nAmbassador. My concern is with what I just addressed, which is we need \nto try to get the fullest possible accounting. We have not gotten the \nfullest possible accounting, and with the Ambassador going to Vietnam \nhe will do that. I am all for it.\n  Let me just also say in regard to Mr. Hoang, who I talked with who is \nnow out of the country and is not here, I hope and believe that should \nMr. Hoang come back into the country that he ought to come before the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee and answer any and all questions put to \nhim regarding not only Vietnam but anything else regarding these \nmatters in terms of how policy was developed. But at this point he is \nnot in the country to do that.\n  So let me again thank everyone involved in working this decision out. \nOne of the nicest things about the Senate, even though it is \nfrustrating if you are on the other side of something, is that you get \nthe opportunity to work together.\n  I remember the first day I was on the floor in 1991. Senator \nMitchell, then the majority leader, came over to me and introduced \nhimself. He said, ``Hello,'' and said, ``Bob, welcome. It is nice to \nhave you. I wish we could have gotten a Democrat, but we got you. But \nlet me just say this. We will work with you over here. It is not like \nthe House, not because we want to but because we have to.'' That is OK. \nI mean that is the way the process works here. When you have a concern, \npeople on the other side work with you to get it resolved. You do the \nbest you can, and sometimes it works out. And more often than not it \ndoes work out even though you take some flak.\n  So I am very pleased with those on all sides of this issue who worked \nwith me to address my concerns. Especially I am grateful to Sandy \nBerger who I called this morning and asked to prepare a letter. I gave \nhim the concerns that I had. He responded before the end of the day to \nSenator Lott with the concerns that I raised. I can't thank him enough.\n  I think the fact that the nomination will go through tonight is to a \nlarge extent due to the willingness of the administration, specifically \nMr. Berger to address my concerns. I am very grateful to them for that.\n  I wish Ambassador Peterson the best of luck. I look forward to \nworking with him as Ambassador to Vietnam to get more information on \nour missing men and a few women in Vietnam.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have relevant material \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Areas Where Vietnam Is Not ``Cooperating in Full Faith'' or Providing \n              Full Disclosure on Unaccounted for Americans\n\n       (1) Politburo records concerning U.S. POWs.--Vietnamese \n     officials have not provided wartime politburo documents in \n     which the total number of captured U.S. POWs were discussed. \n     This is critical because of the information passed to the \n     U.S. Government in 1993 by Russian intelligence which \n     contained reported transcripts of two secret North Vietnamese \n     wartime speeches in which the number of captured U.S. POWs \n     referenced was substantially higher than those who were \n     returned by Hanoi in 1973. U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of \n     Defense for POW/MIA Affairs, James Wold, confirmed in a \n     meeting with Senator Smith and Congressman Johnson on \n     February 4, 1997, that he has not succeeded in convincing \n     Hanoi to cooperate on this matter--and DoD analysts have \n     testified under oath that access to such records has not been \n     provided.\n       (2) North Vietnamese military records on U.S. POW/MIAs from \n     Laos.--Since September, 1993, Vietnam has not provided \n     additional documentation on a North Vietnamese shootdown \n     record pertaining to U.S. losses in Laos. (The so-called \n     ``Group 559 Shootdown Record'' turned over in September, \n     1993, contains only summary information, and DoD analysts \n     have concluded that ``it is clear that this Record was \n     compiled after the fact from original records'' and that ``it \n     is very difficult to believe that additional Group 559 \n     documents could not be turned over forthwith'' and that \n     ``analysis of this document makes clear that the Vietnamese \n     have additional Group 559 records that may contain \n     information useful to POW/MIA case resolution.'' DoD analysts \n     testified under oath to Congress last year that with regard \n     to about 253 Americans captured or lost in Laos, it was not \n     clear that the Vietnamese had direct knowledge of these \n     losses, and ``they should have known exactly what happened to \n     the person.'' U.S. intelligence also indicates that \n     Vietnamese officials should have direct knowledge of the fate \n     of U.S. POWs known to have been held by the Pathet Lao during \n     the war in Sam Neua province in northern Laos--none of whom \n     have ever been accounted for by the Communist side.\n       (3) Unilateral Action by Vietnam on 461 cases of \n     unaccounted for men.--In January, 1996, the State Department \n     indicated that Assistant Secretary Winston Lord had \n     ``expressed disappointment to Vietnamese officials in the \n     level and quality of unilateral work they perform on cases.'' \n     Last summer, General Wold passed to Vietnam 461 ``unilateral \n     cases'' of unaccounted for men--cases\n\n[[Page S3004]]\n\n     where General Wold stated that ``critical Vietnamese \n     assistance'' was needed. Such assistance has not been \n     forthcoming in these cases, according to the comprehensive \n     review of all cases conducted by DoD in response to \n     Congressional legislation in 1995. It is not clear that this \n     situation has dramatically improved over the last six months \n     since General Campbell assumed command of Joint Task Force \n     (Full Accounting.)\n       (4) Prison Camp Records Pertaining to U.S. POWs.--The U.S. \n     has reportedly not received access to prison camp records \n     detailing the fate of many POWs, including so-called ``died-\n     in-captivity'' cases, and the prospects for final \n     accountability for these men (ie: information on the location \n     or disposition of remains). These records would also help \n     resolve eyewitness accounts of reported American POWs in \n     captivity which U.S. intelligence agencies have collected \n     over the years.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 24, 1997.\n     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Dick: I am writing to request an inquiry by the staff \n     of the Select Committee on Intelligence into certain \n     documents pertaining to American POW/MIAs from the conflict \n     in Southeast Asia.\n       As you know, Senator Bob Smith has raised questions about \n     intelligence information on which President Clinton based his \n     1996 certifications required by law as a condition for the \n     expansion of relations with Vietnam. He has specifically \n     raised concerns relating to two documents acquired from the \n     archives of the former Soviet Union. These documents came to \n     light after the Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs \n     was disbanded in 1993.\n       I would appreciate your directing a staff inquiry examining \n     the intelligence basis for the President's certifications--\n     specifically addressing the two documents--in as expeditious \n     a fashion as possible. Because I hope that full Senate can \n     consider the pending nomination of former Congressman \n     Peterson to be Ambassador to Vietnam the week of April 7th, I \n     would appreciate receiving the results of the inquiry prior \n     to that time.\n       Thank you for your consideration of my request. With best \n     wishes, I am\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Trent Lott.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                             Select Committee on Intelligence,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 8, 1997.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: In response to your March 24, 1997 letter, \n     we are attaching the findings of a preliminary staff inquiry \n     into the U.S. Intelligence Community input that formed the \n     basis of the 1996 Presidential determinations regarding \n     Vietnam's accounting for American POW/MIAs, including \n     accelerating efforts to provide POW/MIA-related documents.\n       The President determined last year that, based upon \n     information available to the U.S. Government at that time, \n     the Socialist Republic of Vietnam was cooperating in full \n     faith on the POW/MIA issue. These determinations were made by \n     the President in response to Public Law conditioning the \n     release of funds for U.S. diplomatic or consular post in the \n     Socialist Republic of Vietnam on Presidential certification.\n       The staff inquiry has found:\n       1. That the Intelligence Community appears to have played \n     no formal role in the determinations.\n       2. That regarding the so-called ``735'' and ``1205'' \n     documents from the Russian archives:\n       They have not been the subject of a coordinated community-\n     wide analysis. Elements of the Intelligence Community did \n     contribute to a 1994 Department of Defense assessment and the \n     State Department's Office of Intelligence and Research (INR) \n     prepared several memoranda analyzing the documents;\n       The 1994 DoD assessment and the 1993 INR analysis \n     identified numerous errors in the documents and raised \n     questions about their accuracy, but could not dismiss them as \n     fabrications; and,\n       Time constraints have not allowed the Committee staff to \n     completely investigate all activities taken since 1994, but \n     attempts by the Intelligence Community to gain additional \n     information on the documents appear to have been limited.\n       We want to emphasize that this is not a comprehensive \n     Committee review. We will explore whether the Committee \n     should conduct further inquiry after consultation with all of \n     the Committee Members.\n           Sincerely,\n     Richard C. Shelby,\n       Chairman.\n     J. Robert Kerrey,\n       Vice Chairman.\n       Attachment.\n\n\n                             staff inquiry\n\n                              Background.\n\n       A primary role of U.S. intelligence is to help American \n     foreign policy makers make informed decisions. In general, \n     U.S. Government's certification on foreign affairs matters is \n     assumed to be based on a number of factors including input \n     from the Intelligence Community. The process of collecting \n     and analyzing sensitive and open-source information is \n     complicated and subjective, but is the essence of the work \n     done by the Intelligence Community. In most instances, the \n     quality and source of information is such that it can be \n     interpreted in more than one way and isolated reports of \n     information may easily be misinterpreted. It is critical to \n     take all information--including information derived from \n     sensitive intelligence sources and methods, and information \n     related to policy implementation--into account when judging \n     the validity of information on which to base a certification \n     or determination.\n\n                               Findings.\n\n       1. The Intelligence Community appears to have played no \n     formal analytical role in the determinations.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes follow at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       a. Prior to the 1996 Presidential certifications, or in \n     this case ``determinations,'' \\2\\ the National Security \n     Council did not request an Intelligence Community assessment \n     on whether the Socialist Republic of Vietnam was cooperating \n     in full faith on POW/MIA issues specified in Public Law 104-\n     134 and Public Law 104-208, which included ``accelerating \n     efforts to provide documents that will help lead to the \n     fullest possible accounting of POW/MIAs.''\n       b. The U.S. Intelligence Community did not on its own \n     provide an assessment on whether Vietnam was cooperating in \n     full faith on the key POW/MIA issues.\n       c. The Defense POW/MIA Office (DPMO) and State East Asian & \n     Pacific Affairs Office (EAP), two policy directorates \n     (outside the oversight of the Intelligence Community) within \n     the Offices of the Secretaries of Defense and State, were \n     asked to provide input for a Presidential ``Memorandum of \n     Justification for Determination.'' DPMO and EAP officials \n     indicated to Committee staff that their input did not include \n     any Intelligence Community product but they did rely on in-\n     country reporting from the State Department Embassy officers \n     and the DoD personnel with the Joint Task Force--Full \n     Accounting.\\3\\ Apparently, collection requirements pertaining \n     to the POW/MIA issue were in place during the 1980s and early \n     1990s, but were removed from the President's Decision \n     Directive on the Intelligence Community's priority \n     requirement list on the recommendation of the National \n     Security Council in 1995.\n       d. The only formal POW/MIA issue assessments identified by \n     the U.S. Intelligence Community was a 1987 Special National \n     Intelligence Estimate (SNIE) and a 1996 critique paper. The \n     SNIE was titled, Hanoi and the POW/MIA Issue.\\4\\ Its term-of-\n     reference and key judgment were:\n       ``Resolution of the fate of the 2,413 American servicemen \n     still unaccounted for in Indochina remains a priority \n     humanitarian issue for the U.S. Government, which believes \n     that it should be treated separately from other political and \n     economic concerns. While Vietnam also publicly characterizes \n     such an accounting as a humanitarian issue, Hanoi has used \n     the POW/MIA issue as a means to influence public opinion in \n     the United States and to achieve broader political \n     objectives.''\n       ``There is a considerable body of evidence that the \n     Vietnamese have detailed information on the fates of several \n     hundred personnel. We estimate that the Vietnamese have \n     already recovered and are warehousing between 400 and 600 \n     remains. Thus, Hanoi could account quickly for several \n     hundred U.S. personnel by returning warehoused remains and by \n     providing material evidence that could aid in determining the \n     fate of other personnel.''\n       e. In response to Congressional requests in 1996 for \n     declassification of the 1987 SNIE, Richard Bush, the National \n     Intelligence Officer for East Asia, initiated an Intelligence \n     Community Assessment challenging the SNIE. It concluded that \n     ``[s]ubsequent evidence does not support the Estimate's \n     hypothesis that Hanoi held 400 to 600 sets of remains'' since \n     it was based on ``limited direct evidence whose reliability \n     was open to question.''\n       2. That regarding the so-called ``735'' and ``1205'' \n     documents from the Russian archives:\n        they have not been the subject of a coordinated \n     community-wide analysis. Elements of the Intelligence \n     Community did contribute to a 1994 Department of Defense \n     assessment and the State Department's Office of Intelligence \n     and Research (INR) prepared several memorandum analyzing the \n     documents;\n        the 1994 DoD assessment and the 1993 INR analysis \n     identified numerous errors in the documents and raised \n     questions about their accuracy, but could not dismiss them as \n     fabrications; and,\n        time constraints have not allowed the Committee \n     staff to completely investigate all activities taken since \n     1994, but attempts by the Intelligence Community to gain \n     additional information on the documents appear to have been \n     limited.\n       a. In the view of at least one senior Soviet official, the \n     information contained in the ``735'' and ``1205'' documents \n     was highly significant. They purport to be transcripts of \n     secret wartime reports by North Vietnamese officials in which \n     the number of American POWs captured and held in North \n     Vietnam during the war was referenced. In the first document, \n     dated 1971, a North Vietnam official states that ``735'' \n     American POWs are being held. In the second document, dated \n     1972, another North Vietnamese official states that 1,205 \n     American POWs are being held. Both numbers are significantly \n     higher than the 591 American POWs who were actually released \n     by Vietnam in 1973.\n\n[[Page S3005]]\n\n       b. In 1993, the State Department, INR produced four \n     memoranda analyzing the ``735'' and ``1205'' documents. These \n     analyses were provided to State Department policymakers and \n     distributed to other agencies interested in the POW-MIA \n     issue. The State Department has provided these classified \n     memoranda for Committee review. Because they are still \n     classified, the Committee is unable to cite specific findings \n     in the memoranda, but the conclusions were similar to those \n     in the subsequent 1994 DOD assessment.\n       c. On January 24, 1994, the Department of Defense released \n     a coordinated, interagency intelligence analysis titled, \n     ``Recent Reports on American POWs in Indochina: An \n     Assessment.'' The analysis assessed the ``1205'' and the \n     ``735'' and cast doubt on the accuracy of the numbers.\\5\\ It \n     Also included an assessment of the so-called ``Dang Tan'' \n     reports, first surfaced to the public by the U.S. Government \n     in 1971, which were based on a North Vietnamese defector who \n     claimed Hanoi was holding approximately 800 Americans in the \n     late 1960s. The assessment concludes in the case of:\n       The ``735'' document, that it ``is too fragmentary to \n     permit detailed analysis, but the numbers cited are \n     inconsistent with our own accounting.''\n       The ``1205'' document, that it ``is not what the Russian \n     GRU claims it to be and the information suggesting that more \n     than 600 additional POWs existed is not accurate. . . .we \n     need more information to understand its origin and meaning.''\n       The ``Dang Tan'' documents, that ``the number was so much \n     higher than the United States Government believed had been \n     captured that it detracted from Tan's credibility on other \n     points.\n       The concluding paragraph of the analysis stated, ``[w]e \n     believe there is more information in Russian, and \n     particularly GRU, archives on this issue. There probably is \n     also more information in Vietnamese party and military \n     archives that could shed light on these documents. We \n     continue to pursue information on these issues in both \n     locations.''\n       The Russians have persistently claimed that the ``1205'' \n     and ``735'' documents were genuine Russian intelligence \n     reports. The Vietnamese have dismissed the ``735'' and \n     ``1205'' documents as fabrications.\n       Recently reviewed classified information in the hands of \n     the U.S. Government provides additional germane information \n     that was not factored into the above assessment. While this \n     new data will contribute to a better understanding of the \n     overall issue, to date it has not provided any definitive \n     resolution to the outstanding questions of total numbers of \n     American POW/MIAs known to the North Vietnamese in the early \n     1970s.\n       d. On June 19, 1996, during a House National Security \n     Subcommittee hearing, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense \n     for POW/MIA Affairs General James Wold was asked by Chairman \n     Dornan, ``General Wold, have you ever raised these Russian \n     documents, ``1205'' and ``735'', with the Vietnamese . . . \n     ?'' General Wold responded, ``I have, probably 18 months ago, \n     with the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The response was a lot \n     of excited rebuttal. . . We have raised it. It's still a \n     matter of interest. I still consider it [1205] a document to \n     pursue.'' With a time constraint of two weeks the staff \n     inquiry was not able to ascertain what steps, if any, have \n     been taken by the U.S. Government since General Wold's \n     testimony, and the 1994 analysis which concluded that Vietnam \n     needed to be pressed for more information from its party \n     archives to shed light on the ``735'' and ``1205'' documents. \n     We note that personnel from the Defense POW/Missing Personnel \n     Office have testified that Vietnam has not provided any such \n     access to its wartime party archives. We also note that \n     Vietnam has apparently not yet facilitated access to the \n     ``735'' report's alleged author, Hoang Anh, who is reported \n     to be living in retirement in Vietnam.\n       e. Although the 1994 analysis and General Wold's 1996 \n     testimony emphasize the need to press for more information in \n     order to better understand these documents, the analysis \n     appears to have been used in at least one instance to justify \n     dismissing further investigation. On March 21, 1997, \n     Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs Barbara \n     Larkin signed a letter in response to a Congressional request \n     stating that the ``1205'' and ``735'' documents had not been \n     raised with Vietnamese officials (specifically alleged \n     ``1205'' author General Tran Van Quang) by the U.S. Charge \n     d'Affaires in Vietnam because of ``the interagency \n     intelligence analysis released by the Department of Defense \n     on January 24, 1994, in which the U.S. Government concluded \n     that these documents were not a reliable source of \n     information.''\n     \\1\\ In response to a staff request for DCI's ``input'' on the \n     President's certifications, an April 3, 1997 CIA letter to \n     Committee staff states ``[b]ecause the Defense Department's \n     Defense POW/MIA Office (DPMO) is responsible for intelligence \n     bearing on the POW/MIA issue, other elements of the Community \n     were not formally involved in the certification process.''\n     \\2\\ In Presidential Determinations #96-28 and #97-10, the \n     President noted his Administration's position that the \n     related sections of Public Laws 104-134 and 104-208 are \n     unconstitutional because they ``purport to condition the \n     execution of responsibilities--the authority to recognize, \n     and to maintain diplomatic relations with, a foreign \n     government--that the Constitutional commits exclusively to \n     the President.''\n     \\3\\ On July 16, 1993, the Secretary of Defense consolidated \n     four DoD offices located within the Washington, D.C. area. \n     Each was charged with different functions of the prisoner of \n     war/missing in action (POW/MIA) issue, but each dealt with \n     the same mission: to obtain the fullest possible accounting \n     for Americans missing from the nation's wars. The \n     Intelligence Community's only POW/MIA analytical element, the \n     Defense Intelligence Agency's Office of POW/MIAs Affairs, was \n     transferred out of the National Foreign Intelligence Program.\n     \\4\\ The 1993 Final Report of the U.S. Senate Select Committee \n     on POW/MIA Affairs noted that the 1987 SNIE was the ``only \n     national intelligence estimate produced on this issue since \n     the end of the war.''\n     \\5\\ This analysis effort and contributions from elements \n     within the Intelligence Community, predominately from INR/\n     State and the Defense Intelligence Agency. However, in July \n     1993, this 48-person Defense Intelligency Agency element was \n     transferred in-total to the Defense POW/Missing persons \n     Office, a policy office within the Office of the Secretary of \n     Defense.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                       Washington, April 10, 1997.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: You have requested clarification from me \n     regarding Administration policy on POW/MIA issues with \n     Vietnam, in view of a report recently provided to you by the \n     Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on \n     Intelligence. I am happy to respond, and I realize that some \n     Members of the Senate have linked these matters to a \n     confirmation vote on Douglas ``Pete'' Peterson to be our \n     first Ambassador to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.\n       First, the President commits to continue to press the \n     Government of Vietnam to cooperate on full accounting. We \n     have established mechanisms through which the Vietnamese can \n     respond to requests for information available only to them.\n       As you know, the President has determined that Vietnam is \n     providing full-faith cooperation with U.S. efforts to obtain \n     this information. We believe the President's determination is \n     backed up by tangible assistance provided by Vietnam to the \n     Department of Defense Joint Task Force (Full Accounting). I \n     will direct the Intelligence Community to prepare a special \n     National Intelligence Estimate on this matter, something that \n     was last done in 1987. We will consult with the Chairman and \n     Vice-Chairman of the Intelligence Committee concerning the \n     terms of reference for this new study.\n       Second, we will take immediate steps to ensure that \n     collection requirements pertaining to the POW/MIA issue \n     remain as a high priority for the U.S. Intelligence \n     Community, and we will stay in close contact with the \n     Intelligence Committee on this matter.\n       Third, I will ask for an updated assessment from the \n     Intelligence Community on the so-called ``735'' and ``1205'' \n     documents from Russian archives. We will continue efforts \n     already underway to acquire additional information on these \n     documents from the Vietnamese Government, including access to \n     the alleged ``735'' author Hoang Anh, as well as other \n     relevant party and government archival materials.\n       Fourth, the President asserted when we agreed to establish \n     diplomatic relations with Vietnam that our principal goal was \n     to enhance the full accounting process. This issue will be \n     Mr. Peterson's highest priority as Ambassador. This task will \n     include pressing for additional unilateral efforts by the \n     Government of Vietnam to provide records and remains. We, \n     therefore, hope the full Senate will confirm Mr. Peterson at \n     the earliest possible date.\n       I trust this is responsive to your concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Samuel R. Berger,\n\n                                        Assistant to the President\n                                    for National Security Affairs.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. At this point, Mr. President, I yield the \nfloor to anyone else who may wish to speak on the issue.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I would like to add my thoughts regarding \nthe nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would observe that the majority has \n1 minute and 20 seconds remaining, and the minority manager, the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts, has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I yield whatever time I have remaining to \nthe Senator from Nebraska, and perhaps the Senator from Massachusetts \nmight give him another minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Thank you, Mr. President. I will be very mindful of my \ndistinguished colleagues' time. I too want to add my thoughts and \nthanks to my distinguished colleague from New Hampshire and fellow \nVietnam veterans.\n  Mr. President, I join my colleagues tonight in confirming former \nCongressman Pete Peterson to be our Nation's Ambassador to the \nsocialist Republic of Vietnam. Through his integrity, hard work, and \nbipartisan temperament, he has earned the highest possible regard of \nhis former colleagues in Congress on both sides of the aisle, and I \nthink that is evident tonight.\n  I can think of no other American better suited to be the first United \nStates Ambassador to Vietnam, and I know, as do my colleagues, that \nCongressman Peterson will bring his integrity and\n\n[[Page S3006]]\n\nunique personal experiences to this extraordinarily challenging job \nwhich we all wish him well with and we all will help him with.\n  As a Vietnam veteran, as my colleagues here in the Chamber, I know \nwell how the issue of Vietnam has for so long divided this country, but \nall the Senate Vietnam veterans agree that not only is it time for the \nUnited States to have an Ambassador to Vietnam, we also agree that \nCongressman Peterson, soon to be Ambassador Peterson, is an outstanding \nchoice for this difficult assignment.\n  A small minority of Americans continue to question whether this is \nappropriate, whether it is an appropriate time in United States-Vietnam \nrelations to have a United States Ambassador in Hanoi, and certainly \nthose views deserve respect. Personally, however, I believe that the \ntime for healing has, indeed, arrived, and Congressman Peterson is the \none to lead us in that direction.\n  Congressman Peterson will bring not only his own experience to the \nPOW Vietnam combat veteran, but he also has been a successful \nbusinessman and respected Member of Congress, the recipient of 18 \nmilitary medals including the Legion of Merit, two Purple Hearts. He is \na man of great personal strength and mind with something missing for \ntoo long in this business, a quiet dignity, a quiet confidence, a \nrespect for others.\n  Clearly, President Clinton has chosen well with his nomination, and I \nam pleased to join with my colleagues in confirming Pete Peterson to be \nthe first United States Ambassador to a united Vietnam.\n  On a personal note, Mr. President, I might add I bring him greetings \nfrom his family and his friends in Nebraska. The Congressman was off to \na good start early on in life; he was born in Omaha, NE, and still has \nmany relatives and friends there. And so that gives him probably an \nunfair advantage to be a most unusual and a most effective Ambassador \nfor this country, and we wish him well.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank my distinguished \ncolleague from Massachusetts and fellow Vietnam veteran for allowing me \na little of his time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, if I could just clarify one thing, I am not \nsure we did allow any of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is correct. The \nSenator from Nebraska ended up precisely on the time that was allowed \nto him by the previous order. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized and has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair. I ask for the similar interpretation of \ntime on our side. I am glad to recognize the Senator from Illinois for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for yielding.\n  What extraordinary symmetry, what exceptional justice this evening \nthat we consider the nomination of Pete Peterson to be our first \nAmbassador to Vietnam.\n  Thirty-one years ago as an Air Force pilot, Pete Peterson was flying \nhis 67th combat mission over Vietnam when his plane was shot down. He \ntold me the story when we were colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives. I will not forget that as long as I live, what he went \nthrough as that plane came crashing down and he was parachuting out, \nwith broken bones and beaten up, run through the streets by the crowds \nand pushed into a prison cell, and then to spend 6\\1/2\\ years--6\\1/2\\ \nyears--of his life as a prisoner of war, to come home finally in 1973 \nwith all of the deserved tribute for his service to his country, to \nreturn to his home State of Florida and his family finally and then \ndecide once again to make a commitment to this Nation and to run and \nserve in the House of Representatives and after three terms to be \ndesignated by the President of the United States, President Clinton, to \nbe America's first Ambassador to Vietnam, the same country where his \nplane had crashed and where he had been a prisoner of war for so many \nyears.\n  I say to my colleague, the Senator from Nebraska, who really said it \nso well, the quiet dignity of Pete Peterson will bring a lot to this \njob, the kind of stature which we need in those who speak for the \nUnited States.\n  He served this country well for 27 years in the Air Force, 6 years in \nthe House of Representatives, and now once again we have called Pete \nPeterson into service for his country. To think that he will be \nreturning to Vietnam to speak for this great Nation, to meet some of \nthe people who may have rescued his body and thrown him in prison and \ntoday will be greeting him is an amazing turn in history. But it is \nappropriate.\n  I know what his agenda will be--not only to service this country well \nwith honor, as he always has, but also to work diligently for a full \naccounting of the POWs/MIAs who were not accounted for from that \nconflict and also to bring some new level of understanding between our \ncountries.\n\n  I think Pete Peterson is clearly the person for this task. We are \nfortunate tonight to have this bipartisan feeling about Pete Peterson \nand his confirmation as Ambassador to Vietnam.\n  I thank Senator Lott as the majority leader, Senator Daschle on the \nminority side, Senator Smith, particularly Senator John McCain of \nArizona, a man who has lived this same experience, who carries those \nscars, and will for the rest of his life, as a prisoner of war in \nVietnam, who worked diligently to bring Pete Peterson's nomination to \nthe floor this evening. My hat is off to John McCain for his \nextraordinary efforts.\n  My colleagues, Senator Kerry and Senator Reed, will speak as veterans \nof that war. I am not a veteran of that war, but I feel I am paying \ntribute to one of the best veterans of that war in Pete Peterson. This \nis his night and I want to tell him that it is time for the speeches to \ncome to a close and for Pete Peterson's service to his country on a \nfull-time basis to resume as our first Ambassador to Vietnam.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am very pleased to speak today in \nsupport of the nomination of Congressman Pete Peterson to be our \nAmbassador to Vietnam. This day has been a long time coming, and I want \nto thank Congressman Peterson for his patience.\n  Mr. President, I traveled to Vietnam in 1991 as a member of the \nSelect Committee on POW/MIA Affairs and then again in November 1996 as \npart of a congressional delegation. The change that has taken place in \nVietnam in those 5 years is staggering. Vietnam is a dynamic country \nwith great potential. The United States needs a full diplomatic \npresence in Hanoi to represent our interests in Vietnam adequately, and \nI am very pleased that this is about to happen.\n  Congressman Peterson is an excellent choice for a wide variety of \nreasons, not the least of which is his deep and personal understanding \nof our troubled history with Vietnam. He understands firsthand the toll \nof the war, and, while much good work has been done on the relationship \nbetween our two countries, much more remains to be done. Representative \nPeterson is among the best qualified to continue that work.\n  He is also eminently qualified to continue the work on one of our \nmost important national priorities--achieving a full accounting of \nthose Americans missing in action. In each of our meetings with \nVietnamese Government officials during our recent trip, our \ncongressional delegation stressed the high priority the United States \nplaces on resolving these remaining cases. The Vietnamese pledged \nongoing cooperation, and I feel fully confident that Pete Peterson will \nsee that we get it. As he pointed out in testimony before the Foreign \nRelations Committee, he has a personal stake in achieving the fullest \npossible accounting of those still missing, since many are personal \nfriends of his.\n  In addition to the POW/MIA issue, I am happy that Congressman \nPeterson will be in Hanoi to help shepherd our developing economic and \ntrade relations with Vietnam. Vietnam's interest in achieving full \neconomic relations with the United States is clear. The most recent \nevidence was the agreement it reached last month with the United States \nto repay millions of dollars of debt incurred by South Vietnam for \nroads, power stations, and grain shipments during the Vietnam war.\n  Although the United States does not yet have full economic ties with \nVietnam, its dynamic economy offers great trade opportunities for \nUnited States businesses. During my recent trip to Vietnam, we met with \nthe United\n\n[[Page S3007]]\n\nStates Chamber of Commerce in Ho Chi Minh City. The size of that \ncontingent was a graphic evidence of United States businesses' interest \nin United States economic ties with Vietnam.\n  There are many issues that need to be resolved in fashioning a \ncomprehensive bilateral trade agreement with Vietnam that is a \nprerequisite to full economic relations. In particular, Vietnam remains \ncommitted to a system of central planning, which conflicts with the \nfree market economic principles it espouses. Work has begun on an \nagreement to resolve these issues, but much remains to be done. This is \nan important priority for the United States, as Congressman Peterson is \nwell aware.\n  Another important issue that merits Congressman Peterson's attention \nis conveying to the Vietnamese the important priority the United States \nattaches to Vietnam's human rights practices. Despite its economic \nprogress, Vietnam continues to impose restrictions on political and \nreligious freedom. We must work with the Vietnamese to address these \npractices.\n  There is another issue to which I attach great importance, a fact \nthat I stressed to each of the Vietnamese leaders I met with during my \nvisit last November. For more than a decade, scientists in the United \nStates and Vietnam had been working together to attempt to understand \nthe health effects resulting from our use of agent orange during the \nVietnam war. However, nearly 2 years ago, Vietnam executed a major \nchange in policy with regard to their support of collaborative research \nbetween United States and Vietnamese scientists.\n  In June 1995, Vietnamese customs officers seized without warning \ndocuments and specimens from a team of American scientists who had been \non the first official scientific mission from the United States. All \npapers, even the most innocuous, such as curriculum vitaes, were \nconfiscated. Newly collected specimens were also taken.\n  Though I find the seizure and subsequent refusal to return the \nmaterials or address the issue quite disturbing, I am even more \nconcerned that this may be Vietnam's way of telling us that they no \nlonger want to collaborate on this vitally important issue. To do so \nwould be a shame, not only for our veterans and their families, but \nalso for the Vietnamese. Just last February, the Wall Street Journal \npublished an article that outlined the myriad of health problems and \nbirth defects occurring among the Vietnamese who live in areas that \nwere heavily sprayed. Here in the United States, many dioxin experts \nare now looking to research in Vietnam as the next step in fulfilling \nour commitment to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the health \neffects of exposure to agent orange. Yet, without cooperation from \nVietnam, our efforts to further understand these issues will fall \nshort. We must press to obtain agreements for future cooperation on \nscientific issues of mutual importance, or we must have clear, rational \nexplanations for why additional research is not warranted. The \nstonewalling is puzzling at best, and injurious at worst.\n  I received some positive signs from the Vietnamese during my trip, \nand corresponded with Do Muoi, General Secretary of the Communist \nParty, upon my return to secure an agreement to release the seized \ndocuments and specimens. Unfortunately, I have still not received a \nresponse to my inquiry. I have communicated to Congressman Peterson my \nconcerns and interest in working with him in his new role to \nexpeditiously resolve this issue. We owe it to American veterans and \ntheir families.\n  In conclusion, let me stress my belief that Congressman Peterson will \nbe an important and valuable advocate of United States interests in \nVietnam. I congratulate him and look forward to working with him in the \ncoming years.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination \nof my good friend Pete Peterson, and I urge his swift confirmation as \nour Ambassador to Vietnam. There is no better person for this job.\n  Just over 3 years ago I joined the majority of my Senate colleagues \nin encouraging President Clinton to lift the trade embargo against \nVietnam. I did do because I was convinced that it would strengthen and \nexpand joint United States-Vietnamese efforts to determine the fate of \nthose POW's-MIA's still unaccounted for in Vietnam.\n  I was less certain about the establishment of full diplomatic \nrelations with Vietnam. I feared that such a step would remove an \nimportant incentive to completing our efforts to determine the fate of \nevery POW-MIA. But people like Pete Peterson and John McCain convinced \nme that reestablishing diplomatic relations was the best way to achieve \nour objectives in Vietnam--a full accounting of all POW's-MIA's; the \nimplementation of democratic reforms and economic modernization; and \nrespect of basic human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n  There is no person more qualified to achieve these noble objectives \nthan Pete Peterson. After spending 6\\1/2\\ years as a prisoner of war in \nVietnam--and having left so many of his friends behind--we all can take \ncomfort in knowing that Pete will not rest until every single American \nPOW and MIA is fully and honestly accounted for. This fact was \nrecognized by the Veterans of Foreign Wars, who last year endorsed \nPete's nomination.\n  Pete's qualifications as an advocate for economic freedom and U.S. \nbusiness are also quite remarkable. He has served as a member of the \nHouse Small Business Committee, fighting for average Americans who are \nseeking the American dream by building their own businesses. Pete has \ndemonstrated that he will be a fantastic advocate for American business \nin Vietnam.\n  Pete's experience as a prisoner of war gives him unique \nqualifications to speak frankly and honestly about human rights. As \nsomeone who lost every human right, every freedom, and nearly his life \nin Vietnamese prisons, Pete can speak from the heart on the importance \nof these basic human values in a way that few of us can. And I know \nthat he will do a superb job.\n  And who could be more qualified to heal the wounds of the war, and to \nbuild bridges between the peoples of our two nations. Pete has often \nsaid that he ``left the bitterness at the gate'' when he left his \nprison in Vietnam. His leadership is a major reason that the United \nStates and Vietnam are poised to begin a new era of friendly relations.\n  I have had the honor of working with Pete for the past 6 years. Pete \nrepresents everything that is great about our country. He is selfless--\nhaving served bravely in the Air Force, flying 67 combat missions over \nVietnam, and 6\\1/2\\ years as a POW--Pete came home and went to work to \nmake our country a better place. He has faced personal tragedy--losing \nhis wife Carlotta to cancer--and moved on to make good come out of his \nsuffering. And after 26 years in the U.S. Air Force, Pete felt \ncompelled to continue a life of public service. Now having served for 6 \nyears in the House of Representatives, Pete will return to Vietnam \nunder very different circumstances than those under which he left. But \nhe will continue his lifelong commitment to the American people, and I \nam honored to speak on behalf of this great American.\n  There is another quality that Pete possesses that I think will serve \nhim well in his position as our Ambassador to Vietnam. That quality is \npatience. Pete has waited patiently for over a year for his nomination \nto come to the floor of the Senate. I am very pleased that Pete's long \nwait is about to come to an end, and I urge my colleagues to join me in \nvoting to confirm Pete Peterson as the United States Ambassador to \nVietnam.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair.\n  I rise with a great deal of pride to speak to the confirmation of \nPete Peterson as our Ambassador to the Republic of Vietnam.\n  Simply stated, Pete Peterson is a great man. He was a great man \nbefore he ever put on the uniform of the U.S. Air Force because he is a \nman of outstanding character and a deep devotion to his family and \ncountry. As my friend and colleague, the Senator from Nebraska, pointed \nout, he has that rare quality of dignity and purpose, not flamboyant, \nbut quiet and determinative.\n  Pete is a remarkable person. One of the great privileges I had in my \nlife was to serve with him in the House of\n\n[[Page S3008]]\n\nRepresentatives for 6 years. He brought all of this talent, this energy \nand this fierce patriotism to his work in every capacity. We all know \nthe story. He was a young man, hailed from Nebraska, joined the U.S. \nAir Force, was in 1966 sent to Thailand, flew 66 missions in Vietnam \nand on his 67th mission he was shot down. He was captured. He spent \n6\\1/2\\ grueling, arduous years in captivity in three different prison \ncamps.\n  In all that time, not only did they not break his spirit but they \ncould in no way touch that core of deep respect, regard for all people \nthat he still maintains. He emerged from an experience, which would \nhave seared and destroyed so many other people, unbroken, unbowed and \nwithout bitterness, a remarkable testimony to his character.\n  Pete could have returned in 1973 and said, I have done my duty as an \nAir Force officer, as a patriot. He returned, in fact, in 1973 to greet \nhis wife, his beloved wife, who sadly passed away and will not see this \ntriumph today but I am sure understands from where she is what a great \nday it is for Pete. He, in fact, saw for the first time a son he had \nnever met.\n  Yet, despite all that, he still heard the call of his country, and he \nserved with distinction the second district of Florida for 6 years.\n  There has been some controversy about this nomination, but it has not \nbeen about Pete Peterson because there is no one in this Chamber or in \nthis country that I think ever doubted his capacity or commitment to \nserve as Ambassador to Vietnam. The controversy is about the issue of \nPOW's and MIA's, which was articulated by the Senator from New \nHampshire. Those are serious, important issues which cannot be \nneglected. Indeed, I believe Pete Peterson is the best person to \naddress those issues.\n  He will go to Vietnam, a place where he has already spent one-tenth \nof his life, with the credibility of one who has served and with the \nvision of one who understands what went on there during the war and \nwhat we must do to bring our country and that country closer together. \nAnd he will not neglect the search for the unanswered questions of his \ncomrades who are still missing and unaccounted for.\n  Pete has long been involved in this issue. He has, along with my \ndistinguished colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry, and the \ndistinguished Senator from New Hampshire, been involved with the \nVietnam working group. He has been involved with the U.S.-Russian joint \ncommission on POW-MIA affairs. These gentlemen have committed \nthemselves to search for the answers, and that type of commitment I \nknow will resolve the question.\n  We have a great responsibility to develop a relationship, a mutually \nsupportive relationship between the United States and the Republic of \nVietnam. Pete Peterson can do that. He is not only a warrior but he is \nalso a businessman. He understands that one of our challenges is to \nbring economic prosperity to both our countries, and he will be a \nleader in that regard also.\n  I believe the President has made the wisest choice possible with this \nnomination. We will vindicate and recognize that choice this evening, \nand we will send a strong message, a message of reconciliation and of \nprogress, a message that wars will end and peace will be begun, and a \nmessage also that a life of service to your country, selfless service \nto your country, will be rewarded by further responsibilities \ncommensurate with that service.\n  I, too, thank the majority leader and the Democratic leader, the \nSenator from New Hampshire, and particularly the Senator from Arizona \nfor all his efforts to bring this nomination to the floor and, like \nPete Peterson, also a heroic veteran of the war in Vietnam. As someone \nwho served in the military for 12 years at that time but not in \nVietnam, I recognize all of the tremendous contributions of the \nveterans of that war in this Chamber, in the other body and throughout \nour society. Pete Peterson will make us all proud but particularly \nthose brave men and women who served in Vietnam.\n  I thank the Senator. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield myself such of the remaining time \nas I may use.\n  I thank the majority leader for his efforts to bring this nomination \nto the floor this week so that the Senate may act on it rapidly. It is \na nomination that has been overdue, and it is important that we \nproceed.\n  I think it is safe to say that with this nomination and with the \napproval of the Senate, which I expect, we really begin the process in \nearnest of ceasing to treat Vietnam as a war and beginning in earnest \nto treat it like a country. That is an enormous transition for this \ncountry, and we have traveled a difficult journey through these years.\n\n  As a friend and one who has worked closely with Pete Peterson on the \nPOW-MIA issue, I really cannot think of a better person to be our \nAmbassador to Vietnam. Pete Peterson, Senator McCain, Senator Smith, \nmyself, and others have spent an enormous amount of time, energy, and a \ngreat deal of the taxpayers' money of this country trying to ensure \nthat the families of American servicemen missing from the war in \nVietnam get answers.\n  There is absolutely no doubt, Mr. President, that many families have \ngotten those answers in the last years as a result of the accounting \nprocess that we now have in place. But I recognize that for some whose \nloved ones were lost in that wrenching war questions remain. I am \nconvinced personally that having an ambassador in the country, having \nan American flag again flying in Hanoi and elsewhere in the country \nwill provide us with the opportunity to be able to leverage those \nanswers. Having a man who himself served, as both of my colleagues so \neloquently stated, 6\\1/2\\ years of his life as a prisoner of war in \nVietnam will enhance our credibility and greatly facilitate our ability \nto be able to find those answers.\n\n  As a fighter pilot, as a POW, Pete Peterson has served this Nation \nwith enormous distinction and courage. When he returned from the war, \nas we know, he became a successful businessman and served in Congress. \nDuring that period he served as chairman of the Vietnam working group \nof the United States-Russia Joint Commission On POWs. He returned to \nVietnam twice already in order to meet with Vietnamese officials and \ntravel throughout the countryside, both to find answers as well as to \nunderstand what Vietnam is like today. It is entirely appropriate that \nCongressman Peterson should therefore return to Vietnam as our first \nambassador since the war and literally help to bridge the gap that \nremains between our two countries. He went once in war, and as our \nambassador he would now go in peace. I cannot think of greater poetic \nsymmetry.\n  I know he has the ability as well as, if not better than, anyone to \nunderstand and explain to the Vietnamese, and to others, the full \nbreadth of the emotions that the Vietnam war has generated among us in \nthis country for 30 years or more. His experience as a prisoner gives \nhim the extraordinary standing and importance to represent our country \nin all of the ramifications of the war. No one in Vietnam could doubt \nhis word or his intentions, because he has gone through his own \npersonal process of resolution, and he has emerged from that process \nprepared to return to Vietnam and build a normal relationship between \nthat country and the United States. No one in this country could or \nshould doubt his desire and determination to complete the process of \nPOW-MIA accounting or his commitment to the principles of our country, \nwhich he fought for, which are still at issue with respect to our \nrelationship with Vietnam.\n  So, as Ambassador, Congressman Peterson will confront those issues \nthat are personal, and he will confront a set of issues that are \ncritically important to the regional and bilateral interests of the \nUnited States: Vietnam's relationships with its neighbors, particularly \nChina; legal and political reform within Vietnam; human rights; trade. \nI have every confidence in his ability to deal with these issues \neffectively. He has publicly expressed his willingness and enthusiasm \nto take on the job, and he comes in with a deep belief in our ability \nto build a viable and important relationship with Vietnam.\n  I had the privilege of traveling in Vietnam on one of those trips \nwith Pete Peterson. I have witnessed myself his personal journey of \nrediscovery and\n\n[[Page S3009]]\n\nhis determination to keep faith with his fellow veterans. I know he \nwill represent us extraordinarily well as the first ambassador since \nthe war. And I say to all those who have legitimately expressed \nconcerns--Senator Smith has been as dogged and as determined as any \nperson in the U.S. Senate to get these answers, and I admire that. I \nwould say to him and to anyone else who might fear that sending an \nambassador to Vietnam would lessen our ability to get answers, I say \nlook at the record of the last few years and look at Pete Peterson. He \nand that record show that by having him there, I think families can \nrest assured that they will have the greatest connection to their past, \nto his past, and to our past, and to our future. That future will be a \nfuture that will sustain this POW-MIA accounting effort and also \nsustain the principles for which their loved ones, and Pete Peterson, \nfought.\n  So I look forward to the Senate finally accepting this moment. I \nthank the Senator from New Hampshire and others who have helped to \nbring us to this important point.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I ask unanimous consent to have three \nletters printed in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter to Senator Lott \nfrom the executive director of the National League of Families, Ann \nMills Griffiths, a letter from the Disabled American Veterans to \nSenator Lott, and a letter from The American Legion to Senator Lott be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         National League of Families of American Prisoners and \n           Missing in Southeast Asia,\n                                    Washington, DC, April 9, 1997.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Senate Majority Leader, Russell Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: It is our understanding that an interim \n     report on intelligence regarding the issue of our missing \n     relatives will soon be forwarded from the Senate Select \n     Committee on Intelligence. We further understand that this \n     report is linked to the confirmation vote on Congressman Pete \n     Peterson as our new US Ambassador to Vietnam.\n       For many years, the National League of Families has \n     supported a policy of reciprocity; that is still our policy. \n     Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration has not provided \n     incentives in advance, but inaccurately justified each step \n     on the basis of POW/MIA cooperation to include the \n     President's certification to Congress that Vietnam is \n     ``cooperating in full faith.'' Official information on which \n     we have always relied does not support this certification. We \n     are confident that an objective oversight effort will confirm \n     what we know.\n       On May 7th, a League Delegation will again travel to Laos, \n     Vietnam and Cambodia to hold discussions with the leadership \n     of each country. Our last such trip was in 1994. It is our \n     sincere hope that whatever the outcome of current Senate \n     deliberations, a clear signal will be sent to Vietnam and the \n     Clinton Administration that further unilateral actions on the \n     POW/MIA issue by the government of Vietnam are expected and \n     will be a continuous subject of Senate oversight. This signal \n     is overdue and will help not only our delegation, but \n     reinforce Congressman Peterson when he undertakes his \n     difficult mission.\n       We are grateful for the concern shown by the Senate and \n     look forward to providing you the results of our upcoming \n     trip.\n           Respectfully,\n                                              Ann Mills Griffiths,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Disabled American Veterans, National Service and \n           Legislative Headquarters,\n                                    Washington, DC, April 7, 1997.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: The Disabled American Veterans is deeply \n     concerned for the thousands of American servicemen still \n     unaccounted for in the aftermath of the Vietnam War. Since \n     the end of that war, numerous efforts by high level American \n     delegations, including members of Congress, have visited \n     Southeast Asia in continuing efforts to resolve the fate of \n     these brave men without success.\n       Although the Socialist Republic of Vietnam has committed to \n     renew and increase their unilateral, as well as joint \n     efforts, to account for America's POW/MIAs, we have seen no \n     meaningful efforts taken by Vietnam to account for our \n     missing service personnel.\n       This is particularly true with regards to the unilateral \n     actions which Vietnam should be able to undertake to account \n     for a large number of our POW/MIAs based on the case \n     assessments prepared by our government last year. These case \n     assessments showed that the Vietnamese should be able to \n     provide information on at least 400 POW/MIAs. To date, the \n     Vietnamese have failed to come forth with information on \n     these individuals to any significant extent.\n       As a result of Vietnam's failure to provide the fullest \n     possible accounting of our POW/MIAs, the delegates at our \n     last National Convention in New Orleans, Louisiana, July 28-\n     August 1, 1996, passed a resolution expressing our opposition \n     to further economic and political relations between the \n     United States and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. \n     Accordingly, it is our firm belief that the confirmation of a \n     U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam should be postponed until there is \n     tangible evidence of Vietnam's commitment to provide the \n     fullest possible accounting of our POW/MIAs. Our position \n     does not mean that the DAV is opposed in any way to the \n     individual nominated by President Clinton.\n       I would appreciate learning of your views on this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  David W. Gorman,\n     Executive Director, Washington Headquarters.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              The American Legion,\n\n\n                                            Washington Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 3, 1997.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Russell Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: The American Legion urges you in the \n     strongest possible terms not to proceed with Senate \n     confirmation of a United States Ambassador to Vietnam. While \n     the Legion does not question the personal fitness of the \n     nominee himself, we believe it is premature to approve any \n     nomination for an Ambassador to Vietnam at this time.\n       We know that many others share The American Legion's \n     concern that Vietnam has failed to take the necessary actions \n     to achieve the fullest possible accounting of missing \n     Americans from the war in Southeast Asia.\n       This is particularly true with regard to the unilateral \n     actions Vietnam should be able to immediately undertake to \n     repatriate remains, which would dramatically increase \n     accountability. In fact, the purpose of last year's \n     Presidential Delegation to Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, on \n     which The American Legion was represented, was to gain \n     commitments from the Vietnamese government to take just such \n     unilateral actions.\n       However, despite the pledges by Vietnamese officials with \n     whom the Delegation met, Vietnam has not been forthcoming to \n     any appreciable extent. Enclosed is a copy of a letter to \n     President Clinton expressing The American Legion's concerns \n     about the trip report from last year's Presidential \n     Delegation to Vietnam. This report was a basis for the \n     President's decision to certify Vietnam's cooperation on the \n     POW/MIA issue.\n       Vietnam also promised to turn over military archival and \n     documentary evidence as well as other records which would \n     lead to additional accountability. However, such disclosures \n     have not been forthcoming to any significant extent.\n       Finally, recent reports of illegal campaign financing by \n     Indonesian businessman Mr. Mochtar Riady of the Lippo Group \n     (who advocated normalizing U.S. relations with Vietnam) have \n     raised serious concerns about possible improper influence of \n     official U.S. policy. These are disturbing reports which The \n     American Legion takes very seriously. We firmly believe that \n     Senate action on the confirmation of a U.S. Ambassador to \n     Vietnam should be delayed until Congressional Hearings into \n     these matters have concluded.\n       The American Legion does not support or oppose any \n     nomination put forth by the President for any office of \n     government. However, with respect to the process, we are \n     adamantly opposed to moving forward with the confirmation of \n     an Ambassador to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam until such \n     time that Hanoi is fully forthcoming in an effort to honestly \n     resolve the remaining cases of our missing American \n     servicemen.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Joseph J. Frank,\n                                               National Commander.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the nomination of \nformer Congressman Pete Peterson for the Post of Ambassador to Vietnam. \nAt this critical juncture in our relations with Vietnam and Southeast \nAsia there are many important United States interests that can be \nadvanced only with the presence of an able Ambassador in Hanoi.\n  The most important of these interests is the continued accounting for \nour POW/MIA's. A Vietnam veteran and former prisoner of war, Pete \nPeterson has both a professional and profoundly personal stake in \nensuring the fullest possible accounting of his comrades-in-arms. As \nambassador, he has pledged to make achieving that goal his highest \npriority.\n  In addition to enhancing cooperation on the POW/MIA issue, Peterson \nwill be charged more broadly with encouraging and facilitating Hanoi's \nentry as a peaceful, cooperative member of the community of nations. \nVietnam has begun working with us in the important area of \ncounternarcotics, and this cooperation should be expanded to curtail \nthe flow of heroin and other deadly drugs from Southeast Asia to our \nshores. We have also begun a dialogue\n\n[[Page S3010]]\n\non human rights which must be buttressed by expanded cultural ties and \neducational opportunities.\n  The advocacy of a strong United States Ambassador coupled with the \ncollective efforts of the American people and numerous nongovernmental \norganizations can do much to foster greater Vietnamese respect for \ninternational norms in the areas of human rights, democracy, and \nreligious freedom.\n  Finally, approving the nomination of Congressman Peterson as \nAmbassador to Hanoi will greatly assist efforts already underway to \nadvance United States economic interests in Vietnam and throughout \nSoutheast Asia. Vietnam has made significant progress toward \ntransforming its inefficient centrally planned economy to a market-\nbased economy, and it is actively seeking foreign participation in its \neconomic development. Vietnam's efforts to rebuild its infrastructure \nand modernize its economy present great opportunities for United States \nbusinesses in the areas of energy, telecommunications, health, \neducation, tourism, and environmental protection. But for United States \nfirms to compete successfully with the numerous foreign companies \nalready doing business in Vietnam, the administration must negotiate \nand Congress must approve a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement. As \nAmbassador, Peterson will play a central role in expediting \nnegotiations on an agreement which will safeguard U.S. commercial \ninterests in the fastest growing region of the world.\n  There are some who have speculated about the administration's motives \nfor normalizing relations with Vietnam at this time, questioning \nwhether officials from the Lippo Group or other United States \nbusinesses with prospective commercial interests in east Asia sought to \ninfluence the decision in exchange for their campaign contributions to \nthe Democratic National Committee.\n  As our colleague, Senator McCain--like Congressman Peterson a former \nPOW--noted at Congressman Peterson's confirmation hearing, ``This rumor \nis entirely unsubstantiated by fact.'' President Bush and Secretary \nBaker put the United States firmly on the path toward normalization in \n1989 when they drafted a ``road map'' whose goal was the establishment \nof full diplomatic relations.\n  The pace of normalization has actually slowed during the Clinton \nadministration. As Senator McCain stated during the Foreign Relations \nCommittee hearing, the Clinton administration was worried about the \npolitical ramifications for the President in making a decision to \nnormalize--with the veterans organizations and others--and was not \npossessed with concern about helping business interests, whether \ndomestic or foreign.\n  In short, we have reached the point of preparing to exchange \nambassadors because of the bipartisan conviction that normalizing \nrelations is in our best interests. It had nothing to do with foreign \nlobbyists or contributions to any Presidential campaign.\n  Peterson traveled first to Vietnam 30 years ago as an Air force \nfighter pilot. He served his country nobly, receiving two Silver Stars, \nseveral Bronze Stars, and two Purple Hearts. he flew 66 combat missions \nover Vietnam before his aircraft was downed near Hanoi on September 10, \n1966. He then endured almost 7 years of unimaginable hardship as a \nprisoner of war, before finally returning home in March 1973.\n  Now he seeks to return to Vietnam, not as a warrior, but as an \nambassador of peace, helping to heal old wounds and bring Vietnam into \nthe world community after 30 years of isolation. It is a testament to \nCongressman Peterson's commitment to public service that he is willing \nto take on this difficult mission. I wish him God's speed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the confirmation of the \nnomination.\n  Without objection, the nomination is confirmed.\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A bill to provide for the reorganization of the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n\n\n            THE BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS REORGANIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. McCain. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation to \nreorganize and restructure the Bureau of Indian Affairs. I am joined by \nSenators Domenici, Dorgan, and Thomas as original cosponsors of this \nlegislation.\n  This legislation is virtually identical to the bill that was approved \nby the Indian Affairs Committee and reported to the Senate on January \n26, 1996. Unfortunately, the Congress did not complete action on that \nbill prior to the end of the 104th Congress. This legislation is \nintended to build on the agreements contained in last year's bill and \nstimulate further discussions in Congress and among the tribes about \nthe many problems in the management and operation of the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs.\n  I will not take the time of the Senate to reiterate the long history \nof efforts to reform the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Suffice it to say, \nafter more than 150 years of proposals, reports, hearings, and other \nefforts, the Bureau of Indian Affairs remains a hindrance, not a help, \nto our Native American population.\n  Since 1824, the Bureau of Indian Affairs has been the principal \nagency of the Federal Government which is responsible for meeting this \nnation's trust responsibility to American Indians and Alaska Natives. \nYet, based on the health, social, and economic conditions on Indian \nreservations, the Bureau has failed miserably in carrying out its \nresponsibilities.\n  Just take a brief look at the statistics on native American quality \nof life.\n  Nearly one of every three native Americans in this Nation lives in \npoverty, including half of the families and half of the children under \nthe age of 6 living on Indian reservations.\n  Unemployment on Indian reservations exceeds 25 percent, and the per \ncapita income for an Indian living on the reservation is $4,478.\n\n[[Page S3012]]\n\n  Approximately 90,000 Indian families are homeless or underhoused, \nwith nearly one in five Indian families living on the reservation \nclassified as severely overcrowded. One of every five Indian homes \nlacks complete plumbing facilities.\n  It is long past time to change the way this Nation deals with \nAmerican Indians. It is time to break down the barriers to true tribal \nself-governance and self-determination by providing Indian tribes the \nauthority to design both the structure and function of their trustee, \nthe Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n  This bill I am introducing today will enable the Congress, the \ntribes, and the administration to work together to enact the basic \nreforms in the management and organization of the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs that are necessary to improve the quality of life of native \nAmericans today. This bill will provide an opportunity for Indian \ntribes to participate in the reshaping and redefining of the trust \nrelationship with the Federal Government.\n  For a detailed explanation of the provisions of this bill, I refer my \ncolleagues to the text of the bill which follows, and to Senate Report \n104-227 accompanying the legislation reported from the Indian Affairs \nCommittee last year, which is the basis for this legislation.\n  Mr. President, the reintroduction of this bill marks only the first \nstep in achieving meaningful reform of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. I \nremain committed to working with the new chairman of the Indian Affairs \nCommittee, Senator Campbell, my colleagues in both Houses of Congress, \nthe administration, and most importantly, the Indian tribes to ensure \nthat this legislation meets the goal of real and necessary change in \nthe Bureau. I look forward to our discussions, and I urge my colleagues \nto join in sponsoring this bill to ensure prompt enactment of this \nimportant and much-needed legislation to reorganize the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 545\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleague \nSenator Gregg and Senators Jeffords, Snowe, Collins, Moynihan and Smith \nin introducing the Northern Forest Stewardship Act of 1997 and the \nFamily Forestland Preservation Tax Act. I am proud that this \nlegislation has the entire support of the Senate delegations from the \nNorthern Forest States of Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, as well as \nSenators from other parts of the region.\n  Today's legislation is about empowering communities within the 26-\nmillion-acre Northern Forest--the largest contiguous forest east of the \nMississippi River. This great natural resource criss crosses New York, \nVermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. But as we near the end of the 20th \ncentury, growth pressures on the Northern Forest have increased. The \nthousands of people who live in this region have wrestled with how to \nmaintain economies that provide jobs while preserving the environment \nthat makes the region such a special place.\n  Recognizing the challenge facing these communities, Senator Warren \nRudman and I sponsored the Northern Forest Lands Study in 1990. \nThousands of people who live in the Northern Forest participated in the \nstudy which lasted 4 years. Upon the conclusion of the study, the \nNorthern Forest Lands Council was established to develop specific \nrecommendations to address the issues identified in the study.\n  As one might expect, the majority of these recommendations focused on \nlocal and State issues. However, some of the ideas proposed by the \nNorthern Forest Lands Council requested changes in Federal law. Today, \nwe are here to move forward the council recommendations that need these \nmodifications.\n  Here is an example of what Congress can achieve when it heeds the \npublic's voice. It is founded on extensive research, open discussion, \nconsensus decisions, and visionary problem solving by the people who \nhave a stake in the future of the forest. Legislation rarely embodies \nsuch a thorough effort by so diverse a constituency.\n  This legislation will reaffirm the council's vision of the Northern \nForest as a working landscape of interlocking parts and pieces, \nreinforcing each other: small and rural communities, industrial forest \nland, family and individual ownerships, small woodlots, recreation \nland, public and private conservation land.\n  These bills focus on three key goals of the council: fostering \nstewardship of private land, building knowledge and information on \nforest resources, and increasing funds available for land conservation. \nThese are goals shared by the people and representatives of the \nNorthern Forest region and provide the foundation for the bipartisan \nsupport of this legislation in the House and the Senate.\n  This legislation also recognizes the extraordinary resources the 26-\nmillion-acre Northern Forest region provides to local communities and \nvisitors alike. The forests within the region are rich in natural \nresources and values cherished by residents and visitors: timber, \nfiber, and wood for forest products and energy supporting successful \nbusinesses and providing stable jobs for residents; lakes, ponds, \nrivers, and streams unspoiled by pollution or crowding human \ndevelopment; viable tracts of land for wildlife habitat and \nrecreational use, and protected areas to help preserve the biological \nintegrity of the region.\n  Given the nature of the council's recommendations, one piece of \nlegislation to implement all the recommendations was not feasible, \ntherefore we are introducing this package of bills. It is our hope that \nthese bills will both be taken up in the appropriate committees of this \nCongress and will move through Congress as complementary legislation.\n  Passing this legislation is a priority for me personally and for \nVermont. It will highlight the importance of the forest resources to \nour region and to the Nation. It will help State, local, and community \ngroups draw upon Federal assistance to work toward the goals of the \ncouncil. And, it will reaffirm these goals and the shared commitment to \nprotect the environmental and economic heritage of the region.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill on the part of \nmyself, and Senators Gregg, Jeffords, Snowe, Collins, Smith of New \nHampshire, Moynihan, Kerry of Massachusetts, and Mr. Kennedy be \nintroduced and appropriately referred.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and appropriately \nreferred.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor \nof the Family Forest Land Preservation Tax Act and the Northern Forest \nStewardship Act and commend both Senator Leahy and Senator Gregg for \ntheir leadership in these bills. Both bills include recommendations \nfrom the Northern Forest Lands Council that address the general \nconsensus of the residents in the Northern Forest region.\n  Since the Northern Forest Lands Council's creation in 1990, hundreds \nof citizens have been seeking ways for Maine, New Hampshire, New York, \nand Vermont to maintain the traditional patterns of land ownership and \nuse of the Northern Forest. For over 4 years the council conducted \nindepth research, assessed data, consulted with experts, held public \nmeetings, and listened to thousands of people who live and work in the \nregion. The recommendations that are incorporated in both the \nStewardship Act and the Preservation Tax Act, represent the thoughtful \nwork of many individuals who live and work in the Northern Forest \nregion and hundreds of hours of forums and public meetings.\n  Mr. President, I am grateful and appreciate the dedication and vision \nof the members of the Northern Forest Lands Council and the thousands \nof people who participated in the process. I am grateful, because the \n26-million-acre forest that stretches from eastern Maine through New \nHampshire and Vermont and across New York provides important and \nvaluable resources. This forest region is home to 1 million residents. \nThe people that work and live in this region have a bond to the land. \nHunting, fishing, trapping, walking, and hiking in the woods have been \na way of life for generations.\n  Nearly 85 percent of the Northern Forest is privately owned. For \nyears, these lands have provided a diversity of environmental and \neconomic benefits.\n\n[[Page S3018]]\n\n Families and individuals have taken care of their forests for \ngenerations providing economic viability to communities and overall \neconomic health to the region as well as maintaining opportunities for \nrecreation, natural beauty, and wildlife. The traditional values within \nthe forest regions are also cherished by those who live outside the \nregion. Seventy million people live within a day's drive of the \nNorthern Forest. They too, realize the importance of the Northern \nForest for its source of clean water, clean air, and vast diversity.\n  Mr. President, the Preservation Tax Act and the Stewardship Act are \nneeded to protect and maintain the traditional and valuable uses of the \nNorthern Forest. Complex social and economic forces, some originating \noutside the region, have led to competing and conflicting uses of the \nNorthern Forest. These two bills will help keep the Northern Forest \nproductive and protected.\n  The Family Forest Land Preservation Tax Act will help encourage \nprivate forest land owners to conserve their productive forests. Since \nwell managed productive forests are such an essential element to the \ntraditional values of the Northern Forest region, the Preservation Tax \nAct is vital to maintaining sound forest management. Although this bill \nwas based on recommendation from citizens in the Northern Forest \nregion, it will benefit forest lands in all States. It's important \nbecause it allows for post-mortem donations of conservation easements \nfor estate tax purposes, creates an estate tax alternative for heirs \nwho choose to maintain the property as forest land for 25 years, \nprovides a partial inflation adjustment for timber, creates an \nincentive for the sale of conservation easements to public agencies, \nand eliminates the 100-hour passive loss rule for forest land income.\n  Mr. President, the Preservation Tax Act and the Stewardship Act are \nneeded to relieve the pressure on forest land owners and provide \nincentives to maintain and protect the forests that so many work and \nenjoy. Both bills support the Northern Forest Council recommendations \nby promoting a sound foundation for a diversified economy and stable \ncommunities, opportunities for quality recreation, and long-term \nprotection of the diversity of plant and animal species in the region. \nThese bills are important steps in addressing the many interests in the \nNorthern Forest region. Several years of participation and involvement \nfrom interested parties throughout the region have helped develop \nuseful recommendations that recognize the diversified opportunities of \none of the regions most important resources.\n  It is my hope that both bills will move swiftly through the Senate \nand House and become law. I urge my colleagues to support these bills.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n       By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Lott, Mr. \n        Stevens, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Craig, Mr. Ashcroft, and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 547. A bill to provide for continuing appropriations in the \nabsence of regular appropriations for fiscal year 1998; to the \nCommittee on Appropriations.\n\n\n                 THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN PREVENTION ACT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I and Senator Hutchison and Senator \nLott and Senator Nickles, Senator Stevens, and Senator Craig are \nintroducing the Government Shutdown Prevention Act. This bill creates a \nstatutory continuing resolution as sort of a safety net CR, which would \ntrigger only if the appropriation acts do not become law or if there is \nno governing continuing resolution in place.\n  I want to emphasize here, after a long series of negotiations with \nthe House, with the advice and consent and leadership of the majority \nleader, Senator Lott, and the active participation and leadership of \nSenator Stevens especially, the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, negotiations with the Speaker, the Appropriations Committee \nchairman, Mr. Livingston, in the House, and also Majority Leader Armey, \nwe have come up with this legislation.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is important. It must be done soon. I \nbelieve the lesson of the last 2 years is that we cannot allow the \nGovernment to be shut down again. Nor can we allow the threat of a \nGovernment shutdown to be so impactful that we fiscal conservatives are \nsomehow forced to appropriate billions--in the case of last year around \n$8 billion--additional because of the threat of a Government shutdown. \nSo, this is very important legislation. It is not something that I am \nidly throwing into the hopper.\n  I thank Senator Hutchison for her efforts and participation on this \nbill. What this legislation does is ensures that the Government will \nnot shut down and that Government shutdowns cannot be used for \npolitical games. This safety net continuing resolution basically would \nset spending for fiscal year 1998 at 98 percent of 1997 fiscal year \nlevels.\n  In other words, the way this would work is if we could not get \nagreement on the appropriations bills, rather than the threat of a \nshutdown of Government or parts of Government because of failure to \nappropriate funding for their continued effort, this would be funded at \n98 percent of the previous year's level. That would ensure, if any kind \nof standoff between the Congress and the White House occurs, that vital \nGovernment functions will continue and Government employees will \ncontinue to serve the public.\n  It is our intention to move this bill quickly. It is very important \nwe act before the appropriations season begins in earnest. Therefore, \nit is the intent of Senator Hutchison and myself to move this bill as \nsoon as possible, specifically on the emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill that will be before this body probably within a \nmonth or so.\n  We all saw the effects of gridlock in the past. No one wins when the \nGovernment shuts down. Shutdowns only confirm the American people's \nsuspicions that we are more interested in political gain than doing the \nNation's business. The American people are tired of gridlock. They want \nthe Government to work for them, not against them. The budget process \nin the last Congress, in my view, was a fiasco and, more important, in \nthe view of the American people.\n  Our Founding Fathers would have been ashamed of our inability to \nexecute the power of the purse in a responsible fashion. I am sure they \nwould have been quite shocked by the 27 days that the Government was \nshut down, 13 continuing resolutions, and almost $6 billion in \nblackmail money that was given the administration to ensure that the \nGovernment did not shut down a third time.\n  Although Republicans shouldered the blame for the Government \nshutdown, President Clinton and his colleagues were equally at fault \nfor using it for their political gain. Republicans were outmaneuvered \nby President Clinton because we were not prepared for him to use the \nbudget process for his own political purposes. We thought that by doing \nthe right thing--passing the first balanced budget in a generation, and \nfiscally sound appropriations bills--that we would eventually prevail. \nWhat we did not realize was that the President was more interested in \nplaying politics with the budget than actually balancing it. This year \nwe have to be prepared for these games and launch a preemptive strike \nto ensure that basic Government operations will not be put at risk \nduring the next budget battle.\n  This legislation does not erode the power of the appropriators and \ngives them ample opportunity to do their job. It is only if the \nappropriations process is not completed by the beginning of the fiscal \nyear, as was the case in the last Congress, that the safety net \ncontinuing resolution will go into effect.\n  In addition, I emphasize that entitlements are fully protected in \nthis legislation. The bill specifically states that entitlements such \nas Social Security--as obligated by law--will be paid regardless of \nwhat appropriations bills are passed or not passed.\n  According to President Clinton, the combined cost of last year's \nGovernment shutdown was $1.5 billion. However, this figure does not \nbegin to account for the millions of dollars lost by small businesses \nwho depend on the Government being open. In my State of Arizona, during \nthe Government shutdown the Grand Canyon was closed for the first time \nin 76 years. I heard from people who work close to the Grand Canyon. \nThese were not Government employees. These were independent small \nbusiness men and women. They\n\n[[Page S3019]]\n\ntold me that the shutdown cost them thousands of dollars because people \ncould not go to the park. According to a CRS report, local communities \nnear national parks alone lost an estimated $14.2 million per day in \ntourism revenues as a direct result of the Government shutdown, for a \ntotal of nearly $400 million over the course of the shutdown.\n  The cost of the Government shutdown cannot be measured in just \ndollars and cents. During the shutdown millions of Americans could not \nget crucial social services. For example, 10,000 new Medicare \napplications, 212,000 Social Security card requests, 360,000 individual \noffice visits and 800,000 toll-free calls for information and \nassistance were turned away each day. There were even more delays in \nservices for some of the most vulnerable in our society, including 13 \nmillion recipients of AFDC, 273,000 foster care children, over 100,000 \nchildren receiving adoption assistance services and over 100,000 Head \nStart children--not to mention the new patients that were not accepted \ninto clinical research centers, the 7 million visitors who could not \nattend national parks, or the 2 million visitors turned away at museums \nand monuments. And the list goes on and on.\n  In addition, our Federal employees were left in fear wondering \nwhether they would be paid, would they have to go to work, would they \nbe able to pay their bills on time. In my State of Arizona, for \nexample, of the 40,383 Federal employees, over 15,000 of them were \nfurloughed in the last Government shutdown. I do not want to put these \nworkers at risk ever again.\n  A 1991 GAO report confirmed that permanent funding lapse legislation \nis a necessity. In their report they stated, ``Shutting down the \nGovernment during temporary funding gaps is an inappropriate way to \nencourage compromise on the budget.''\n  Neither party can afford another break of faith with the American \npeople. Our constituents are tired of constantly being disappointed by \nthe actions of Congress and the President. They are tired of our not \nbeing prepared for what appears to be the inevitable. That is why this \nlegislation is so important. We want the American people to know that \nthere are some of us in Congress who are thinking ahead and who do not \nwant a replay of the last Congress.\n  I want to especially note the support of our good friend, Senator \nStevens, the distinguished Senator from Alaska and chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee. His support of this bill is crucial, and I \nthank him for it. I wish him well in overseeing the appropriations \nprocess.\n  While I am sure we will all have our differences, I am confident he \nwill be able to do his best to ensure that the Senate enacts the \nappropriations bills in an efficient and expeditious manner. Let us \nshow the American people that we have learned our lessons from the last \nCongress. Passing this preventive measure will go a long way to restore \nAmerica's faith that politics or stalled negotiations will not stop \nGovernment operations. It will prove to our constituents that we will \nnever again allow a Government shutdown or threat of Government \nshutdown to be used for political gain. I hope the Senate will act \nquickly on this important matter.\n  I thank the Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchison, who is on the \nfloor, for her continued efforts on behalf of this legislation. The \nState of Texas is a very large State. It was very heavily impacted, as \nwas my State. As I say, we fully intend to move this legislation onto \nthe supplemental appropriations bill, which should be before the body \neither this month or sometime next month.\n  I want to say that this is not an idea that Senator Hutchison and I \ncame up with. It was an idea that is supported throughout the Congress. \nWe engaged in serious and sincere negotiations with the leader, Senator \nLott, whose leadership was vital in this endeavor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona \nbecause he and I talked about this when we saw the debacle of the \nclosing of the Government 2 years ago. We thought this is not the way \nto run a railroad or a government.\n\n  We have talked about this for a long time, but it was Senator McCain \nwho said we are going to fix this and we are going to fix it in a \nresponsible way. The Senator from Arizona has provided great \nleadership, and with the Senator from Arizona, we have gotten the other \nleaders of our Congress--we certainly have Senator Stevens, the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, who deserves a lot of credit \nfor helping on this; the majority leader, Senator Lott; the majority \nwhip, Senator Nickles; Senator Craig; Senator Ashcroft, and many \nMembers have been talking about what we can do to run this Government \nin a responsible way. So the Senator from Arizona and I are introducing \nthis bill together to try to provide for a good, solid, easy way to \nmake sure that things keep going if we get bogged down in tough \nnegotiations.\n  This may seem like a kind of small, inside-the-beltway-process issue. \nPeople might say, ``A continuing resolution, so what, big deal, why are \nyou doing that?'' This small thing will have huge ramifications if any \nparts of our Government are not funded on September 30, because what \nhappens is that when you get into the heat of negotiations, threat of \nGovernment shutdowns become a leverage point for one or the other side. \nIt can work either way.\n  But the issue is the American people, the people who were mentioned \nby Senator McCain, the Federal employees and their families not knowing \nfor sure that they are going to get paychecks, people who have planned \ntheir family vacations for over a year and they go to the Grand Canyon \nand it is closed or they come to Washington, DC, to visit this Capitol \nand it is closed or they cannot get into the Smithsonian or the \nNational Gallery of Art; people who are planning their vacations or \nbusiness travel and they find their passport has expired and they \ncannot get a new passport, so their dreams go up in smoke--these are \npeople who are affected by a shutdown of Government.\n  This very small process issue becomes a real quality-of-life issue \nfor everyone in our country who is in need of regular Government \nservice. That is why we are acting now. We are trying to provide for a \nsmooth transition if we bog down in negotiations, hitting against the \nend of the fiscal year, September 30 of this year. We want to make sure \nthat if we in Congress cannot agree with the President that we are \nstill able to negotiate in good faith for what is right, rather than \nbumping up against a deadline and fearing that Government is going to \nshut down and cause a disruption in the lives of so many families in \nour country.\n  We wanted to do it right now. As Senator McCain said, we are \nintending to put this bill on the supplemental resolution that will be \ncoming before Congress probably by the end of this month. We want to do \nit now before the heat of battle so that we will know that this is not \ngoing to be a tool used by either side.\n  Some people have said, ``Does this cut for Republicans or does it cut \nfor Democrats?'' It cuts for the American people. It might go either \nway. It might hurt Republicans, it might hurt Democrats, but who will \nnot get hurt if we pass this are the people of America, and that is who \nwe are here to represent.\n  I want to talk for a minute about the 98 percent that we are going to \nfund in the continuing resolution. People may say, ``Well, why not 100 \npercent, why not 90 percent?'' We wanted 98 percent because in our \noriginal budget resolution, when Congress decided to get serious about \nbalancing the budget of this country, we set a trajectory starting at \nfiscal year 1995, actually and going to the year 2002 that would have a \ncut of about 2 percent each year in the growth rate of spending, \nbecause we felt that that was a responsible approach.\n  Ninety-eight percent is a 2-percent cut in the 1997 budget that we \nare in right now. A 2-percent cut makes sure that we are not going to \ngo over our budget projections and hurt our ability to balance the \nbudget if, in fact, we go into this continuing resolution. But it also \nfunds at 98 percent, which I think is virtually full funding, programs \nthat are ongoing and necessary.\n  If there is any agency in Government that cannot do with 98 percent \nof its present budget, then I would like to introduce them to the real \npeople in America who have had to balance budgets and cut budgets every \nday of their lives. I think 98 percent is certainly\n\n[[Page S3020]]\n\nsomething that the Government can live with, because we know that \nfamilies and businesses in this country have cut much more than 2 \npercent in any fiscal year in their own lives. We think 98 percent \ncovers expenses responsibly, but it keeps within our budget projections \nso that we have the ability to slow the rate of growth of spending, and \nso the Congress still has some leeway to make the decisions going into \nthe next fiscal year of what actually needs to be cut without running, \nif we did go 2 or 3 months, into having to cut more because we were \noverspending in some areas. So that is how we came up with the number \nof 98 percent.\n\n  Mr. President, I think we are taking a very responsible action today. \nI hope that we will have 100 percent vote in the Senate. I have not \nreally talked to anyone who is against this bill, but I think it is \nsomething if we can agree on in a bipartisan way, we will clearly make \nthe people of America sure that we are not going to have some kind of \ndisruption in their lives, whether it is their family vacation or \nbusiness travel or going into a museum or a national park they would \nlike to go into or, if you are a Federal employee or a veteran, we do \nnot want you to worry that your pay or your benefits are going to be \nthere.\n  This will provide for that smooth transition, and I hope Congress \nwill take this responsible action, do this now before we even know what \nthe issues are so that the smooth transition is there and we can \nnegotiate on the budget in a way that is responsible, that does meet \nthe needs of our country, but also makes sure that in the end, we are \ngoing to continue to march toward the year 2002 with a balanced budget \nfor the United States of America.\n  I am very pleased to be able to cosponsor with Senator McCain the \nMcCain-Hutchison Government Shutdown Prevention Act. We are joined in \nthe cosponsorship by Senators Stevens, Nickles, Craig, Ashcroft, our \nmajority leader, Senator Lott, and I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nWarner be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Those are the original cosponsors. I hope that we \nhave 100 cosponsors by the time this bill comes to the floor. I would \nlike for it to go on a voice vote. That may be a pipe dream, but, \nnevertheless, I think it would be responsible Government, and I think \nit would be right for the American people.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to join Senators Hutchison of Texas \nand McCain, Chairman Stevens, our majority leader, Senator Lott, and \nothers, as an original cosponsor of the Government Shutdown Prevention \nAct.\n  Under this bill, if fiscal year 1998 starts before any of the 13 \nregular appropriations bills become law, no part of the Government \nwould shut down because of the delay.\n  Funding would automatically continue at 98 percent of fiscal year \n1997 levels.\n  Some of us feel 98 percent is too high. And automatic continuing \nappropriations may not be the perfect way to fund programs.\n  But this process would meet two important tests, best described by \ntwo old, familiar rules of thumb:\n\n       There is an old saying: ``When you find yourself in a hole, \n     stop digging.''\n       And we all know the First Rule of Medicine: ``Do no harm.''\n\n  These two rules of thumb explain why we need the Government Shutdown \nPrevention Act.\n  This is not a long-term, structural change in the budget process. \nIt's not a plan to balance the budget. But it is a very much-needed \nstopgap reform, in case of another budget impasse. Indeed, it may \nprevent such an impasse.\n  It will help us work toward a balanced budget, without disrupting the \nlives and work of millions of innocent bystanders, both inside and \noutside the Federal Government.\n  The first step toward balancing the budget is, stop digging.\n  For 36 of the last 37 years, the government has overspent. Every \nyear, no matter what the process, no matter what the negotiations, \nspending goes up.\n  Many times--not just last year--liberals have threatened to shut down \nthe government if they didn't get their spending hikes.\n  This bill says, ``No More!'' to that upward spiral. If there's \ngridlock, at least spending will not go up as a result. It will go \ndown, just slightly.\n  We also need to remind the budget doctors: Do no harm.\n  In the last two Government shutdowns, in Idaho--We had a VA hospital \nwonder if it would have critical medicines on hand from week to week; \nwe had small businesses wonder if they should deliver goods that \nGovernment offices had ordered--and if they would ever get paid; and we \nhad Government workers first worry about feeding their families and \nmaking their house payments, and then outraged that they were ordered \nnot to do the jobs they and other taxpayers were paying for.\n\n  This bill says, ``We will not allow these innocent Americans to be \ntaken hostage again, by either side in a budget dispute.''\n  Keeping the Government open at 98 percent of current spending is a \nresponsible, fair, even generous formula. And it is consistent with the \nreasonable fiscal restraint that we have begun, with the last Congress, \nto work for.\n  The time to pass this reform is now.\n  Once the appropriations process begins in earnest, too many parties \nare going to look at any reform like this in terms of whether they win \nor lose, compared with what's in their appropriations bill, or what \nthey might get if their allies threaten another Government shutdown.\n  Now is the time we are most likely to see this reform judged on it \nown merits, for what it is: Shutdown prevention, a level playing field, \nlegislation for the public good.\n  I urge my colleagues to join as cosponsors of this bill, and to \nsupport every effort to enact this reform into law as quickly as \npossible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 549. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat certain cash rentals of farmland will not cause recapture of \nspecial estate tax valuation; to the Committee on Finance.\n  S. 550. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase \nthe gift tax exclusion to $25,000; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                    ESTATE AND GIFT TAX LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I introduce two pieces of legislation aimed \nat minimizing the burden of the estate and gift tax on Americans. The \nfirst would provide Americans with a powerful estate tax planning tool \nby raising the tax-free gift limit to $25,0000 from the current \n$10,000. The second bill would correct a longstanding agricultural \nproblem that effectively limits the ability of farmers to rent farmland \nthat they have inherited to other family members.\n  The Senate Agriculture Committee held hearings at the end of February \nto study the impact of estate and gift taxes on farmers. As a farmer \nand chairman of the Agriculture Committee, I understand the far-\nreaching effect that the inheritance tax has on rural America. \nTestimony revealed that farmers are six times more likely to pay estate \ntaxes than other Americans due to the capital-intensive nature of the \nfarm business. Commercial farms, those core farms that produce 85 \npercent of the Nation's agricultural products, may be 15 times more \nlikely to pay inheritance taxes than other individuals. As the average \nage of farmers approaches 60 years, a quarter of all farmers could \nconfront the inheritance tax over the next 20 years.\n  I have already introduced three comprehensive bills on this subject--\nthe first bill would eliminate the inheritance tax entirely; the second \nphases it out gradually; and the third raises the unified credit \nexemption to $5 million from the current $600,000 level. By raising the \nlevel of exempted property to this amount, the Federal Government would \nrelieve 96 percent of the Americans who currently file estate tax \nreturns from this burden.\n  Although repeal of this tax ultimately is the best course of action, \nI understand that sufficient momentum may not exist to achieve this \nend. In the mean time, Congress should provide Americans with estate \nplanning alternatives that help facilitate the passing of their estates \nto the next generation. These two bills further this goal.\n  The first bill would simply raise the yearly nontaxable gift amount \nfrom the current $10,000 to $25,000. Congress\n\n[[Page S3021]]\n\nunified the estate and gift titles of the Tax Code in 1976, subjecting \na decedent's lifetime taxable gifts and taxable estate to one rate \nstructure. Under current law, the first $10,000 of gifts made by a \ndonor during a calendar year to any individual are not included in the \ndonor's taxable gift amount for that year. Nor does this $10,000 gift \nlower the decedent's unified credit exemption, which allows each \nindividual to pass on $600,000 of assets without incurring estate and \ngift taxes. Over the years, inflation has eroded this $10,000 amount, \nwhich has not been increased since 1982. Under my proposal, individuals \ncould give $25,000 each year without estate and gift tax consequence. \nThrough the current practice known as ``gift splitting,'' a couple \ncould give up to $50,000 tax free each year. Raising the gift exemption \namount would be a positive first step for Congress to take in helping \nwith the transfer of family businesses and farms to the next \ngeneration.\n  My second bill would correct a longstanding agricultural problem in \nthe Tax Code that disqualifies farm heirs from receiving special use \nvaluation for estate tax purposes because they cash leased the farm \nproperty to another member of the family. Section 2032A of the Tax Code \nprovides heirs the option of valuing qualified farm property at its \ncurrent use rather than valuing the property at its highest and most \ndeveloped use. If the heir who inherited the property ceases to use it \nin its qualified use within 10 years, an additional recapture tax is \nimposed to regain the benefit of the special use valuation. Some tax \ncourts have held that the cash leasing of the property to members of \nthe decedent's family is not a qualified use, thus triggering the \nrecapture tax provision. Congress partially fixed this problem in 1988 \nin regard to spouses, but other qualified heirs remain unable to cash \nlease the property to members of the family. My legislation would \ncorrect this wrinkle in the law by allowing qualified heirs to cash \nlease the inherited special use property to members of the decedent's \nfamily or members of the spouse's family without triggering the \nrecapture tax. This bill is retroactive to December 31, 1976, when \nsection 2032A was enacted into law.\n  Congress intended to grant family businesses and farms some level of \nprotection from the estate and gift tax through section 2032A, and \nfarmers have relied on this provision for estate planning purposes over \nthe years. During the Senate Agriculture hearings on estate taxes, the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture testified that the special use valuation \nreduced the number of taxable estates and the total Federal estate and \ngift taxes for all farm estates by about one-third. The American \nFarmland Trust gave witness to the fact that more than half of farm \nproduction in the United States occurs in counties that are \nmetropolitan or adjacent to metropolitan areas. Without special use \nvaluation for estate tax purposes, much of our Nation's agricultural \nland would be valued as strip malls or housing developments, rather \nthan as farmland. Lessening the gross estate through section 2032A \nallows the next generation of farmers to maintain this land in \nagricultural production and helps slow urban sprawl. My legislation \nwould make this good provision better.\n  Mr. President, I am hopeful that my Senate colleagues will join me in \nsupporting these two estate and gift tax initiatives that provide \nAmericans with means for protecting their lifetime of savings and hard \nwork. I ask unanimous consent that both bills be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 549\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

INCREASE IN GIFT TAX EXCLUSION\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 2503(b) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (relating to exclusions from gifts) is amended \n     by striking ``$10,000'' and inserting ``$25,000''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to gifts made after December 31, 1997.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GREGG:\n  S. 551. A bill to amend the Occupational Safety and Health Act of \n1970 to make modifications to certain provisions; to the Committee on \nLabor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                       THE OSHA MODERNIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise in introducing the Occupational \nSafety and Health Modernization Act. Let me say at the outset that in \nproposing and considering OSHA reform, worker safety was my first \nconcern. I am firmly committed to ensuring a safe and healthy workplace \nand will not support legislation which puts that in jeopardy. I believe \nin this bill that I have accomplished a true modernization of OSHA \nwithout compromising the safety of our workers in any way.\n  Throughout my career in public office, I have worked to make \ngovernment more efficient and more user and consumer friendly. Federal \nGovernment agencies have grown so large and become so bureaucratic that \nthey are often not providing the kinds of personal services and proper \noversight that was originally intended when they were created. Too \noften Government carries a heavy stick, but no carrot, when it \ninteracts with individual citizens and businesses throughout our \ncountry.\n  I believe that it is high time we take a close look at how we can \nimprove the way government works and, at the same time, provide \nincentives for the private sector to act more responsibly. Americans \nwill be better served in a climate where people in government, and in \nbusiness, can work together to solve problems in a spirit of \ncooperation, rather than in an atmosphere strictly of threats, \nintimidation, and punitive measures.\n  When OSHA was enacted, its intended purpose was to make the workplace \nfree from ``recognized hazards that are causing, or likely to cause \ndeath or serious physical harm to * * * employees.'' As is the case \nwith many programs established by Congress over the years, OSHA has \ndeveloped a well-earned reputation for over-regulation. OSHA has moved \nfrom its original purpose of protecting workers to hindering businesses \nwith excessive mandates.\n  While I feel that much of the problem within OSHA is of a cultural \nnature, the bill we are introducing today will concentrate on relieving \nOSHA's oppressive and burdensome regulations, thereby removing a \nfeeling among American employers and employees that OSHA is the ``bad \ncop.'' My legislation puts in place partnerships for assuring safety \nand health in the workplace.\n  This balanced approach will include a consultation program, voluntary \ncompliance and third party certification, employee involvement, \nwarnings in lieu of citations for nonserious violations, and reduced \npenalties for nonserious violations. This legislation will use \nincentives, rather than penalties, to enhance workplace safety. It will \nallow companies with clean safety records to implement their own health \nand safety programs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n[[Page S3022]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 551\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to preserve \nfamily held forest lands, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n           THE FAMILY FORESTLAND PRESERVATION TAX ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I introduce the Family Forestland \nPreservation Tax Act of 1997 on behalf of myself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \nJeffords, Mr. D'Amato, Ms. Collins, Ms. Snowe, and Mr. Smith of New \nHampshire. This bill amends several key tax provisions to help \nlandowners keep their lands in long-term private forest ownership and \nmanagement. Without these changes, many landowners will continue to be \nforced to sell or change the use of their land.\n  This bill derives from four years of work by the Northern Forest \nLands Council [NFLC]. The NFLC was created in 1990 to seek ways for \nMaine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York to maintain the traditional \npatterns of land ownership and use in the forest that covers this \nNation's Northeast. The Northern Forest is a 26-million-acre stretch of \nland, home to 1 million residents and within a 2-hour drive of 70 \nmillion people. Nearly 85 percent of the forest is privately owned. \nTimes have changed, however, and social and economic forces have begun \nto affect the traditional patterns of land use with more and more land \nbeing marketed for development.\n  This bill will help maintain traditional patterns and, thus, preserve \nthe forest by adjusting several estate tax provisions. This bill would \nallow heirs to make postmortem donations of conservation easements on \nundeveloped estate land and allow the valuation of undeveloped land at \ncurrent use value for estate tax purposes if the owner or heir agrees \nto maintain the land in its current use for a period of 25 years. This \nbill also would establish a partial inflation adjustment for timber \nsales by allowing a tax credit not to exceed 50 percent. This will \nencourage landowners to maintain their timberland for long-term \nstewardship, which is both economically and environmentally desirable. \nAlso, the bill would eliminate the requirement that landowners \ngenerally must work 100-hours-per-year in forest management on their \nforest properties to be allowed to deduct normal management expenses \nfrom timber activities against nonpassive income. Currently, landowners \nare required to capitalize these losses until timber is harvested. This \nlegislation, though prompted by the NFLC's work, will benefit not only \nthe four states that make up the Northern Forest, but also all States \nwith forest land and all who enjoy the multiple uses of forest land. I \nurge my colleagues to support this bill, which will not only protect \nthe historic current use patterns, but also allow the rustic beauty of \nour forests to be enjoyed by all.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 552\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to regulate ammunition, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                   THE AMMUNITION SAFETY ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, no gun works without a bullet. Yet for no \ngood reason, Congress in the early 1980's--which were marked by \nterribly troubling increases in gun-caused fatalities and injuries--\nrepealed laws that regulate ammunition. And while a background check is \nrequired to stop felons from purchasing guns, no such background check \nis required to stop them from buying ammunition for guns they already \nmay have. In the meantime, bullets are getting meaner and more deadly. \nLaw enforcement officers know all too well the danger they face each \nand every time a gun is pointed at them.\n  Advances in technology only promise to make matters worse. When a \nlarge percentage of gun-related deaths involve handguns, and a larger \npercentage of gun-related deaths is accidental, it is not sensible to \nallow unrestricted manufacture, sale, and use of new, more destructive \nbullets. In 1994, 157 police officers and State troopers were killed in \nthis country. Five lost their lives in my home State of Massachusetts. \nAdditionally, more than 200 people die from the accidental use of \nhandguns every year. In 1992 alone, 233 accidental deaths occurred \nbecause of handguns. This included 6 babies, 36 children under the age \nof 14, and 8 senior citizens, 2 of whom were over the age of 80.\n  In light of these sad and disturbing facts, there is no good reason \nto permit ever more dangerous bullets to come on the market. And there \nis every good reason to keep off our streets and out of our homes \nbullets that supply handguns with the approximate destructive power of \nassault weapons.\n  That is why I am today reintroducing the Ammunition Safety Act that I \nintroduced previously in the 104th Congress. The Ammunition Safety Act \nof 1997 does two things: it reestablishes reasonable regulations for \nthe sale of handgun ammunition, and it outlaws all exceedingly \ndestructive handgun ammunition by expanding and updating the ban on \narmor-piercing handgun ammunition. This bill would provide a weapon for \nlaw enforcement to crack down on crime and would make ordinary people \nsafer from handgun violence and accidental shootings. The bill \naccomplishes these goals in three steps.\n  First, the bill reinstates and strengthens ammunition control \nlanguage that Congress repealed during the Reagan era. The bill would \nrequire dealers of handgun ammunition to be licensed by the Federal \nGovernment and would restrict interstate sale and transportation of \nhandgun ammunition to licenced dealers. The bill also would double the \nmaximum penalties for sale of handgun ammunition to and possession of \nsuch ammunition by felons and persons under age 21.\n  Second, the bill would apply Brady Bill provisions to handgun \nammunition. To prevent the sale of handgun ammunition to felons, every \npurchaser of ammunition would have to pass a background check before \nammunition could be sold to him or her. These regulations would be a \nvital tool for law enforcement to use in investigating crime, and would \nprovide equity to a system that currently monitors and restricts the \nflow of guns, but, inexplicably, not of ammunition.\n  Third, the bill expands the definition of illegal armor-piercing \nhandgun ammunition to include any new conceivable kind of armor-\npiercing bullet. The bill establishes a new method to accomplish this \ngoal. To date, no law has been able to effectively ban all armor-\npiercing bullets. It is impossible to ban what cannot be defined \nbecause vague laws are constitutionally void--and definitions to date \nhave failed to cover all armor-piercing bullets. All that existing law \ndoes is ban bullets based on the materials of which they are made. \nConsequently, bullets made of hard metal are illegal in the hope that \nthis definition will cover most armor-piercing bullets. But the \nexisting composition-based definitions fail to prevent the sale of \ncertain bullets that pierce armor like large lead bullets that are not \nintended for handguns but can be used in them.\n\n  This bill calls on the Treasury Department to define major armor-\npiercing bullets. Fulfilling this new responsibility would entail four \nsteps:\n  First, within 1 year, the Treasury Department is charged to determine \na standard test to ascertain the destructive capacity of any and all \nbullets. This will probably result in something along the lines of a \nsystem that has been employed for some testing purposes that calculates \nthe width times the depth of the hole a projectile bores in a block of \ngelatin when it is shot with no extra powder from a standard handgun at \na distance of 10 feet.\n  Second, utilizing this destructive capabilities rating test, the \nTreasury Department would then test and determine the destructive \nrating of every bullet available on the market.\n  Third, all manufacturers of bullets for sale in the United States \nwould be required to cover the costs incurred by the Treasury \nDepartment in this testing.\n  Fourth, the bill would make it illegal to manufacture, sell, import, \nuse, or possess any bullet--existing or newly invented--that has a \ndestructive rating equal to or higher than the armor-piercing \nthreshold. This would be in addition to the existing composition-based \ndefinition.\n  This bill contains reasonable exemptions. Those bullets exclusively \nmanufactured for law enforcement would be exempt; so would be those \nbullets designed for sporting purpose that Congress specifically \nexempts by law; and so would be those bullets that are proven by their \nmanufacturer at its expense to have a destructive rating below the \narmor-piercing threshold.\n  By setting the legal standard at the armor-piercing threshold, all \narmor-piercing bullets would be illegal. And there is an additional \nadvantage to setting a legal threshold in this fashion: The threshold \nwould ban more than armor-piercing bullets. It would ban any bullet \ninvented in the future that explodes on impact, that turns to shrapnel, \nthat does things today's technology cannot yet fathom, or that by any \nother means is exceptionally destructive.\n  Setting a legal standard this way draws a hard and fast line between \nthose bullets currently on the market and future bullets that do more \ndamage that we can image today. This bill says that America is \nsatisfied that the bullets of today are dangerous enough, and America \nwill tolerate no greater likelihood of accidental death as a result of \nnew bullets.\n  This bill recognizes the fact that regulating only guns is naive. \nThose who\n\n[[Page S3028]]\n\nwant to kill or injure others will always be able to find guns, but \nthey must purchase ammunition. When they do this, this bill will be \nthere to stop them.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that there is a limit to what the \nGovernment can do to stop gun violence and accidental death. But today, \nour Government is shirking its responsibility. This bill is a vital \nstep toward ensuring that our Government does what is necessary to save \nlives.\n  The law enforcement community and the public will never again have to \nreact to advertisements like the one for the famous Rhino bullet. This \nad states: ``The Rhino inflicts a wound of 8 inches in diameter. Each \nof these fragments becomes lethal shrapnel and is hurled into vital \norgans, lungs, circulatory system components, the heart and other \ntissues. The wound channel is catastrophic. Death is nearly \ninstantaneous.''\n  If this bill is enacted, opportunistic manufacturers like the one who \ncreated the Rhino bullet will have nothing to gain from advertising the \ndramatic innovations of their bullets. If an advertisement claims that \na new bullet is unusually destructive, the public will know that the \nadvertisement is either an outright lie or that the product is illegal. \nEither way, the public will know in advance that no such bullet will \never hit the street, and the public will have no cause for alarm.\n  When this bill becomes law, no new bullets that are more dangerous \nthan those of today will make it to market. When this bill becomes law, \nbullets now available for purchase end up in the wrong hands.\n  This bill is a solid step toward returning sanity and safety to our \nNation's streets and households. The Government has no greater \nresponsibility than to work toward this goal. I welcome the support of \ncolleagues who share my concerns, as many do.

A bill to inform and empower consumers in the United States \nthrough a voluntary labeling system for wearing apparel or sporting \ngoods made without abusive and exploitative child labor, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n         THE CHILD LABOR FREE CONSUMER INFORMATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that will \ninform and empower consumers in the United States through a voluntary \nlabeling system for wearing apparel and sporting goods made without the \nuse of abusive and exploitative child labor. Congressman George Miller \nis introducing companion legislation in the other body.\n  This is the second time I have come to the floor of the Senate to \nintroduce this bill, and I will continue to introduce it until it \nbecomes law.\n  I'd like to ask my colleagues to take a moment to look around. Maybe \nit's the shirt you have on right now. Or the silk tie or blouse. Or the \nsoccer ball you kick around with your kids in the backyard. Or the \ntennis shoes you wear on weekends.\n  Chances are that you have purchased something--perhaps many things--\nmade with abusive and exploitative child labor. And chances are you \nwere completely unaware that was the case. You will find a label that \ntells you what size it is, how to take care for it and what it costs. \nBut it doesn't tell you about the person who made it.\n  Mr. President, recently, the International Labor Organization [ILO] \nreleased a very grim report about the number of children who toil away \nin\n\n[[Page S3029]]\n\nabhorrent conditions. The ILO estimates that over 250 million children \nworldwide under the age of 15 are working instead of receiving a basic \neducation. Many of these children begin working in factories at the age \nof 6 or 7, some even younger. They are poor, malnourished, and often \nforced to work 60-hour weeks for little or no pay.\n  Now when I speak about child labor, I am not talking about 17-year-\nolds helping out on the family farm or running errands after school. I \nam speaking about children, often under 12 years old, who are forced to \nwork long hours in hazardous and dangerous conditions, many as slaves, \ninstead of going to school.\n  On September 23, 1993, the Senate appropriately put itself on record \nas expressing its principled opposition to the abhorrent practice of \nexploiting children for commercial gain and asserting that it should be \nthe policy of the United States to prohibit the importation of products \nmade through the use of abusive and exploitative child labor by passing \na sense of the Senate Resolution I introduced. In my view, this was the \nfirst step toward ending child labor.\n  Mr. President, never has the issue of child labor in the garment \nindustry been more prominent than today. Last year, talk show host \nKathie Lee Gifford learned that some of the garments with her name on \nthem were being produced by children. She did not bury her head in the \nsand. Instead, she reacted quickly and decisively to heighten awareness \nabout the issue of abusive and exploitative child labor.\n  Americans in Des Moines or Dallas or Detroit may say, ``What does \nthis have to do with us?'' It is quite simple. By protecting the rights \nof workers everywhere, we will be protecting jobs and opportunities \nhere at home. A U.S. worker cannot compete with a 12-year-old working \n12 hours a day for 12 cents.\n  Last year, the United States imported almost 50 percent of the \nwearing apparel sold in this country and the garment industry netted \n$34 billion. According to the Department of Commerce, last year, the \nUnited States imported 494.1 million pairs of athletic footwear and \nproduced only 65.3 million here at home. That means that we imported \nenough shoes to encircle the earth five and a half times.\n  As I have traveled around the country and spoken with people about \nthe issue of abusive and exploitative child labor, I have found that \nconsumers--ordinary Americans--want to get involved. They want \ninformation. They want to know if the products they are buying are made \nby children.\n  According to a survey sponsored by Marymount University, more than \nthree out of four Americans said they would avoid shopping at stores if \nthey were aware that the goods sold there were made by exploitative and \nabusive child labor. They also said that they would be willing to pay \nan extra $1 on a $20 garment if it were guaranteed to be made under \nlegitimate circumstances. I ask unanimous consent to enter this study \ninto the Record.\n  Mr. President, it is obvious that consumers don't want to reward \ncompanies with their hard-earned dollars by buying products made with \nabusive and exploitative child labor.\n  This issue demands our attention. My legislation, the Child Labor \nFree Consumer Information Act 1997, will inform and empower consumers \nin the United States through a voluntary labeling system for wearing \napparel and sporting goods made without abusive and exploitative child \nlabor. In my view, a system of voluntary labeling holds the best \npromise of giving consumers the information they want--and giving the \ncompanies that manufacture these products the recognition they deserve.\n  The crux of this legislation is to provide the framework for members \nof the wearing apparel and sporting goods industry, labor \norganizations, consumer advocacy and human rights groups along with the \nSecretaries of Commerce, Treasury, and Labor to establish the labeling \nstandard and develop a system to assure compliance that items were not \nmade with abusive and exploitative child labor. Thus, ensuring \nconsumers that the garment or pair of tennis shoes they purchase was \nmade without abusive and exploitative child labor.\n  In my view, Congress can't do it alone through legislation. The \nDepartment of Labor can't do it alone through enforcement. It takes all \nof us from the private sector to labor and human rights groups to take \nresponsibility, to come together to end abusive and exploitative child \nlabor. And I am pleased to say there has recently been promising action \nto that end.\n  Yesterday, an article in the New York Times appeared announcing a \ntentative agreement between human rights and labor leaders and some \nmembers of the apparel industry to adopt a code of conduct and a \npromise to form an association to provide consumers with information on \nthe items they purchase. This is a praise worthy initiative and I am \nglad that my discussions with President Clinton on the issue of child \nlabor have helped lead to this development. Now, we must take the \nlogical next step to inform and assure consumers that the goods they \npurchase are not made with abusive and exploitative child labor. My \nbill has provisions for a labeling system that will inform consumers \nthat the wearing apparel and sporting goods they purchase are not made \nby the sweat and toil of children, as well as enforcement provisions to \nassure consumers that the label has integrity. Until an effective and \nreliable labeling and monitoring system is in place, consumers can \nnever truly be sure that the goods they purchase were not made by an \nexploited child. I look forward to continuing my work with my \ncolleagues and the White House on strengthening this initiative to \ninform and empower consumers. That is what the American consumer \ndemands and deserves.\n\n  Mr. President, when the private sector decides to take speak up--it \ncertainly can make a difference. Recently, in Bangladesh, the \nBangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association has agreed \nto work with the International Labor Organization to take children out \nof the garment factories and put them into school--where they belong. \nAs of July 1996, more than 110 schools for former child workers have \nopened, serving nearly 2,000 children. So, if we can do it in \nBangladesh, then we can do it elsewhere.\n  Mr. President, let me be clear, companies can choose to use the label \nor not to. This bill is not about the big government telling the \nprivate sector what to do. This bill is centered around this \nfundamental principle: Let the Buyer Be Aware. This ``Truth in \nLabeling'' initiative is based on the principle that a fully informed \nAmerican consumer will make the right, and moral, choice and vote \nagainst abusive and exploitative child labor with their pocketbook.\n  We have seen such an approach work effectively with the Rugmark label \nfor hand-knotted carpets from India. It is operating in some European \ncountries. Consumers who want to buy child labor-free carpets can just \nlook for the Rugmark label. I visited the Rugmark headquarters in New \nDelhi, India last week. Mr. President, this initiative is working. It \nhas succeeded in taking children out of the factories and putting them \ninto schools while providing consumers with the information they need.\n  By the end of April, half a million carpets will have received the \nRugmark label and been shipped to stores in Germany. Rugmark licenses \nalready provide 30 percent of German carpet imports from India. And I \nam pleased to say that there are two wholesalers in New York that offer \ncarpets with the Rugmark label. I am hopeful that by the end of the \nyear there will be at least 20 importers in the United States.\n  Mr. President, the progress that has been made on eradicating abusive \nand exploitative child labor is irreversible. Therefore we must \ncontinue to move forward. And I believe my bill allows us to do just \nthat. It allows the consumer to know more about the products they buy \nand give companies that use the label the recognition they deserve.\n  Our nation began this century by working to end abusive and \nexploitative child labor in America, let us close this century by \nending child labor around the world. I urge my colleagues to support my \nbill.\n  I hope that we will be able to vote on this piece of legislation in \nthe near future so that we can give consumers the information they \ndeserve to make informed decisions.\n\n[[Page S3030]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 554\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The new study \n     shows that consumers would avoid stores that sell goods made \n     in sweatshops and be more inclined to shop at stores working \n     actively to prevent garment worker abuses.\n       According to the survey, more than three-fourths of \n     Americans would avoid shopping at stores if they were aware \n     that the stores sold goods made in sweatshops. Consumers also \n     are willing to pay a price for assurances that the goods they \n     buy are not made in sweatshops. An overwhelming majority (84 \n     percent) say they would be willing to pay up to an extra $1 \n     on a $20 garment if it were guaranteed to be made in a \n     legitimate shop.\n       The study, sponsored by Marymount's Center for Ethical \n     Concerns and the Department of Fashion Design and \n     Merchandising, was prompted by the recent discovery of \n     sweatshops operating in the United States in which illegal \n     aliens smuggled into the country were forced to produce \n     garments under almost slave labor conditions. In one factory, \n     raided earlier this year by U.S. officials, workers had been \n     confined in a barbed wire-enclosed compound and forced to \n     work between 16 and 22 hours a day. Workers were paid less \n     than $1 an hour and essentially held captive until they had \n     repaid the cost of their passage to the United States, a \n     process that took years in some cases.\n       Since these revelations, the U.S. Department of Labor has \n     been working with retailers to encourage greater diligence in \n     policing the industry voluntarily and plans in the near \n     future to release a list of companies that have agreed to \n     cooperate in these efforts. The new study shows that a \n     substantial majority of Americans (66 percent) would be more \n     likely to patronize stores that they know are cooperating \n     with law enforcement officials to prevent sweatshops. If such \n     a list were published, more than two-thirds (69 percent) of \n     consumers say they would take this information into account \n     when deciding where to do their shopping this holiday season.\n       ``It is gratifying to know that Americans condemn these \n     sweatshop conditions and are willing to demonstrate that \n     commitment when they shop, even if it costs them a few \n     pennies. The industry, including retailers, has a \n     responsibility to make sure it is not selling garments made \n     in sweatshops, and the public is willing to hold them \n     accountable,'' said Sr. Eymard Gallagher, RSHM, president of \n     Marymount University. ``Despite the competitiveness in the \n     industry, we can't close our eyes to these kinds of \n     conditions that we thought had disappeared years ago,'' she \n     said.\n       The telephone survey of 1,008 randomly selected adults, was \n     conducted by ICR Survey Research Group of Media, PA, at the \n     request of Marymount. The survey has a margin of error of \n     plus or minus 3 percentage points.\n       Marymount University's fashion design and fashion \n     merchandising programs are among the leaders in this field in \n     the United States. Marymount is an independent, Catholic \n     university, emphasizing excellence in teaching, attention to \n     the individual, and values and ethics across the curriculum. \n     Located in Arlington, Virginia, Marymount enrolls 4,200 men \n     and women in its 34 undergraduate and 24 master's degree \n     programs.\n\n\n                    study background and objectives\n\n       United States officials recently discovered that workers \n     who had been smuggled into this country were making garments \n     in sweatshops where they were forced to work long hours under \n     extremely poor working conditions for less than the minimum \n     wage. As a result, this research was conducted to determine: \n     Whether respondents would avoid shopping at retailers if \n     aware they sold garments made in sweatshops; Whether \n     respondents would be more inclined to shop in retail stores \n     cooperating with law enforcement officials to prevent \n     sweatshops; Whether respondents would be willing to pay $1 \n     more for a $20 garment if it were guaranteed to be made in a \n     legitimate shop, and; Whether respondents would be more \n     likely this holiday season to shop in retail stores on a \n     forthcoming list of retailers assisting authorities in their \n     effort to end abuse of United States garment workers. Whether \n     the manufacturers or the retailers should have the \n     responsibility of preventing sweatshops.\n\n\n                          research methodology\n\n       The research entailed a telephone interview insert in ICR \n     Survey Research Group's EXCEL Omnibus. EXCEL includes a \n     national random sample of approximately 1,000 adults (18+), \n     half male and half female.\n       Interviewing was conducted from Friday, October 27 through \n     Tuesday, October 31. A total of 1008 interviews were \n     completed. Data has been weighted to reflect the U.S. \n     population 18 years of age and older (188,700,000).\n\n\n               in a nutshell . . . here are the findings\n\n                Retailers--beware of sweatshop garments\n\n       Americans overwhelmingly support the idea of officials \n     publishing a list of retailers who assist law enforcement \n     agencies in their effort to end abuse of United States \n     garment workers. Seven-in-ten respondents indicate they would \n     be more likely to shop at the stores this holiday season that \n     cooperate to end garment worker abuse. Consumers are willing \n     to pay a price for assurances that goods they buy are not \n     made in sweatshops. 84% of consumers would pay an additional \n     $1 on a $20 item if they knew the garment was guaranteed to \n     be made in a legitimate shop.\n       Most Americans (76%) blame the existence of sweatshops on \n     the manufacturers who employ the contractors or workers. \n     However, if consumers knew a retailer sold garments that were \n     made in sweatshops, nearly eight-in-ten would avoid shopping \n     there. As the holiday season starts to kick-off, retailers \n     would be wise to ensure their garments were in fact made in \n     legitimate shops. Given the potential for enticing customers \n     with legitimately made garments, and the potential for losing \n     customers if caught selling sweatshop-made garments, \n     promoting legitimately made garments provides a strategic \n     business opportunity for retailers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 555. A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to require that \nat least 85 percent of funds appropriated to the Environmental \nProtection Agency from the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund \nbe distributed to States to carry out cooperative agreements for \nundertaking corrective action and for enforcement of subtitle I of that \nAct; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n THE LEAKING UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANK TRUST FUND AMENDMENTS ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am introducing, The Leaking \nUnderground Storage Tank Trust Fund Amendments Act of 1997. This \nlegislation, if enacted, would change who controls the bulk of the \nmoney from the trust fund, and the purposes for which the money can be \nspent. The legislation is simple, it mandates that 85 percent of the \nmoney in the trust fund must be allocated to the States. It's my view \nthat since the States are responsible for the bulk of underground \nstorage tank enforcement and cleanup, they should have greater control \nover the dollars.\n  This legislation also broadens the purposes for which trust fund \ndollars can be spent. Under this legislation States would have the \nauthority to use the funds to meet the greater demand for cleanup.\n  There has been some concern expressed about how trust fund money has \nbeen targeted up to this point. For example, since inception of the \nprogram only 1 percent of the money has been used for actual cleanup of \norphan tanks. The other 99 percent has gone to administration and \nenforcement. I think there should be some discussion on whether this \nmoney can be spent with greater environmental benefit. Instead of \ntargeting 99 percent to administration and enforcement, perhaps it \nwould be a better idea to help owners and operators who need financial \nassistance to handle their problem. Since the money for assistance \nwould come from a dedicated tax, and not the general fund, why not get \nas big an environmental bang for the buck as possible. By taking this \naction we may also be able to have more appropriated out of the trust \nfund every year. As some may be aware, only a small portion of the $1.5 \nbillion in the trust fund\n\n[[Page S3033]]\n\nis appropriated every year. If we can show that the money being \nappropriated is directly cleaning up tanks, we can certainly make a \nbetter claim for those dollars.\n  Finally, I understand that EPA and some Members have concerns with \nthis legislation. I think that working with Chairman Smith and Chairman \nChafee, and their staffs, we can craft legislation that will be signed \ninto law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Helms, Mr. \n        Cochran, Mr. Nickles, and Mr. Sessions):\n  S. 556. A bill to provide for the allocation of funds from the Mass \nTransit Account of the Highway Trust Fund, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                        mass transit legislation\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nattempts to level the playing field for transit donor States across the \ncountry. In addition to myself, Senators Tim Hutchinson, Helms, \nCochran, Nickles, and Sessions are all original cosponsors.\n  Federal Transit dollars are distributed according to the Federal \nTransit Act as amended by the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act [ISTEA]. Similar to highway dollars, transit dollars are \ncollected at the gas pump and are distributed by both formula and \ndiscretionary grants.\n  States such as Oklahoma that do not receive back all of the revenues \nthat they send to the Federal mass transit account are considered donor \nStates. Unfortunately, these States are not getting nearly as much back \nin Federal funding as they contribute. In 1995, Oklahoma contributed \nabout $30 million and only received back about $8 million from the mass \ntransit account of the highway trust fund. This inequity allows for \nStates with more urban centers to receive more dollars back than they \nactually contribute to the Federal account. Basically, donor States are \nsubsidizing large metropolitan areas with the portion of the funds that \nwe never get back. This puts smaller and rural areas at a disadvantage \nin trying to maintain transit systems whether it be buses or light \nrail. Rural areas are, too, interested in conserving fuel and \ncontributing to better air quality.\n  My proposal is designed to address this critical transit problem as \nwe move deeper into the ISTEA reauthorization debate. Under my bill, \neach State that contributes $50 million or less into the Federal Mass \nTransit Account will be guaranteed to receive back no less than 80 \npercent of its apportionment.\n  States should reasonably be able to expect that local dollars will be \nused for local transit needs.

A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to exclude beverage alcohol \ncompounds emitted from aging warehouses from the definition of volatile \norganic compounds; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n  the clean air act amendments distilled spirits clarification act of \n                                  1997\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation \nwhich will correct an oversight in the Clean Air Act Amendments of \n1990. This legislation will clarify the treatment under the act of \nbeverage alcohol compounds emitted from aging warehouses.\n  Under the current statute, EPA classifies beverage alcohol emissions \n(ethanol) as a volatile organic compound [VOC]. VOC's react in the \natmosphere to form ozone. Ethanol, however, has been proven to play an \ninsignificant role in ozone formation because of its low reactivity.\n  Despite scientific evidence proving the minimal value of these \ncontrols (at exorbitant cost) the EPA has wrongly refused repeated \nrequests regarding removal of restrictions on beverage distillation. If \ncontrol technology is implemented, this would mean process changes in \nthe historical aging process that makes each beverage unique.\n  Aging is arguably one of the most important components of the \nproduction process. For example, Bourbon whisky, which is a distinctive \nproduct of the United States, and Kentucky, must be aged at least 2 \nyears in wooden barrels according to Federal regulation. This process \ninvolves natural oxidation which requires the passage of air and \nethanol vapors into and out of the barrels. Any effort to alter this \nnatural aging process through controls on temperature, ventilation \npatterns, and humidity, could change the actual physical properties of \nBourbon whisky, thus altering the distinguishing taste associated with \ncertain brands.\n  Mr. President, I agree that we must protect the environment that we \nall share. However, when extremist, inflexible regulation threatens an \nentire industry at minimal, if any, environmental return, we must \nreevaluate our priorities. I urge my colleagues to join me in restoring \na little sanity to our regulatory process.\n  I ask unanimous consent for the bill to be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nrecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 557\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DEFINITION OF VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS.\n\n       Section 302(s) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7602(s)) is \n     amended by adding the following at the end thereof: ``Such \n     term shall not include beverage alcohol compounds (ethanol) \n     emitted from aging warehouses.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 558. A bill to provide for a study and report regarding the \npotential recruitment, hiring, or retention of qualified former \nofficers of the Royal Hong Kong Police by Federal law enforcement \nagencies; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n       THE ROYAL HONG KONG POLICE ANTICRIME STRATEGY ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the forthcoming reversion of Hong Kong to \nChinese control is, as a matter of diplomacy, the mere implementation \nof a diplomatic agreement between the United Kingdom and the government \nof the People's Republic of China.\n  But it is, of course, far more complicated, and its implications far \nmore profound. The challenges ahead are many. Will Beijing abide by the \nrule of law and uphold its commitment to the United Kingdom and the \npeople of Hong Kong to ``one country, two systems?'' Will America and \nthe major powers have the political will to challenge China should they \nrenege on their commitments?\n  Nowhere are the challenges of reversion greater than for United \nStates law enforcement--for Hong Kong has long been a center of the \ninternational criminal organizations which control the trade in Asian \nheroin, money laundering is on the rise, and there are a host of other \nlaw enforcement problems.\n  Here in the United States, we see the related problems of Asian \norganized crime, or Tongs, heroin trafficking from Asia through Hong \nKong, alien smuggling, arms trafficking, and the\n\n[[Page S3034]]\n\nuse of Hong Kong as a money laundering center for criminals. \nUnfortunately, the capacity of U.S. law enforcement to respond to this \nthreat is limited by the fact that we simply do not have enough agents \nwith the language skills, intelligence background and contacts to \ninfiltrate Asian organized crime.\n  This is why I am introducing today the Royal Hong Kong Police \nAnticrime Strategy Act of 1997. I am pleased to be joined in doing so \nby Senator Grassley, my colleague on the Senate International Caucus on \nNarcotics Control.\n  This legislation seeks to take advantage of a potential opportunity--\neven in the face of all the challenges which will come with the \nreversion of Hong Kong. To describe in simplest terms the opportunity--\nas officers of the Royal Hong Kong Police leave their force, U.S. law \nenforcement agencies may be able to bolster our anti-drug, money \nlaundering, alien smuggling and Asian organized crime capabilities with \nthe unique knowledge of the former officers of the Royal Hong Kong \nPolice.\n\n  For example, it could be of significant value to federal law \nenforcement to simply retain on a one-time or continuing basis former \nRoyal Hong Kong Police personnel to use them to help build a major \nAsian-Crime investigative database. Such a database could form the \nbackbone of U.S. investigations in the years to come. I offer this \nsimply as a means to illustrate to my Senate colleagues the potential \nlaw enforcement benefits of this legislation. Of course, the best uses \nmust be decided by the law enforcement professionals within the Justice \nand Treasury Departments.\n  I also point out that I have long worked on this issue--beginning \nwith a hearing with the FBI on the issue of Asian organized crime way \nback in August, 1990. My January 1992 drug strategy also called on the \nBush Administration to determine if these police officers could be of \nassistance. In fact, a DEA operation began in 1992 which used some \nretired Royal Hong Kong Police in a very limited capacity to provide \ntranslation services to support investigations of Asian heroin \ntrafficking.\n  I was also pleased to include a provision offered by Senator Roth in \nthe 1994 Biden Crime Bill to study this issue--unfortunately, this \nprovision was dropped from the final agreement due to opposition in the \nHouse.\n  But, today, with the continuing rise of the heroin trade, I am \nreiterating my call for us to address this issue. The legislation I \noffer today calls on the Attorney General and the Treasury Secretary to \nreport to Congress on the need and potential benefits--as well as any \npotential security or administrative problems--of adding former \nofficers of the Royal Hong Kong Police to our federal law enforcement \nagencies.\n  And, if the benefits exist, this legislation authorizes the addition \nof up to 200 former officers to assist in the investigation of \ninternational drug trafficking, alien smuggling, money laundering and \norganized crime undertaken by the Justice and Treasury Departments.\n  Mr. President, preparing for the reversion of Hong Kong primarily \nmeans preparing for the challenges ahead--but it also requires us to \nrecognize the opportunities ahead. Taking advantage of this opportunity \nis what the ``Royal Hong Kong Police Anticrime Act of 1997'' is all \nabout.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the legislation appear \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 558\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Biden in \noffering the Royal Hong Kong Police Anticrime Strategy Act of 1997. As \nthe recent State Department report on international narcotics control \nmakes clear, the criminal activities of major Asian organized crime \ngroups directly affects the United States. Whether we are talking about \nalien smuggling, heroin trafficking, or spreading corruption, major \nAsian-based gangs, many operating from Hong Kong, daily affect the \nquality of life of many of our citizens. Their activities to launder \ntheir illegal incomes threatens the integrity of our banking and \nfinancial systems.\n  With the transfer of Hong Kong to China, much of the current \nexpertise on these criminal organizations now based in the Royal Hong \nKong Police will be lost. What this legislation will do, and it is only \na first step, is to give us the opportunity to examine ways of \nretaining that expertise, of putting it to use in our efforts to stop a \ndespicable trade in human beings and to improve our capability to stop \nthe flow of dangerous drugs that do so much to make our neighborhoods \nand streets unsafe. The proposal is innovative and timely. While only \nauthorizing a study, the present proposal will give us the opportunity \nto explore ways to ensure the effectiveness of our international \nnarcotics control efforts.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself and Mr. Kennedy) (by request):\n  S. 559. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax relief to middle-income families who are struggling to pay for \ncollege, to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide \nsignificantly increased financial aid for needy students, provide \nuniversal access to postsecondary education, reduce student loan costs \nwhile improving student loan benefits, to streamline the Federal Family \nEducation Loan Program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  S. 560. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide \nsignificantly increased financial aid for needy students, provide \nuniversal access to postsecondary education, reduce student loan costs \nwhile improving student loan benefits, to streamline the Federal Family \nEducation Loan Program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nLabor and Human Resources.\n\n\n    the hope and opportunity for postsecondary education act of 1997\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, on behalf of the administration, I am \nintroducing, with Senator Kennedy, the Hope and Opportunity for \nPostsecondary Education [HOPE] Act of 1997. This legislation includes \nthe President's higher education tax and spending proposals to help \nmake a college education more affordable for American families.\n  During the last decade, college costs have soared. Federal student \naid programs have been instrumental in helping many people get a good \neducation. But aid to students has not kept pace with the cost. In the \n1970's, Pell grants made up 77 percent of the cost of going to college; \ntoday they make up only about 30 percent of the cost. Many of these \nstudents, and those who don't qualify for assistance, are taking on \nlarger and larger amounts of debt. This has many consequences both for \nthe student and for the Nation. Concerns about high levels of \nindebtedness affects students' choices about where to go to school or \nwhat to study and, for some, makes it impossible to get a degree at \nall. This means we are not developing the talents of our people to the \nfullest, and that has significant costs for our Nation.\n  Access to higher education is clearly the key to our future. Not only \ndo we know that those who attend college earn higher incomes, but \nhaving a well-educated work force is also important for our Nation's \noverall economic growth and ability to compete in the global \nmarketplace.\n  I applaud the President for his initiatives in this area--his plan is \na good and thoughtful one. He deserves a lot of credit for taking on \nthis important issue and insisting that it be part of the national \nagenda. His bill helps people from a wide range of backgrounds who need \nhelp, from middle-class families who are struggling to make ends meet \nto people from low-income families who are trying to escape poverty and \nmake decent lives for themselves. He does this by increasing the \nmaximum Pell grant to $3,000 and he reduces student loan interest \ncosts.\n  I do want to say that I have some concerns about aspects of this \nbill. I believe we have an important opportunity to help lower income \npeople further by making the tax credit be refundable. We did that in \nS. 12, legislation introduced earlier this year by Senate Democrats. I \nalso believe that we should allow the credit to be combined with other \naid, again as we did in S. 12.\n  Despite these concerns, I am pleased to introduce this legislation \nfor the administration, because I believe it helps us move forward to \nfind ways to improve the affordability of education in this country.\n  This is not a partisan issue: all families worry about the cost of \ncollege. We ought to find common ground to make a college education \nmore affordable. It's time to hold hearings so that we can examine \nthese issues and advance the public dialog. Higher education is too \nimportant to the future of this Nation to divide us. I am committed to \nthis goal and look forward to working with my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle to find solutions to this problem.\n  Senator Kennedy and I are also introducing, by request, a separate \npiece of legislation that includes the non-tax-related provisions of \nthe HOPE legislation. We are doing this because, historically, these \nprograms have been in the Labor Committee's jurisdiction, and we want \nto make sure the Labor Committee considers them fully.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the administration's \nletter of transmittal, and a section-by-section analysis of the HOPE \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 559\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That this \n     Act may be cited as the ``Hope and Opportunity for \n     Postsecondary Education Act of 1997''.\n\n                        TITLE I--TAX PROVISIONS\n\n\n         short title; amendment of 1986 code; table of contents\n\n       Sec. 101.

Albert Gore, Jr.,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are enclosing for the consideration \n     of the Congress the Administration's legislative proposal \n     entitled ``The Hope and Opportunity for Postsecondary \n     Education (HOPE) Act of 1997.'' This bill, which includes \n     higher education tax and spending proposals, would promote \n     access to college for low- and middle-income students and \n     provide tax relief to middle-income families struggling to \n     pay for college. These proposals are fully paid for in the \n     President's fiscal year 1998 budget proposal. An identical \n     letter is being sent to the Speaker of the House.\n       The need for higher education--both for the individual and \n     the Nation--has never been greater. Economic prosperity in \n     the next century will come through productivity gains and \n     technological advances that require an adaptable and highly-\n     skilled work force. Those nations that provide their citizens \n     with opportunities to gain higher level skills and to learn \n     throughout a lifetime will thrive.\n       The Federal student aid programs have already opened the \n     doors to college for millions of Americans. Despite making \n     tremendous gains in access to college, students from lower-\n     income families still are far less likely to attend college \n     or earn a degree than are students from higher-income \n     families. Even students from middle-income families are only \n     one-half as likely to earn a college degree as those from \n     upper-income families. This gap shows that we must do more to \n     make higher education readily available to all.\n       To enable all of our citizens, young and old, to gain \n     access to higher education and training, and to strengthen \n     the Nation's ability to compete in the global economy, the \n     Administration proposes a set of integrated grant, loan and \n     tax relief measures that would: create HOPE Scholarships, \n     higher education tax deductions and other tax benefits worth \n     $38.6 billion between fiscal years 1997 and 2002; create \n     strong incentives for saving to help families pay for \n     postsecondary education costs; significantly increase the \n     amount of grant aid available to needy students through the \n     Pell Grant program; and reduce up-front fees in the loan \n     programs to put an additional $2.6 billion over five years in \n     the hands of students. These targeted financing proposals \n     would help our citizens acquire and maintain the knowledge \n     and skills they need to be productive throughout their \n     lives.\n\n\n                        title i--tax provisions\n\n       This section of the bill would create a HOPE Scholarship \n     tax credit to help make 14 years of education the standard \n     for all Americans. A taxpayer could claim a $1,500 per-\n     student nonrefundable tax credit for tuition and required \n     fees for enrollment of the taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse, \n     or the taxpayer's dependent in a postsecondary degree or \n     certificate program.\n       The credit would be available for payments made after \n     December 31, 1996 with respect to education commencing on or \n     after July 1, 1997. The amount of the credit would be reduced \n     by other non-taxable Federal educational grants, such as Pell \n     Grants, received by the student. The student could claim the \n     credit for two different years, so long as he or she is \n     enrolled on at least a half-time basis in each of those \n     years. The HOPE Scholarship would be available for a second \n     year only if the student had obtained at least a B-minus \n     average for all prior postsecondary course work completed \n     before the beginning of the second taxable year. A credit \n     would not be available in any year for a student who had been \n     convicted of a drug-related felony. The maximum credit amount \n     would be indexed for inflation beginning in 1998.\n       In addition to the HOPE Scholarship tax credit, an annual \n     tax deduction of up to $5,000 per family ($10,000 after 1998) \n     would be permitted for the tuition costs of college, graduate \n     study, job training, or retraining for the taxpayer, or the \n     taxpayer's spouse or dependents. The deduction would be \n     available to all taxpayers, whether or not they itemized \n     deductions. Because the deduction would be available for \n     students enrolled in as little as one course at a time if the \n     course is career-enhancing, it would be especially valuable \n     for working adults seeking to improve their job skills.\n       A taxpayer could claim either the HOPE Scholarship tax \n     credit or the tax deduction but not both, for a student's \n     expenses in the same tax year. In addition, both the credit \n     and deduction would be phased out for taxpayers filing a \n     joint return with adjusted gross income (AGI) between $80,000 \n     and $10,000. For taxpayers filing a head-of-household or \n     single return, the credit and deduction would be phased out \n     for those with AGI between $50,000 and $70,000. The phase-out \n     ranges would be indexed for inflation beginning in 2001. \n     Education expenses qualifying for the credit and deduction \n     include tuition and fees paid to institutions eligible to \n     participate in Federal student aid programs under the Higher \n     Education Act (HEA).\n       This bill would exempt from taxation up to $5,250 annually \n     in employer-provided educational assistance and restore this \n     benefit for graduate level education. In addition, beginning \n     in 1998, small businesses would be eligible for a new credit \n     equal to 10 percent of amounts spent on worker training \n     provided by third parties. The bill also would provide tax \n     relief for loan forgiveness so that students whose loans are \n     forgiven by charitable or educational institutions in \n     return for community service, and borrowers whose Direct \n     Loans are forgiven after 25 years in the Income Contingent \n     Repayment plan, are not taxed on the forgiven amount.\n       As you know, in addition to the tax proposals contained in \n     the HOPE Act, the President has also proposed targeted tax \n     cuts to help middle-income Americans raise their young \n     children and save for the future. Under the economic and \n     technical assumptions of the Office of Management and Budget \n     (OMB), which we stand behind, all of these tax cuts could be \n     made permanent, and the President's budget would still reach \n     balance in 2002.\n       At the same time, the President has committed to reach \n     balance in 2002 under the assumptions of the Congressional \n     Budget Office (CBO) as well. For the sole purpose of ensuring \n     that CBO continues to score the President's budget as \n     balanced in 2002, we have included in this proposal, and \n     elsewhere, sunset dates that would end most of our tax cuts \n     after the year 2000. However, the President's budget also \n     includes a fast-track procedure for the Congress to extend \n     the tax cuts if, as we believe, OMB's assumptions prove more \n     accurate than CBO's, and we can still reach balance in 2002.\n\n\n                    title ii--student aid provisions\n\n       The Administration is proposing funding sufficient to \n     establish the maximum Pell Grant award at $3,000 in its \n     fiscal year 1998 appropriation request, up from $2,700 in \n     fiscal year 1997. The HOPE Act contains language that would \n     reinforce this funding request by requiring that the Pell \n     Grant maximum award be at least $3,000, a level that is \n     needed to help restore the value of the grant and to provide \n     a meaningful level of support.\n\n[[Page S3052]]\n\n       This bill also proposes substantial improvements in the way \n     financial need is determined for disadvantaged independent \n     students who do not have dependents (other than a spouse). \n     The bill would set the income protection allowances for \n     independent students who do not have dependents in the same \n     way as the allowances used for other students. The \n     Administration has included an amendment in the 1998 \n     appropriation language for the 1998-99 award year. This bill \n     would make a permanent change to the HEA for later years.\n       The proposed bill would amend the HEA to reduce loan fees \n     for students by $2.6 billion over five years and lower \n     interest rates for Unsubsidized Stafford Loan borrowers by \n     one percentage point, thereby saving students an additional \n     $1 billion over five years. The bill also would standardize \n     benefits for students, to the extent practicable, across the \n     Direct Loan and Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) \n     programs, and address a number of structural problems and \n     inefficiencies in the FFEL program.\n       Under this bill, borrowers would realize substantial \n     benefits as loan origination fees are cut in half for the \n     neediest students and by 25 percent for others. Interest \n     rates on Unsubsidized Stafford loans would be lowered by one \n     percentage point while borrowers are in school. Lenders \n     would be required to offer the same terms to all borrowers \n     for the same type of loan--just as the government is \n     required to do under the Direct Loan program. Borrowers \n     who consolidate loans within FFEL would receive the same \n     interest rates and comparable benefits to those who \n     consolidate in Direct Loans.\n       This bill proposes a number of changes to the FFEL guaranty \n     agency system in recognition that these State and private \n     nonprofit entities are not the ultimate guarantors of FFEL \n     and act only as administrative agents of the Federal \n     government. Because the Federal government is the sole \n     insurer of FFEL loans, the Secretary would undertake the \n     obligation to pay lenders directly using his agents and \n     recall guaranty agency reserves over the next five years, \n     saving some $2.5 billion.\n       To address structural deficiencies that hamper default \n     prevention activities, guaranty agencies would be authorized \n     to retain no more than 18.5 percent of default collections--\n     comparable to the Department's cost of collections--not the \n     arbitrary 27 percent guaranty agencies retain under current \n     law. Guaranty agencies would receive a default prevention fee \n     from lenders when delinquent loans are brought current. To \n     further encourage default prevention, lender risk-sharing \n     would be increased to 5 percent from 2 percent, and lenders \n     would be required to offer borrowers certain additional \n     flexible repayment options now offered under the Direct Loan \n     program.\n       A more complete summary of the bill's provisions is \n     contained in the Section-By-Section Analysis enclosed with \n     this letter.\n       This bill is part of an ambitious national agenda--an \n     agenda for the next century that places education at the \n     center and recognizes that all workers need to possess ever \n     higher levels of skills throughout their lifetime. Provisions \n     in this bill reflect the Administration's strong belief that \n     we must raise educational expectations and make 14 years of \n     education the standard for every American. At the same time, \n     this bill offers substantial increases in benefits to needy \n     students, significant, targeted education tax relief to \n     working and middle-income families, and lifelong learning \n     opportunities for all Americans.\n       The HOPE Act creates a powerful new way for the Nation to \n     invest in its citizens and the economy. I urge you to join me \n     in supporting this legislation. The Office of Management and \n     Budget advises that there is no objection to the submission \n     of this legislation to the Congress and that its enactment \n     would be in accord with the program of the President.\n     Pay-As-You-Go Requirement\n       The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 requires that \n     all revenue and direct spending legislation meet a pay-as-\n     you-go requirement. That is, no such bill should result in an \n     increase in the deficit; and if it does, it will trigger a \n     sequester if not fully offset.\n\n                              EDUCATION TAX INCENTIVES--CHANGE IN FEDERAL REVENUES                              \n                                              [Millions of dollars]                                             \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                              1997     1998      1999      2000      2001      2002      97-02  \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPAYGO--on-budget...........................    -138    -4,479    -6,662    -8,372    -8,819    -9,349    -37,819\nNon-PAYGO--off-budget......................     -28      -210      -207      -234       -60         0       -739\n    Total Receipts--Effects................    -166    -4,689    -6,869    -8,606    -8,879    -9,349    -38,558\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                         STUDENT LOAN PROVISIONS--CHANGE IN BUDGET AUTHORITY AND OUTLAYS                        \n                                              [Millions of dollars]                                             \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     1997     1998     1999    2000    2001     2002      97-02 \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLoans: Budget Authority...........................    -340    -1,304    -154    -190    -193    -1,287    -3,468\nLoans: Outlays....................................    -340    -1,050    -347    -225    -210    -1,294    -3,466\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n           Sincerely,\n     Richard W.

There are, however, special \n     circumstances in which deductions for higher education \n     expenses are allowed, or in which the payment of higher \n     education expenses by others is excluded from income.\n       Higher education expenses may be deductible, but only if \n     the taxpayer itemizes deductions, and only to the extent that \n     the expenses, along with other miscellaneous itemized \n     deductions, exceed two percent of adjusted gross income \n     (AGI). A deduction for educational purposes is allowed only \n     if the education maintains or improves a skill required in \n     the individual's employment or other trade or business, or is \n     required by the individual's employer, or by law or \n     regulation for the individual to retain his or her current \n     job.\n       The interest from qualified U.S. savings bonds is excluded \n     from a taxpayer's gross income to the extent the proceeds of \n     the bonds are used to pay qualified educational expenses. To \n     be qualified, the savings bonds must be purchased after \n     December 31, 1989, by a person who has attained the age of \n     24. The interest exclusion is phased out for taxpayers with \n     AGI over certain amounts. For 1996, the exclusion was phased \n     out for taxpayers with modified AGI between $49,450 and \n     $64,450 ($74,200 and $104,200 for joint returns). Qualified \n     educational expenses consist of tuition and fees for \n     enrollment of the taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse, or the \n     taxpayer's dependent at a public or non-profit institution of \n     higher education, including two-year colleges and vocational \n     schools.\n     Reasons for Change\n       Well-educated workers are essential to an economy \n     experiencing technological change and facing global \n     competition. The Administration believes that reducing the \n     after-tax cost of education for individuals and families \n     through tax credits and deductions will encourage investment \n     in education and training while lowering tax burdens for \n     middle-income taxpayers.\n       The expenses of higher education place a significant burden \n     on many middle-class families. Grants and subsidized loans \n     are available to students from low- and moderate-\n     income families; high-income families can afford the cost \n     of higher education. The combination of Federal grants and \n     a tax credit reduces the after-tax cost of higher \n     education, creating a Federal guarantee of a specified \n     amount of assistance for higher education expenses by \n     reducing the after-tax cost of higher education. This \n     guarantee will help make 14 years of education the norm in \n     America.\n     Proposal\n       As described in detail below, taxpayers would be able to \n     claim a non-refundable tax credit or a tax deduction for \n     qualified higher education expenses incurred for themselves, \n     their spouses or their dependents during their first two \n     years of postsecondary education in a degree or certificate \n     program. If the requirements for both the credit and the \n     deduction were met with respect to a particular student's \n     expenses, the taxpayer would be free to choose either the \n     credit or the deduction for those expenses. The deduction, \n     but not the credit, would be available for qualified higher \n     education expenses incurred after the first two years of \n     postsecondary education or at any time for courses that \n     enable the taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse or dependent to \n     acquire or improve job skills.\n     HOPE Scholarship Tuition Credit\n       A taxpayer would be allowed a non-refundable credit against \n     Federal income tax for qualified higher education expenses \n     paid during the taxable year for the education of the \n     taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse, or the taxpayer's \n     dependents. The credit would be\n\n[[Page S3053]]\n\n     available with respect to an individual student for two \n     taxable years, provided the student has not completed the \n     first two years of postsecondary education.\n       A credit for qualified higher education expenses would be \n     available in the taxable year the expenses are paid, subject \n     to the requirement that the education commence or continue \n     during that year or during the first three months of the next \n     year, and provided the student is enrolled during the year \n     (or in the first three months of the next year) at least \n     half-time in a degree or certificate program. Qualified \n     higher education expenses paid with the proceeds of a loan \n     generally would be eligible for the credit (rather than \n     repayment of the loan itself). The credit would be recaptured \n     where a student or the taxpayer received a refund (or \n     reimbursement through insurance) of tuition and fees for \n     which a credit had been claimed in a prior year.\n       With respect to an individual student, a taxpayer is \n     limited to a tuition tax credit of the lesser of the \n     taxpayer's qualified higher education expenses and the \n     maximum credit amount. The maximum credit for a taxable year \n     would be $1500, reduced by any Federal educational grants, \n     such as Pell Grants, awarded for that year (or for education \n     beginning in the first three months of the next year, if \n     credits are claimed based on payments for that education). \n     Beginning in 1998, the maximum credit amount would be indexed \n     for inflation, rounded down to the closest multiple of $50.\n       The maximum credit amount would be phased out ratably for \n     taxpayers with modified AGI between $50,000 and $70,000 \n     ($80,000 and $100,000 for joint returns). Modified AGI would \n     include taxable Social Security benefits and amounts \n     otherwise excluded with respect to income earned abroad (or \n     income from Puerto Rico or U.S. possessions), and would be \n     determined before the deduction for education expenses \n     contained in this proposal. Beginning in 2001, the income \n     phase-out ranges would be indexed for inflation, rounded down \n     to the closest multiple of $5000.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ This description of the proposal reflects a modification \n     of the indexing date contained in the OMB analytical \n     materials relating to this proposal.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Qualified higher education expenses would be defined as \n     tuition and fees charged by an institution of higher \n     education that are directly related to an eligible student's \n     course of study (e.g., registration fees, laboratory fees, \n     and extra charges for particular courses). Charges and \n     expenses associated with meals, lodging, student activities, \n     athletics, health care, transportation, books and similar \n     personal, living or family expenses would not be included. \n     The expenses of education involving sports, games or hobbies \n     would not be qualified higher education expenses unless this \n     education is required as part of a degree program.\n       Qualified higher education expenses generally would include \n     only out-of-pocket tuition and fees. Qualified higher \n     education expenses would not include expenses covered by \n     educational assistance that is not required to be included in \n     the gross income of either the student or the taxpayer \n     claiming the credit. Thus, total tuition and required fees \n     would be reduced by scholarship or fellowship grants \n     excludable from gross income under section 117 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code (scholarships and fellowships that pay \n     for tuition, required fees, books and equipment) and any \n     educational assistance received as veterans' benefits. \n     However, assistance with expenses other than tuition, \n     required fees and books, such as expenses associated with \n     meals, lodging, student activities, athletics, health care \n     and transportation, could be received without a reduction of \n     creditable higher education expenses. In addition, qualified \n     higher education expenses would be reduced by the interest \n     from qualified U.S. savings bonds that is excluded from a \n     taxpayer's gross income for the taxable year. However, no \n     reduction would be required for a gift, bequest, devise, or \n     inheritance within the meaning of section 102(a).\n       An eligible student would be one who is enrolled or \n     accepted for enrollment during the taxable year in a degree, \n     certificate, or other program (including a program of study \n     abroad approved for credit by the institution at which such \n     student is enrolled) leading to a recognized educational \n     credential at an eligible institution. The student must \n     pursue a course of study on at least a half-time basis. In \n     addition, for a student's qualified higher education expenses \n     to be eligible for the credit, the student must not have been \n     convicted of a Federal or state felony consisting of the \n     possession or distribution of certain drugs, and generally \n     cannot be a nonresident alien. Furthermore, a taxpayer would \n     not be entitled to a credit for a second taxable year unless \n     the student obtained a qualifying grade point average for \n     all previous postsecondary education. Generally, this \n     would be an average of at least 2.75 on a 4-point scale, \n     or a substantially similar measure of achievement. This \n     provision would allow institutions that do not use a 4-\n     point grading scale to retain their own system while still \n     allowing their students to qualify for the credit: these \n     institutions will determine what measure under the system \n     they use reasonably approximates a B- grade point average.\n       An ``institution of higher education'' is defined by \n     reference to section 481 of the Higher Education Act. Such \n     institutions generally would be accredited postsecondary \n     educational institutions offering credit toward a bachelor's \n     degree, an associate's degree, or another recognized \n     postsecondary credential. They could also be proprietary \n     institutions or postsecondary vocational institutions. The \n     institution must be eligible to participate in Department of \n     Education student aid programs.\n       This proposed credit would not affect deductions claimed \n     under any other section of the Code, except that if a \n     student's qualified higher education expenses for a taxable \n     year are deducted under another section of the Code \n     (including the proposed deduction for education expenses) no \n     credit would be available. If a taxpayer is eligible to claim \n     either the credit or the deduction for qualified higher \n     education expenses with regard to a single student, the \n     taxpayer may choose between the credit and the deduction, but \n     may not claim both. In addition, a taxpayer may claim the \n     credit for some students and the deduction for others. An \n     eligible student would not be entitled to claim a credit \n     under this provision if that student is claimed as a \n     dependent for tax purposes by another taxpayer. If a parent \n     claims a student as a dependent, any education expenses paid \n     by the student would be treated as paid by the parent for \n     purposes of this proposal.\n       The Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of \n     Education, operating in close consultation, will have \n     authority to issue regulations to implement the provisions. \n     The Secretary of the Treasury generally would be authorized \n     to issue regulations to implement this section of the \n     Internal Revenue Code. For example, the Secretary of the \n     Treasury would have authority to issue regulations providing \n     appropriate rules for recordkeeping and information of \n     reporting. These regulations would address the information \n     reports institutions of higher education would file to assist \n     students and the IRS in determining whether a student meets \n     the eligibility requirements for the credit and calculating \n     the amount of the credit that is potentially available. \n     However, certain terms would be defined by reference to the \n     Higher Education Act of 1965. The Secretary of Education \n     would have the authority to issue regulations under those \n     provisions as well as authority to define other education \n     terms as necessary. The Secretary of the Treasury and the \n     Secretary of Education would coordinate their work in \n     developing their respective regulations.\n       The proposal would be effective for payments made on or \n     after January 1, 1997, for education commencing on or after \n     July 1, 1997.\n     Education and Job Training Tax Deduction\n       A taxpayer would be allowed a deduction for qualified \n     higher education expenses paid during the taxable year for \n     the education or training of the taxpayer, the taxpayer's \n     spouse, or the taxpayer's dependents. The deduction would be \n     allowed in determining AGI. Therefore, taxpayer's could claim \n     the deduction even if they do not itemize their deductions \n     and even if they do not meet the two-percent of AGI floor on \n     miscellaneous itemized deductions.\n       The term ``eligible student'' generally is defined in the \n     same way for the proposed deduction as it is for the proposed \n     tuition credit, that is, to include students enrolled at \n     least half-time in a degree or certificate program at an \n     institution of higher education. However, a student taking a \n     course to improve or acquire jobs skills would also be an \n     eligible student for purposes of the deduction. Qualified \n     higher education expenses would also be defined in the same \n     way for the deduction proposal as they are for the tuition \n     credit proposal, that is, tuition and required fees that are \n     directly related to an eligible student's course of study.\n       ``Institution of higher education'' is defined the same way \n     for purposes of this proposal as it is in the tuition credit \n     proposal.\n       Qualified higher education expenses would be deductible in \n     the taxable year the expenses are paid, subject to the \n     requirement that the education commences or continues during \n     that year or during the first three months of the next year. \n     Deductible educational expenses paid with the proceeds of a \n     loan generally would be deductible (rather the repayment of \n     the loan itself). Normal tax benefits rules would apply to \n     refunds (and reimbursement through insurance) of previously \n     deducted tuition and fees, making such refunds includable in \n     income in the year received.\n       In 1997 and 1998 the maximum deduction for a taxpayer would \n     be $5,000. In 1999 and thereafter, this maximum would \n     increase to $10,000. The deduction would be phased out \n     ratably over an income range in the same way as the credit. \n     The maximum deduction would not vary with the number of \n     students in a family.\n       This proposal would not affect deductions claimed under any \n     other section of the Code, except that any amount deducted \n     under another section of the Code could not also be deducted \n     under this provision. In addition, a taxpayer who claimed a \n     deduction for a student's qualified higher education expenses \n     for a particular taxable year could not also claim a tuition \n     tax credit for any of the student's qualified higher \n     education expenses for the year. A student would not be \n     eligible to claim a deduction under this provision if that \n     student is claimed as a dependent for tax purposes by another \n     taxpayer. If a parent claims a student as a dependent, any \n     education expenses paid by the student will be treated as \n     paid by the parent for purposes of this proposal.\n       The proposal would grant the Secretary of the Treasury \n     authority to issue regulations\n\n[[Page S3054]]\n\n     under this section, including rules requiring record keeping \n     and information reporting.\n       This proposal would be effective for payments made on or \n     after January 1, 1997, for education commencing on or after \n     July 1, 1997.\n\n\n        tax incentives for expansion of student loan forgiveness\n\n     Current Law\n       Generally, a taxpayer has income when all or part of a loan \n     made to the taxpayer is forgiven. However, an exception is \n     provided in section 108(f) for the forgiveness of certain \n     student loans. If the United States, a State or local \n     government, or a public benefit corporation with control over \n     a state, county, or municipal hospital makes a loan to a \n     student to support the student's attendance at an educational \n     institution and subsequently forgives all or part of the \n     loan, the income resulting from the cancellation of \n     indebtedness is excluded from the student's income, provided \n     the loan forgiveness is contingent on the student's working \n     for a certain period of time in certain professions for any \n     of a broad class of employers.\n     Reasons for Change\n       The Administration believes in encouraging Americans to use \n     their education and training in community service. Providing \n     tax relief in connection with the forgiveness of certain \n     student loans will help make it possible for students with \n     valuable professional skills to accept lower-paying jobs that \n     serve the public.\n     Proposal\n       The income exclusion for student loan forgiveness would be \n     expanded to cover forgiveness of loans extended by nonprofit \n     tax-exempt charitable or educational institutions to their \n     students or graduates when the proceeds are to be used to \n     repay outstanding student loans, provided the loan \n     forgiveness is contingent on the student's working for a \n     certain period of time in certain professions for any of a \n     broad class of employers. The income exclusion would not be \n     available where a loan is extended and then forgiven by an \n     institution that employs the borrower. The exclusion would \n     also be expanded to cover forgiveness of direct student loans \n     made through the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program \n     where loan repayment and forgiveness are contingent on the \n     borrower's income level.\n       The proposal would be effective with respect to amounts \n     otherwise includable in income after the date of enactment.\n\n\n         exclusion for employer-provided educational assistance\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 127 provides that an employee's gross income and \n     wages do not include amounts paid or incurred by the employer \n     for educational assistance provided to the employee if \n     such amounts are paid or incurred pursuant to a qualified \n     educational assistance program. This exclusion is limited \n     to $5,250 of educational assistance with respect to an \n     individual during a calendar year. The exclusion applies \n     whether or not the education is job-related. In the \n     absence of this exclusion, educational assistance is \n     excludable from income only if it is related to the \n     employee's current job.\n       The exclusion for undergraduate education expires in mid-\n     1997. The exclusion does not apply to graduate level courses \n     beginning after mid-1996.\n     Reason for Change\n       Well-educated workers are essential to an economy \n     experiencing technological change and facing global \n     competition. Extension of section 127, including \n     reinstatement of its application to graduate courses, will \n     expand educational opportunity and increase productivity. In \n     addition, these provisions will encourage the retraining of \n     current and former employees to reflect the changing needs of \n     the workplace. The extension of section 127 also will \n     simplify the rules for employers and workers by eliminating \n     the need to distinguish between job-related expenses and \n     other employer-provided educational assistance.\n     Proposal\n       The section 127 exclusion would be extended through \n     December 31, 2000 and reinstated for graduate education.\n\n\n small business tax credit for employer-provided educational assistance\n\n     Current Law\n       Under current law, job-related training and education \n     expenses, as well as amounts paid or incurred by an employer \n     for educational assistance provided to employees pursuant to \n     a qualified educational assistance program, are deductible by \n     the employer. Employer payments for job-related training and \n     amounts paid under a qualified educational assistance program \n     up to $5,250 annually are excluded from the gross income and \n     wages of the employee. No special incentive is provided to \n     assist small businesses in promoting employee education.\n     Reason for Change\n       Education and training builds skills and increases the \n     productivity of the American workforce. Well-educated workers \n     are better able to adapt to changes in the workforce and the \n     demands of technological challenges and global competition. \n     An additional incentive is needed to foster increased \n     educational opportunities and workforce training for \n     employees of small businesses that otherwise may be unable to \n     devote sufficient resources to their employees' skill \n     development.\n     Proposal\n       Small businesses would be allowed a 10 percent income tax \n     credit for payments made in taxable years beginning after \n     December 31, 1997, and before January 1, 2001, with respect \n     to expenses incurred during those taxable years for education \n     of employees by third parties under an employer-provided \n     educational assistance program. The credit would be available \n     to employers with average annual gross receipts of $10 \n     million or less for the prior three years.\n\n               Title II--Student Financial Aid Provisions\n\n       Section 201.--Section 201 of the bill sets out the short \n     title for Title II of the bill, the ``Student Financial Aid \n     Improvements Act of 1997''.\n\n                          Part A--Pell Grants\n\n       Section 211.--Section 211 of the bill would amend section \n     401 (b)(2)(A) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 \n     (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act'') to provide that, \n     subject to the award rules in section 401(b) of the Act, the \n     Pell Grant maximum award may not be less than $3,000. This \n     increase from the $2,700 maximum for FY 1997, which was in \n     turn a significant increase in the Pell Grant maximum award \n     over previous years, further restores the eroded buying power \n     of Pell Grants. By providing more aid to students at the \n     lowest income levels, this increase would complement the tax \n     proposals in Title I of the bill, which are focused more on \n     middle class students and their families. Together, these \n     proposals would significantly enhance the affordability of \n     postsecondary education.\n\n                    Part B--Student Loan Provisions\n\n       Section 221.--Section 221 of the bill would add a new \n     subsection (h) to section 422 of the Act, and make conforming \n     changes to subsection (g) of that section. Under new section \n     422(h), the Secretary would recall from the reserve funds \n     held by guaranty agencies at least $731,000,000 in fiscal \n     year 1998; $127,000,000 in fiscal year 1999; $186,000,000 in \n     each of the fiscal years 2000 and 2001; and $1,271,000,000 in \n     fiscal year 2002. The amounts recalled from each guaranty \n     agency each year would be in proportion to its share of the \n     total reserve funds held by guaranty agencies as of September \n     30, 1996, and recalled funds would be deposited in the \n     Treasury.\n       Each guaranty agency would be required, within 45 days of \n     the date of enactment of this provision, to transfer all \n     reserve funds that it holds (that have not yet been recalled) \n     to a restricted account and invest those funds in United \n     States Government securities specified by the \n     Secretary. Except under the working capital provisions \n     described below, the guaranty agency could not use any \n     restricted account funds for any purpose without the \n     express permission of the Secretary.\n       A guaranty agency would be permitted to use the FY 1998 \n     earnings on its restricted account to assist in meeting its \n     operational expenses. In addition, the Secretary would permit \n     the use of up to $350,000,000 in the aggregate of restricted \n     account funds to be used as working capital to assist with \n     guaranty agency operating expenses. A guaranty agency's share \n     of working capital would be based on its proportionate share \n     of all borrower accounts outstanding on September 30, 1006. \n     Working capital provided to the guaranty agency must be \n     repaid by no later than September 30, 2002, or the date on \n     which the guaranty agency's agreement under section 428(c) \n     ends (through resignation, expiration, or termination), \n     whichever is earlier.\n       Finally, new subsection 422(h) would specify that non-\n     liquid reserve fund assets, such as buildings and equipment \n     purchased or developed by the guaranty agency with reserve \n     funds, as well as any liquid assets remaining in a guaranty \n     agency's restricted account after the recalls, would remain \n     the property of the United States, could only be used for \n     purposes that the Secretary determines are appropriate, and \n     would be subject to recall by the Secretary no later than the \n     date on which the guaranty agency's agreement under section \n     428(c) ends.\n       The proposed recall of reserves is consistent with the \n     legal status of those reserves as Federal property, as well \n     as the current role of the guaranty agency in the Federal \n     Family Education Loan (FFEL) program, as well as the changes \n     proposed in section 226 of the bill, described below. Section \n     432(o) of the Act, which was added by the Higher Education \n     Amendments of 1992 (P.L. 102-325), clarified that the \n     Secretary is the ultimate insurer of all FFEL guarantees. \n     Thus, guaranty agencies function more like loan servicers \n     than guarantors, and their need for reserve funds is \n     currently limited to their 2 percent risk-sharing \n     requirement, which also comes from Federal funds. The changes \n     proposed in section 226 of the bill would eliminate any need \n     for a guaranty agency to hold capital excess of their working \n     capital requirements.\n       Section 222.--Section 222 of the bill would amend sections \n     427, 428(b), 428C, and 455(d) of the bill to provide FFEL \n     borrowers with the extended and graduated repayment options \n     currently available only to Direct Loan borrowers. These new \n     options would be in addition to the standard and income \n     sensitive repayment plans currently available to FFEL \n     borrowers (a more limited form of graduated repayment is also \n     currently available to FFEL borrowers), and would provide far \n     greater flexibility to FFEL borrowers in managing their loan \n     obligations, and therefore may avoid defaults. As with Direct \n     Loan repayment, a FFEL borrower would also\n\n[[Page S3055]]\n\n     have the ability to change repayment plans. The Secretary \n     would also be required to ensure that, to the extent \n     practicable and not otherwise provided in statute, the \n     repayment plans offered to FFEL borrowers are comparable to \n     Direct Loan repayment plans.\n       Section 223.--Section 223 of the bill would amend sections \n     427A and 455 of the Act to reduce the applicable interest \n     rate on all subsidized and unsubsidized FFEL and Direct \n     Loans during in-school, grace, and deferment periods to \n     the same rate as the Department of Education's own \n     borrowing rate, although the interest rates would be \n     capped at the same levels as in current law. This change \n     would reduce Federal costs by reducing excess profits to \n     lenders during times when there are few servicing costs \n     associated with subsidized loans, but the highest profit \n     margins. It would also provide lower interest rates to \n     borrowers of unsubsidized loans while they are in in-\n     school, grace, or deferment periods. Finally, these \n     amendments would standardize interest subsidy costs for \n     the FFEL and Direct Loan programs.\n       In addition, section 223 of the bill would clarify that the \n     interest rate used to determine the rebate of excess interest \n     under section 427A(i)(7)(B) of the Act was not intended to be \n     used to change special allowance payments for the period \n     affected by the rebate. This change would correct a recent \n     contrary court decision.\n       Section 224.--Section 224 of the bill would amend section \n     428(b)(1)(G) of the Act by reducing lenders' insurance rate \n     from 98 to 95 percent. This change would give lenders a \n     greater economic incentive to prevent loan defaults.\n       Section 225.--Section 225 of the bill would amend sections \n     428(b)(1)(H), 428H(h), 438(c), and 455(c) of the Act to \n     eliminate the one percent insurance premium that may be \n     charged to a FFEL borrower at the time his or her loan is \n     originated, to reduce FFEL origination fees on subsidized \n     FFELs by one percent (i.e., from three percent to two \n     percent), and to reduce comparably the loan fee charged on \n     Direct Loans. The loan fee for Direct Loans is currently four \n     percent, and is designed to be the equivalent of the FFEL \n     insurance premium plus the FFEL origination fee. Thus, the \n     Direct Loan loan fee would be reduced from four percent to \n     three percent for unsubsidized Direct Loans, and from four \n     percent to two percent for subsidized Direct Loans.\n       These reductions in fees will provide significant benefits \n     to all students, and will provide additional funds to \n     borrowers up front, at the time that the loan funds are \n     needed to pay for costs of attendance. The proposed changes \n     would also assist in standardizing borrower benefits within \n     the FFEL program as well as between the FFEL and Direct Loan \n     programs, because lenders and guaranty agencies will no \n     longer be able to selectively reduce costs for certain FFEL \n     borrowers by waiving or paying the insurance premium on the \n     borrower's behalf. The Secretary is not authorized to waive \n     or lower loan fees under the Direct Loan program.\n       The additional reduction in fees for subsidized FFEL and \n     Direct Loans would also complement the HOPE Scholarship and \n     tax deduction proposals in Title I of the bill by \n     significantly reducing loan costs for the neediest students \n     and providing them with additional resources when the loan is \n     originated.\n       Section 226.--Section 226 of the bill would substantially \n     revise section 428 of the Act to reflect more accurately the \n     current role of the guaranty agency in the FFEL program, and \n     to affirmatively recognize that the Secretary is the sole \n     guarantor of FFELs. Section 432(o) of the Act, which was \n     added by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 (P.L. \n     102-325), clarified that the Secretary is the ultimate \n     insurer of all FFEL guarantees. Thus, in practice, \n     guaranty agencies actually function more like loan \n     servicers than guarantors. The changes proposed in section \n     226 of the bill would treat guaranty agencies in a manner \n     more consistent with their current program functions.\n       Subsections (a) and (b) of section 428 would be modified \n     and reorganized to reflect the substantive changes proposed \n     primarily to section 428(c) of the Act. Under these changes, \n     the Secretary would be authorized to enter into an agreement \n     with a guaranty agency, under which the Secretary would \n     insure loans with the guaranty agency acting as the agent of \n     the Secretary. Any guaranty agency that had an agreement with \n     the Secretary under section 428(b) on the day before the date \n     of enactment of this bill could enter into an initial \n     agreement with the Secretary, and all existing guaranty \n     agency agreements would expire within 180 days of the date of \n     enactment. Outstanding loan insurance issued by the guaranty \n     agency would be replaced by loan insurance issued by the \n     Secretary, and the guaranty agency would, in general, be \n     relieved of any further liability on the loans. To help \n     ensure a smooth transition, for the first year after the date \n     of enactment the Secretary could specify interim \n     administration measures necessary for the efficient transfer \n     of the loan insurance function.\n       The new guaranty agreements would be for five years, \n     renewable by the Secretary for successive five-year periods, \n     although the Secretary could terminate the agreements prior \n     to expiration of certain circumstances. After the initial \n     agreement with a guaranty agency entered into after the date \n     of enactment has ended (through its expiration, the \n     termination of the guaranty agency agreement by the \n     Secretary, or the resignation of the guaranty agency), the \n     Secretary, in his discretion, may enter into another \n     agreement with that guaranty agency, an alternate agreement \n     under with a different guaranty agency, or one or more \n     contracts under section 428E (as added by section 229 of the \n     bill) under which contractors would carry out one or more of \n     the functions formerly performed by the guaranty agency.\n       The agreement between the Secretary and a guaranty agency \n     would specify the responsibilities of the guaranty agency, if \n     any, for: administering the issuance of insurance on FFELs on \n     behalf of the Secretary; monitoring insurance commitments \n     made under this section; default prevention activities; \n     review of default claims made by lenders; payment of default \n     claims, collection of defaulted loans; adoption of internal \n     systems of accounting and auditing that are acceptable to the \n     Secretary; reporting requirements; and monitoring or \n     participating institutions and lenders. The Secretary could \n     also permit the guaranty agency, on a case-by-case basis, to \n     engage in such other businesses, previously purchased or \n     developed with reserve funds, that relate to the FFEL \n     program.\n       Under the agreement, guaranty agencies would receive the \n     following fees and revenues: a one-time issuance fee for each \n     new FFEL insured by the Secretary through the guaranty \n     agency; and annual maintenance fee for each active borrower \n     account; a default prevention fee, paid by lenders, of not to \n     exceed $100 per borrower account if the guaranty agency \n     succeeds in bringing a loan into current repayment status; a \n     collection retention allowance of not to exceed 18.5 \n     percent, determined on the basis of the Secretary's review \n     of payments for similar services in a competitive \n     environment; the interest earned on working capital \n     provided under section 422(h) (as added by section 221 of \n     the bill); and revenues derived from other FFEL-related \n     businesses in which the Secretary permits the guaranty \n     agency to engage.\n       In addition to restructuring guaranty agency agreements, \n     the changes proposed in section 226 of the bill would provide \n     guaranty agencies with an incentive to improve their \n     efficiency by permitting them to retain a share of their net \n     revenues for activities, approved by the Secretary, in \n     support of postsecondary education. The share that guaranty \n     agencies may retain and use for this purpose would be \n     calculated by the Secretary after determining an adequate \n     level of economic incentive for guaranty agencies to maximize \n     their efficiency, in an amount not to exceed 50 percent of \n     guaranty agency net revenues.\n       A guaranty agency would be required to carry out its \n     responsibilities under the agreement in accordance with \n     performance standards specified by the Secretary, which would \n     be uniformly applied to all guaranty agencies. The Secretary \n     would compare the performance of the guaranty agencies with \n     one another, and publicly disseminate the comparison. A \n     guaranty agency that fails to achieve a specified level of \n     performance on one or more performance standards could be \n     fined, and if its failure resulted in a financial loss to the \n     United States, the guaranty agency would be required to \n     indemnify the Secretary for that loss.\n       A guaranty agency's agreement could be ended in advance of \n     its expiration date, either because its agreement becomes \n     automatically void under certain circumstances, or because \n     the Secretary, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, \n     terminates the guaranty agency for substantially failing to \n     achieve an acceptable level of performance under its \n     agreement.\n       Finally, while most of the changes proposed in this section \n     of the bill pertain to guaranty agencies and their functions, \n     section 226(a)(2)(E) of the bill would require only eligible \n     lenders that originates or holds more than $5,000,000 in \n     FFELs during an annual audit period to submit to the \n     Secretary a compliance audit for that audit period. This \n     change is similar to exemptions provided in recent \n     Appropriation Acts, and would alleviate the burden and \n     disproportionate expense that annual compliance audits impose \n     on lenders with small FFEL portfolios.\n       Section 227.--Section 227 of the bill would repeal section \n     428(n) of the Act, which requires a State to pay to the \n     Secretary an annual amount that represents the State's share \n     of risk for high default rates at institutions within the \n     State. This provision has never been implemented.\n       Section 228.--Section 228 of the bill would make a number \n     of changes to section 428C of the Act pertaining to FFEL \n     consolidation loans that would make the terms of these loans \n     more comparable to Direct consolidation loans. (Changes to \n     repayment terms for FFEL consolidation loans are proposed in \n     section 222 of the bill.) Section 228 would permit borrowers \n     to obtain a FFEL consolidation loan while they are in ``in-\n     school'' status, and to consolidate FFEL  consolidation loans \n     into new FFEL consolidation loans. Lenders would also \n     retain the interest subsidy on the portion of a FFEL \n     consolidation loan that repays subsidized loans, and the \n     interest rate on FFEL consolidation loans would be changed \n     to a variable rate comparable to the rate applicable to \n     Direct consolidation loans. By extending favorable terms \n     currently available only to borrowers of Direct \n     consolidation loans to borrowers of FFEL consolidation \n     loans, these amendments would reduce costs for, and \n     provide greater flexibility to, these FFEL borrowers, \n     particularly those FFEL borrowers with\n\n[[Page S3056]]\n\n     loans from multiple lenders who have not consolidated \n     these loans because they would lose the benefits \n     associated with the separate loans.\n       Section 229.--Section 229 of the bill would add a new \n     section 428E to part B of Title IV of the Act that would \n     authorize the Secretary to enter into one or more contracts \n     to carry out any of the functions that otherwise would be \n     carried out by a guaranty agency. This amendment is \n     consistent with the changes to guaranty agency functions that \n     are proposed in section 226 of the bill.\n       Section 230.--Section 230 of the bill would amend the \n     definition of an ``eligible lender'' in section 435(d) of the \n     Act to require lenders to offer uniform terms and conditions \n     to all borrowers taking out the same type of FFEL loans (for \n     example, Unsubsidized or Consolidation Loans). The Secretary \n     would be authorized to prescribe regulatory exceptions to \n     this requirement.\n       Section 231.--Section 231 of the bill would amend section \n     438 of the Act to provide for the computation of special \n     allowance rates at the same time and in the same manner as \n     student loan interest rates (annually rather than quarterly), \n     to eliminate the potential for special allowance payments \n     merely because the rates are calculated on a different cycle.\n       Section 232.--Section 232 of the bill would amend section \n     439(h)(7) of the Act to reflect congressional intent that the \n     Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae) not be able \n     to circumvent the requirement that it pay an offset fee on \n     loans it holds by ``securitizing'' loans upon which it would \n     otherwise be required to pay the offset fee. This provision \n     would also remedy a recent, partially adverse, court decision \n     and would be effective retroactively to August 10, 1993, the \n     date of enactment of the Sallie Mae offset fee requirement, \n     but would not apply to the privatized entity that may be \n     created as a result of the Student Loan Marketing Association \n     Reorganization Act of 1996.\n       Section 233.--Section 233 of the bill would amend section \n     452(b) of the Act to replace the statutory requirement \n     (currently overridden by the FY 1997 Appropriation Act) to \n     pay all participating institutions that originate Direct \n     Loans a fee to assist in meeting the costs of loan \n     origination with a fee to be paid only to institutions (or \n     consortia of institutions) in their first year of \n     participation in the Direct Loan program, in order to \n     compensate for costs associated with their transition to the \n     program. The new, more targeted transition fee could not \n     exceed an average of $10 per borrower at the institutions \n     receiving the fee.\n       Section 234. Section 234 of the bill would amend section \n     458(a) to specify funding levels through FY 2002 for \n     mandatory administrative expenses for the student financial \n     aid programs, including the Direct Loan program, at levels \n     lower than the current baseline.\n\n              Part C--Need Analysis and General Provisions\n\n       Section 241.--Section 241 of the bill would make a series \n     of changes to the calculation of a postsecondary student's \n     need for assistance under Title IV of the Act that complement \n     the HOPE Scholarship and deduction proposals in Title I of \n     the bill. These changes are intended to ensure that a \n     student's future eligibility for Title IV assistance is not \n     affected by his or her family's use of the HOPE Scholarship \n     tax credit or the education and training tax deduction. These \n     amendments would: 1) prevent the HOPE Scholarship tax credit \n     from being treated as part of the family's total income by \n     treating the credit amount as ``excludable income'' and \n     making clear that it is not to be treated as ``untaxed income \n     and benefits''; 2) prevent the education and training tax \n     deduction from reducing the family's total income by treating \n     the amount deducted as ``untaxed income and benefits''; 3) \n     ensure that the family's available income is accurately \n     reflected by taking account of federal taxes that would be \n     owed if neither the HOPE Scholarship tax credit nor the \n     education and training tax deduction were available; and 4) \n     prevent the HOPE Scholarship tax credit from substituting for \n     other forms of student aid by making clear that the amount of \n     the credit is not to be treated as ``financial assistance.''\n       Section 242.--Section 242 of the bill would amend section \n     476(b) of the bill to make the income protection allowance \n     (IPA) (one factor used in the calculation of a student's need \n     assistance) for independent students without dependents \n     (other than a spouse) comparable to the IPAs used for parents \n     of dependent students and for independent students with \n     dependents. This change would increase the Pell Grant and \n     other need-based aid available to low- and moderate-income \n     students in this category. A conforming change would also be \n     made to section 478(b) of the Act to permit the updating of \n     the numbers used in the IPA calculation to reflect inflation, \n     consistent with the IPA calculations for the other categories \n     of students.\n       Section 243.--Section 243 of the bill would add a new \n     subsection (g) to section 481 of the Act that would require \n     the Secretary to define in regulations certain education-\n     related terms for purposes of the HOPE Scholarship tax credit \n     and the deduction proposed in Title I of the bill. Section \n     482(c) of the Act, which requires that regulations must be \n     published in final form by December 1 in order to be \n     effective for the award year beginning the following July 1, \n     shall not apply to these regulations, which pertain to the \n     administration of the tax provisions, not the student aid \n     programs under Title IV.\n       Section 244.--Section 244 of the bill would amend several \n     provisions of Title IV of the Act primarily to extend the \n     FFEL program and section 458 of the Act through FY 2002. \n     These extensions are necessary in order to make the other \n     changes proposed in this Title for years after FY 1998.\n\n                        Part D--Effective Dates\n\n       Section 251.--Section 251 sets out the effective dates for \n     the amendments proposed in this Title of the bill.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I give my strong support to President \nClinton's HOPE and Opportunity for Postsecondary Education Act of 1997, \nintroduced today by Senator Daschle and myself.\n  Education must continue to be a top priority in Congress. We need to \ndo more to make college accessible and affordable for all students. It \nis not enough to maintain current spending levels for education. \nTargeted increases are essential to help students, and also to help \ncolleges deal with increasing enrollments.\n  Today, college is priced out of reach for many families. From 1980 to \n1990, the cost of college rose by 126 percent, while family income \nincreased by only 73 percent. To meet that rising cost, students are \ngoing deeper and deeper into debt. In 1993 alone, students borrowed $30 \nbillion--a 65-percent increase since 1993. Since 1988, borrowing in the \nFederal student loan program has increased by more than 100 percent, \nwhile starting salaries for college graduates have failed to increase \nat all. Many students and their families are fearful of the mounting \ndebt burdens that await college graduates.\n  The President's bill will help students pay for college in two ways: \nthrough tax relief and through increased direct financial aid. With the \ntax relief, students and their families will be able to choose between \na $1,500 HOPE tax credit and a $10,000 tax deduction to pay annual \ntuition expenses for the first 2 years of postsecondary education, \nincluding graduate school The tax deduction is also available to help \nreduce the cost of further years of education, including graduate \nschool. These two changes will make a college education more affordable \nfor thousands of middle and lower income families.\n  The bill also provides tax relief for students whose loans are \nforgiven in return for community service or for low-income wage earners \nunder the income-contingent repayment plan. In addition, the bill \nprovides tax incentives to encourage employers to pay for the further \neducation of their employees.\n  In the area of direct financial aid, the bill broadens the reach of \nPell grants to help the neediest students pay for higher education. It \nincreases the maximum Pell grant from $2,700 to $3,000. It also changes \nthe needs analysis for some independent students by increasing the \nincome protection allowance to make it comparable with that allowance \nfor other categories of students.\n  The bill also decreases the cost of student loans by reducing \ninterest rates, and by lowering the initial fees charged to students. \nBorrowing has become an essential part of financing education for \nmillions of students. These provisions will benefit them while they are \nin college by reducing the initial fees, and after college by lowering \nthe interest rates on the amount they owe.\n  It is fitting that this bill is being introduced today, because many \nmembers of the United States Student Association are here on Capitol \nHill this week to urge Congress to give education the high priority it \ndeserves. These students want a better education. They know they need \nit. And they are worried about how to pay for it. They want Congress to \nwork together to provide the financial assistance they need to pursue \ntheir dreams. The presence of these intelligent and committed students \nreminds us that the future of our country depends on the education they \nreceive. This Congress can open the door of higher education for many \nmore of them.\n  The President's proposal deserves broad bipartisan support. It is \nvital for the country that higher education be truly open to all \nqualified students, without monetary barriers. Investing in education \nis investing in a stronger America here at home and around the world. I \nlook forward to working with\n\n[[Page S3057]]\n\nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle to renew and extend our \ncommitment to higher education.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Bennett, Mr. \n        Sarbanes, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Bryan, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. \n        Moseley-Braun, Mr. Johnson and Mr. Reed):\n  S. 562. A bill to amend section 255 of the National Housing Act to \nprevent the funding of unnecessary or excessive costs for obtaining a \nhome equity conversion mortgage; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n\n\n             THE SENIOR CITIZEN HOME EQUITY PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwhich will protect our Nation's senior citizens from exploitation by \nfraudulent operators who are manipulating the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development's [HUD] Federal Housing Administration [FHA] home \nequity conversion mortgage program.\n  I commend the cosponsors of this legislation and thank them for their \nsupport of this essential initiative: Senator Lauch Faircloth; Senator \nRobert Bennett; Senator Paul Sarbanes; Senator Christopher Dodd; \nSenator John Kerry; Senator Richard Bryan; Senator Barbara Boxer; \nSenator Moseley-Braun; Senator Tim Johnson; and Senator Jack Reed.\n  I am pleased to announce a bicameral, bipartisan response to this \ninjustice. Identical companion legislation is being introduced today by \nRepresentative Rick Lazio, chairman of the House Banking Subcommittee \non Housing and Community Opportunity. I salute Congressman Lazio for \nhis swift response in condemning this outrageous practice and for \nproposing a legislative solution. I pledge to work side-by-side with \nhim on this important issue until our companion bills become law.\n  This legislation has been endorsed by the administration. I would \nlike to commend HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo for recognizing this serious \nproblem, bringing these abuses to our attention, and acting \ncourageously to prohibit their continued occurrence.\n  The FHA home equity conversion mortgage program offers elderly \nhomeowners the opportunity to borrow against the equity in their homes. \nThis effective program assists our senior citizens who have substantial \nequity in their property but have incomes too low to meet ordinary or \nextraordinary living expenses. A program recipient can receive cash \nthrough this reverse mortgage in the following ways: a lifetime \nguaranteed monthly payment; a line of credit; a combination of monthly \npayment and line-of-credit options; or a lump sum. These mortgages are \noriginated by FHA-approved lenders, insured by the FHA and purchased by \nthe secondary mortgage market.\n  Since the program's inception, approximately 20,000 loans have been \nmade. The median age of borrowers is 76 years old and the median income \nis $10,400. This reverse mortgage program represents an ideal public/\nprivate partnership in which needy, very-low income Americans are aided \nwithout cost to the Federal Government.\n  Unfortunately, unscrupulous middlemen, posing as service providers or \nestate planners have taken advantage of seniors by charging unnecessary \nand excessive fees to assist them in obtaining a home equity conversion \nmortgage. These predators have charged elderly homeowners fees ranging \nfrom 6 to 12 percent of the loan amount. In hundreds of cases, very \nlow-income seniors have been manipulated into paying several thousand \ndollars in return for ministerial and often meaningless services. The \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development provides information on \napplying for a reverse mortgage at no cost.\n  These abuses must be stopped at once. Such exploitation is absolutely \nunconscionable. The elderly who are being preyed upon are some of the \nmost vulnerable in our society. Reverse mortgage proceeds are generally \nused by the homeowner to maintain a decent standard of living and pay \nfor essentials like property taxes, medical bills, and groceries.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will assist HUD with its \nefforts to ensure that our senior citizens are protected. We must \nensure that not even one recipient of a HUD reverse mortgage is charged \nany unnecessary or excessive costs for obtaining that mortgage.\n  The bill provides two important safeguards to achieve this purpose. \nFirst, it provides a requirement that the mortgagor has received a full \ndisclosure of all costs of obtaining the mortgage, including any costs \nof estate planning, financial advice or other related services. Second, \nit clarifies that the HUD Secretary has authority to impose \nrestrictions to ensure that the mortgagor is not charged any \nunnecessary or excessive costs for obtaining a reverse mortgage.\n  The legislation requires the HUD Secretary to implement the above \ndescribed safeguards in an expeditious manner by interim notice. Within \n90 days of the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall issue \nfinal regulations after providing notice and opportunity for public \ncomment. The terms of the interim notice shall not be effective after \nthe final regulations are in place.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this vital legislation and look \nforward to its speedy passage by the Senate. The Senate, the House of \nRepresentatives and the administration must work together quickly to \nensure that our Nation's most vulnerable homeowners are no longer \nvictimized.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 562\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Senior Citizen Home Equity \n     Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS; PROHIBITION OF FUNDING OF \n                   UNNECESSARY OR EXCESSIVE COSTS.\n\n       Section 255(d) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. \n     1715z-20(d)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (2)--\n       (A) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (B) by redesignating subparagraph (C) as subparagraph (D); \n     and\n       (C) by inserting after subparagraph (B) the following:\n       ``(C) has received full disclosure of all costs to the \n     mortgagor for obtaining the mortgage, including any costs of \n     estate planning, financial advice, or other related services, \n     and'';\n       (2) in paragraph (9)(F), by striking ``and'';\n       (3) in paragraph (10), by striking the period at the end \n     and inserting ``; and''; and\n       (4) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(11) have been made with such restrictions as the \n     Secretary determines to be appropriate to ensure that the \n     mortgagor does not fund any unnecessary or excessive costs \n     for obtaining the mortgage, including any costs of estate \n     planning, financial advice, or other related services.''.\n\n     SEC. 3. IMPLEMENTATION.\n\n       (a) Notice.--The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development \n     shall, by interim notice, implement the amendments made by \n     section 2 in an expeditious manner, as determined by the \n     Secretary. Such notice shall not be effective after the date \n     of the effectiveness of the final regulations issued under \n     subsection (b).\n       (b) Regulations.--The Secretary shall, not later than the \n     expiration of the 90-day period beginning on the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, issue final regulations to implement \n     the amendments made by section 2. Such regulations shall be \n     issued only after notice and opportunity for public comment \n     pursuant to the provisions of section 553 of title 5, United \n     States Code (notwithstanding subsections (a)(2) and (b)(B) of \n     such section).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Res. 20\n\n       Whereas on March 17, 1992, the Israeli Embassy in Buenos \n     Aires, Argentina, a school, and several nearby buildings were \n     destroyed by a powerful suicide car bomb blast in which 29 \n     innocent children, women, and men lost their lives and an \n     additional 252 innocent people were injured;\n       Whereas the victims of this terrorist attack included \n     employees of the Israeli embassy and their families, children \n     from a nearby Roman Catholic primary school, women and men \n     from a nearby Roman Catholic church shelter, a Roman Catholic \n     priest, and people from across the spectrum of Argentine \n     society;\n       Whereas Argentina's Jewish community, which numbers 300,000 \n     and is the largest Jewish community in Latin America, has \n     suffered severe anti-Semitism during periods of military rule \n     and feels particularly vulnerable to assault from certain \n     radical Islamic groups and from indigenous far right \n     extremists in Argentina;\n       Whereas Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the \n     bombing of the Israeli Embassy and praised the name of the \n     alleged suicide bomber, Abu Yasser, by calling him a ``martyr \n     struggler'';\n       Whereas Islamic Jihad is a terrorist organization that is \n     supported by Iran and, according to Department of State \n     officials, Iranian dipomats collected information to plan the \n     bombing;\n       Whereas the failure of Argentine and international efforts \n     to bring the perpetrators of the embassy bombing to justice \n     made Argentina a prime target for a second devastating \n     terrorist attack on July 18, 1994;\n       Whereas the second bombing destroyed the Asociacion Mutual \n     Israelita Argentina (AMIA) Jewish Community Center, killing \n     86 people and injuring over 200 people; and\n       Whereas the investigation of the Israeli Embassy bombing \n     has been hampered by the inefficiency of having the entire \n     membership of the Supreme Court of Argentina in charge of the \n     investigation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) notes that as of March 17, 1997, 5 years after the \n     bombing of the Israeli Embassy and 2\\1/2\\ years after the \n     bombing of the AMIA Jewish Community Center, Argentinean \n     police and judicial authorities have not identified and \n     initiated prosecution of the perpetrators of these 2 \n     barbarous acts of terrorism;\n       (2) urges the Supreme Court of Argentina to designate a \n     single investigative judge to conduct the investigation of \n     the terrorist bombing of the Israeli Embassy in order to \n     improve the efficiency of the inquiry;\n       (3) urges Argentinean judicial authorities to aggressively \n     investigate the bombing of the AMIA Jewish Community Center \n     and the possible connection between that bombing and the \n     bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires;\n       (4) urges Argentinean authorities to acknowledge publicly \n     the reports submitted by Argentinean, United States, and \n     Israeli experts, that the explosion at the Israeli Embassy \n     took place outside the walls of the embassy;\n\n[[Page S3059]]\n\n       (5) urges the President and appropriate executive agencies \n     to provide whatever assistance is requested by Argentinean \n     Government authorities in order to help that Government \n     investigate these 2 acts of terrorism; and\n       (6) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to the Government of Argentina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/10/senate-section/article/S3058-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3059]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        SENATE RESOLUTION 70--REGARDING EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK\n\n       Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Reid, \n     Mr. Harkin, Ms. Landrieu, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Durbin, Ms. \n     Moseley-Braun, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Kerry) submitted the \n     following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \n     Labor and Human Resources.\n\n                               S. Res. 70\n\n       Whereas, in recent years, the participation of women in the \n     workforce has increased dramatically, with women now making \n     up almost half of the workforce;\n       Whereas families in which both parents must work are the \n     norm;\n       Whereas in 1995, 72 percent of all 2-parent families with \n     children, or 18,000,000 such families, were supported by a \n     working mother and father;\n       Whereas many families depend on the pay of working women;\n       Whereas some families depend wholly on women's pay, with 22 \n     percent of all families with children, or 7,600,000 such \n     families, being headed by single mothers;\n       Whereas the inability to earn adequate pay is a burden for \n     an entire family and sometimes forces women onto public \n     assistance to provide for their families;\n       Whereas unfair pay disparities lead to inadequate savings \n     for retirement and lower pensions for women;\n       Whereas on average, during the period between 1995 and \n     1981, a woman earned only 60 cents for each dollar earned by \n     a man;\n       Whereas on average a woman earned 63.9 cents for each \n     dollar earned by a man in 1955, a figure that improved only \n     to 71.4 cents for each such dollar in 1997, with a woman of \n     color earning even less;\n       Whereas this improvement equals an average annual increase \n     of only 0.28 percent from 1955 to 1997;\n       Whereas much of this improvement has resulted from a \n     decline in men's real pay and, if men's real pay had not \n     declined, there would have been a much smaller increase in \n     women's pay relative to men's pay;\n       Whereas working women have benefited the United States \n     economy enormously;\n       Whereas the provision of equal pay helps business by \n     improving productivity and reducing employee turnover;\n       Whereas the pay disparities cost the economy \n     $130,000,000,000 in lost purchasing power per year;\n       Whereas ensuring equal pay is a high priority for working \n     women and their families;\n       Whereas it took a woman, on average, from January 1, 1996, \n     to April 11, 1997, to receive as much pay as a man received \n     in 1996 alone; and\n       Whereas April 11 is being recognized as National Pay \n     Inequity Awareness Day: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) women have made great contributions to the United \n     States workforce and the United States economy and should be \n     paid fairly and have the same access to education and \n     training as men;\n       (2) all employers, in the public and private sectors, \n     should comply with Federal and State law requiring equal pay \n     for equal work;\n       (3) many employers have made serious efforts to provide \n     equal pay and should be commended for those efforts; and\n       (4) all employers should address unequal pay in their \n     workplaces and ensure that working families can prosper.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this Friday, April 11, is National Pay \nInequity Awareness Day, the day on which an average woman's salary, \nwhen combined with her salary from last year, will equal the salary \nearned by an average man in 1996 alone. It is a day that challenges us \nto meet our goal of providing equal pay for equal work. Today I want to \ntake another step toward this goal by introducing Senate Resolution 70, \na resolution recognizing the important role that women play in the work \nforce and in supporting their families and how far we have yet to go \nbefore they will be fairly paid for their efforts.\n  This is an issue of fairness and of families. In 1995, 72 percent of \nall two-parent families with children--18 million in total--were \nsupported by a working father and a working mother. An additional 7.6 \nmillion families were dependent entirely on the income of a working \nmother. The burden of unfair pay falls directly on these families, and \nmakes an immediate difference in their lives. For example, an average \nfemale secretary makes $2,000 less than a male secretary. Think of the \ndifference that $2,000 can make in the life of a family--it can pay for \nbags of groceries, checkups for the children, or rent. Unfair pay is \nmore than a slogan, it means less security for families struggling to \nmeet the needs of their everyday lives.\n  There is no dispute about the facts. On average, women earn 71 cents \nfor every dollar earned by a man. And even professional women earn less \nthan men, even when women have the same duties, experience, and \neducational level. On average, female lawyers earn $11,000 less than \nmale lawyers. Female computer programmers earn $4,000 less than their \nmale counterparts. The discrepancies are equally great for women who \nwork for hourly wages. Over her lifetime, the average woman will earn \n$420,000 less than a man. This leaves retired women with smaller \npensions and leads to a high rate of poverty among elderly women.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to the time when we no longer need to \nrecognize National Pay Inequity Awareness Day. It is my hope that as \nwomen's wages increase, this day will fall earlier and earlier in the \nyear, and that, someday soon, when women are finally paid what they \ndeserve, we won't need to commemorate this day at all. One important \nstep toward that goal would be the enactment of S. 71, the Paycheck \nFairness Act. It would provide important new tools to remedy this \nproblem of unfair wages, and I urge my colleagues to give it their full \nsupport.\n  I also urge my colleagues to show their support for the principle of \nfair pay by joining me in support of this resolution recognizing \nNational Pay Inequity Awareness Day. It calls for all women to be paid \nfairly, for women to have the same access to education and training as \nmen, for all employers to comply with State and Federal laws requiring \nequal pay for equal work, and it commends employers who have made \nprogress in this important area. It is a small but important way to \ndemonstrate our support for working women, and to participate in the \nactivities taking place in more than 30 States around the Nation to \nhighlight the wage gap. Raising women's salaries presents us with \nformidable challenges, but, together, I am convinced that we will be \nsuccessful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/10/senate-section/article/S3059-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3059-S3062]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  THE NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY ACT OF 1997\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   REID (AND BRYAN) AMENDMENT NO. 28\n\n  Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Bryan) proposed an amendment to \namendment No. 27 proposed by Mr. Thurmond to the bill (S. 104) to amend \nthe Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982; as follows:\n\n       At the end of the matter proposed to be inserted, add:\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this bill, \n     transportation of spent nuclear fuel or high-level \n     radioactive waste under the provisions of this bill to a \n     centralized interim storage site or to a permanent repository \n     shall not cross any state line without the express written \n     consent of the governor of the State of entry.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    WELLSTONE AMENDMENTS NOS. 29-30\n\n  Mr. REID (for Mr. Wellstone) proposed two amendments to amendment No. \n26 proposed by Mr. Murkowski to the bill, S. 104, supra; as follows:\n\n                            Amendment No. 29\n\n       On page 22 of the substitute, line 5, after ``(3)(B)'' \n     insert ``until the Secretary has made a determination that \n     personnel in all State, local, and tribal jurisdictions on \n     primary and alternative shipping routes have met acceptable \n     standards of training for emergency responses to accidents \n     involving spent nuclear fuel and high-level nuclear waste, as \n     established by the Secretary, and''.\n\n                            Amendment No. 30\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, I rise to recognize the \noutstanding achievements of the ``Top 25'' women-owned businesses in \nNew Mexico that are being honored by Albuquerque Woman magazine. These \nbusinesses--small-, medium-, and large-sized--are all contributing to \nthe economic well-being of our State.\n  It is not easy to start up a new business venture, and it is even \nmore difficult to become a prosperous enterprise. Economic success \nrequires the dedication, hard work and know how that all of the winners \nof the ``Top 25'' awards have shown. But successful businesses operated \nby caring individuals generate more than economic growth, they also \nbuild our communities. If you look at the list of the businessowners \nthat I will include later in my statement, you will notice many\n\n[[Page S3064]]\n\nfamiliar names. These names are familiar because these women are \ncontributing their energy and insight to improving our communities in \nNew Mexico every day.\n  We face many challenges in my home State of New Mexico, not the least \nof which is to create jobs that pay good wages and provide retirement \nsecurity. The contributions these women businessowners have made \nrepresent real progress in building both the human and capital \ninfrastructure of private enterprise in New Mexico. I congratulate them \non their accomplishments and wish them well on the further growth of \ntheir businesses.\n  The list of those businessowners being honored by Albuquerque Woman \nmagazine are: Teresa McBride, Jo Summers, Dorothy Queen, Melissa \nDeaver, Barbara Trythall, Kathleen Olson, Shirley Jones, Judy Roberts, \nCarole Petranovich, Sandra Bundy, Judi Friday, several doctors from \nWomen's Specialists of New Mexico Ltd., Ching-Ching Ganley, Caroline \nRoberts, Laurie Steinberg, Elizabeth Pohl, Joan Rosley-Griffin, Ella \nLeeper, Mary Severns, Sandra Levinson, Annique Torres, Brenda Kilmer, \nSally C.

Mr President, I would like to make my colleagues \naware of an important event taking place in my home city of Detroit, \nMichigan--the opening of the new Museum of African American History. \nThe Museum is unique in its size, scope and mission.\n  Located in Detroit's Cultural Center, the 120,000 square foot Museum \nof African American History is the largest museum in the nation \ndedicated to documenting and celebrating the African American \nexperience. It is led by Kimberley Camp, who was the first African \nAmerican gallery director in the history of the Smithsonian Institute. \nUnder Dr. Camp's leadership, the Museum is poised to become a \ndestination for tourists and researchers from around the country.\n  The Museum was designed by prominent Detroit architects Howard Sims \nand Harold Varner, of Sims-Varner and Associates, Inc. Using \ncontemporary building materials, Mr. Sims and Mr. Varner created a \nbuilding thoroughly American in design, but with significant accents \nwhich evoke African culture and traditions. Two Detroit artists, \nRichard Bennett and Hubert Massey, created some of the most striking of \nthese accents. Mr. Bennett's massive African-style masks adorn the \nfacade above the bronze front doors, which he also created. Mr. \nMassey's terrazzo tile mosaic, ``Genealogy,'' is interwoven with the \nfloor in the rotunda. Crowning the rotunda is a glass and steel dome, \nthe largest dome in southeastern Michigan.\n  The central display in the Museum will be the core exhibition, ``Of \nthe people: An African American experience.'' This exhibition will use \nhistorical artifacts, audio recordings, documents, and three-\ndimensional displays to take visitors through the totality of the \nAfrican American experience, from the first slave ships through the \npresent day. Displays will also put into context the importance of \nAfrican traditions in historical and modern American culture. Two \nadditional galleries will be used for new and changing exhibits.\n  The men and women of the new Museum of African American History are \ncommitted to creating an institution which is truly a partner in the \ncommunity. To that end, the Museum will offer a lecture series, after-\nschool programs for Detroit children, weekend workshops for children \nand adults and theatrical arts programs.\n  The Museum never would have been built without the leadership of \nMayors Coleman Young and Dennis Archer, and without the financial \nsupport of the residents of Detroit and the corporate community. All of \nthem came together and pledged their support for what will be the \nfinest institution of its kind in the country.\n  At the Museum's grand opening on April 12, the United States Postal \nService will unveil the winning design for the first stamp celebrating \nKwanzaa. The Kwanzaa stamp, which has been designed by the \ninternationally acclaimed artist Synthia Saint James, will highlight \nthe importance of African traditions in the lives of so many Americans. \nMs. Saint James is an accomplished author, poet, and award-winning \nillustrator of books for children and adults. She has previously been \ncommissioned to create works of art for organizations like UNICEF, \nDance Africa and the Girl Scouts of America.\n  Mr. President, it is important that we recognize the contributions \nAfrican Americans have made to our nation's cultural heritage. People \nof all races will learn and be touched by their experience at Detroit's \nMuseum of African American History. On the occasion of the Museum's \ngrand opening, I know my colleagues join me in congratulating the men \nand women who helped make this remarkable institution a reality. \n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/10/senate-section/article/S3064-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--SENATE RESOLUTION 70\n\n  Mr. FORD.

Res. 20\n\n       Whereas on March 17, 1992, the Israeli Embassy in Beunos \n     Aires, Argentina, a school, and several nearby buildings were \n     destroyed by a powerful suicide car bomb blast in which 29 \n     innocent children, women, and men lost their lives and an \n     additional 252 innocent people were injured;\n       Whereas the victims of this terrorist attack included \n     employees of the Israeli Embassy and their families, children \n     from a nearby Roman Catholic primary school, women and men \n     from a nearby Roman Catholic church shelter, a Roman Catholic \n     priest, and people from across the spectrum of Argentine \n     society;\n       Whereas Argentina's Jewish community, which numbers 300,000 \n     and is the largest Jewish community in Latin American, has \n     suffered severe anti-Semitism during periods of military rule \n     and feels particularly vulnerable to assault from certain \n     radical Islamic groups and from indigenous far right \n     extremists in Argentina;\n       Whereas Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the \n     bombing of the Israeli Embassy and praised the name of the \n     alleged suicide bomber, Abu Yasser, by calling him a ``martyr \n     struggler'';\n       Whereas Islamic Jihad is a terrorist organization that is \n     supported by Iran and, according to Department of State \n     officials, Iranian diplomats collected information to plan \n     the bombing;\n       Whereas the failure of Argentine and international efforts \n     to bring the perpetrators of the embassy bombing to justice \n     made Argentina a prime target for a second devastating \n     terrorist attack on July 18, 1994;\n       Whereas the second bombing destroyed the Asociacion Mutual \n     Israelita Argentina (AMIA) Jewish Community Center, killing \n     86 people and injuring over 200 people; and\n\n[[Page S3065]]\n\n       Whereas the investigation of the Israeli Embassy bombing \n     has been hampered by the inefficiency of having the entire \n     membership of the Supreme Court of Argentina in charge of the \n     investigation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) notes that as of March 17, 1997, 5 years after the \n     bombing of the Israeli Embassy and 2\\1/2\\ years after the \n     bombing of the AMIA Jewish Community Center, Argentinean \n     police and judicial authorities have not identified and \n     initiated prosecution of the perpetrators of these 2 \n     barbarous acts of terrorism;\n       (2) urges the Supreme Court of Argentina to designate a \n     single investigative judge to conduct the investigation of \n     the terrorist bombing of the Israeli Embassy in order to \n     improve the efficiency of the inquiry;\n       (3) urges Argentinean judicial authorities to aggressively \n     investigate the bombing of the AMIA Jewish Community Center \n     and the possible connection between that bombing and the \n     bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires;\n       (4) urges Argentinean authorities to acknowledge publicly \n     the reports submitted by Argentinean, United States, and \n     Israeli experts, that the explosion at the Israeli Embassy \n     took place outside the walls of the embassy;\n       (5) urges the President and appropriate executive agencies \n     to provide whatever assistance is requested by Argentinean \n     Government authorities in order to help that Government \n     investigate these 2 acts of terrorism; and\n       (6) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to the Government of Argentina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/10/senate-section/article/S3064-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDESIGNATING THE J.

Mr. President, James Philander Campbell made \nsignificant contributions to the State of Georgia and the Nation during \nhis lifetime, especially in the area of agriculture. J. Phil Campbell \nwas born in Dallas, GA, just northeast of Atlanta, on March 28, 1878. \nHe grew up on a farm and at an early age helped enact legislation to \nauthorize agriculture instruction in Georgia's rural schools. Mr. \nCampbell was a true visionary who saw the importance of agriculture to \nour Nation and the need to establish a comprehensive national strategy.\n  Between 1908 and 1910, Mr. Campbell served as the first farm \nextension supervisor to the southeast region. This was done before \npassage of the Smith-Lever Act in 1915, which created the Federal \nextension service. In 1910, he began a career as the Georgia State \nagent for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as well as serving on the \nstaff of Georgia State University's College of Agriculture.\n  Mr. Campbell was the director of extension work in agriculture and \nhome economics. In 1933, he helped assist the Agriculture Adjustment \nAdministration with its cotton belt crop replenishment division. \nShortly thereafter, he was named as Assistant Chief of the Soil \nConservation Service in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. He remained \nat that post until his death in December 1944.\n  The legislation we have before us today, H.R. 785, sponsored by \nRepresentative Charlie Norwood, recognizes the lifetime accomplishments \nof Mr. Campbell by renaming a building which he was substantially \nresponsible for creating, the Southern Piedmont Conservation Research \nCenter, in his honor. H.R. 785 is similar to legislation which I \nintroduced earlier this year, S. 338, which renames this center in Mr. \nCampbell's honor. I would like to thank my colleague in the House, \nRepresentative Norwood, for his work on this legislation, as well as \nSenator Cleland for his cosponsorship of S. 338 and help in \nfacilitating the passage of H.R. 785. I would also like to thank \nChairman Lugar, the staff of the Senate Agriculture Committee, the \nmajority leader, and the minority leader for their help in enacting \nthis legislation.\n  The Southern Piedmont Conservation Research Center is located on \nExperimental Station Road in Watkinsville, GA. This legislation would \nredesignate this facility as the ``J. Phil Campbell, Senior Natural \nResource Conservation Center.'' I would like to point out that the \nCongressional Budget Office [CBO] has stated that enactment of this \nlegislation will result in no significant cost to the Federal \nGovernment or taxpayers. In addition, Secretary of Agriculture Dan \nGlickman has no objections to this legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing Mr. Campbell's \ncontributions to agriculture and our Nation by supporting this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I ask unanimous consent the bill be \nconsidered, read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and any statements relating to the bill be placed \nat the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 785) was passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/10/senate-section/article/S3065-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3065-S3066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      JUNETEENTH INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the Judiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration \nof S.J. Res. 11 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 11) commemorating \n     ``Juneteenth Independence Day,'' the day on which slavery \n     finally came to an end in the United States.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the joint resolution.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today we recognize the date upon which \nslavery finally came to an end in the United States, June 19, 1865, \nalso known as ``Juneteenth Independence Day.'' It was only on this day \nthat slaves in the Southwest finally learned of the end of slavery. \nSince that time, for over 130 years, the descendants of slaves have \ncelebrated this day in honor of the many unfortunate people who lived \nand suffered under slavery. Their suffering can never be repaired, but \ntheir memory can serve to ensure that no such inhumanity is ever \nperpetrated again on American soil. We commemorate Juneteenth \nIndependence Day to honor the struggles of these slaves and former \nslaves, to acknowledge their suffering and so that we may never forget \neven the worst aspects of our Nation's history.\n  But this day and this resolution in honor of the end of slavery \nshould also make us feel proud, proud that we as a Nation have come so \nfar toward advancing the goals of freedom and justice for all of our \ncitizens. While we must continue ever forward in the search for \njustice, we should be thankful that the tireless efforts of vigilant \nAmericans have enabled us to achieve a society built on Democratic \nprinciples and the recognition that all men and women are created \nequal.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, today, April 11, is national pay \ninequity awareness day. Today we recognize that women are still earning \nless than 75 cents for every dollar that a man earns and that this pay \ndifferential has a long-lasting negative impact on women and on the \nNation.\n  Women earn less than men. In 1981, a woman earned just 60 cents for \nevery dollar a man earned. We have made progress and today women are \nearning about 71 cents on the dollar. In Illinois that number is just \n66 cents for every dollar, but even this is progress. Nonetheless the \nremaining inequity is unacceptable.\n  Besides the basic equity issue, the fact that women earn less than \nmen is unacceptable for three reasons: women comprise over half the \npopulation, women contribute to family income in over half of all \nAmerican families, and women live longer than men.\n  Women make up over half the population and that means that pay \ninequities affect the majority of the American people. Employers \ncontinue routinely to pay lower wages on jobs that women dominate and \nin many cases women receive less pay for performing the same work as \nmen. Women in the American work force are not only met\n\n[[Page S3066]]\n\nwith the challenge of breaking through a glass ceiling, but also a \nglass wall.\n  Women are breadwinners in over half of all American families. The \nfact that over a lifetime, this difference in pay can equal over a \nquarter of a million dollars has a direct impact on America's \nfamilies--families struggling to send their children to school, to pay \ntheir mortgages, to save for retirement. Women who receive 71 cents on \nthe dollar in wages are not able to pay 71 cents on the dollar for \ngroceries or child care. Equal pay is a survival issue for America's \nfamilies.\n\n  Women live longer than men. Women are going to spend more years in \nretirement and will have to make their fixed incomes stretch even \nfurther. The impact of lower lifetime earnings mean that only a third \nof female retirees today earn private pension benefits and the median \npension benefit for women is half that of men's. In addition, while \nSocial Security covers most female retirees, women's benefits are lower \nthan men's. Even with full benefits, Social Security was never meant to \nprovide for a secure retirement, it is only a floor. Today, women make \nup three-quarters of the elderly poor because they continue to earn \nless in retirement.\n  Women make up the majority of the population, are breadwinners in the \nmajority of families and live longer than men. These facts combined \nwith the reality of women's lower earnings result in a system of \ninequity that hurts America's families.\n  It is for these reasons that I joined my colleagues in sponsoring a \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment recognizing the important contributions \nwomen make to our country, recognizing the strides that employers have \nmade in the area, and calling on all employers to address the issue of \nequal pay in their workplaces so that America's families can prosper. \nThis is a resolution I believe we can all support.\n  I am also the cosponsor of legislation in this Congress that will \nmake it easier for women to challenge unfair pay practices and for the \nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission to pursue cases of unequal \ncompensation. This legislation is a basic remedy for a problem we all \nagree should not exist. I urge my colleagues to join me in sponsoring \nS. 71.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be \nconsidered read a third time and passed, the preamble be agreed to, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements \nrelating to the bill appear at this point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The joint resolution (S.J. Res. 11) was ordered to be engrossed for a \nthird reading, was read the third time, and passed.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The joint resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 11\n\n       Whereas news of the end of slavery came late to frontier \n     areas of the country, especially in the American Southwest;\n       Whereas the African-Americans who had been slaves in the \n     Southwest thereafter celebrated June 19 as the anniversary of \n     their emancipation;\n       Whereas their descendants handed down that tradition from \n     generation to generation as an inspiration and encouragement \n     for future generations;\n       Whereas Juneteenth celebrations have thus been held for 130 \n     years to honor the memory of all those who endured slavery \n     and especially those who moved from slavery to freedom; and\n       Whereas their example of faith and strength of character \n     remains a lesson for all Americans today, regardless of \n     background or region or race: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That the \n     annual observance of June 19 as Juneteenth Independence Day \n     is an important and enriching part of our country's history \n     and heritage.\n       That the celebration of Juneteenth provides an opportunity \n     for all Americans to learn more about our common past and to \n     better understand the experiences that have shaped our \n     Nation.\n       That a copy of this resolution be transmitted to the \n     National Association of Juneteenth Lineage as an expression \n     of appreciation for its role in promoting the observance of \n     Juneteenth Independence Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/10/senate-section/article/S3065-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nPERMITTING THE USE OF THE ROTUNDA OF THE CAPITOL FOR A CEREMONY AS PART \n   OF THE COMMEMORATION OF THE DAYS OF REMEMBRANCE OF VICTIMS OF THE \n                               HOLOCAUST\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.
