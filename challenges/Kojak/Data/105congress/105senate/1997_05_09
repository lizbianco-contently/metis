Mr. President, pursuant to the order, I rise today to \nspeak to the release of the report, and I will show you this report. \nThe report is entitled, and I think the title is important, ``U.S. and \nAllied Efforts To Recover and Restore Gold Stolen by Germany During \nWorld War II.'' I think that description of the report is totally \ninadequate. It is a great report. The author and the person who has \nworked so hard, Ambassador Stuart Eizenstat, Under Secretary of \nCommerce and soon to be Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs in the \nState Department, should be proud. We should all commend him for his \nefforts at getting the truth.\n  What this report might better be called is the report on the greatest \nrobbery that mankind has seen take place under the guise of the law and \nunder the guise of civilized conventions and under and with the \napproval of allies who did not face the killing machine of the German \nNazi armies. This was after the war that the greatest looting continued \nand this conspiracy continued for 50-plus years.\n  Let me say we owe a great debt of gratitude to Stuart Eizenstat \nbecause he comes forward with the truth--not all of it, because not all \nof the documents and not all of the evidence are available or have been \nmade available, but it is a beginning. His dedication to the truth and \nthe perseverance he has demonstrated, and those who work with him, to \nbring us to this point should be commended. He has done this despite \nopposition from many quarters,\n\n[[Page S4256]]\n\nquarters within our own Government, the State Department. The State \nDepartment was not happy; they were not happy campers. He pushed \nforward and he saw to it that this report was released. It really \ncracks the conspiracy, the veil of secrecy that has existed for 50-plus \nyears. It begins to unravel the web and the deception that has been \ncontinued for 50 years, the so-called neutrality of some nations, and \nparticularly the Swiss.\n  Simply put, this report details the greatest robbery in the history \nof mankind. It underscores the necessity for a complete review and \nrelease of all of the documents and a full accounting of the assets \nthat the Swiss held during the war and continued to hold for the past \n50 years. It is outrageous that this crime could continue and that \nthere were nations and citizens and representatives of this country, as \nwell as our allies, as well as the French, as well as the English, who \ncountenanced this. There were no great German armies threatening them \nat that point in time. The Swiss cannot claim that they were fearful \nbecause they were surrounded and they were a tiny little nation.\n  The report demonstrates beyond a shadow of a doubt the guilt and \ncomplicity of the Swiss Government as the bankers for the Nazis during \nWorld War II. Holocaust victims and their families have to shudder when \nthey read this report. It leaves the unmistakable conclusion that we \nhave to look carefully and ask our allies to look with us at whether or \nnot we should reopen the Washington accords. The Washington accords set \nthe basis for the distribution of billions and billions of dollars \nworth of gold.\n  Literally, let me say that it would appear that the Swiss Government \nwithheld billions. I will get into some detail and indicate how much. \nIt is very clear that the Swiss Government was not forthcoming, that \nthey were deceptive in terms of how much in the way of assets they were \nholding, that the Nazi killing machine had deposited with them. They \nkept these billions of dollars illegally and improperly, \nnotwithstanding the bonafideness they might claim as a result of the \naccords being agreed to by the Allies.\n  Some of this money, unmistakably, came from the death camps, places \nlike Auschwitz and Treblinka, as well as from the peoples throughout \nEurope who were slaughtered when the Nazi killing machine swept across \nthe Continent. In the 1946 accords between the Allies and Switzerland, \nthe Swiss Government only agreed to give the Allies $58 million in \ngold. That would be the equivalent of about $580 million today, despite \nthe fact that even some of our negotiators knew they had at least $398 \nmillion, or worth close to $4 billion today. So, while they had $4 \nbillion that never belonged to them, they distributed and agreed to \ndistribute a small portion of that. They basically said, ``We have it, \nwe are not telling you how much, and this is how much we are going to \ngive you.''\n  The report indicates that the Swiss refused to give the Allies any \nmore than $28 million in what we call German external assets. Those are \nthe assets that are stocks and bonds and insurance policies, real \nestate, and others. Despite the fact that we knew that they had the \nequivalent of between $4 and $8 billion, they said, ``We will give the \nequivalent of less than $300 million.''\n  There is a movie that has become somewhat famous called ``Jerry \nMaguire.'' In that, the athlete, I think the movie star Cuba Gooding \nJr., has a great line when he says, ``Show me the money.'' Well, Mr. \nPresident, it is about time we said to the Swiss, ``Show us the \nmoney,'' give to the world a full and proper accounting, reopen those \naccords.\n  There was a claim by the Swiss Ambassador the other day saying, ``You \ncannot hold us responsible for what took place 50 years ago.'' To that \nextent I can say, that is correct. Most of the individuals today in \nGovernment or in positions of responsibility were nowhere around then. \nThey did not make those decisions. They did not make the decisions \nrelating to trafficking with the Nazis, being their bankers, or, \nindeed, keeping the loot thereafter and refusing to meet their \nlegitimate obligations. But we can hold them accountable now. We can \nand we must.\n\n  There are going to be great pressures to say, ``Come on, stop rocking \nthe boat.'' There are tremendous international consequences in terms of \nthe international corporations that these banks do business with and/or \ncontrol and/or work with. These billions of dollars that they have had \nand have used all these years at their disposal, they are not so \nanxious to depart with them. Indeed, if one were to say, ``Give us a \nreal accounting, show us all of the money, the money and profits that \nwere made as a result of the billions of dollars that you have kept \nover the years,'' wouldn't that be interesting.\n  The question as to where did all of that money go becomes important. \nWho concealed it for all these years? Why did it take a righteous man \nlike Christophe Meili, a young bank guard, to stop the records of these \ntransactions from being shredded? He attempted to. He is a young bank \nguard who stumbled upon Union Bank of Switzerland shredding records 5 \nmonths ago. Should we say anyone who is alive today is responsible for \nwhat took place 50 years ago when they were not there? We can certainly \nsay, why would you shred records now, records that related to great \ncompanies and corporations and the business activities that they had \nwith the Germans, records that, it would seem, indicated that there \nwere properties of Jews that were forced to leave, forced sales? Why \nwould the bank historian do this, and what was the fate of this \nparticular young man?\n  This week we heard testimony from Mr. Meili, who, as a result of \nturning over some documents to the Jewish Historical Society, who then \nturned them over to the Swiss police, has come under tremendous \npressure. Instead of being held as a righteous person and a man who did \nwhat was correct, he has received hundreds of death threats, in \nwriting--not just by way of the telephone. His children have been the \nsubject of harassment, and they are 2 and 4 years old. He has been \nthreatened and the lives of his children--it has been indicated they \nwould be kidnapped in retaliation for his act of courage. Here is a \nyoung man who acted as a righteous person, and instead of beinging \ntreated as a hero for standing up and doing what is right, he has been \ntreated like a criminal.\n  Yes, the Swiss Government and their Ambassador has said, ``Do not \njudge us on the events that occurred 50 years ago but on what we do \ntoday.'' Certainly, if the treatment of Mr. Meili is any indication of \ntheir commitment to finding truth, then it makes it rather difficult to \nhold out hope that they are really dedicated to attempting to deal with \nthe horrors that took place and have been concealed for 50 years.\n  The Swiss bankers owe the world a total and full accounting, as do \nour allies. It is about time that our allies and this Government put \naside the diplomatic niceties and do what they should have done 50 \nyears ago and do the right thing. You don't have to be a rocket \nscientist to know that there are going to be great pressures to put \nthis aside. I think what is taking place is unconscionable, and it is \ntime to set the record straight.\n  Because of the importance of the report of Mr. Eizenstat, as well as \nthe great work of Mr. Slany, the historian of the State Department, we \nwill be holding Banking Committee hearings on Thursday, May 15. We will \nhear from Ambassador Eizenstat, and Mr. Slany, the State Department \nhistorian. They will discuss the findings of the report, what it \ncovers, what it doesn't cover. We will also hear from Ambassador Borer, \nof the Swiss Foreign Ministry; he is their special ambassador. Finally, \nwe will hear from Tom Bower, author of the book ``Nazi Gold,'' which \ntraces the history of the Swiss banks during World War II, and Rabbi \nMarvin Hier, of the Simon Weisenthal Center in Los Angeles. Rabbi Hier \nhas played a major role in tracing the flow of assets of Europe to \nSouth America during this period.\n  Mr. President, the world deserves the truth. For 50 years, it has \nbeen hidden in the archives while justice has been denied to the \nvictims of the Holocaust and the survivors. This is the greatest \ntragedy, a tragedy of indifference, a tragedy of the indifference of \nthe Swiss bankers and it is disgraceful. They knew they were accepting \nlaundered gold and that they were financing the Nazi war machine. As \nSecretary Eizenstat said, the Swiss bankers extended the war. How many \npeople died\n\n[[Page S4257]]\n\nbecause of this? We don't know. We may never know the answer. But it is \nour duty to get the facts and have a full accounting from the bankers.\n  During these ``Days of Remembrance'' of the Holocaust, it is our duty \nto go forward to try to achieve some measure of justice for those who \ncannot fight for themselves. In memory of those who died in the \nHolocaust, and the people who still act courageously, like Christophe \nMeili, we must continue the inquiry so that the full truth be known.\n  This past Tuesday, Mr. President, Mr. Meili came before the Banking \nCommittee. His testimony was chilling, to say the least. As we reached \nthe end, I asked him several questions. I turn to page 40 of the \ntranscript. Mr. President, let me say that this was not a Q and A in \nwhich the questions were known to the person who was being asked, nor \ndid I have any idea or know how Mr. Meili--the 28-year-old bank guard \nwho came from Switzerland this past Friday, and is in this country \nnow--would respond. I said:\n\n       Let me, if I might, just ask several other questions, and \n     then put some letters . . . into the record.\n\n  And I turned to him and I said:\n\n       What made you, Christophe, think that the records you found \n     were important and should be saved from destruction?\n\n  Through his interpreter, Mr. Meili said this:\n\n       A few months before, I had seen the movie ``Schindler's \n     List.'' And that's how, when I saw these documents, I \n     realized I must take responsibility; I must do something.\n\n  He is a 28-year-old bank guard in Switzerland. He did something that \nwas right, that was courageous. He is a non-Jew, but he had seen \n``Schindler's List'' and he was moved, he was compelled to respond, to \nstop the shredding of these documents or the destruction, to report \nthem to someone, and to say should this be done?\n  And then, Mr. President, if that wasn't chilling enough--and, really, \nit seems to me a call for those of us who have the power and the \nresponsibility of righting these wrongs--I asked him if there were any \nclosing remarks he would like to make, that we would be glad to receive \nthem. I asked that question of the three witnesses who appeared before \nus. Here is what Mr. Meili said:\n\n       Please protect me in the United States and in Switzerland. \n     I think I become a great problem in Switzerland. I have a \n     woman, two little children, and no future. I must see what \n     goes on in the next days for me. Please protect me. That is \n     all. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\n  Mr. President, it is not good enough for the Swiss Ambassador to say, \n``You can't hold us responsible for what took place 50 years ago,'' \nwhen a young man who has attempted to do what is right finds himself \nostracized, finds the power of the Swiss Government and the Swiss \nbanks--who indeed run the Swiss Government, as a practical matter--and \nthat remark may draw their ire and their fire and their protest, that a \nyoung man who acted courageously now finds himself a victim scorned, \nthe lives of his wife and children threatened. How can we do any less \nthan what one individual, Christophe Meili, attempted to do, and that \nis to do what is right?\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that this week when we have these hearings, \nthis will be a new beginning and it will energize our Government and \nour allies to come forward in a united way, to put aside the diplomatic \nniceties that have shrouded this over the years, to seek a full \naccounting and to seek justice once and for all.\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we are now \non general debate on S. 4; is that the order of business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Actually, we are in morning business until \n12:30.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Fine. I will proceed anyway.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/09/senate-section/article/S4255-6", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4257-S4259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE FAMILY FRIENDLY WORKPLACE ACT\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the legislation that we are discussing \ntoday, S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act, is timely, commonsense \nlegislation designed to give working families a much-needed option in \nbalancing their busy work and family schedules. I am extremely pleased \nthat the leadership has made passage of this bill a high priority.\n  The Family Friendly Workplace Act is intended to provide private-\nsector employers and employees with the same optional workplace \nflexibility benefits that public-sector employees have enjoyed since \n1978. S. 4 provides three alternative work schedule options: One, \ncompensatory time off in lieu of monetary overtime pay; two, biweekly \nwork schedules; and three, flexible credit hours. I will explain each \nof these in more detail in a minute. In addition to the workplace \nscheduling option, S. 4 offers much-needed salary basis reform, and \nthis is a very important problem that we now have as a result of recent \ncourt decisions.\n  Mr. President, there seem to be many misconceptions about what this \nlegislation does and what it doesn't do. I appear today to clear that \nup.\n  I wanted to go over, first, the four components of S. 4. I believe \nthis will give some of my colleagues a better understanding of this \nbill.\n  The first component of S. 4 is the compensatory time provision. S. 4 \nwould amend the Fair Labor Standards Act's overtime provisions to allow \nemployers to offer their employees the option of compensatory time off \ninstead of traditional overtime pay.\n  In other words, you can trade the time and a half pay for \ncompensatory time off. This provision will allow hourly employees the \nability to take time off as a result of having worked overtime. Like \nState and local government employees, private sector employees would \naccrue comptime at the same rate as an employer's normal rate of \novertime pay, that is 1\\1/2\\ hours of compensatory time off for every \nhour of overtime worked.\n  This legislation is not mandatory. It does not require employers to \noffer compensatory time off. If employers decide to offer the comptime \noption to their employees, it is up to the employees to decide whether \nor not to accept it. Employees who are members of unions will choose \ncompensatory time through the collective bargaining process. Nonunion \nemployees, on the other hand, must ``knowingly and voluntarily'' enter \ninto an agreement with their employer for comptime before they perform \nany overtime work. Again, I want to stress that this provision is \npurely voluntary.\n  Mr. President, this legislation goes to great lengths to protect \nemployees. If a nonunion employee does not like the comptime program, \nhe or she may withdraw at any time by providing his or her employer \nwith written notice. The withdrawal of employees who are members of \nunions will be controlled by the collective bargaining agreement.\n  I see no reason why unions should be in opposition to this bill.\n  If an employer finds that its comptime program is not working out, it \ncan cancel its compensatory time off policy by providing the employees \nwho have elected to earn comptime with 30 days with written notice. \nAgain, there is nothing compulsory about this law at all.\n  Employees are also permitted to cash out--receive the case equivalent \nof their accrued comptime--at any time.\n  Let me repeat that. Employees are permitted to cash out--receive the \npay equivalent of their accrued comptime--at any time. So even if an \nemployee selects the comptime option, if that employee decides at a \nlater date that he or she needs the overtime pay instead of time off, \nthe employee has the ability to cash out, to get cash for their \novertime work.\n  An employee will also receive the cash equivalent of any unused \ncompensatory hours whenever an employer discontinues its compensatory \ntime policy or in situations where an employee withdraws, resigns or is \nterminated.\n  The employer must cash out the employee's compensatory time at either \nthe employee's overtime rate or the\n\n[[Page S4258]]\n\nemployee's final rate of pay, depending on which is greater.\n  The legislation allows an employee to accrue up to 240 hours of \ncompensatory time during a 12-month period. If, after the 12-month \nperiod, an employee has not used his accrued time, the employer has 31 \ndays to remit the cash equivalent of those hours. If an employee has \naccrued over 80 hours at any time, an employer may remit the cash \nequivalent of those excess hours, in lieu of the employee taking time \noff.\n  While opponents of the legislation fear that employers will control \nwhen an employee will be able to use accrued compensatory time off, \ntheir concern is unfounded. The bill clearly states that an employee \nmust be allowed to use his or her accrued compensatory time off within \na reasonable period of time provided that the time off will not unduly \ndisrupt the workplace. This portion of the bill mirrors what is already \nfirmly established, strongly recognized, and upheld in the FLSA and the \nregulations applying to the public sector.\n  Under a compensatory time off program, an employee enjoys the \npreexisting protections of the Fair Labor Standards Act, including \nprohibitions against violations of section 7 and FLSA's discrimination \nprovision, as well as S. 4's anticoercion provision, which will be an \nadditional provision of FLSA. No employee may be coerced, intimidated \nor threatened to accept any of the bill's flexible workplace options. \nViolation of any of these provisions submits an employer to additional \nliability including liquidated damages and any other viable remedy at \nlaw or equity.\n\n\n                        Biweekly Work Schedules\n\n  The second alternative is a work scheduling option called biweekly \nwork schedules. Biweekly schedules give employees the option of \nscheduling 80 hours at any time within a 2 week period rather than \nconfining employees to scheduling 40 hours in 1 week. This greater \nflexibility gives employees the ability to create schedules that \ncoordinate their work responsibilities with their personal obligations.\n  That is an important thing to know. This gives the employees the \nflexibility to try to manage their hours within the 2-week period to \ntake care of their own personal problems, whether it is with schools, \nday care, or whatever else it is--to make everything a little bit more \nflexible, a little bit more friendly to the family.\n  Just as the election of compensatory time is voluntary, so too, is \nthe election of biweekly work schedules. Employers do not have to offer \nbiweekly schedules and any employee who is not interested in a biweekly \nschedule and may keep a traditional work schedule.\n  Again, I want to emphasize that the biweekly schedule is completely \nvoluntary. Employees who are satisfied with the existing 40 hour work \nweek are under no obligation to enter into a biweekly schedule \narrangement with their employer.\n  An employee who wants to work under a biweekly schedule must meet \nwith his or her employer prior to each 2-week work period and \nprearrange a schedule for that period. Regardless of how the hours are \ndivided, the employee will not be required to work past 80 hours during \nthe 2-week period. An employer will have to pay overtime for any \ndeviations from the schedule. Any hours that an employer requests the \nemployee to work beyond the predetermined 80 scheduled hours are \nconsidered overtime.\n  So overtime provisions are maintained. Again, it is totally \nvoluntary. So the employees have flexibility and have an understanding \nof what happens if the employer asks them to deviate from that \nschedule.\n  Once the biweekly period begins, an employer cannot alter an \nemployee's scheduled hours to meet the employer's overtime needs. Even \nif the employee has worked less than 40 hours during the week, if an \nemployer asks the employee to work hours in addition to the preset \nschedule, the additional time is considered overtime.\n  Under S. 4's biweekly work schedule provisions, employees enjoy the \npreexisting safeguards of the FLSA. Employees will also benefit from S. \n4's provisions prohibiting an employer from directly or indirectly \nintimidating, threatening, or coercing an employee to participate in a \nbiweekly schedule program.\n  Again, there is very strong protection for the employee to be \nprotected against any abuse by the employer.\n  For union employees, the particulars of a biweekly work schedule, \nsuch as hours to be worked and methods of withdrawal, will be set forth \nin a collective bargaining agreement.\n  There is no reason why any union should disagree with this. If unions \ndo not care for the biweekly scheduling option, they do not have to \nselect it.\n  In the nonunion setting, an employee would enter into an agreement \nwith his or her employer. Again, it is totally at the option of the \nemployer and the employee.\n  Because biweekly work schedule programs are voluntary, nonunion \nemployees may withdraw their agreement to participate by providing \nwritten notice to the employer. Similarly, an employer may discontinue \na biweekly work schedule program upon 30 days notice to all \nparticipating employees.\n  The third provision may seem new to some of you but, again, we have \ntaken this concept--that of flexible credit hours--from the public \nsector.\n\n\n                         Flexible credit hours\n\n  It is not uncommon for employees to need to take unpaid leave for \ncommon life events such as caring for a loved one, assisting an elderly \nparent or studying for an exam. Employees may wish to work additional \nhours, in excess of the traditional 40 hour week, in order to bank \nthose additional hours for future use.\n  Under the FLSA, however, an hourly employee is not permitted to carry \nover additional hours for use in a future work week. Instead, the \nemployer would have to pay overtime for the additional hours worked by \nthat employee. Employers who have no need for their employees to work \nextra hours are unlikely to be willing to pay employees an overtime \npremium. As a result, there is really a disincentive under the FLSA for \nemployers to provide employees with the flexibility that they demand.\n  To assist employees who would like to accrue hours for future use, \nthe third provision in this legislation is the flexible credit hour \nprogram. The flexible credit hour program would allow an employee to \nrequest to work up to 50 hours over his or her regularly scheduled \nhours.\n  Flexible credit hours are awarded on a one-to-one ratio: 1 credit \nhour for one hour over an employee's regular schedule. Each hour is a \nflexible credit hour which is then banked for future use. When \nemployees use their flexible credit hours they are compensated for \ntheir time off at their regular rate of pay.\n  Therefore, employees wishing to take an additional week of vacation \nwould have the ability to work 2 extra hours a week for 20 weeks and \nthen use the 40 flexible credit hours that they have banked so that \nthey collect a regular paycheck on their extra week off.\n  It is very, very important for workers that are trying to plan their \ntime off and who are trying to coincide with school vacations, or other \nfamily events that will require them to be away from work.\n  Allowing employees to bank hours would also provide the millions of \nAmericans who do not work overtime hours with more flexibility because \nit would give them the ability to work additional hours so that they \ncould use the paid time off when necessary.\n  As with compensatory time and biweekly programs, an employer has the \ninitial decision of whether to offer the flexible credit hour program. \nHowever, once an employer offers the program, whether an employee \nparticipates is 100 percent voluntary. If an employee elects to \nparticipate, the employer and the employee jointly designate hours for \nthe employee to work that are in excess of the basic work requirement \nof the employee so that the employee can accrue flexible credit hours.\n  The anticoercion, remedy, and sanction provisions applicable to \ncompensatory time-off options and biweekly work schedule programs apply \nto the flexible credit programs as well.\n  Compensation for unused accrued credit hours is handled in much the \nsame way that compensation for unused compensatory time is handled. If \nan employee has not used all his or her credit hours within a 1-year \nperiod, the employer is required to cash out the employee's remaining \ncredit hours at the employee's normal rate of pay. An employee must be \nallowed to use accrued credit hours within a reasonable period of time \nfollowing the request so\n\n[[Page S4259]]\n\nlong as doing so will not unduly disrupt the workplace. This program's \nparticulars also track those of both the compensatory time off option \nand the biweekly work schedule program. Employees remain entitled to \nthe same protections and remedies, agreement, accrual, withdrawal, and \nnotice requirements.\n  These are all just merely required because the FLSA and the 40-hour \nwork week are so rigid that it is very difficult for employees and \nemployers to arrange things such that they can help employees to better \nmanage the obligations of work and family.\n  The final provision of S. 4, the salary basis fix, may seem a bit \narcane, but it is a very serious problem.\n  The fourth provision impacts the treatment of salaried employees \nrather than hourly wage employees.\n  The final portion of this legislation helps clarify a problem that \nhas arisen under the ``salary basis'' test. In recent decisions, courts \nhave clouded the salary basis test and caused unnecessary litigation \nand windfall awards for highly paid employees. This portion of the \nlegislation simply clarifies who is and who is not an exempt employee \nto prevent additional unfair payments of overtime back pay to salaried \nemployees.\n  Under the salary basis test, an employee is considered to be paid on \na salary basis, and thus exempt from FLSA, if that employee regularly \nreceives a straight salary. The FSLA provides that an exempt employee's \nsalary cannot be--subject to reduction for absences of less than a day. \nA number of court cases, however, have interpreted this language to \nmean that the theoretical possibility of a salary being docked--that \nis, decreased--for an absence of less than a day is enough to destroy \nthe employee's exemption even if that employee has never experienced an \nactual deduction.\n  It is one of those things where the Court has found something they \nbelieve to be an accurate interpretation of the law. When in fact it is \nnot Congress' intent for the law to work this way. The impact that it \nhas can be incredibly destructive.\n  For more than 5 decades the ``subject to'' language generated little \nor no controversy. In recent years, however, courts began to interpret \nthe salary-basis standard, seizing upon the ``subject to'' language, \nlarge groups of employees, many of them who are highly compensated, \nhave won multimillion-dollar judgments. These awards have been granted \nin spite of the fact that many of the plaintiff employees have never \nactually experienced a pay deduction of any kind and have never \nexpected to receive overtime pay in addition to their ``executive \nadministrative or professional'' salaries. This problem has been \nparticularly onerous in the public sector.\n  I want to be clear that the bill is intended to clarify that an \nemployee would not lose his or her exempt status just because his or \nher employer has a policy on the books that provides for a reduction in \npay for absences of less than a full day or less than a full week. \nThose employees should remain exempt and this bill would ensure that \nhappens. However, if an employee's salary was actually docked, the \nlegislation would not affect the outcome as to that employee.\n  Again, I want to emphasize that if an employer docks the pay of a \nsalaried employee, that employee could still lose his or her exempt \nstatus, but only if it has been docked.\n  The legislation also clarifies that employers may give bonuses and \novertime payments to salaried employees without destroying their \nexemption from the FLSA. That is the opposite side of the equation.\n  Finally, Mr. President, while the FLSA was enacted to protect \nworkers, many of today's work force view certain of the FLSA provisions \nas harmful rather than helpful. Given the overwhelming success of \npublic sector programs which S. 4 is modelled after here, I believe it \nis important that Congress now extend the same freedom and flexibility \nto private workers.\n  Again, I emphasize this is voluntary for both parties. The flexible \nwork schedules would give employees more control over their lives by \ngiving them a better tool to balance their family and work obligations. \nEmployers and hourly employees must be given the ability to reach \nagreement on flexible schedules beyond the standard of the inflexible \n40-hour workweek and to bank compensatory time in lieu of cash overtime \nwhere such an agreement is mutually beneficial, and voluntarily entered \ninto. Salary-basis reform for nonexempt employees would also increase \nflexibility options.\n  The FLSA should be amended to assist workers in balancing the needs \nof an evolving work environment and quality family time.\n  I thank most of all Senator Ashcroft, who has been the leader in this \nfight and who has done an outstanding job of bringing the attention to \nthis legislation, not only to the Members, but nationwide. I look \nforward to working with him and Senator DeWine on this bill. Mr. \nPresident, as I discuss the wonderful provisions in this legislation I \ncan't help but wonder why anybody could oppose it, but I expect that \nsome of my colleagues will express a differing view.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President and colleagues, let me first congratulate \nSenator Jeffords for bringing this bill to the floor and for a very \neloquent statement about the merits of this bill. I see Senator \nAshcroft, who is the author of the bill, in the Chamber. I know he \nwishes to speak about the bill, as I do. I also see Senator Kennedy, \nwho wishes to speak as well. Before I begin to talk about this bill, I \nwould like to talk about two other items.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/09/senate-section/article/S4257-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4259-S4260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SHERIFF RUSSELL A. BRADLEY\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I rise this morning to note the passing \nof a friend and former colleague. Russell A. Bradley died yesterday \nmorning. It was to me rather ironic that as I heard the news, I was \npreparing to go to a Judiciary Committee hearing to talk about the \ncrime problem in this country because Sheriff Bradley, Russell Bradley, \nwas my home county sheriff for 30 years. Russell Bradley was a \ndedicated public servant, a great politician, and was my friend. \nRussell Bradley served as Greene County Sheriff from 1957 to 1987. For \n30 years, Russ Bradley was the sheriff. Elected eight times, he built \nthe Greene County sheriff's office into the professional organization \nthat it is today and that today we, frankly, take for granted. It was \nnot so when he became sheriff in January 1957.\n  I first met Russ Bradley when I was a young boy growing up in the \nvillage of Yellow Springs. Russ Bradley at that time was the chief of \npolice. Russ Bradley was a person whom you would go to if you had a \nproblem in the community. I remember talking with him, being with him, \nfishing with him when I was a very, very young boy. In 1956, when I was \n9, Russ Bradley was elected county sheriff. He ran in the Republican \nprimary and beat the incumbent, a shock to everyone across the county. \nFrankly, it was a shock to most of us who were his friends because we \ndid not think he could win. That was the first of eight victories he \nwon running for the office of sheriff in Greene County.\n  He remained sheriff long enough so that a 9-year-old boy who knew him \nwhen he was first elected had an opportunity to grow up, go away to \ncollege, go to law school, come back home and become assistant county \nprosecutor and then have the opportunity to work on a professional \nbasis with Sheriff Bradley. I had a chance for a little over 2 years to \nserve as assistant county prosecutor, then to serve as the elected \ncounty prosecutor for 4 more years. I had the opportunity then to see \nthis man whom I had known as a young boy, to see him up close and \npersonal and work with him literally on a daily basis as we dealt with \ncrime problems in our county.\n  Russ Bradley really taught a whole generation, really two generations \nof Greene County and Ohio public servants and politicians how to win \nelections. He was the person we watched, we copied, we emulated, we \nstole ideas from. He was literally the master and we were the students. \nHe taught us how to campaign door to door and the significance of that, \nthe tenacity to continue to do that night after night. He taught us how \nto work the county fair. He even taught us things such as how to go out \nand put your signs along the\n\n[[Page S4260]]\n\nroad to make sure the signs were positioned in exactly the right \nposition so that the headlights of the car would strike that sign just \nas you came around the corner. He had it all, he did it all, and he \ntaught us very well.\n  The most important thing that he taught politicians and people in \npublic office in our area was how to be a public servant. He taught us \nthe essential lesson of politics, that public service is good politics \nand good politics is public service, and that the way to ensure being \nelected, the way to ensure being successful is always remember where \nyou came from and always remember who you serve.\n  Russ Bradley was a person who was dedicated to service. He delivered \nservice every single day. I remember talking to him when I was county \nprosecutor. He would say: Mike, you are worried about this and you are \nworried about that. The only thing you really have to worry about is \ngiving people service. Give them what they are paying you to do. When \nanybody comes in here with a problem, you try to help them solve that \nproblem. And even if you cannot solve it, if you try to help them solve \nthe problem, that is what you should be doing.\n  That is a lesson I certainly have never forgotten.\n  Russ Bradley was a great investigator. I have been involved and seen \nan awful lot of people in law enforcement over my now quarter-of-a-\ncentury career. I have never seen anyone as good as Russ Bradley at \nheading up an investigation. The tougher the case, the better he was.\n\n  I remember many days going into his office as he assembled his team \nat 8 o'clock in the morning, his detectives and his road men. You have \nto keep in mind this was not a huge department. Our county is only \n130,000, 135,000. But we would have, unfortunately, our share of \nmurders, our share of very difficult cases. I remember him bringing \npeople together every day, and he orchestrated how his men and women \nwere to go out that day and continue to follow every lead they could \ncome up with.\n  Russ Bradley knew what all people in law enforcement know. This is \nnot a glamorous job. It is a tough job. It is hard work. It is grunt \nwork, really, and following leads and being lucky if 1 out of 100 turns \ninto anything. And if you are lucky, that 1 out of 100 turns into \nsomething else and you can keep trying to unravel the crime and try to \nput the puzzle together to solve the crime.\n  He was an expert at what, for want of a better word, I would call the \ndrive-by shooting, the roadside murder where, when the police get \nthere, the sheriff gets there, the only thing they can find is the \nbody. There is just no other evidence at all. I have seen him take \ncases like that and reconstruct those cases and slowly build them week \nafter week after week and ultimately lead to a conviction of the person \nwho committed the murder.\n  Russ Bradley was the best I have known at getting a confession, and \nhe managed to operate in the pre-Miranda days and in the post-Miranda \ndays, which is quite an accomplishment. As Russ said, if anyone could \nget a confession, I could. If I couldn't get them, nobody could. He \nwould laugh with people. He would cry with them. He would pray with \nthem, whatever it took, but he would get that person's confidence and \nhe would ultimately get that person to tell him what the facts were. He \nwas a master at that.\n  Sheriff Bradley was also a great judge of people. When I would go \ninto a case, the first thing, of course, you do in a case, as a \nprosecutor, you begin the process of selecting the jury. That is a \njudgment call of who you want to serve on that jury. I always wanted \nRuss Bradley right by my side to eyeball that jury and tell me who he \nthought would be a good juror, who he thought might not be such a good \njuror. He was able to do this, not only because he knew about everybody \nin the county or knew their sister or brother or cousin or somebody, \nbut also because he was a consummate judge of human nature. He knew \npeople very well and could size a person up, his or her character, what \nkind of people they were--he could do that probably better than just \nabout anybody that I know or ever met.\n\n  This is a time to recall Sheriff Bradley, though it is not a time to \nbe sad. I do not think anyone who knew Russ Bradley could think of Russ \nBradley without smiling. He was someone who was a great practical \njokester, someone who loved to laugh, someone who loved to hunt, \nsomeone who loved to fish, someone who loved to have a good time.\n  He was a tremendous coon hunter. I remember many mornings coming in \nand, as we were about to start a trial at 9 o'clock, in Judge Aultman's \ncourt or Judge Weber's court, the sheriff would come rolling in. I \nwould meet him at the courtroom. I would look over and say, ``Russ, you \nbeen out coon hunting?''\n  He would say, ``Oh, no, just a little bit last night.''\n  Then it would come out from one of his deputies he had been up to 4 \na.m., gone home, taken a shower, a little catnap, and was able to come \ninto court raring to go. He was able to do that night after night.\n  Russ Bradley was once interviewed about his prowess as a coon hunter. \nHe said: ``A coon hunter has got to be tough. There's a lot of them who \ncan walk faster than I can, but not many who can walk longer than I \ncan.''\n  Russ Bradley, a great coon hunter, a great fisherman, someone who \nliked to have a good time as well as someone who was a great politician \nand a great public servant. I pause at this point to remember my \nfriend, Russ Bradley. There will never be another like him. He is \nsomeone who taught me a great deal over the years. He is someone whom \nwe should honor. It was an honor for me to actually serve with him on a \ndaily basis for 4 years when I was county prosecutor, but it was also, \nfrankly, a lot of fun to serve with him as well. For the rest of my \nlife I will have great memories of him, what kind of person he was and \nthe fun that we had with him, all the time he continued to do an \nexcellent job as our county sheriff.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/09/senate-section/article/S4259-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4260-S4261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 HAITI\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, let me at this point turn to another \ntopic, which I believe is very timely. It has to do with a meeting that \nPresident Clinton is having tomorrow.\n  Madam President, President Clinton will be meeting tomorrow with \nPresident Preval of Haiti. This is a very important meeting. It is \nimportant because Haiti is at a crossroads and the United States needs \nto provide all the leadership it can to help Haiti choose the right \npath. In view of this important meeting, I think it is important to \nreview Haiti's situation. I have visited the country of Haiti four \ntimes in the last 2 years, most recently just this past month. I have \ndone so to examine the conditions there and to find out about the \nprogress being made by U.S. policies in regard to that country.\n  Let me begin, if I could, by talking about the economy. The economy \nis today, as it has been for many years, to put it bluntly, in a \nshambles. Unemployment--no one knows how high the unemployment is, but \nit is said to be running at about a 65 percent rate. Privatization has \nyet to occur, but it is essential. It must occur if Haiti is to \nrecover. While it has not occurred yet, the good news is the Haitian \nGovernment has announced a calendar for privatization, something we had \nnot seen before the last several months. There is a calendar, there is \na schedule. Everyone from President Preval, through the president of \nHaiti's central bank, to members of the legislature, all personally \nassured me that this privatization calendar will be maintained, it will \nbe met. Privatization will, in fact, occur, they tell me, and \nguaranteed to me, while I was there, that this would happen.\n  Let me say, for the good of the people of that country, this \nprivatization simply must begin to take place. The people of Haiti have \nto have jobs. They need hope. They are not going to have jobs, they are \nnot going to have hope unless privatization begins, because it is only \nwith privatization that they will be able to get the economy moving \nagain. It is only by privatization that the climate will be created and \nthe right signals will be sent to the world so the world community will \nbegin to invest in Haiti. Promises will not create jobs. The people of \nHaiti have been fed on promises for two centuries. Only action will \ncreate jobs and only action will start to break this cycle of despair.\n  This privatization is important for basic economic reasons, but it is \nalso\n\n[[Page S4261]]\n\nessential for the preservation of democracy, a goal for which this \ncountry risked American lives and has already spent hundreds and \nhundreds of millions of dollars. For democracy to survive in Haiti, \npeople need to see real improvement in the lives of their families, of \ntheir children, of their loved ones. Real improvement in their lives \nwill only come with privatization. If democracy is to survive, it is \nnot enough to have elections. People have to have something to eat as \nwell. Elections are just not enough and people know that. The turnout \nin the recent legislative elections in Haiti was less than 10 percent. \nI believe we have to view that as a vote of no confidence in the \nprogress being made by the Haitian Government. Clearly Haiti needs to \nturn it around. They need, if I can use the term--they need some \nvictories. All politicians need victories. The Government of Haiti has \nto have some victories. They need to take the kind of action that will \ninspire confidence in their common future, the kind of confidence that \nis a prerequisite for economic success. The way to do this is to send \nthe right message to the rest of the world. That message is that Haiti \nis serious about participating in the global economy. Only by doing \nthis, by doing what is necessary to participate in the rising tide of \ninternational growth, can Haiti hope to spark a real economic upturn.\n  The first privatization is scheduled for this July. They first start \nwith cement factories and the flour mills. The schedule further calls \nfor, in November, the Haitian Popular Bank to privatize; in December, \nthe National Port Authority; in January, the airport and the National \nBank of Credit; finally, in February, the telephones and in March the \nelectric company. When I was in Haiti last month I stressed to my hosts \nthat they must act on this plan. Frankly, no one in Congress was going \nto believe what they said or be convinced that they were serious until, \nactually, some action took place.\n\n  I have also spoken to President Clinton about this matter, and I have \nasked the President, when he meets with President Preval tomorrow, to \nstress the importance of this privatization, to make sure the President \nof Haiti understands our very legitimate concern that this \nprivatization really take place.\n  Madam President, another key area in which Haiti needs to follow \nthrough is the investigation of the political murders. Palace security \nforces are alleged to have killed two prominent opposition politicians, \nMr. Fleurival and Reverend Leroy. In response to these murders, the \nGovernment of Haiti suspended the chief of palace security, they \nsuspended his deputy and seven Presidential Security Unit guards who \nwere allegedly at the scene.\n  The Haitian Government needs to send the strongest possible message \nthat this kind of subversion of democracy, murder of political \nopponents, will simply not be tolerated. There is a reasonable chance \nthe Leroy case will be solved, but only if there is adequate leadership \nfrom the top of the Haitian political system. In my view, this is a \ntest case of the rule of law, one that President Clinton must take up \nwith President Preval at their meeting tomorrow.\n  In other areas, Haiti is making real and measurable progress. One \nsuch area is the civilian police. In my visit to Haiti, I met again \nwith United States police officers who are helping retrain the Haitian \npolice. These are Haitian-born, Creole-speaking United States citizens \non leave from their jobs as city police officers in this country. They \ncome from cities such as Boston--I see Senator Kennedy on the floor. I \nmet with a number of those police officers from Boston. They come from \nNew York. They come from Miami. They are veterans, and they are \nmentoring these inexperienced, young Haitian police recruits.\n  Madam President, nobody expected miracles from this training program, \nbut they are making slow but solid progress. This is a program that \nworks. I am glad the State Department has responded positively to my \nurging that the number of United States advisers be doubled. That has \ntaken place, and we are now up to the number of 49. Frankly, I believe \nit is in our national interest to again significantly increase the \nnumber of these dedicated United States police officers who are serving \nin Haiti. I met with these advisers during my recent visit. I was \ngratified by what I saw. They are doing an excellent job and they need \nour continuing support. These advisers, I believe, are America's signal \nto the Haitian people that we will help them in the difficult process \nof building the rule of law in their country.\n  I, later today, will continue to discuss the situation in Haiti. At \nthat time I intend to talk about the agricultural situation and several \nother suggestions that I have that I believe will help the situation \nthere.\n  I believe, in conclusion for now, the meeting the President of the \nUnited States is having tomorrow with President Preval is a crucial \nmeeting. I believe Haiti is at a crossroads. I believe it is important \nfor our country to continue to work internally in this country to \ndevelop a bipartisan foreign policy in regard to Haiti. But, \nultimately, it is abundantly clear that, no matter what we do, the \nimportant players are really the Haitian politicians, Haitian \nGovernment officials, and the Haitian people. Our message to President \nPreval and to the Haitian people must simply be this: We can and we \nwill help you, but the destiny of your country really lies in your own \nhands.\n  Madam President, I will turn to this later in the day. I also will \nhave the opportunity, later, to discuss the comptime and flextime bill.\n  I do see my colleague from Massachusetts on the floor, so at this \ntime I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/09/senate-section/article/S4260-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4261-S4267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE FAMILY FRIENDLY WORKPLACE ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I welcome the opportunity to make some \nbrief comments on the measures which are before us here this morning, \nand that is on the legislation which is, allegedly, the family friendly \nworkplace legislation. I will just take a brief time, but I want, just \nat the outset, to indicate where we are in terms of working families in \nthis country.\n  We have made important progress in the last Congress in increasing \nthe minimum wage.\n  It was not long ago that we made real progress in trying to provide \nemployees who have worked over a long period of time in a plant or a \nfactory with notification when there was going to be a plant closing, \nso that men and women who worked years, for some a lifetime, in a \nparticular plant would not show up on Monday and find the doors boarded \nup. In the past, individuals like these were often virtually cast out \ninto the dark without any kind of notification whatsoever. We tried to \ngive, at least for the larger companies that were included in that \nlegislation, notice to the employees so that they would be treated more \nrespectfully and have more time to find a new job. That law has worked \nvery well despite the dire predictions of some in the U.S. Senate.\n  Then we had the battle on family and medical leave which gives \nparents who have a sick child the opportunity to take unpaid leave. \nEvery other industrial nation in the world has paid leave under those \ncircumstances, yet it took a lengthy battle in the U.S. Senate to get \nunpaid leave. We were able to pass it for employers with 50 or more \nemployees. I will come back to that issue in just a few moments. That \nbattle was led by our friend and colleague, Senator Dodd of \nConnecticut. I welcomed the chance to join with him on that. It was a \n5-year battle in the Senate. Twelve million Americans have taken \nadvantage of it, the law has worked very well and most Americans wonder \nwhy it took us so long.\n  Those are just three examples of issues, Madam President, which we \nhave fought for on behalf of working men and women. There have been \nmany others. What is so interesting is that in each and every one of \nthose battles, we faced opposition from the National Association of \nManufacturers; the Labor Policy Association, which is comprised of many \ndifferent companies and employers; the National Restaurant Association; \nand the NFIB. It is very interesting that now on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate, on legislation that is supposed to protect workers, those four \norganizations are trying to portray themselves as friends of the \nworker.\n\n[[Page S4262]]\n\n  It is very interesting that those groups, and many others that have \nopposed every single protection for workers in the past, are embracing \nS. 4 and are now suddenly going to protect all the employees in \nAmerica.\n  As we begin this debate, I think it is worthwhile to examine those \nthat are for this legislation and those who are critical of this \nparticular legislation. We should ask who has credibility as advocates \nfor America's workers and who does not. This bill has been described by \nits authors as ``a Mother's Day gift to America's working women.'' \nNothing could be further from the truth. It is a Mother's Day hoax. A \nmore appropriate description would be the ``Employer Choice and \nPaycheck Reduction Act,'' and it has four fatal flaws.\n  First, it would result in a pay cut for many working families. The \nbill eliminates the guarantee of pay for overtime work for 65 million \nemployees. Many of them are already struggling to make ends meet. \nNearly half of those who earn overtime pay have a total income of \n$16,000 a year or less. More than 80 percent of them earn under $28,000 \na year. Employees could allocate all overtime work to employees who \nagree to accept time off instead of extra pay for working overtime. \nThose who insist on receiving overtime pay will no longer get overtime \nwork.\n  Second, the bill provides no employee choice. Let me repeat that, \nbecause that is the heart, I think, of this whole debate: Will the \nemployee have the right to make the decision to take time off when he \nor she needs it, to go with a child to that school meeting or to that \nplay or to the dentist appointment? Or will the employer have the \nultimate authority and power to say no?\n  Under the terms of S. 4, the employer is given the power to dictate \nwhen workers can use comptime. S. 4 would not let working mothers \nchoose when to take their hard-earned comptime. That is the key to what \nis wrong with this bill. It is the heart of the debate: Where is the \npower, who determines when the employee can use the comptime which has \nbeen earned. This bill provides no employee choice.\n\n  Third, the bill will cut benefits for many workers; because it does \nnot count hours of comptime as hours worked. Health and retirement \nbenefits are widely based on the number of hours worked by employees. \nBut under the Republican bill, comptime hours do not count as hours \nworked. As a result, employees can lose eligibility for health coverage \nwhile they are working, and lose eligibility for pension benefits when \nthey retire.\n  And fourth, the Republican proposal effectively abolishes the 40-hour \nworkweek. An employer can literally require employees to work up to 80 \nhours in a single week without overtime pay. As long as the 2-week \ntotal does not exceed 80 hours, the workers would not be entitled to \nextra pay. A company can schedule a worker for 60 hours in one week, \nand 20 in the next, all without a penny of overtime pay. That is hardly \na gift to working mothers, forcing them to try to arrange child care to \ncoincide with such an erratic work schedule.\n  Madam President, I will just take a moment or two this morning to \ntalk about the issue of employee choice. I have listened to the \neloquent remarks of our friends and colleagues who are supporting this \nproposal. Talk is pretty cheap around here, and it is important that we \nlook at the legislative language.\n  The bill gives employees, as I mentioned, no right to use the \ncomptime when he or she needs it. Instead, the bill makes it easy for \nemployers to discourage the use of the comptime during the busy periods \non the job. The bill says this, Madam President: ``The employee shall \nbe permitted to use comptime within a reasonable period after making \nthe request if the use of comptime off does not unduly disrupt the \noperations of the employer.''\n  The employer gets to decide what is a ``reasonable period'' and what \n``unduly disrupt'' means. The bill does not define those terms. The \nemployer, not the employee, makes those judgments. In practice, for \nexample, the employee cannot use comptime to go to the school play the \nnext afternoon if the employer decides that the employee has not asked \nfar enough in advance. Another example, if the employee plans to take a \nchild to a dentist appointment during a school vacation, the employer \ncan refuse to let the employee use the comptime for that purpose on the \ngrounds that the absence would unduly disrupt the employer's business.\n  Madam President, the bill also provides no penalty, no enforcement. \nUnless you provide a remedy, you are not giving a right. We have seen \nthat time and time again. The bill provides no penalty at all if the \nemployer violates this reasonable period/unduly disrupt standard--none.\n  If the employer unreasonably denies the employee's request to use the \ncomptime, the employee has no recourse. We will hear how in the \nlegislation there is going to be a balance between the employer and the \nemployee, and the terms will have been agreed upon before the parties. \nBut, in reality, that is not the case. We will get back to that in the \ncourse of the debate.\n  One of the problems in the bill is that it can be an oral agreement. \nThe employer can say, ``Look, we had an agreement, this employee wanted \nto have time off later on. Don't you remember our conversation around \nthe water cooler? You don't remember it? I remember it.'' And the \nemployee has the burden of challenging that representation.\n  Contrast this with the Family and Medical Leave Act. Under that law, \nif the employer denies the worker's request to take family leave, the \nworker can recover damages, including money spent on child care, \ncompensatory damages and the like. The supporters of S. 4 say the \nunduly disrupt standard comes from the Family and Medical Leave Act. \nThat is what they say. ``Senator, you don't really understand, the \nunduly disrupt standard is the same language as the Family and Medical \nLeave Act.''\n  This is not true, Madam President. The FMLA has two types of medical \nleave, unforeseen serious illness and foreseeable medical treatment. \nFor the unforeseen illness, such as hepatitis, pneumonia, or the like, \nthe employee has a right to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid medical \nleave. Any disruption to the employer's operation is irrelevant. The \nemployee makes the judgment.\n\n  For foreseeable medical treatment, such as elective surgery or \nremoval of wisdom teeth, the employee retains the right to take the \nmedical leave, but the employee must make a reasonable effort to \nschedule the treatment at a time that does not unduly disrupt the \nemployer's operation. If the employee's reasonable efforts fail, the \nworker can still take the time for the surgery. The decision is made by \nthe employee under the Family and Medical Leave Act. It has worked and \nworked well. I will come back to that when we have more of a chance to \ndebate this. We will go through family and medical leave act and the \nevaluations of it demonstrating that there have not been abuses. \nHowever, under S. 4 just the opposite is done. The employer makes the \nfinal judgment on when the comptime can be used.\n  The Ashcroft unduly disrupt language differs from the Family and \nMedical Leave Act standard in critical ways. First of all, the Ashcroft \nlanguage gives no right to the employee to take comptime under any \ncircumstances, even for unforeseen illness or other uncontrollable \nevents. The employer can deny a worker's request to use the comptime if \na child's babysitter calls in sick at the last moment, docking the \nemployee's pay even if she has comptime in the bank. This does not help \nthe working families.\n  Second, the Ashcroft language deletes the requirement that workers \nmake only a reasonable effort to schedule time off so it will not \nunduly disrupt an employer's operation.\n  For example, a waitress makes a reasonable effort to schedule her \nchild's immunization for the week after Christmas when the restaurant \nbusiness is slow, but the doctor is on vacation that week. The waitress \nwants to use comptime to get the immunization the week after New \nYear's. The employer says no, citing that it will be unduly disruptive. \nThe worker does not use comptime, and the child does not get immunized. \nThis is not family friendly. This is an outrage.\n  Let's talk about who these hourly workers are. They are the workers \nat the lower rung of the economic ladder.\n\n[[Page S4263]]\n\n Sixty percent of them have only a high school education. Eighty \npercent of them make less than $28,000. A great percentage of them are \nsingle mothers with children who are depending on that overtime. Many \nof them are already having trouble making ends meet. They need every \ndollar they can earn to support their families.\n  The extraordinary comment which a witness from the NFIB made at the \nFebruary 13, 1997 Labor Committee hearing proves that the real goal of \nthe business advocates of this bill is to reduce the pay of these \nvulnerable workers:\n\n       [Small businesses] can't afford to pay their employees \n     overtime. This is something they can offer in exchange that \n     gives them a benefit.\n\n  This statement is so harsh and blunt that even supporters of the bill \nhave been embarrassed by it, and they are attempting to retract it.\n  That says it all, Madam President. When you take away all of the \nrhetoric, that says it all. They do not want to pay hard-working \nAmericans who are at the lower rung of the economic ladder overtime. \nThat is what this bill is about--not giving the employee the \nopportunity to make the choice, but giving it to the employer. The \nemployer has the whip hand under the provisions of S. 4.\n  There is a dramatic difference between the flexible credit hour \nprovisions applicable to Federal employees in title 5, United States \nCode, and in the flexible credit hour provisions of S. 4.\n\n       The credit hours mean any hours within a flexible schedule \n     which are in excess of the employee's basic workweek which \n     the employee elects to work so as to vary the length of the \n     workweek or workday.\n\n  With Federal employees, who makes the judgment? Is it the employee \nand the employer? It is the employee who makes it with regard to the \nFederal employees. But, that is not the case with S. 4's credit hour \nprogram. Under this provision, the final say as to when an employee can \ntake the time off rests with the employer.\n  The heart of the section, page 13, lines 12 through 17, these lines \nprovide: ``An employee shall be compensated for flexible hours at the \nemployee's regular rate.'' That is, an employee that works 45 hours in \na week can take 5 hours of flexible credit time at some point in the \nfuture.\n  This, too, is a pay cut. Current law would require the worker to get \npaid time-and-a-half for those 5 hours. But this bill would compensate \na worker at the straight-time rate for those hours.\n  That is another section we will have an opportunity, Madam President, \nto get into in greater detail.\n  But the idea that this is giving to the working moms the kind of \nflexibility to meet responsibilities is a hoax.\n  What would do it is Senator Murray's amendment to the Family and \nMedical Leave Act to give up to 24 hours of leave per year to be used \nat the employee's discretion. This would allow employees to go to a \nteacher's conference, take their child to the dentist, or go to the \nChristmas play that their children are involved in.\n  But Senator Murray's amendment was defeated on a party-line vote in \nthe committee. ``No way we're going to take that, Senator Murray. No \nway we're going to let them have 24 hours where the employee--the \nemployee--is going to make the decision. No. We're not going to do \nthat. No way.'' We are talking about only 24 hours a year. But the \nRepublicans say no. We are not going to do that. That is not \nacceptable. We will not include that provision in this bill. We are not \ngoing to do that for those workers.\n  The Republicans are not even going to say to the employees of smaller \nbusinesses--those with 25 to 50 employees--that they too are entitled \nto the benefits of family and medical leave. This applies to 13 million \nAmericans not currently covered by FMLA. They must continue to choose \nbetween the needs of their family and the demands of their employer. \nNo, said the majority, we are not going to give the employees that kind \nof right. Senator Dodd's amendment would lower the threshold of the \nFMLA to apply to employers with at least 25 employees. But the \nRepubicans said, ``No.'' Let us really do something today that can make \na difference for these workers as it already has for more than 12 \nmillion Americans, mothers and fathers that have used the leave because \nthey had a sick child.\n  Everyone in this body knows that if you have a parent or a loved one \nthat cares for a child who is ill, that child recovers at about 40 to \n50 percent faster than if the child is just isolated and trying to \nrecover on his or her own. That is one of the principal reasons for \nfamily and medical leave--unpaid family medical leave.\n  But when we tried with Senator Dodd to reduce the eligibility \nthreshold, the Republicans said no way. And they said no to the Murray \namendment for 24 hours to give the employee the opportunity to attend a \nschool event.\n  We have to ask ourselves, Madam President, at the beginning of this \ndebate, whose side are we on? Whose side are we on? Who are we going to \nsay is really protecting the interests and the rights of workers? Is it \nthose people who have stood up time and time again on plant closing \nlegislation to protect workers, minimum wage, family and medical leave? \nOr are we going to believe that business groups and organizations that \nhave opposed every one of those programs for workers are suddenly \nundergoing a conversion and are sincerely interested in employee well-\nbeing?\n\n  Madam President, we will have a chance at a later time to examine in \ndetail the other provisions of this legislation. I would just hope as \nwe celebrate this Mother's Day, we will tell the truth to America's \nworking mothers. S. 4 is a cruel hoax. It will not provide you the time \noff you need when you need it.\n  Finally, I would just ask, Madam President, who are the ones that are \nreally benefiting from the overtime? About 80 percent of those that \nreceive overtime pay are employees that are making less than $28,000 a \nyear, and trying to take care of their families. Most of them want to \nwork overtime so they can earn the extra pay to look after their kids. \nLet us not lose sight of that.\n  Madam President, this is a pay cut bill. This is a pay cut bill.\n  Last year, we had 147,000 decisions made by the NLRB about violations \nof even paying overtime. Over $100 million in back wages awarded by the \nLabor Department to workers in 1996. You can imagine if we pass S. 4, \nwhat do you think they are going to do? You have half the garment shops \nin this country today who are not paying the minimum wage and not \npaying overtime. Industries with records like that cannot be trusted \nwith the kind of power this bill would give them.\n  So, Madam President, I look forward to this debate, because I believe \nwhat we have seen in recent years is a growing disparity between the \nresources of those at the top level versus those struggling Americans \nwho are the heart and soul of the country--the men and women that clean \nthese buildings, clean the companies, are teachers' aides and are \nworking in nursing homes and health assistance. They are barely able to \nmake it with overtime. We cannot in good conscience take that overtime \npay away from them.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I am pleased we have had the opportunity to begin the debate on the \nFamily Friendly Workplace Act. The Senator from Massachusetts has \nreferred to this act as a hoax, and indicated that it would not be in \nthe best interest of workers. Frankly, it is troublesome to me to find \nthat kind of disconnect with what is happening to workers, because I \nhave letters from people who are having a tough time making time for \ntheir families and making time for their jobs. These workers want us to \naddress this important issue. Particularly, mothers--who are in the \nwork force in increasingly high numbers--need to have flexibility so in \norder to meet the needs of their families, financially by being in the \nworkplace, and emotionally by being able to spend time with their \nfamilies.\n  There are a couple--as a matter of fact, there are a whole series of \nthings that the Senator from Massachusetts stated which are \nsubstantially inaccuracies as it relates to the bill.\n  The suggestion, for instance there is no employee choice. This bill \nis predicated upon employee choice. There is\n\n[[Page S4264]]\n\nno ability of any employer to impose anything on any employee contained \nin this bill. The provisions of this bill are available only--only and \nexclusively--when the employee agrees. If the employer so much as \nsuggests that the employee work overtime--the employee would be \nentitled to overtime compensation at one-and-one-half times the \nemployees regular rate of pay. Any time the employer goes to an \nemployee and asks for additional time beyond the 40-hour week it is \nautomatically overtime.\n  The difference in this bill is that the employee would have the \nchance to say, ``You know, I would like to take time-and-a-half \nsometime instead of being paid overtime for this work because I'm \nhaving such a tough time spending enough time with my family.'' That is \nemployee choice.\n  The Senator went through a long and rather arduous explanation about \nhow that was not employee choice. The truth of the matter is, if the \nemployee--at any time after the employee has opted for compensatory \ntime--if the employee decides, ``well, I think I want the money \ninstead, the second level of employee choice arises.'' That is, the \nchoice to change his or her mind.\n  Employees are not just endowed with the choice originally to ask for \ncompensatory time. If an agreement has been reached that compensatory \ntime will be allowed, then a second option comes to the employee, the \noption to say, ``Well, I don't think I really wanted to take the time \noff after all. Give me the money.'' You still have the money. This \nsuggestion that there are no employee choices in this bill is simply \nnot borne out by the bill itself.\n\n  For instance, if the employer asks that the extra time be worked, if \nthere is extra time that comes as a result of a request by the \nemployer, or if the request is initiated by the employer, it is \nautomatically overtime.\n  One interesting case that came up really stunned me. During the \nwinter of 1996, the Washington, DC area had a big, heavy snowstorm. A \nwoman named Arlyce Robinson spoke before the Labor and Human Resources \nand testified that she was called on a Friday morning and told not to \ncome to work due to the heavy snowfall. Therefore, Arlyce, along with \nall of her coworkers missed 1 day of work and suffered a 20-percent \ndecrease in her salary. She and a couple hundred other people at her \nplant wanted to have that money. They needed the money--their fuel \nbills were going up because of the severe winter. They wanted, during \nthe following week, to add 1 hour and 40 minutes a day to their work \nschedule so they could make up for the Friday missed. The current laws \nmake it illegal for the employer to allow them to work that extra hour \nand 40 minutes on each of the days the next week in order to make up \nfor the time lost on Friday.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is correct, these people are the \npoorest of the people that are working by the hour. They are suffering \nfinancial stress. If the employer is willing to let them work \nadditional hours to make that up, what does the law say? The law says \nit is illegal, we cannot allow that to happen. Our bill would allow the \nemployer to let that happen, allow the employer to say you can make up \ntime or you can make up time in advance. You can bank flexible hours in \norder to ameliorate these stresses--these stresses that attend the work \nof the most needy of the workers.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts kept asking the rhetorical question, \nwho are we for? I tell you who we are for; we are for the working \npeople here. Guess who already has flextime? The guys in the boardroom \nalready have flextime. The guys with the paneled offices already have \nflextime. They never have to worry if they need to take time off to \nwatch their son or daughter get an award at the high school.\n  When Arlyce Robinson came to talk to us about this bill, she said she \nneeded to have time off during the day occasionally to attend those \nresponsibilities of her four grandchildren. She said, ``More and more, \nthe extracurricular activities are in the daytime because it is safer \nfor people to go to extracurricular activities in the daytime, safer \nfor the kids if they are scheduled in the day,'' and she wanted to see \none of her grandchildren play in sports or do other things.\n  The guys in the boardroom with the walnut-paneled walls can take the \ntime off. The supervisors paid on salary can take the time off. The \nfolks who work for the Federal Government have flextime already. We \nhave flextime for far more people than those who do not. There are \nabout 79 million people in this country who are eligible for flextime \nwhile the people at the bottom end of the ladder--people who need to be \nable to spend time with their kids--who are trying to make ends meet, \nfamilies where both parents have to be in the work force in order to \nhave enough money to make ends meet. This group who does not have \naccess to flexible work arrangments includes a large number of the most \nstressed people in this culture--the single parents who must spend the \ntime working, they are the ones who desperately need flexible \nschedules.\n  Whose side are we on? I tell you whose side we are on. We are not on \nthe side of the guys who already have it. Sure, we are glad that \nFederal workers have flextime. If you interview the Federal workers, \nthey tell you how well it works. Federal workers interviewed by the \nGeneral Accounting Office--this is not a polling firm going out to get \none result or another. The chairman of the committee, who has been so \ngood in pushing this bill forward, knows the General Accounting Office \nis a governmental agency that just wants to get to the facts and the \ntruth. They interviewed the hourly workers at the Federal Government \nwho have basically the same components of this plan. What do they say? \nMr. President, by a 10-to-1 ratio they say, ``This is great. We like \nthis. We want this.'' That is whose side we are on.\n\n  The Senator from Massachusetts suggests that the 40-hour work week is \nabolished. I do not know how you can read this bill and come to the \nconclusion that the 40-hour week is abolished. Everything in this bill \nis voluntary. Anyone who does not want to agree--and it takes the \nagreement of both the employer and the employee--cannot be forced to \nworking such schedules.\n  The single most popular program for Federal workers, the 2.9 million \nFederal workers in the country that enjoy this provision, is the \nability to take a weekday off every other week so every other Friday or \nevery other Monday is off.\n  That means if they need to take a child to a doctor or schedule \nthings, if they want to go fishing, hunting, or take a day of vacation \nwith their children, it is something they can do. It is something they \ncan do on their own without taking a pay cut.\n  This does not empower employers to demand it. It empowers workers, if \nthey can cooperate with their employers, to get it. No employer can \nmandate any provision in this bill. It is that simple. If the employer \nis not cooperating to give people time off the way they would otherwise \nwant the time off, what is the choice of the worker? The worker can \nimmediately say, ``Give me the money.'' This bill allows the worker to \ncash in any of the banked benefits or compensatory time benefits at any \ntime.\n  In case someone is worried--we do not want anything that would not \nprotect the worker. We have gone to great lengths, we have doubled the \npenalties for abuses under the bill. We have said that at any time the \nemployee wants the money instead of the time, they can automatically \ncall for it. We have said that at the end of the year if the time has \nnot been taken, give them the money. In every respect, any time this is \nnot working, the current law prevails, the money is paid at regular \novertime rates, individuals fall back to the normal 40-hour week. This \nis a voluntary measure.\n  Some strange suggestion was made that because this was not exactly \nlike family and medical leave, it did not have merit. I would like to \nask those who would make that argument, like the Senator from \nMassachusetts, whether he believe that this abolishes family and \nmedical leave? Every benefit that is available to people under family \nand medical leave will continue to be available to them. After this is \nenacted, after this is signed by the President, people will still have \nfamily and medical leave, so that all of the obligations available to \nthem under that setting and in that situation still will be available \nto them. This is simply an additional way for people to accommodate the \nneeds of their families.\n\n[[Page S4265]]\n\n  I do not think we would be getting the kind of letters we are; I do \nnot think we would have Working Women's magazine, Working Mother \nmagazine say, ``Get this done.'' I do not think newspapers like the New \nYork Times, the Chicago Tribune would be endorsing this proposal. I do \nnot think we would have people asking us to do something if family and \nmedical leave were all that people wanted. This bill does not repeal or \nadjust or otherwise diminish family and medical leave. It simply says \nthere are flexibilities that workers need in addition to that.\n  There are differences between this and family and medical leave, and \none of those differences is something that hard working Americans will \nreally appreciate. The biggest single difference between this measure \nand family and medical leave is that family and medical leave has \npeople taking time off without pay. I think most people would rather \ntry to plan their schedules and develop the capacity to make up for \nthings in advance so they did not have to take a pay cut every time \nthey wanted to take some time off. I think that the people of the \nUnited States of America really want to be good moms and dads without \ntaking a pay cut, because in a very strange way, whenever you take the \npay cut, you impair your ability to be the kind of parent you want to \nbe. Most people have both spouses working so they can meet the \nfinancial needs of their families. If meeting the needs of your family \nfor time means you have less capacity to meet the need of your family \nfor finances, it creates undue stress. This is a stress reduction \nmatter. I am surprised that the Senator would indicate that somehow \nthis competes with family and medical leave. This adds to the options \nof American workers.\n\n  Sure, they are different. There are different standards for this \niteration or that iteration. The primary difference is that this does \nnot require you to take a pay cut to take time off. Family and medical \nleave simply requires you to take a pay cut to take time off.\n  It is appropriate we will be getting this bill to the floor. We will \nhave the full range of debate on it. It is important we be engaged on \nthis matter. I think it is important we understand that workers need \nsomething more than what we already have. Workers are feeling this \ntension.\n  I look at today's Washington Times, and it contains an article that \nsaid ``Moms of Today Don't Think They Are Doing As Good As Our Own \nMoms, Poll Says.'' I think we all sense the stresses of modern day \nlife. It recounts a study that says a substantial number of moms today \njust feel that ``We really have a lot of juggling to do and \nunfortunately * * * our children suffer because of what we have to do * \n* * to maintain a living.'' ``We are doing a worse job than our mothers \ndid.'' Well, I think mothers are doing a valiant job, but people are \nfeeling the pressure.\n  The study also found more than half the mothers who worked full time \nwere burdened with time pressures and trying to balance motherhood with \nother aspects of their lives. ``Some of the pressures cited by mothers \ninclude trying to be in three places at once, making sure they get \neverything done without being stressed out and having enough time for \nthemselves.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the article from the \nWashington Times regarding mothers be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Times, May 9, 1997]\n\n Mothers of Today Don't Think They're Doing as Good as Own Moms, Poll \n                                  Says\n\n       Saundra Watson is a successful professional who has raised \n     a well-adjusted 18-year-old son.\n       Still, she is often racked by guilt because she's not there \n     for him when he returns from school to ask how his day was, \n     go over his homework with him and eat dinner with him.\n       ``We really have a lot of juggling to do and unfortunately \n     . . . our children suffer somewhat because of what we have to \n     do . . . to maintain a living,'' said Mrs. Watson, 42, an \n     accounting manager. ``We're doing a worse job than our \n     mothers did.''\n       Mrs. Watson is not alone in thinking that way. According to \n     a study released yesterday, just before Mother's Day weekend, \n     56 percent of the women surveyed think their mothers were \n     better parents than they are.\n       But on a more cheerful note, most mothers said they are \n     mostly or very satisfied with the job they're doing raising \n     their children.\n       The study by the Pew Research Center questioned 1,101 \n     women, 74 percent of them mothers. Of the total sample 42 \n     percent were employed full time, 15 percent part time, 21 \n     percent retired and 22 percent not employed outside the home. \n     The study has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage \n     points.\n       The researchers found that the problems and challenges \n     faced by 1990s moms are related to changes in the lives of \n     women and the evolution of the American family.\n       Mrs. Watson agrees.\n       ``I think that parenting has somewhat taken a back seat to \n     our lives and that should not be,'' said Mrs. Watson. ``A lot \n     of kids are somewhat having to raise themselves.''\n       According to the survey, a large proportion of the women \n     favored more traditional family settings.\n       Only 17 percent said most divorced couples who split \n     custody of their children can do a good job of parenting; and \n     fewer than 30 percent said most single mothers, stepmothers \n     and couples in which both parents work full time can do a \n     good job.\n       The study also found that more than half the mothers who \n     worked full time were burdened with time pressures and trying \n     to balance motherhood with other aspects of their lives \n     compared with 18 percent of mothers who work part time or not \n     at all.\n       Some of the pressures cited by mothers include trying to be \n     in three places at once, making sure they get everything done \n     without being stressed out and having enough time for \n     themselves.\n       But the survey found that disciplining children is a \n     problem all mothers face whether or not they work outside the \n     house.\n       Despite the guilt, the self-recrimination and the worry, \n     Mrs. Watson says, being a mother ``is definitely worth it.''\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. This sensitivity is not just felt in polls. It is felt \nin the lives of real individuals. With this Mother's Day weekend in \nview, I will take you through the life of a mother who came to testify \non this bill. Her job was incredible. People talk about overtime work. \nAs far as I am concerned, there is not a mother in the United States of \nAmerica who does not work overtime. I have observed only two mothers \nvery closely, my own mother, and my wife, who is the mother of our \nthree kids, and working overtime is an understatement. I am sure the \nchairman would agree. It is work all the time. I think it is important \nto provide some flexibility.\n  Let me give a little schedule out of the life of Christine \nKorzendorfer, an executive assistant in a TRW's northern Virginia \noffice, is one of the individuals who came to talk about the need for \nflexible working arrangements. This is Christine's picture here.\n  She gets up at 5:30 in the morning and gets herself together by \nshowering and dressing. About 6:30, she gets up her 2-year-old son, \nRyan, to give him breakfast, yogurt and bananas.\n  Those were the days, I remember them, and I am sure the Senator from \nVermont remembers them. It is one thing to coax a child to eat, but if \nthe child decides he is not going to eat, it can ruin your whole day. \nYou better be well protected or poorly dressed. You are at the child's \nmercy if he decides not to eat.\n  At 6:30 you put the yogurt and bananas together, feed the toddler, \nand you may have to bathe the toddler. I know Christine says she bathes \nthe kid before he goes to bed at night, but sometimes a 2-year-old has \nto be bathed again in the morning. Then the 14-year-old in the \nhousehold wakes up. So then from 7 to 7:15--after getting up at 5:30, a \n6:30 feeding, getting up the 2-year-old and helping the 14-year-old get \nthings together. At 7 or 7:15 in the morning, strap Ryan into the baby \nseat of the van and drive to the day care center. Of course, you have \nto leave your 14-year-old, at that point, with the right instructions \nand asking for the personal discipline on her part to get ready to go \nto junior high. Christine gets to the day care center and has to partly \nundress the kid she just dressed a short time ago. He is anxious about \nleaving his mom. Christine has to start distracting him, showing him \nsomething or another that might capture his attention, quiet him as \nmuch as possible before kissing him goodbye and sneaking out. And \nsometimes the sneak doesn't work. We have all been there, where the \nchild clings. We have all had the scratches on the back of our necks or \non our faces from a child who simply doesn't want to be left. Then, \nfrom 7:15 from 8 a.m. Christine drives to work. At work, she \nimmediately is thrust into the day, sifting through, organizing.\n\n  For Christine, an easy workday is from 8 to 4. She loves her job. Her \ncoworkers really are another family to her. She works hard to keep them\n\n[[Page S4266]]\n\ndoing what they need to do, and she works hard to keep from being \nburned out. She eats lunch on the job, with ordered-in food from a \nfast-food chain. At 3:30, her daughter, Jennifer, the 14-year-old, gets \nhome from school before Christine even leaves work. So she tries to get \na call from her daughter. She would like to be home, but she cannot be, \nso she is sort of making up. The stress is there, but she is at least \nchecking by phone. On the easy day, she drives home between 4 and 5 \no'clock, picks up Ryan, straps him back into the seat. Sometimes--very \noften--she has to work overtime, but when she doesn't, she arrives home \nat 5 o'clock. Everybody wants a snack right off the bat. They are too \nimpatient to wait for dinner. The snacks come first and then the dinner \nbegins. Her husband plays with Ryan in the yard; dinner is at 6. Then \nRyan wants to go back outside and play while mom is cleaning up the \nkitchen. Christine bathes Ryan, maybe, for a second time during the \nday, and everybody tries to go to bed in time to get up again at 5:30 \nin the morning.\n  All the errands are run on the weekends, which really makes it tough \nbecause, in that setting, the time we would normally have for repose, \nrelaxation, and recovery is spent grocery shopping, clothes shopping, \nrunning around. The one thing that interrupts the schedule is when the \njunior high student needs the assistance of a parent with homework, and \nit often means that a couple extra hours are injected.\n  According to Christine, her daughter Jennifer had to have oral \nsurgery a couple of weeks ago. Christine had to take unpaid leave on \nWednesday, Thursday, and Friday afternoon to take care of Jennifer at \nhome. And because Christine has a lot of overtime--we have said that \nher short days are the 8 to 4 days--and she would very much like to \nhave been able to spend comptime or flextime for those 3 days. However, \nsince those options are not available, Christine had to take a 3-day \npay cut for her to be the kind of mother she wants to be. This is one \nvery conscientious woman. I might add that Christine and her husband \nnow are expecting their third child. So this pressure is not likely to \nbe abated. During her testimony before the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee's Employment and Training Subcommittee hearing, Christine \nasked the members to hurry up and pass the legislation so she could \nbank some comptime to use at the end of her current pregnancy. Mr. \nPresident, if we hurry, we might just make it.\n  The point I want to make is that, as we approach this Sunday when we \nhonor mothers who don't work just overtime, they work all the time, we \nhave a responsibility to do what we can to give them at least the \ncategory of flexibility that the majority of workers in our culture \nenjoy. The boardroom enjoys flextime options; the managers enjoy \nflextime--the ones not paid by the hour, and most of them are not--\nGovernment workers enjoy flextime and comptime, and, frankly, it is \ntime for the working mothers of America to enjoy a comptime option.\n\n  Harvard economist Juliet Schor has chronicled the crazy schedules \nthat Americans are put through in a 1992 book called ``The Overworked \nAmerican.'' She found that between 1969 and 1987, men worked an average \nof 98 more hours per year at the end of the period than they did at the \nbeginning of the period. Here is the staggering statistic: during that \nsame period--between 1969 and 1987--the average woman worked 305 more \nhours at the end of the period per year than she did at the beginning \nof the year.\n  Not only are we working more, but the demands that we have for our \nfamilies are not less; they may be more. There are more threatening \ninfluences on our families, I believe, in today's culture than there \nhave been in the past. The need for direct parental involvement is \nsomething I believe the Senator from Massachusetts and I can agree to. \nI think kids do respond to direct parental involvement. He cited the \nfact that children actually recover faster from illness when there is \nmore time with parents. I can agree to that. We need to provide a way \nfor parents to do that, and we should not ask them to take a pay cut in \norder to be able to spend more time with their children, whether it is \nrecovering from an illness or whether it is something else. Again, 305 \nadditional hours, on the average, women at work in 1987 than there was \nin 1969.\n  Working mothers are stressed. Millions of moms wake up at 6, or \nearlier, in the morning to hustle their kids out of bed, make breakfast \nand lunch before sending the kids to the bus or dropping them off at \nday care. After the hectic morning hours, they show up for work ready \nto meet the demands of the day. We enjoy a great standard of living, a \nhigh level of productivity in the United States of America. There are \nlots of reasons for it, but one of the primary reasons we have the \nstandard of living we do is that women work in the marriage. When the \nFair Labor Standards Act went into effect in the 1930's, only one out \nof six mothers of school-aged children was in the work force. But \ntoday, about 75 percent--or 9 out of 12--of the mothers of school-aged \nchildren are in the work force. There is a benefit to the culture in \nthat. We have a high standard of living. As a nation, we are \ncompetitive and productive. To think that somehow we can ignore the \nneeds of the people who are the source of that productivity and \ncompetitive standing is just to have our heads in the stand.\n  After 8 or 9 hours of work, women pick up the kids from some \npractice, or a babysitter, and go home to make dinner, sometimes with \nthe assistance of the family, sometimes not. Often, each person in the \nfamily has a different shift, and that makes the schedule even more \nhectic. But there is a real challenge here. I think it is very \nimportant. The study indicates that, in addition to the 40-plus hours a \nweek a working mom puts in on the job, the average mother adds about 25 \nto 45 additional hours at home. That is not just overtime, that is \nwhere we talk about the fact that women are working all the time.\n  You know the problems that can exist often in the middle of a school \nday: a school nurse calls to announce a child is ill and needs to be \npicked up. Under today's labor law, a mother who takes Friday afternoon \noff to take her flu-stricken son home can't make up that time on the \nfollowing Monday. She must suffer a pay loss for those hours. We want \nto correct that. She can't go to a ``bank'' of pre-work time and say, I \nhave 3 or 4 hours in reserve so that I won't have to have my pay \ndisrupted; I can go and I don't have to choose between my paycheck and \nmy child. No one wants to do that. No one would choose their paycheck. \nWe don't want to put people under that stress. They could just go to an \naccount that they would have for flexible working arrangements or \ncompensatory time, and employers who understand the value of workers \nare eager to cooperate with workers to help them meet the needs of \ntheir families.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts made a number of remarks that, in my \njudgment, suggest that employers aren't eager to help employees resolve \nthese difficulties. I think that may have been the case at some time in \nhistory. But there are many, many employers who are very eager to help \ntheir employees do well with both their families and on the job. As a \nmatter of fact, Working Women magazine features the 100 best companies \neach year, and companies compete for this. They say, ``You should work \nfor us because we have this kind of willingness to work with you, and \nwe should be partners in an enterprise that isn't just a business \nenterprise, but the enterprise of helping you be successful.''\n\n  Well, I believe that our ability to add to the arsenal of things that \ncan help people meet the needs of their families and the workplace is a \ntremendous responsibility, and we should take that responsibility \nseriously and we should address it. To suggest that to have flexible \nworking arrangements means that we can't have or won't have the family \nand medical leave opportunity is simply wrong. To suggest that if these \nnew arrangements aren't identical to family and medical leave, they are \nbad, is to ignore the fact that family and medical leave can meet one \ncategory of demand, and flexible working arrangements can meet another \ncategory of demand. And to ignore the fact that the category of need \nexists for flexible working arrangements is to ignore the thousands of \nworkers that have contacted us, and to ignore the experience of people \nin the public sector and salaried workers and people in\n\n[[Page S4267]]\n\nthe boardroom who have been using flexible work approaches for a long \ntime.\n  I am very grateful to the chairman of the Labor Committee, the \nSenator from Vermont, and to the chairman of the subcommittee, the \nSenator from Ohio, for their excellent work in this respect. I look \nforward to the debate.\n  This is not a pay reduction bill. I kind of get the idea that those \nwho oppose this bill know that it is not, because this is a way for \npeople to take time off without taking the pay cut. I kind of get the \nidea that those who oppose this bill feel like a good offense must be \ntheir best defense because, frankly, to suggest that this is a pay cut \nbill is to misrepresent it in terms of the thing that makes it most \nstrong, and that is this is the ability of people to meet the needs of \ntheir families, without sacrificing their pay in order to do so.\n  It is with that in mind that I look forward to the debate next week \nand to the ultimate passage of this measure by the U.S. Senate. It, \nindeed, would be the very single best Mother's Day gift that this \nGovernment could extend to the people of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from \nMissouri for his eloquent, compassionate statement on behalf of the \nfamilies of America and on behalf of the Mothers of America. I \nappreciate his leadership on this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/09/senate-section/article/S4261-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4267-S4269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         EXPANDED PORTABILITY AND HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE ACT\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, yesterday, I introduced legislation \nthat I believe is desperately needed by millions of uninsured Americans \nwho are employed by small businesses.\n  The problem of the uninsured--both children and adults--is largely a \nproblem of small businesses lacking access to affordable health \ninsurance.\n  When I first came to Congress in 1993 on the House side, health \ninsurance coverage and accessibility was at the forefront of public \ndebate. This year, it seems as if all of the attention is focused upon \nhealth insurance coverage for children--a very important topic indeed.\n  If we can provide access for millions of adults in this country, we \ncan extend access to health care for millions of children. We know that \nthere are more than 40 million uninsured Americans, and that 10 million \nof those 40 million Americans are children. It is these children who \nare the most vulnerable in our society. If we do not provide these \nchildren with quality health care in their early years, we will find \nthe cost of providing health care for them as they grow older to be \never higher. Not providing quality health care for our children \ntranslates into higher health costs for all of us.\n  A closer examination reveals that 80 percent of these individuals--\nthat is the 40 million who are uninsured--live in families with an \nemployed worker who is likely to work for a small employer, or who is \nself-employed. That is, they are drawing a paycheck. And, yet, they \ndon't have health insurance.\n  In fact, only 26 percent of the workers in companies of 10 employees \nor less receive health insurance through their employer, while nearly \nall workers in Fortune 500 companies have health insurance available to \nthem. This, of course, is because many small employers simply cannot \nafford high health premiums and the high administrative costs \nassociated with health insurance today.\n  So, if you work for a small business with 10 employees or less, the \nodds are three to one that you don't have health insurance.\n  If we can solve this problem so that millions of Americans who are \nworking for small businesses can obtain health insurance, we will have \ntaken a huge step toward providing health insurance for all Americans.\n  According to a February General Accounting Office study, while many \nemployers remain committed to providing employee and family coverage, \nthe percentage of people with private coverage is declining in America. \nAt the very time that we want to expand health insurance for millions \nof children in this country, at the very time that we have a goal of \nproviding universal health coverage to all Americans, we are finding \nthat the percentage of people with health coverage is declining. One of \nthe primary reasons for this decline is eroding financial support. Each \nyear between the late 1980's and 1994, increases in employers' cost to \nprovide health insurance to their employees and their employees' \nfamilies outpaced inflation, with cost growth of 18 percent in one \nsingle year.\n  With the surge in health insurance premium costs, many employers have \nreevaluated their commitment to provide health coverage to employees \nand their families. It is understandable. With health care inflation, \nincreasing at as much as 18 percent a year in certain instances, it is \nlittle wonder that employers are reevaluating whether they are going to \nbe able to afford to provide health coverage to their employees and to \ntheir employees' families. Some employers--particularly smaller \nemployers--have dropped their health care coverage altogether. Many \nemployers that have chosen to continue to offer benefits, have been \nforced to raise employees' premiums, creating more out of pocket \nexpenses for their employees--which is essentially a pay cut.\n  The percentage of Americans with private health insurance dropped \nfrom 75 percent in 1989 to 71 percent in 1995. During the same time \nperiod, private health insurance coverage for children under the age of \n18 decreased from 73 percent to 66 percent. If private coverage levels \nhad not decreased, it is estimated that about 5 million more children \nand 5 million more adults would have private health insurance.\n\n  To my colleagues, I say that we are actually losing ground in our \nefforts to provide health insurance for all Americans.\n  Small employers also cannot afford costly State mandated benefit \nrequirements, which studies show can add up to 30 percent of health \ncare costs. According to a December 1996 study by Blue Cross-Blue \nShield, the number of State mandated benefit requirements has soared \nover the past 20 years. For example, the State of Florida had enacted \nonly two insurance related mandates in 1976. In just 20 years, the \nnumber of State insurance mandates in the State of Florida has \nincreased to 36. In my home State of Arkansas, the number has more than \nquintupled over the same 20-year period. State mandates are increasing \nexponentially all over the Nation.\n  It is important to realize that while the number of people with \nprivate insurance has declined, the number of people with Medicaid \ncoverage has increased. Unless the decline in private coverage abates, \ntaxpayers may face increased costs for health care as we see more and \nmore people enroll in the Medicaid system.\n  The Expanded Portability and Health Insurance Coverage Act, which I \nintroduced yesterday, will help alleviate the problem of the uninsured \nby removing barriers that prevent small businesses from providing \nhealth insurance to their employees. Most small businesses want to \nprovide these benefits, but they find that there are innumerable, \ncostly barriers that prevent them from doing so. This legislation will \ngive associations and franchise networks the opportunity to form \nmultistate purchasing groups under a single set of national rules, \nthrough the Employment Retirement Income Security Act, ERISA. The EPHIC \nbill will make health insurance more affordable for small employers in \nseveral important ways.\n  First, it will lower administrative costs. Second, it will provide \ngreater bargaining power to smaller employers to negotiate better \nagreements with health plans and providers. Finally, it will eliminate \nthe need for small businesses to comply with costly State-mandated \nbenefit requirements which, as I mentioned, studies indicate amount to \n30 percent in additional cost.\n  To put this in this perspective, just last week, a constituent came \ninto my office and told me the following story. He is an employer with \nabout 150 employees in Little Rock, AR. He shopped\n\n[[Page S4268]]\n\naround for health insurance for his employees, and generously agreed to \npay 90 percent of their health insurance premiums. Just last year, he \nwas faced with a 25-percent increase in his health care costs--a 25-\npercent increase. Now, his only choices are to drastically decrease the \namount of benefits provided to his employees, or raise the premiums for \nhis employees and the portion they pay, or, as so many small businesses \nare doing today, drop coverage altogether.\n  The EPHIC bill will help millions of employers who, like my \nconstituent in Little Rock, AR, really want to provide health benefits \nto their employees.\n  While expanding insurance coverage to American workers and their \nfamilies, the EPHIC bill also contains important consumer safeguards \nthat would apply to multigroup plans that self-insure. They include \nmandatory stop-loss insurance, reserve requirements, solvency \nindemnification standards, and strict fiduciary responsibilities, and \nnondiscrimination requirements.\n  The EPHIC bill is supported by a broad coalition of over 100 \norganizations, and has bipartisan support in both the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate. There are over 100 cosponsors of this \nbill in the House of Representatives.\n  I am very pleased that Senator Lott, Senator Hollings, Senator \nBrownback, Senator Roberts, and Senator Landrieu have joined as \noriginal cosponsors of this very, very important legislation.\n  I urge the rest of my colleagues to join in support of this \nlegislation as well.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, last Congress we were able to enact some \nimportant reforms to greatly improve access to health care for millions \nof Americans. The Kennedy-Kassenbaum Health Insurance Portability and \nAccountability Act improved the insurance marketplace so workers with \npreexisting medical conditions or who were at risk of losing health \ninsurance when they changed jobs are more likely to have coverage.\n  We were successful because we applied certain principles learned in \nthe experience with President Clinton's Health Care Security Act. In \nthe Senate, we worked in a bipartisan manner to fix a targeted number \nof our Nation's problems in a way that does not completely overhaul our \ncurrent health care system. Because we did not fix the whole system, \nthere is still work to be done. Today, Senator Hutchinson and I are \nproposing the next step in an incremental approach. We hope that the \nSenate can continue to work in a bipartisan way to achieve additional \nreforms to improve our citizens' access to what many say is the finest \nhealth care system in the world--if you have a ticket to get in.\n  The Expanded Portability and Health Insurance Coverage Act that we \nintroduced yesterday focuses on improving the health insurance market \nplace so that workers in small businesses and their families can enjoy \nthe health benefits and freedom from fear of a catastrophic illness as \nemployees of large businesses.\n  Many of us are greatly concerned about the 40 million or so Americans \nwho currently have no health insurance, 10 million of them children. \nLooking closely at the problem, you see that over 80 percent of those \nuninsured live in a family with an employed worker who is likely to \nwork for a small employer or be self-employed. Only 26 percent of \nworkers in companies of 10 or less employees get health insurance \nthrough their employer, while virtually all workers in Fortune 500 \ncompanies do so. This leads to the inevitable conclusion that, in order \nto get a handle on the problem of the uninsured, we have to address the \nhealth insurance marketplace for small employers.\n  A recent study by the National Federation of Independent Businesses, \nentitled ``Small Business Problems and Priorities,'' ranked the cost of \nhealth insurance as the No. 1 problem that small businesses face today. \nThe great majority of small business owners want to provide coverage \nfor their workers and families but they do not have affordable coverage \noptions currently available to them.\n  Our bill seeks to address this problem by allowing small businesses \nto form multi-state purchasing groups under a single set of national \nrules. This is done through the Employee Retirement Income Security \nAct. Such a change in law will make health insurance more affordable \nfor small businesses in several important ways:\n  First, it will lower the administrative costs of health care coverage \nfor small employers,\n  Second, it will give greater bargaining power to small employers so \nthey can negotiate better deals with the health plans and providers, \nand\n  Third, it will eliminate the need for small businesses to have to \ncomply with some costly benefits mandated in some States.\n  Administrative costs account for nearly 30 percent of health \ninsurance premiums, so lowering administrative costs will result in \ndecreased premiums. A study by the Congressional Research Service and \nthe Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives shows that \nthe administrative costs of insurance for small employers are up to 30 \npercent higher than for large employers due to the fact that it costs \ninsurers and health plans more to market to these small groups. The \nper-person cost of processing claims and the general management of \nbenefits is also much higher. Costs are dramatically lower for larger \ngroups. Allowing small employers to form large groups will result in \nlower administrative costs.\n  The bill, in permitting the formation of multi-state purchasing \ngroups under ERISA, will give small employers much greater purchasing \npower than they have under current law. It will be far easier and safer \nfor the small businesses to self-insure through a purchasing group. \nEnabling small employers to do this will give the groups the \nopportunity to get better value for each health care dollar spent. They \nwill be able to act like large employers and directly contract with \nhealth plans and providers. In negotiating with health plans and \nproviders like larger companies, they will be able to actively \nnegotiate lower prices in exchange for a large group of users. This \nwill make health insurance more affordable.\n  That mandated benefits significantly add to the cost of providing \nhealth insurance was documented in an August 1996 GAO Report, ``Health \nInsurance Regulation, Varying State Requirements Affect the Cost of \nInsurance.'' Also, a study by the NFIB Education Foundation shows that \nState-mandated benefits can add up to 30 percent to the cost of health \ninsurance premiums. Essentially the bill levels the playing field so \nthat small employers can operate health plans under the same set of \nrules as large employers. Allowing small businesses to operate under a \nsingle set of national rules will eliminate the need for such groups to \nhave to comply with each State's list of rules regarding benefit \npackages, claims and solvency. Instead, the groups will need to follow \none set of rules under the ERISA. The rules are changed so that \nconsumer protections and safeguards will apply to these multi-state \npurchasing groups. For example, only a legitimate association that is \ncertified by the U.S. Department of Labor could become a purchasing \ngroup. They are subject to strict standards concerning sponsor \neligibility, nondiscrimination, fiduciary, solvency, reporting, \ndisclosure and plan termination standards. States would be permitted to \nenforce these Federal standards.\n  While it is difficult to predict exactly how much coverage will \nincrease through this legislation, at a hearing held by the House \nEducation and Workforce Committee last year, the National Business \nCoalition on Health and the National Association of Manufacturers \npredicted about 20 million uninsured adults and children could be \ncovered as a result of this legislation. The Employee Benefit Research \nInstitute estimates that 55 percent of uninsured children have a parent \nwho works full time for the entire year. So a great majority of the \nuninsured children are likely to benefit from this bill as well. And, \nthe beauty of this legislation is that it enables millions of currently \nuninsured people to have health care through the private sector, so no \nnew entitlements involving huge costs to the Government are involved.\n  The Expanded Portability and Health Insurance Coverage Act gives us \nan opportunity to enact essential reform to strengthen our current \nhealth care system. It is an important step forward in\n\n[[Page S4269]]\n\nthe effort to find solutions to our Nation's health care problems and I \nencourage my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard).

Mr. President, in Vermont, you have to wait until May to \nsee signs of life, signs of spring. But this May has been unseasonably \ncold, and got a little colder earlier this week when Vermont lost Jack \nBarry--one of the true, enduring treasures of the most special State in \nthe Union.\n  Jack Barry left us on Sunday, May 4, at the age of 70, after a long \nstruggle with cancer. He was in his third year as a senator, he was my \nfirst press secretary when I came to Washington as a 34-year-old \nSenator. But most of all he was an extraordinary and beloved \nbroadcaster on radio and television whose ubiquitous presence on the \nVermont airwaves has made thousands of Vermonters feel as though Jack \nBarry has been a member of the family.\n  In fact, he really was a member of thousands of Vermont families, and \nmore welcome in their homes than just about anybody else.\n  Jack achieved legendary status among Vermont broadcasters. As an \ninterviewer, he had an unparalleled ability to get to the essence of a \nperson and an issue.\n  Jack's life in radio and television makes any review of his \nachievements read like a broadcasting directory. As you might expect, \nJack had an on-air personality and voice to die for, and he was the \nsame off the air, as fresh and genuine as the Green Mountains that he \nloved.\n  He hosted call-in shows where civility and common sense were the \nstandard, he moderated and produced several public affairs programs \nwhere he was the most prepared person there. And he was a popular \nmaster of ceremonies for a wide range of nonprofit and public interest \ncauses. He was Vermont's Sportscaster of the Year in 1972 and the \nVermont Association of Broadcasters gave him the Distinguished \nBroadcasting Award in 1981 and, to make sure that everyone knew, they \ninstalled him into their Hall of Fame in 1995. He was the Rutland \nHerald's Vermonter of the Year in 1991. He lent his considerable \ntalents to many community organizations including St. Michael's \nCollege--his alma mater, and mine--the Vermont Special Olympics, United \nWay, and the Vermont Cancer Society. He was past chairman of the \nVermont Heart Association and was serving on the national board of the \nAmerican Heart Association. For the last 3 years he served in the \nVermont Senate, where, as Senate President pro tempore Peter Shumlin \nputs it, Jack ``was like a kid in a candy shop.''\n  He loved people. He truly loved people--all people--just as he truly \nloved politics. And he did not shrink from controversy to act on his \nconvictions. He embraced controversy, if need be, because he never gave \nup his convictions, as when he forcefully argued against the popular \nrush to criminalize the rare instances of flag burning. And our State \nagreed with him.\n  I want to put into the Record at the end of my remarks a selection of \nthe many news accounts, columns, and editorials this week that recite \nso many more of his achievements. But first I want to recount some of \nthe personal recollections about Jack from his friends and colleagues \nthat have come my way since Sunday.\n  George Goldring, who works at WVMT, recalls the days when he and Jack \nbroadcasted University of Vermont football--Jack, for WVMT, and George, \nfor WJOY.\n  He fondly remembers one night after a game in Pennsylvania, when they \nwere sitting around a hotel room with a couple of other Vermont \nbroadcasters. Nobody went to bed. The night dissolved into morning as \nJack regaled them with story after story and joke after joke, keeping \neveryone in stitches all night long.\n  Mr. President, having been one of those fortunate enough to have sat \nin on one of these evenings--you do not want the night to end. It is \nthe best of Irish storytelling.\n  George says that Jack was a professional's professional in front of a \nmicrophone. He was never at a loss for words.\n  John Goodrow of my staff and Jack both worked at WJOY in Burlington \nin different eras. Last November, the station threw a party to mark its \n50th anniversary, and through the evening all the former on-air \npersonalities were introduced. But when Jack Barry was introduced, the \napplause was the loudest and the longest, the most fervent, the most \nheartfelt.\n  John's father, Goody Goodrow, recalls getting to know Jack while \nGoody was a student at St. Michael's College after serving in the Navy \nin the Second World War. He was one of the many St. Mike's students who \nwould phone in music requests to Jack's radio show. Goody himself was a \nmusician who once played piano in Artie Shaw's military band, and he \nmade a living in the Burlington area as a musician--in fact, as a young \nstudent, I danced some of those times he played--including stints, \nafter those years at St. Mike's, playing the piano on Jack's radio \nshows on WJOY.\n  Joel Najman engineered Jack's show at WJOY for years, and he now \nworks at WDEV. He tells about Jack's natural curiosity about the world. \nHe was a sponge for information and ideas. Joel said he had time to \nread just one newspaper before Jack's morning show, but before airtime, \nJack already had read four or five newspapers, and from personal \nexperience I know he committed them virtually to memory.\n  Ken Horseman was an executive producer at Vermont ETV--public \ntelevision in Vermont--and also produced Jack's radio show for a time. \nAnd Ken's fondest memories of Jack center on the old Vermont ETV \nauction which Ken produced and Jack hosted. Jack would hold forth \nthrough 10 hours of live television, and he would do this for 10 \nstraight days. He would prime the pump for the station's coffers, and \npeople all over the State and in nearby Canada and everywhere else \nwould tune in to see Jack Barry.\n  Jerry Lewis has nothing on Jack Barry as a telethon maestro. More \nthan 3,000 Vermonters volunteered during the auction over those 10 \ndays. To them and to the viewing audience, Jack was the auction's \nsymbol. I was fortunate enough to have had a chance to be on some of \nthose auctions as a volunteer, as was, I think, the whole Vermont \ncongressional delegation at one time or another, because Jack would \njust grab everybody. You could be the person who runs the gas station; \nyou could be the Governor of the State. Jack Barry would say: ``Now \nhere is the time you are going to auction,'' and you would.\n  He thrived on the unpredictability of live television. He was steady \nin the midst of chaos, as Ken remembers.\n  Mike Donoghue of the Burlington Free Press grew up in Vermont \nlistening to Jack on the radio. Like all of us, he remembers his \nsignature line at the end of every radio spot: ``Don't forget to tell \n'em Barry brought ya.'' Of course, that is exactly what people did.\n  Jack brought us the warmth of his smile. He nourished our sense of \ncommunity and purpose in Vermont. And he brought us the gift of his \nfriendship.\n  Last September, Marcelle and I attended Jack's surprise 70th birthday \nparty at his son-in-law's camp in Jonesville, VT.\n  Mr. President, if there is any way that I would remember Jack, it was \nat this party. It was vintage. He was surrounded by the family he \nadored and who adored him even more. Politicians and political junkies \nwere everywhere, from both parties, and, of course, Jack was at center \nstage holding forth and carrying the day. I took photograph after \nphotograph, although in one way I did not need to because the memories \nare as clear as the photographs are. Everybody came in, and it would be \nlike they were the one person there with Jack. He would hug them and \nthey would hug him. And the children were around. It was chaotic and it \nwas fun. It was very, very, very Irish. It is that sunny day in \nJonesville that sticks most in my mind when I think of Jack.\n\n[[Page S4270]]\n\n  But I also think of Monday of this week when Marcelle and I went to \nJack's home and visited with his wife, Bunny, a dear friend, the woman \nhe loved so much, and with other family members, and the stories about \nJack's humor and generosity and humanity rose easily and quickly to the \nsurface as they always have when talking about Jack. One minute \nMarcelle and I were crying; the next minute we were laughing with \neverybody else there. Kathy, Maureen, and Bridget were there, Bunny's \ndaughter Brigid and others, Tim and Wright, and we talked with Bridget \nand Kathy and Maureen about the time when Jack Barry was first down \nhere as press secretary, and Marcelle was taking the kids on a ride in \nthe car coming back from somewhere and two cars stopped in front of \nus--and I mean this is 20 years ago, Mr. President. Some of the people \nwere getting out of the two cars in front of Marcelle, and they were \ngetting into a fight and Marcelle was telling the children, ``Get down! \nGet down!'' And they were saying, ``We want to see! We want to see!'' \nAnd it was typical of what any one of Jack's kids would want: ``But I \nwant to see what's going on!''\n  I think of all the times I would call him for advice, in good times \nand in some very sad times. Jack was always there. We might not have \ntalked to each other for weeks and we would pick up the conversation as \nthough it ended minutes before. I remember calling him and asking him \nfor a joke because I was going to be speaking somewhere, and to start \noff he would say, ``Well, there were these two Irish guys,'' and we \nwould both be laughing, and I hadn't even heard the joke. We would \nstart laughing right away because we knew how funny it would be.\n  I recall a Christmas when Marcelle was on duty at the hospital and I \nwas calling friends, and I called up Jack, after he had taken up his \nnew duties in the Vermont Statehouse, and I said, ``Hi, Senator.'' He \nsaid, ``Hi, Senator.'' And we were going on calling each other Senator \nfor a couple minutes until we were both laughing so hard we sort of \nlost it.\n  We go back a long time, Mr. President. His father and mother and my \nfather and mother were friends. Jack and I knew each other forever it \nseems. I think of the days when he was down here, when we first moved \ndown a few days before the swearing-in. It was New Year's Eve. We had \nrented a townhouse. And the moving van came that day. We were unloading \nboxes, and Jack shows up, and a couple other Vermonters were here with \nme, and we decided we would have a New Year's Eve party. We invited the \ntwo moving van people. We sat around on crates and boxes and opened \nthem up trying to find a plate, a glass or silverware, ordering in \npizza and soda and beer and what not. Jack put us all at ease. He \nstarted telling stories. Midnight came and midnight went, and that \nparty went on and on.\n  How much I wish it could still go on today. I think of people that \nJack helped during his years here in Washington, people who were cursed \nwith the affliction that some have of drinking, and Jack would work \nwith AA. He would be the person they would call when they really needed \nhelp and he would go. And after that time I heard from so many Members \nof Congress and others who would come to me and tell me, ``Jack Barry \nreally saved my life.''\n  I remember him interviewing Cabinet Members down here for Vermont ETV \nand them telling me afterward that he was the most prepared interviewer \nthey ever had.\n  So I have lost a dear, dear friend. Marcelle and I have spent a lot \nof time talking this week about how much he meant to us. We also know \nthat Vermont has lost one of its real treasures. So Marcelle and I join \nall Vermonters in extending wishes of comfort and appreciation to Bunny \nand to all the family. I will put, as I said, items in the Record, but \none especially from Bridget Barry Caswell--his daughter who we know and \nlove and are so proud of, a great journalist in her own right and one \nwho learned so much from her father--the eulogy she gave this week in \nhis memory at St. Michael's College.\n  I will say this to the family, as my Great-Aunt Kate, who came here \nfrom Ireland, would say of a good Irish person when they would leave \nthis vale of tears: ``He went straight up.'' Jack Barry went straight \nup, and I cannot help but think of the Irish jokes that are going \nthrough the heavens tonight.\n  Mr. President, in yielding the floor, I ask unanimous consent that \nthese other items be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              For You, Dad\n\n                       (By Bridget Barry Caswell)\n\n       To borrow one of my father's favorite words . . . he would \n     be just tickled to see all of you here today, to celebrate \n     his life and his final passage into peace. He'd probably look \n     around and say, ``Fantastic! I didn't know I had so many \n     friends.'' But he certainly did . . . and then some.\n       My Dad was truly one of a kind, as you know. He was \n     enthusiastic, he was warm . . . he was a true humanitarian \n     and he was the most optimistic person I know.\n       I am so proud to be a part of my Dad. We are all so proud \n     to say we are of him . . . we are a product of Jack Barry.\n       He was a passionate man. He was passionate about public \n     service and his career . . . a news junkie to the bone. And \n     he was passionate about learning and his family.\n       My father's life was dedicated to public service . . . he \n     was absolutely loyal to everything he cared about and fought \n     for. We will probably never know all of the people he \n     influenced or aided in one way or another . . . either \n     through his thousands of programs on issues affecting \n     everyday Vermonters . . . or the endless speaking engagements \n     he said yes to year after year. He couldn't say no and he was \n     able to use his public persona in so many good ways. And he \n     didn't do it for his own gratification . . . that didn't \n     matter to him . . . for he said yes whether it was a request \n     for a 500-person gala or a request to play auctioneer at an \n     elementary school fundraiser. I can remember as a child, my \n     father was always out . . . lending his name to one cause or \n     another. I don't think I realized at the time all of the good \n     he was doing. I'd like to share with you one example of my \n     father's dedication and loyalty to an organization. Shortly \n     after I was born--30 something years ago--I was diagnosed \n     with a serious heart defect. It was eventually repaired \n     through surgery, but that event in my father's life marked \n     the beginning of a lifetime of service to the Vermont Heart \n     Association . . . my family dove into volunteer work \n     immediately and my father's never ended. He served on the \n     board as member and eventually chairman. He spoke at endless \n     Heart Association events, and at the time of his death was \n     serving on the national board of the American Heart \n     Association. He considered that a great honor . . . and his \n     work finally came full circle when he became the beneficiary \n     of Heart Association research.\n       My Dad was also passionate about learning . . . he was a \n     life-long learner, always on a quest to improve his mind. And \n     it showed. He was a voracious reader. He read seven \n     newspapers every day . . . and devoured every news magazine \n     possible. On top of that, he always, and I mean always, had a \n     novel or two going. He would go on vacation to Florida for \n     two weeks and finish off a half-dozen books . . . and I mean \n     books like this. He loved to share them too . . . a few of \n     you probably still have a few of his out there!! I know I do! \n     But it didn't stop there. Whenever my nieces and nephew, who \n     live out of state, would come to visit, they always had their \n     own special time with my father, their grandfather. He would \n     take them out . . . not to a movie or a fun park. He took \n     them to the Oasis for breakfast and then they went \n     shopping . . . for books. Every time they visited, that \n     was their ``tradition'' with my Dad. He instilled in them \n     a love of reading and to this day, it is an area in school \n     where they all excel. He was very proud of that.\n       And finally, as I said earlier, my father was passionate \n     about his family. You probably got a little tired of hearing \n     about us all the time . . . he talked about us incessantly on \n     the air. His listeners knew of every milestone in our lives. \n     But that made us feel special. And he made us feel special in \n     the little things he did . . . a personal note on our ``big'' \n     birthdays . . . the Sweet 16th, the 21st, the quarter-of-a-\n     century, and the 30th. And as some of you may have read, at \n     our family dinners--which meant anywhere from 10 to 22 people \n     at the table --my father led us with a toast before each \n     meal, and to him that meant a time to note our \n     accomplishments, large and small. He didn't forget anyone . . \n     . and he welcomed each and every one of us to share in the \n     meal, usually gourmet and always cooked and served to \n     perfection.\n       My father loved to cook . . . as my aunt said the other \n     day, if you needed a good recipe, you called Jack. If you \n     needed a good joke, you called Jack. And if you needed a good \n     book, you called Jack.\n       But he wasn't alone in his love for a good book, a good \n     joke or a good recipe. My Dad and Bunny were a team . . . \n     true soulmates and best friends . . . and they wore their \n     love on their sleeves. My Dad was passionate about Bunny . . \n     . on the air he often referred to her as ``that beautiful \n     thing I'm married to.'' And at home . . . it usually went \n     something like this, ``Hey Bare. You can carve the meat now'' \n     and he'd say, ``Anything you say, Baby.'' Even to the end, \n     they exchanged love names. Bunny will probably never forgive \n     me for telling you this, but even during the last difficult \n     days of my father's life, when he continued to fight so \n     valiantly, she would walk into his hospital room--after\n\n[[Page S4271]]\n\n     catching maybe an hour or two of sleep--and she'd say \n     ``Jackie-Poo, I'm here.'' She made all of us smile during \n     those dark days last week and my sisters and I will be \n     forever grateful for the love and care she gave to my Dad \n     during his illness.\n       Boy we loved him . . . he was truly an exceptional human \n     being. In just a moment we'd like to invite you to sing with \n     us one of my father's favorite songs, ``When Irish Eyes Are \n     Smiling.'' My Dad always had a smile in his eyes . . . and we \n     all know that he was certainly a proud Irishman.\n       In closing, I'd like to share with you a poem that was sent \n     to my father in February by his old buddy, John Zampieri. The \n     two of them were battling their own health problems and they \n     often exchanged notes sending words of encouragement. Just \n     two weeks ago, I sent out for my Dad his last note to \n     ``Zamp,'' as he called him. It was a photo on election night \n     . . . and they looked fabulous. Anyway, just yesterday, we \n     found this poem that John sent to my father a few months ago. \n     It was the first we'd seen of it . . . and we found it most \n     appropriate in light of my Dad's incredible optimism, his \n     courage and his pledge to never give up his fight. It's \n     called ``Don't Quit.''\n\n\n                               Don't Quit\n\n     When things go wrong, as they sometimes will\n     And the road you're trudging seems all uphill\n     When the funds are low and the debts are high\n     And you want to smile but you have to sigh\n     When care is pressing you down a bit--\n     Rest if you must but don't you quit\n\n     Life is queer with its twists and turns,\n     As every one of us sometimes learns\n     And many a fellow has turned about\n     When he might have won if he'd stuck it out\n     And he learned too late when the night came down\n     How close he was to the golden crown\n\n     Success is failure turned inside out,\n     The silver tint of the clouds of doubt\n     And you never can tell how close you are\n     You may be near when it seems so far\n     So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit\n     It's when things seem worst that you mustn't quit\n\n       That's All Folks . . . ``Don't forget to remind 'em that \n     Barry brought you.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                            Barry Brought Me\n\n                           (By Peter Freyne)\n\n [From the Column ``Inside Track'' Seven Days, Burlington, VT, May 7, \n                                 1997]\n\n       They're burying Jack Barry today. It'll be a good turnout. \n     Jack always loved a crowd. Just given him a microphone and \n     turn him loose, and the kid from Waterbury Center, Vermont, \n     would crank up those marvelous Irish pipes with the lilt and \n     the blarney and the gift of the gab.\n       As far as the airwaves go, this was Jack Barry's town. He \n     loved it and he lived it--oh did he live it! From the days of \n     ``It's Your Nickel'' to ``Open Mike'' to ``The Jack Barry \n     Show,'' to ``Vermont Report'' and ``Vermont This Week'' on \n     Vermont ETV, Jack was the man who could turn your average \n     story into a marvelous tale. Before talk radio became king in \n     the 1980s, he was already sitting in the throne. ``Be sure \n     and tell'em Barry brought you,'' was his trademark refrain.\n       Jack wasn't one of those wishy-washy types who'd try to \n     please everyone. He had values and principles and opinions, \n     and he laid it on the line. He also had a fiery passion for \n     politics. For decades on the local airwaves he defended a \n     women's right to choose, and boldly called for an end to the \n     war in Vietnam, the war in Vietnam, the war that he \n     personally checked out in a 1968 visit. Once he saw firsthand \n     what a ``bright shining lie'' that war was, Jack wasn't \n     afraid to change his position.\n       Jack was the best sort of friend a guy could have, the kind \n     who was there for you not just when you were on top of the \n     world, but when the world had beaten you down. I know. When I \n     hit bottom, Jack Barry was there for me.\n       He loved the ponies--oh, did he love the ponies--and he \n     loved Saratoga in August. And, coincidentally, there was a \n     horse in the Kentucky Derby the day before he passed away, by \n     the name of Jack Flash. But most of all he loved his Bunny, \n     the Murphy girl he married and laughed with through the best \n     years of his life.\n       Well, Jack Barry's crossed the finish line now--in a flash. \n     No need to wait for the stewards to develop the photo. It \n     wasn't even close. Jack Barry won . . . going away.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                 [From the Rutland Herald, May 6, 1997]\n\n                   Jack Barry, A Man Of The Airwaves\n\n                         (By Christopher Graff)\n\n       Montpelier--Jack Barry was radio's biggest cheerleader.\n       Sure, he loved public television. And he was passionate \n     about politics. But radio was his true love.\n       ``Radio was everything,'' Barry once said, reminiscing \n     about the glory days before the dawn of television. ``Radio \n     was drama. Radio was sports. Radio was a window on the \n     world.''\n       ``Radio, pre-television, was everything,'' he said. ``And \n     it was a central part of everyone's lives.''\n       And Jack Barry, for many decades, was a central part of \n     Vermonters' lives.\n       Barry died Sunday at the age of 70. He was in his third \n     year as a state senator, a position that allowed him a seat \n     at center stage of the political world he loved. But it was \n     as a radio and television host that Barry became a household \n     name.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       ``I just always had this radio bug,'' he later said.\n       In 1948 he went to WJOY in Burlington, then owned by The \n     Burlington Free Press, where he helped air the 11 p.m. news \n     live from the Free Press newsroom and then stayed to play \n     poker with the editors while the paper ran off the presses.\n       In 1954 he and his pal Vin D'Acuti provided competition for \n     WJOY by launching WDOT. They did it all themselves, working \n     18-hour days. Barry raced around to fires and car accidents \n     and plane crashes in a Ford station wagon. He could--and \n     did--broadcast live anywhere, anytime.\n       He entered the world of talk shows, the forum in which he \n     would excel, becoming the daily visitor into the homes of \n     Vermonters.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Barry later entered television. There was a time he did a \n     morning show on WVMT radio in Colchester 6 a.m. to 9 a.m., \n     then a television show on WVNY-TV from 10 to 11 and then back \n     to WVMT for his ``Open Mike'' show from noon to 2 p.m.\n       In the evenings he was off to do play-by-play sports \n     broadcasts--baseball, basketball, football, hockey or boxing.\n       He started volunteering at Vermont ETV in 1970 and went on \n     the payroll in 1973. He took a brief time out for his first \n     round in politics, serving two years as press secretary for \n     Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.\n       He was back in 1976, juggling his morning radio shows and \n     his evening television appearances right up to his retirement \n     from Vermont ETV in 1991. The radio continued for a bit until \n     elective politics beckoned and he became a state senator.\n       Last year his life's passions came together briefly when \n     the Senate considered a proposal to cut ETV's state funding \n     from $762,500 to $1.\n       Barry, although ill, traveled to the State House to make an \n     impassioned plea for ETV. He talked about his experiences, \n     his interviews, the reaction from viewers. ``There are \n     moments at ETV that transcend anything I can recall,'' he \n     told his colleagues, who restored half of the money.\n       One of his greatest pleasures in a wide world of \n     broadcasting was when he found himself on the other side of \n     the microphone.\n       Vermont ETV, on Barry's final day on the job, set up a \n     surprise interview of Barry by his daughter, Bridget Barry \n     Caswell, herself a television reporter.\n       ``I am very proud you have come into this field,'' Barry \n     told his daughter on the air. ``It's a honorable profession \n     and a very good one. Without the Fourth Estate, we'd all be \n     in big trouble.\n       ``I hope your career is long and pleasant and you get to \n     achieve the things that give you as much satisfaction as my \n     career has given to me.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n           [From the Burlington (VT) Free Press, May 6, 1997]\n\n                              A Man Of Joy\n\n       Jack Barry found what many Vermonters spend a lifetime \n     seeking; a family he treasured, public service work he loved, \n     and an optimism that sustained him to the end.\n       Barry, who died Sunday of liver cancer at 70, will be \n     missed.\n       Sen. Jack Barry, D-Chittenden, was a decent man. For \n     decades, his loyalty was to his many listeners on \n     Burlington's radio stations and Vermont ETV. In the end, it \n     was the residents of Chittenden County who came first.\n       As a radio and television interviewer, Barry quizzed \n     politicians, journalists and entertainers alike.

An overwhelming 72 percent of the respondents favored this \nproposal, which is contained in the legislation that Senator Hatch and \nI have introduced last month.\n  The detailed breakdown of the responses shows that the plan has broad \nsupport among people of all ages, incomes, ethnicities, educational \nbackgrounds, party affiliations, and geographical regions.

Mr. President, this coming Sunday, May 11, is Mother's Day. \nIt used to be that Members of the House and Senate would call attention \nto special days, days of special significance such as Mother's Day, \nFather's Day, Memorial Day, Columbus Day, Independence Day, and so on. \nI do not hear much of that being done anymore, but I like to stay with \ntradition. I believe that is the tried and true way. The Bible says, \n``Remove not the ancient landmark which thy fathers have set.''\n  Mother's Day came about through the efforts of a dedicated mother and \ndaughter from Grafton, WV. Since 1914, the United States has set aside \nthe second Sunday in May to honor mothers. Anna Maria Reeves Jarvis, a \nremarkable woman who championed the cause of sanitation and family \nhealth throughout her entire life and whose establishment of Mother's \nDay Work Clubs kept bound the fragile ties of families and communities \nthroughout the Civil War, was a heroine to her daughter, Anna M. \nJarvis. Due to Anna M. Jarvis' efforts, she also serves as the source \nof a beautiful sentiment for all of us today. In honoring her mother's \nhope that a post-Civil War ``Mothers' Friendship Day'' might someday \nbecome an annual event commemorating the service that mothers render to \nhumanity in every field, Anna M. Jarvis has provided each of us with an \nopportunity to remember and to delight in the love and support which \nour own mothers have offered to us.\n  My own dear angel mother died when I was little less than a year old. \nShe was a victim of the virulent Spanish influenza pandemic that swept \nthe globe and swept the Nation in 1918, killing an estimated 20 million \npeople around the world; 500,000 in this country alone. Her name was \nAda Kirby Sale. In the one photograph which I have of her, gazing back \nat me is a blue-eyed, fair-complexioned, pretty young woman with a \nserious, yet sweet, expression on her face and a large bow of ribbon in \nher hair. How I wish that I had known her, even for one day! Even in \nher own distress, she thought of me, her youngest child, when she asked \nher sister-in-law and brother-in-law to raise me if she, my mother, did \nnot recover from the flu. In those days they were stricken on one day \nand died the next. So, she asked my aunt and her husband to raise me if \nshe, my mother, did not recover, while my father looked after my four \nolder siblings. I had three brothers and one sister, and my father had \n10 sisters and two brothers, so my father gave to various sisters my \nthree brothers, and to Titus Dalton Byrd and my aunt, I was given. And \nmy father kept my sister. I have always carried with me that \nremembrance of my mother's love for me, because she gave me two foster \nparents for the hard work of raising a child.\n  I, therefore, was reared by my Aunt Vlurma and her husband, Titus \nDalton Byrd. My name was not Byrd at that time, my name was Sale. My \nancestor came from England in the year 1657, and was an indentured \nworker 7 years to pay for the trip across the waters. He ended up down \nalong the Rappahannock River, in Virginia. So I am his ninth generation \ndescendant. His name was James Sale.\n  My foster mother and my natural mother were as different in \nappearance as two women can be. My aunt Vlurma was stocky, stockily \nbuilt, olive-complexioned, and a laconic woman with dark-brown eyes. \nShe was very religious. She did not make a big whoop-de-do about it. \nShe was not of the religious right or the religious left. She just \nbelieved in the old-time religion.\n\n[[Page S4273]]\n\n She was religious, straightforward in her dealings with people, and a \ngood shot with a pistol. She was very good to me, though she never \ndisplayed much affection. I have no recollection of ever receiving a \nkiss from her. But I have many recollections of hearing her prayers as \nthey wafted through the stillness of the night from the other room. \nMany times I have seen her on her knees, praying. It used to be, when I \nwould leave Raleigh County, West Virginia, to return to Washington on a \nSunday afternoon, having been back in my congressional district, she \nwould say, ``You be a good boy, Robert. I always pray for you.''\n  So, she was a major influence in my life, and I thank her to this day \nfor accepting responsibility for me out of affection and kinship with \nmy mother, and for instilling in me strong values--strong values, a \nsense of duty, a sturdy work ethic, and an unshakable--unshakable faith \nin the Creator.\n  How proud man, vain man has become. How arrogant, who has the \naudacity to say there is no God! I read, just a few days ago, about a \npoll that was taken among scientists--of all people, who should believe \nand who should realize that there is a Creator. And I noted that only \n40 percent of those scientists, according to the poll, believed in a \nCreator. That was amazing. It was the same percentage as resulted from \na similar poll among scientists in 1916. I took the occasion a few days \nago to read from Darwin's ``Origin of Species,'' and to read where \nDarwin made reference to a Creator, made reference to God; and Darwin \nasked the question: Is it possible that the Creator may be so superior \nin intellect to the intellect of man as the human eye is superior to \nthe man-made camera? Here was a scientist who did not deny the \nexistence of a Creator.\n\n  I ask doctors--when I go to the office of a physician, I say, \n``Doctor, do you believe that there is a Creator?'' And I have yet to \ncome across a doctor who has not answered without hesitation, ``I do. I \nbelieve in a Creator.'' I had one doctor less than a week ago talk with \nme in his office. I asked him the same question. And I sat, open-\nmouthed and open-eyed, listening to him talk about the audacity of men \nwho would say there is no God.\n  Raising a child is hard work. Even though the endeavor is leavened \nwith joy, lightened with laugher, and sweetened with children's kisses, \nraising a child is a demanding job. Every mother who takes on the \nchallenge and raises a responsible, caring individual, merits applause \nfrom all of us.\n  Emerson said, ``Men are what their mothers made them.'' The mother \nfigure is certainly the strongest influence over the character and \ndevelopment of a child in its early years. Motherhood is the most \nimportant of life's assignments. There is none other that will equal \nthat. And the responsibility of motherhood is a particularly \nchallenging endeavor, especially in today's world, where parenting \nresponsibilities often have to be juggled with work responsibilities \nand housekeeping chores.\n  I often stop to marvel at the many young mothers who work in my own \noffice and in the various Senate offices and throughout the Government \nand the Nation. Poised, cool, and professional at work, one might never \nsuspect that, after work, they must still dash to the day-care center, \nrace home, feed husbands and children, spend quality time with the \nfamily, buy groceries, do the laundry, clean the house, and be back at \nthe office the next morning to begin the cycle all over again. So, I \ntake my hat off to all working mothers as we honor mothers this \nweekend. They maintain a heroic pace and the Nation owes them a debt \nthat can never be paid.\n  But, I also salute those women in our society who stick to the more \ntraditional role of keeper of the home and the hearth, for theirs is a \ndifficult job as well, and it is a job for which they receive no pay \nand little recognition in exchange for their priceless contribution to \nsociety.\n  Anne Morrow Lindbergh said: ``By and large, mothers and housewives \nare the only workers who do not have regular time off. They are the \ngreat vacationless class.''\n  Sometimes it seems to me that the traditional stay-at-home mom is not \nas much appreciated today. I have always believed that a great deal of \ncredit should go to those women who make the decision to work in the \nhome. Theirs is the oldest profession in the history of the world: The \nhome maker, the housewife. Managing a home and raising children are \nserious responsibilities, which, if well carried out, can make a \nsignificant contribution to the stability and well-being of our own \ncountry.\n  I recall the story of a great painter, a great artist, Benjamin West, \nwho went to his mother and showed her the little drawings of birds that \nhe had made with pencil and crayon on pieces of paper. And then she \ntook him and sat him gently on her knee and kissed him on the cheek and \nsaid, ``You will grow up to be a great painter.'' And Benjamin West \nattributed his greatness in that art as having originated with a \nmother's kiss.\n  My own treasured wife, Erma, with whom I have been blessed to share \nthe past 60 years--as of 2 weeks and 6 days from today--has devoted her \nlife to caring for me and our household, our children and our \ngrandchildren. With her capable hand in charge on the home front, I \nhave had the luxury to devote myself to the duties of the Senate, free \nfrom any domestic worries. And it's a great luxury. I could not have \nput in the countless hours required by my office without her extreme \npatience and forbearance, understanding and good humor and support. \nErma is the epitome of traditional family values, and my pride in the \naccomplishments of my daughters and their children is a clear \nreflection of the values and lessons that they learned from their \nmother and grandmother.\n\n  While I was out campaigning in the early years, while I was out \nknocking on doors, driving over the hills and up the hollows and down \nthe creeks campaigning, she was at home, my wife, with those two young \ndaughters. It is one of the great sacrifices that I have made in public \nlife, one that I can never retrieve--the time that I would like to have \nspent but didn't spend with my two daughters. But she, my wife, was \nthere, at home and at the hearth with them.\n  Family values and family structure have traditionally served as the \nstrong backbone of the Nation, and we ought to stop and think about \nthat, not just on Mother's Day, but every day. This strong backbone of \nour Nation has suffered from osteoporosis in recent years, but it is \ncurrently enjoying a resurgence of strength and appreciation because of \na collective realization that most of society's ills are not a result \nof the success or failure of any Government program, but rather have \ntheir roots, as well as their solutions, in the most basic building \nblocks of our culture, like the quality of the home and the cohesion of \nthe family.\n  Society is a collection of individuals, each of which is shaped, \nfirst and foremost, in large part, by his or her own mother. The values \nthat we all cherish, and on which society depends--like caring for \nothers, respect for the law, tolerance, comity, perseverance, loyalty, \ndedication, patriotism, faith in God--are learned earliest and best \nfrom the examples set by our mothers. The woman who raised me didn't \nhold any doctorates, master's degree, baccalaureate degrees. I don't \nknow that she ever went to school a day in her life, but she taught me \nhow to live. And with that kind of teaching, one may stray from time to \ntime throughout the years of one's life, but they will always come \nback--they will always come back.\n  When I think of her, and I can say much about the man who was her \nhusband, also--I will save that for another day--when I think of her \nstalwart faith in a supreme, omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent God, I \nthink of something that made this a great country, and the same thing \nmade the ancient Romans a great people. Theirs were pagan gods, but \nthey believed in their gods. They venerated their ancestors. They \nhonored their parents. The Bible says, ``Honor thy father and thy \nmother.'' When I think of the woman who took me to raise--I never knew \nany other mother--I think of one who was as unshakable in her faith as \nare the mountains of West Virginia, and she ingrained that faith in me.\n  Churches and schools are important places of learning, but it is the \nconstant encouragement and attitude of our mothers that instill in \nchildren the proper respect for church and school in\n\n[[Page S4274]]\n\nthe first place. We learn to pray at our mother's knee, and to read \nwhile sitting on her lap.\n  In my view, we desperately need a serious bolstering of our national \nregard for the position of the family in our national life. One day we \nought to take the people who do the TV programming that spews filth and \nviolence and sex into the homes of America and shake them with \nlegislation--and the day will come, I believe--that will teach those \npeople that if they will not clean up their act, somebody else will do \nit for them.\n  We need more Anna Maria Reeves Jarvises and more daughters like Anna \nM. Jarvis, who could so effectively mobilize a nation in honor of her \nown heroic mother and all mothers, and we should honor the role of \nmothers, not only this weekend, but every day.\n  So this weekend, especially, let us recognize the role of motherhood, \nwith all of the sentimentality and sweet remembrance that a day set \naside for honoring unselfish love should invoke. Let us also realize \nthat proper mothering is a tough job, with the future of our Nation \nriding, to a great extent, on the success of that endeavor, and let \nthat realization guide us as we contemplate policies for an ailing \nsociety sorely in need of a strong dose of moral direction and support.\n\n                            Rock Me To Sleep\n\n     Backward, turn backward, O time, in your flight,\n     Make me a child again just for tonight!\n     Mother, come back from the echoless shore,\n     Take me again to your heart as of yore;\n     Kiss from my forehead the furrows of care,\n     Smooth the few silver threads out of my hair;\n     Over my slumbers your loving watch keep;--\n     Rock me to sleep, Mother--rock me to sleep!\n\n     Over my heart, in the days that are flown,\n     No love like mother-love ever has shone;\n     No other worship abides and endures--\n     Faithful, unselfish, and patient like yours:\n     None like a mother can charm away pain\n     From the sick soul and the world-weary brain.\n     Slumber's soft calms o'er my heavy lids creep;--\n     Rock me to sleep, Mother--rock me to sleep!\n\n     Tired of the hollow, the base, the untrue,\n     Mother, O Mother, my heart calls for you!\n     Many a summer the grass has grown green,\n     Blossomed and faded, our faces between:\n     Yet, with strong yearning and passionate pain,\n     Long I tonight for your presence again.\n     Come from the silence so long and so deep;--\n     Rock me to sleep, Mother--rock me to sleep!\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, it is always a real treat to be on the \nSenate floor when my friend and colleague and neighbor from West \nVirginia speaks.

I would like to spend just a few more minutes talking about this \nissue.\n  We are proud, once again, to bring before the Senate this piece of \nlegislation that we believe will help bring the American workplace into \nthe 21st century. The Family Friendly Workplace Act will make our \nNation's working environments more flexible, more productive and more \nhospitable to the changing needs of the American family.\n  Last week, in my opening comments about this bill, I described what \nwe discovered in the hearings, and I use the term ``discover'' rather \nloosely because, really, I think we all knew what we saw in those \nhearings, what we heard in the Senate Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee. The testimony was very clear that the American workplace \ntoday is a dramatically different place than it was when the underlying \nbill was enacted 60 years ago.\n  The facts are that the stereotypical roles of management and labor \nand of male and female workers really no longer apply. The testimony in \nfront of our committee was that individual workers are too often faced \nwith a brutal squeeze today, a squeeze between their duties at work, \ntheir obligations, and what they want to do with their families. This \nworker squeeze is so great that I believe it calls for immediate \naction. And this bill is that action.\n\n  The static and outdated Fair Labor Standards Act that was enacted \nover 60 years ago must be modified, must be changed. It must be changed \nto allow American workers today the flexibility that they demand, the \nflexibility that they want.\n  The facts are fairly clear. When the underlying legislation, the \nunderlying bill was enacted in 1938, less than 16 percent of married \nwomen worked outside the home. Today, more than 60 percent of married \nwomen work outside the home. And 75 percent of mothers with school-aged \nchildren today work outside the home. And according to a survey \nconducted by the U.S. Department of Labor, Women's Bureau, the top \nconcern--top concern--of working women is flexible scheduling in the \nworkplace, flexible scheduling which will allow them to balance their \nresponsibilities at work with the needs of their children and the needs \nof their families.\n  The chart that is behind me depicts the pattern of change the \nAmerican workplace has undergone over the last 25 years. ``The Changing \nLabor Force Trends of Families, 1940-1995.''\n  Look at the complete contrast between the family structure today and \nthe family structure as it existed in 1940--1940--only 2 years after \nthe enactment of the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n  In 1940, Mr. President, 67 percent of all families had a working \nhusband and a wife who stayed at home, what we considered in those \ndays, the typical family. At the same time, only 9 percent of families \nhad two working spouses. And in 1940 only 5 percent of the families \nwere actually headed by women.\n  Clearly, this is no longer the case.\n  By 1995, only 17 percent of families had a working husband and a wife \nwho stayed at home. And 43 percent of American families had two working \nspouses. And 12 percent were actually families headed by women.\n  Society, Mr. President, has changed. But the workplace, at least the \nlaws governing the workplace, has not kept pace. I believe that \nAmericans are crying out for relief. They are demanding of this \nCongress that we change the law, that we change the law to reflect the \nway people really live today.\n  Take for example, the Morris family. Clayton Morris--father, \nhusband--is a public employee. As a public employee he has the option \nof choosing compensatory time over traditional monetary overtime pay. \nHe gets a choice which way he wants it. He is free to spend important \nextra time with his 2\\1/2\\-year-old son Domenic, while his wife Ann, a \nsales assistant for a Cleveland area business form company, cannot. She \nis prohibited by law from having that option.\n  This is what Ann has said:\n\n       He [referring to her husband Clayton] has the ability if he \n     works overtime to store [up] those hours . . . [he] can use \n     the stored comp time to be at home where he is needed. \n     [However, when] I need to be able to leave work, I end up \n     having to take sick time or vacation time to do that. [That's \n     what I have to do.] It would be really nice if I had a \n     flexible schedule [also].\n\n  Mr. President, seemingly countless studies and surveys have pointed \nout time and time again that Americans overwhelmingly need, desire, \nwant, and support a more flexible workplace schedule and the changes \nthe Family Friendly Workplace Act would bring about.\n  Let me take the opportunity now to highlight what this bill will do, \nS. 4, and explain briefly the different provisions of the bill.\n  The first option of the bill we refer to as comptime. This allows \nworkers to voluntarily--voluntarily--choose to take their overtime pay \nas time off instead of taking their overtime pay in money. They get the \ntime off as opposed to taking the money. But it is the worker's choice.\n  Under this bill, compensation in the form of compensatory time off is \npaid out at the same rate as an employee's normal rate of overtime pay. \nThat is, one-half hour of compensatory time off for every hour of \novertime worked.\n  Mr. President, under this option employers and employees must agree \nto provide and receive, respectively, compensatory time in lieu of \nmonetary overtime pay. It is an agreement, a voluntary agreement \nentered into by both\n\n[[Page S4275]]\n\nthe employer and the employee, an agreement that does not take place \nunder this bill or situation that does not take place unless both sides \nvoluntarily say, ``That's what I want to do.''\n  Union employees do this through the collective bargaining process. \nNonunion employees must do so by agreement prior to the performance of \nthe overtime worked. The employee must enter this agreement--this is \nfrom the bill--``knowingly and voluntarily.'' A nonunion employee's \ndecision to participate in a compensatory time off program must be in \nwriting or must be otherwise verifiable and kept by the employer, \naccording to the Fair Labor Standards Act's recordkeeping provision.\n  An employer may withdraw from his decision to provide a compensatory \ntime off program by providing 30-day written notice to the \nparticipating employees. On the other hand, nonunion employees may \nwithdraw by providing written notice to their employer. The terms of a \nunion employee's withdrawal would be reflected in the collective \nbargaining agreement.\n\n  Mr. President, upon an employer's discontinuance of this compensatory \ntime off policy, or on the occasion of an employee's withdrawal, the \nresignation or termination, an employee is then entitled to the cash \nequivalent of any unused comptime hours. An employee under this bill \nmay accrue up to 240 hours of compensatory time during a 12-month \nperiod. If after the 12-month period an employee has not used his \naccrued time, the employer has 31 days, under the bill, to remit the \ncash equivalent of those hours.\n  An employee must be allowed to use any accrued comptime within a \nreasonable period, a reasonable period of time after the request is \nmade provided that it does not duly disrupt the workplace.\n  Under a compensatory time-off program, an employee enjoys the \npreexisting protections of the Fair Labor Standards Act. These are not \nimpacted. The underlying bill is still there. And the underlying \nprotections are still there.\n  These protections include prohibitions against violation of section \n7, the FLSA discrimination provision, as well as S. 4's anticoercion \nprovision. No employee may be coerced, intimidated, or threatened to \naccept or deny participation in any of the bill's flexible workplace \noptions.\n  To be absolutely perfectly clear, let me spell out what the penalties \nunder this bill will be.\n  First, S. 4, as an amendment to section 7(r), will enjoy the already \nestablished penalties provided in the Fair Labor Standards Act. This \nwill obviously include the new amending provision in S. 4.\n  The penalties are:\n  First, the availability of criminal penalties in the event of a \nwillful violation;\n  Next, civil penalties in the event of repeated or willful violations;\n  They will include the remittance of unpaid overtime compensation and \nliquidated damages;\n  It will also include appropriate legal or equitable relief and \nliquidating damages for any retaliation by the employer against an \nemployee who complains of or testifies about an employer's conduct, as \nwell as attorney fees and costs to the employee who sues for \nretaliation.\n  Additionally, the Secretary of Labor may take action to acquire the \nemployee's unpaid overtime compensation and liquidated damages.\n  As stated, in addition to the penalties already provided by the Fair \nLabor Standards Act for a violation of section 7(r), S. 4 provides \nadditional penalties for direct and indirect intimidation, threats, and \ncoercion. Furthermore, S. 4 dictates penalties for any violation of \nthis anticoercion language.\n  Further, this bill provides for unpaid overtime compensation and \nliquidated damages or injunctive relief should the Secretary be \nrequired to bring a cause of action against the employer.\n  Mr. President, behind me is a picture, headlined ``Akron Beacon \nJournal,'' and ``A Juggling Act.'' It is a picture of a real family, \nthe Morris family of Ohio, and a description that I think, in the \nstory, tells the importance of this bill. I think this family \ndemonstrates why we need to have this bill. Here is what it says:\n\n       Ann Morris of Akron has to use vacation or sick days when \n     two-year-old Domenic is sick, while her husband Clayton has \n     the option of using comp time.\n\n  That is what this bill is about, Mr. President. This bill is about \nsome equity and equality in the workplace. Does it make any sense to \nhave a law today, as we do, that says to an hourly worker, who doesn't \nwork for the Government, the Federal Government is going to prohibit \nyou and your employer from entering into agreements that are flexible \nand allow you to spend more time with your family? That is what current \nlaw says today.\n  Current law discriminates against the person who works by the hour, \nand it says that in a business or in a shop, if there is a worker who \nworks by the hour and right next to him or her is a worker who is paid \nsalary, the person who is paid salary may have comp time or flextime, \nbut the person who works by the hour is denied that. Does that make any \nsense?\n  In the case of this family, the discrimination exists right in that \nfamily. The husband has these benefits, has these rights; yet, the \nFederal law says that the wife, the mother, can't have them. What this \nbill does is change that and eliminates that discrimination. It says to \nall American workers that whether you work for the Federal Government \nor don't, whether you work by the hour or are salaried, as long as the \nemployer and employee both agree, voluntarily, you can do many \ndifferent things in regard to flextime and comptime and making your \nlife easier, making it better, accommodating the workplace rules to the \nway people have to live today.\n\n  Mr. President, I began a few minutes ago, a discussion of the four \nprincipal parts of this bill. I talked about the comptime section. I \nnow want to move to the second section of biweekly work schedules.\n  Mr. President, let me turn to the biweekly work schedules. The second \noption this bill provides is the biweekly work schedules. Under this \noption, an employee may choose to work 80 hours over 2 weeks, in any \ncombination that that employee works out with the employer. For \nexample, a worker may choose to work 9 hour days but, every other \nFriday, get the whole Friday off. Maybe that worker wants to spend time \nwith his or her children. Maybe they want to go hunting or fishing, or \nmaybe they don't want to do anything. They have the right to make that \nagreement and have that long weekend. Biweekly work schedule programs \nare simply another way to ensure workplace flexibility. Biweekly work \nschedules enable employees to craft schedules that coordinate their \nwork obligations to go along with their personal obligations.\n  Mr. President, here is how it would work in practice. If an employer \nchooses to offer a biweekly schedule option, and if the employee elects \nto participate--it is purely voluntary--prior to each 2-week work \nperiod, the employer and employee will arrange a schedule for the 2-\nweek period. Regardless of how the hours are divided, the employee will \nbe paid overtime for working over 80 hours during the 2-week period. \nAgain, the decision is to be made together, mutually, voluntarily.\n  Additionally, employees would be entitled to overtime for all hours \nworked that are outside that predetermined biweekly work schedule. For \nexample, if an employee agrees to work 45 hours during the first week, \n35 hours during the second week, any hours worked above 45 in the first \nweek would, of course, be overtime, and any hours worked over 35 during \nthe second week would also be overtime, because that is what they had \nagreed on. Simply, Mr. President, if an employee is required to work \nany additional hours above the agreed-to schedule, he gets overtime.\n  Let me turn to the third provision of this bill, flexible credit \nhours. The third option that this bill provides that is not provided \nunder current law, Mr. President, is flexible credit hours. Under this \noption, an employee may choose to work additional hours. That is more \nthan 40 hours, more than 40 hours a workweek in order to use these \nextra hours to shorten another week at a later date.\n\n  Biweekly schedules and flexible credit hours provide flexibility to \nemployees who may not traditionally work a great deal of overtime. The \nflexible credit hour program would give more employees a greater \nability to balance work with family. A flexible credit\n\n[[Page S4276]]\n\nhour program would allow an employee to bank--``to bank''--up to 50 \nhours over his or her regularly scheduled hours. The employee under \nthis bill may use those banked hours at any future date to reduce the \nworkday or a workweek.\n  Mr. President, when used, the flexible credit hours represent time \noff from work at the employee's regular rate of pay. An employee must \nbe allowed to use accrued credit hours within a reasonable period of \ntime following his or her request, so long as doing so will not unduly \ndisrupt the workplace.\n  As is true with comptime and biweekly programs, an employer has the \ninitial decision of whether to offer the flexible credit hour program \nat all. Then participation in a flexible credit hour program is, of \ncourse, voluntary on the employer's part and on the employee's part. An \ninterested employee must elect to participate. If he or she does not, \nthen the status quo under current law would be in effect.\n  Mr. President, union employees can do this in accordance with their \ncollective bargaining agreements. Nonunion employees must submit a \nwritten or otherwise verifiable statement acknowledging his or her \nparticipation in the program. The anticoercion remedy sanctions \nprovision which we talked about before are applicable to the comptime \nand biweekly schedules and are also applicable to this flexible credit \nprogram as well.\n  Mr. President, let me turn now to the fourth major provision of the \nbill clarifying Federal law.\n  I have talked about the three chief options provided by the bill.\n  Let me also point out in the interest of completeness that S. 4 also \nmakes important clarifications in the regulations delineating the \nsalary basis test. The bill makes it clear that the fact that a \nparticular employee is subject to a deduction in pay for absence of \nless than a full workday or less than a full workweek may not be \nconsidered in determining whether that employee enjoys exempt status. \nOnly actual reductions in pay may be considered.\n  Mr. President, for more than five decades the ``subject to'' language \ngenerated little or no controversy. However, in recent years courts \nhave begun to reinterpret the salary basis test. Seizing on the phrase \n``subject to'' in the regulations, large groups of employees have won \nmultimillion-dollar judgments. These awards have been given in spite of \nthe fact that many of the plaintiff employees have never actually \nexperienced a pay reduction of any kind and have never expected to \nreceive overtime pay in addition to their executive, administrative, or \nprofessional salaries.\n  Mr. President, included in this bill--in part to stop the large \nnumber of cases that are being brought against State and local \ngovernments--it is true that the Department of Labor attempted to solve \nthis problem through regulations as they applied to State and local \nemployees in 1992. This legislation in no way preempts those \nregulations.\n  The legislation also clarifies that employers may give bonuses and \nmay give overtime payments to salaried employees without destroying \ntheir exemption from FLSA.\n  In summary, Mr. President, let me talk again briefly about the four \nprovisions.\n  Comptime, first of all, allows workers to voluntarily choose to take \ntheir overtime pay as time off instead of as overtime pay.\n  Biweekly schedules, the second provision, allows workers to choose to \nwork their 80 hours for 2 weeks in any combination that they so elect \nand if they agree with their employer.\n  Flexible credit hours, the third provision, allows workers to choose \nto work additional hours and to bank these hours for use as time off at \nsome point in the future.\n  All of these flexible workplace options are designed to expand the \nchoices available to working families. They are, Mr. President, \ncompletely voluntary. No employee can be forced to participate in a \nflexible workplace option. No employer can be forced to offer one. If \nany employer directly or indirectly coerces employees to participate in \na particular option, the employer can be punished under the Fair Labor \nStandards Act, be forced to pay back wages, and maybe even face \nimprisonment.\n  Mr. President, that is what the bill would accomplish.\n  This bill would accomplish a real change for the betterment of the \nlives of working families, and the American people absolutely agree \nwith this. A national poll conducted in September 1995 shows that the \nAmerican work force endorses flexible work options. When asked, Mr. \nPresident, about a proposal to allow hourly employees the choice of \ntime and a half in wages or time off with pay, 75 percent of the \nworkers agree with that proposal; 65 percent said they favored more \nflexible work schedules.\n  Mr. President, according to a poll recently taken, 88 percent of all \nworkers want more flexibility, either through scheduling flexibility or \nchoice of compensatory time in lieu of traditional overtime pay. In \nthat same poll, 75 percent of the workers favored changes in the law \nthat would permit hourly workers such a choice. The evidence is \noverwhelming about what the American workers want.\n\n  I think these poll results square with what most of us know, frankly, \nintuitively. As both the economy and the American family and life grow \nmore and more complex, the men and women in America's work force want \ngreater flexibility to be able to cope with all of the changes that we \nhave in life today. I think that this consensus presents us, this \nSenate, with a remarkable opportunity.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues as we work on what \nshould be a bipartisan approach to this bill.\n  Mr. President, this bill is about equity. It is about equality. It is \nabout families such as this that are pictured behind us. Families want \noptions. They want flexibility. This is what this bill gives them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/09/senate-section/article/S4274-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise here this morning to comment on a \npiece of legislation that my colleague from Ohio, Senator DeWine, and I \nintroduced actually a few days ago, but because of the pressing nature \nof the business on the floor of the Senate, did not get a chance to \nactually discuss it here.\n  I would like to describe what we have introduced and urge our \ncolleagues to\n\n[[Page S4277]]\n\njoin us in this effort and urge the administration to join us as well.\n  The legislation we introduced is called the Better Pharmaceuticals \nfor Children Act. It is a piece of legislation that we think has great \nvalue.\n  According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, only one-fifth, or \n20 percent, of all drugs on the market in the United States have been \ntested for their safety and effectiveness in children. Children are not \nsimply smaller versions of adults. Their bodies actually metabolize \ndrugs quite differently as they grow older.\n  The lack of information about how drugs work in children can place \npediatricians in an untenable position. They can either prescribe \npowerful drugs for their young patients that have only been tested in \nadults or they can deny them access to life-saving therapies.\n  This dilemma is dramatically illustrated in the case of children with \nAIDS. The hopes of tens of thousands of adult AIDS patients were raised \nlast year by the promising benefits of protease inhibiters. However, \nthe families of very young children have much less to be hopeful about.\n  None of these drugs is yet approved for newborns and infants. This is \ndespite the fact that the earliest days of a child's life may be the \nmost promising time to reverse the effects of HIV. As unbelievable as \nit may seem, physicians are forced to treat these children without the \nbenefit and guidance of research.\n  Even in adults, getting the proper dosage of these powerful drugs is \ntricky indeed. Too large a dose can cause severe side effects; too \nsmall a dose can make the HIV virus mutate into a far more dangerous, \ndrug-resistant strain. In children, the effects are compounded. A full-\nstrength dose can kill a toddler.\n  Other examples of this problem, Mr. President, are also quite \ndisturbing. Despite the fact that asthma is one of the most common \nchronic illnesses in children, and the most common cause of children's \nadmissions to hospitals all across this country, there is only one \nasthma drug that has been tested for children under 5 years of age.\n  In fact, my colleague from Ohio personally and eloquently related a \nsituation with one of his own children who has asthma that I am sure he \nwill comment on at some appropriate time. It is alarming that with \nasthma we have the single most common reason for admission to the \nhospital for children and yet we have no drugs tested to treat children \nunder the age of 5.\n\n  As other examples, despite the fact that sedatives are used to help \ntreat sick and injured children, not a single sedative has been \nspecifically tested for safety and efficacy in children under the age \nof 2. In addition, virtually every medication currently used to treat \nstomach and intestinal diseases in children has only been tested in \nadults.\n  While this so-called off label prescribing is neither illegal or \nimproper, it forces doctors to practice hand-me-down medicine for \npediatric cases, which is unacceptable, to put it mildly.\n  I think it is about time, Mr. President, we took the guesswork out of \nchildren's medicine. The Better Pharmaceuticals for Children's Act is a \nsimple solution to this problem. It provides a fair and reasonable \nmarket incentive for drug companies to make the extra effort needed to \ntest their products for use by children. It grants an additional 6 \nmonths of market exclusivity for drugs which have undergone pediatric \nstudies at the request of the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n  I want to briefly point to something most parents are all too \nfamiliar with--the disclaimers that appear on the labels of so many of \nthe pharmaceutical products that are needed and used by children: ``Not \nrecommended for use in children, as no clinical studies have been \nperformed to determine risks, benefits, and dosages.'' Another says, \n``Safety and effectiveness in children younger than the age of 2 has \nnot been established.'' Or, ``Safety and effectiveness in children \nyounger than age 12 have not been established.'' And, ``Safety and \nefficacy in children younger than age 18 have not been established.''\n  We have labels on the food that children eat; we have labels now for \nthe programs that children watch on television. I think we would all \nagree that it is about time we have labels that parents and physicians \ncan rely on when they give children medicine.\n  The bill that Senator DeWine and I have introduced is a sensible way \nto keep our children healthier. That is why it has enjoyed broad \nbipartisan support both in and outside of the Congress.\n  In fact, the bill is endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics, \nthe Pediatric AIDS Foundation, the National Association of Children's \nHospitals, and PHRMA, the trade association of the pharmaceutical \nindustry. Senators Mikulski and Kennedy have signed on as cosponsors, \nand I know that Representative Greenwood will soon be introducing this \nbill in the other body.\n  Mr. President, this is commonsense legislation. I call on our \ncolleagues to join Senator DeWine and myself in this effort. We hope we \ncan get passage quickly. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/09/senate-section/article/S4276-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HAPPY BIRTHDAY, KATHARINE HEPBURN\n\n  Mr. DODD. I join together with my colleague from Connecticut, Senator \nLieberman, in recognizing the birthday of an individual with whom we \nare all familiar. Our constituent in Connecticut, Katharine Hepburn, \nwill turn 90 on Monday. She probably will not be happy to have her \nSenator reveal her age on television.\n  Katharine Hepburn is a national treasure. We take pride in the fact \nthat she is a native of Connecticut, of Hartford, and today lives in \nOld Saybrook. She is world renown and has made a great contribution to \nthe arts. At the Bushnell Memorial in Hartford, where there is a ``wall \nof fame,'' she scribbled next to her name, ``Local girl.'' We cannot \nsay that about everyone on that wall. She has a career spanning seven \ndecades and is the only person in the history of film in this country \nwho has received 12 Academy Award nominations. She won four awards, for \n``Morning Glory'' in 1933, ``Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,'' ``Lion in \nWinter,'' and ``On Golden Pond.''\n  She won three Oscars after she turned age 60. For people in this \ncountry who wonder whether you can have a productive life after the age \nof 60, certainly Katharine Hepburn offers vivid proof that productive \nyears lie ahead.\n  On behalf of all of us in Connecticut, Mr. President, and my \ncolleagues here, we wish Miss Hepburn a very, very happy birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/09/senate-section/article/S4277-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4277-S4278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         IN MEMORY OF ANN PETRY\n\n  Mr. DODD. Ironically, in the same town of Old Saybrook, CT, we have a \nsadder piece of news about a wonderful constituent of my State. Ann \nPetry, an African-American writer whose life is described in an article \nby David Streitfeld last Saturday in the Washington Post, has died. She \nwas well into her nineties at the time of her death and was truly a \nremarkable person.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have that article printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 3, 1997]\n\n          Ann Petry's Storied Life--Author Left Indelible Mark\n\n                         (By David Streitfeld)\n\n       Ann Petry lived in Connecticut in a 200-year-old sea \n     captain's house that smelled of old wood and homemade bread. \n     Her husband, the taciturn but adoring George, was her \n     constant companion; their one child, Liz, had ended a \n     promising law career because she wanted to live near her \n     parents, because she liked them.\n       It seemed a pretty idyllic way to finish a life. Petry, who \n     died Monday in a convalescent home at the age of 88, was well \n     known enough to need an unlisted phone number but not so \n     famous that people were constantly on her doorstep. She knew \n     her books would be remembered, and that--along with her \n     family and friends and the warm spring mornings out in her \n     garden--provided pleasure. I think she died without regrets, \n     which has to be unusual.\n       Petry's family was firmly rooted in Old Saybrook; her \n     father had opened a pharmacy there in 1902, and Ann was \n     trained to follow him. As much as possible for a black woman \n     in the first half of this century, she escaped the effects of \n     racism.\n       It was a life in sharp contrast to that of her most famous \n     heroine, Lutie Johnson in ``The Street.'' Lutie is a single \n     mother in Harlem in the 1940s who has the misfortune to be \n     good-looking. White or black, the men\n\n[[Page S4278]]\n\n     want only one thing. Lutie tries to protect her 8-year-old \n     son and her virtue, an impossible task:\n       ``Streets like the one she lived on were no accident. They \n     were the North's lynch mobs, she thought bitterly; the method \n     the big cities used to keep Negroes in their place. And she \n     began thinking of Pop unable to get a job; of Jim slowly \n     disintegrating because he, too, couldn't get a job, and of \n     the subsequent wreck of their marriage; of Bub left to his \n     own devices after school. From the time she was born, she had \n     been hemmed into an ever-narrowing space, until now she was \n     very nearly walled in and the wall had been built up brick by \n     brick by eager white hands.''\n       ``The Street'' was based on the nine years Petry spent in \n     Harlem, working primarily as a journalist. ``I can only guess \n     at what she went through when she moved to New York and saw \n     all those disenfranchised people, totally lacking power in a \n     way that she and our family never did,'' her daughter once \n     told me. ``Her way of dealing with the problem was to write \n     this book.''\n       ``The Street'' was well reviewed when it appeared in 1946, \n     enough to become a bestseller, and it went on to become a \n     classic. It will always have a place in literary history \n     because it was the first book by a black woman to sell more \n     than 1 million copies, but the real reason it will survive is \n     because it's good, a triumph of realism.\n       Sadly, the book is also a measure of how far we have \n     fallen.\n       In 1992, when the original publisher, Houghton Mifflin, \n     bought back the rights and reissued ``The Street,'' it got a \n     front-page review in the Los Angeles Times Book Review. \n     Petry's Harlem, Michael Dorris wrote, ``hard as it was, now \n     seems in some respects almost nostalgically benign. The \n     streets of New York, as she describes them in the mid-1940's \n     were indisputably mean to the downtrodden, but in those days \n     it was still possible for a Lutie Johnson to walk 12 blocks \n     safely, at midnight, or to ride the last subway alone. It was \n     a place where the worst thing a child might bring to public \n     school was a penknife, a place where neighbors tried to watch \n     out for one another, where violent death was a rare and awful \n     occurrence.''\n       After ``The Street,'' Petry wrote in quick succession two \n     other novels for adults, ``Country Place,'' a story about a \n     Connecticut town that featured no black characters, and ``The \n     Narrows'' about a doomed interracial love affair. During the \n     '50s, she wrote several fiction and nonfiction books for \n     young people. While ``The Narrows,'' particularly, has its \n     supporters, her fame primarily rests on ``The Street.''\n       One of the problems with interviewers is that they ask \n     pesky questions like ``When are you going to publish a new \n     book?'' Five years ago, Petry answered that she was working \n     on things, but I didn't really believe it and I don't think \n     she expected me to believe it. She had said what she had to \n     say, and saw no need to obscure it with inferior work. It's a \n     lesson many other novelists could learn.\n       Petry had little tolerance for fools or academics, two \n     categories she regarded as essentially synonymous. From a \n     1989 interview with a scholar who wrote ``the first post-\n     structuralist study to reveal a hidden text'' in Petry's \n     novels:\n       Q. Richard Wright mentions in ``How Bigger Was Born'' that \n     he experienced ``mental censorship'' when writing ``Native \n     Son,'' that he worries about what blacks and whites would say \n     about Bigger and whether Bigger would perpetuate stereotypes. \n     How much mental censorship did you experience when you were \n     writing ``The Street''?\n       A. None.\n       Q. Were there ever concerns on your part or on the part of \n     your editor about ``The Street'' being overshadowed by or \n     having to measure up to ``Native Son''?\n       A. No.\n       When I interviewed Petry in 1992, she said that I should \n     stop by the next time I was in the area. This is the sort of \n     thing interview subjects often say; what they really mean is \n     that they hope you're not going to write something nasty. \n     They don't actually expect or want you to come visit.\n       Petry, though, did. So a few times when I was in that \n     corner of Connecticut I called her up and dropped in for a \n     couple of minutes. I last saw her about two years ago. She \n     was a little more stooped but seemed as if she would live \n     forever. George, who survives her, puttered around and didn't \n     say much as usual. I walked down the block to the old family \n     drugstore, where I looked out the window that Petry's father \n     would look out Sunday mornings to catch a glimpse of his wife \n     coming back from church.\n       ``Come here,'' he would tell Ann. ``Look at your mother. \n     Isn't she beautiful?''\n       Tuesday, I noticed a teenage girl on the Metro reading a \n     beat-up paperback of Petry's biography of Harriet Tubman. \n     Although I didn't know it, Petry had died the day before. \n     Like any good writer, her work survives.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Ann Petry's father was a pharmacist who opened up a \npharmacy in 1902 in Old Saybrook, CT. Although she learned the pharmacy \ntrade from her father, her contribution, of course, was in literature.\n  Her famous novel, ``The Street,'' written in the 1940's, was a \nremarkable piece of journalism that is still read today by younger \ngenerations. She followed that novel with two others that received wide \nrecognition, ``The Narrows,'' and ``A Country Place,'' about a \nConnecticut town that many thought could be Old Saybrook. She wrote a \nnumber of short stories and articles. Ann Petry was truly a very \nremarkable person.\n  She did not have much use for fools and academicians, she once said, \nand she said she was usually speaking about one and the same person \nwhen talking of fools and academicians. I do not know that I agree, but \nshe was a person of curt opinion, straightforward talk, and was well \nadmired and loved in the town of Old Saybrook. Her contributions to \nliterature have brightened the lives of many, many people.\n  We express our sorrow for the loss of Ann Petry.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague from Ohio has indicated I \nshould proceed to seek 10 minutes of time, at which point he intends to \nresume his discussion. I appreciate his courtesy.\n  I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/09/senate-section/article/S4277-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               DISASTER SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday we completed a disaster \nsupplemental appropriations bill that addresses some of the needs of \nthe serious disaster that occurred in my State of North Dakota and the \nthree-State region of South Dakota, North Dakota, and Minnesota. I am \npleased to say at the end of the day Senator Stevens, Senator Byrd, and \nso many others, on a bipartisan basis, in this Chamber were willing to \nadd sufficient resources so that people who lost their homes, people \nwho lost their businesses, who feel helpless and hopeless, will now \nhave some hope that there will be recovery in our region of the \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, 25,000 people in Grand Forks, ND, woke up this \nmorning, not in their own bed, not in their own home, some in a \nshelter, many with friends, some in other towns, because much of that \ntown is still evacuated. In East Grand Forks, across the river, 9,000 \npeople have left the town. The entire community was evacuated, and the \nmayor indicates nearly none of them are back.\n  The blizzards, the floods, and the fires were the worst we have ever \nseen. The need for the rest of the country to extend a helping hand, to \nsay we want you to recover and rebuild and get back on your feet, is \nwelcome news. I appreciate very much the resources, some $500 million \nof community development block grant funds, that resulted, finally, in \nthis legislation enacted yesterday by the U.S. Senate.\n  I thank all my colleagues for that help, on behalf of all North \nDakotans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/09/senate-section/article/S4278-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

I happen to think there is \ngreat merit in reaching a bipartisan agreement on a balanced budget \ndeal, and when I use the term ``deal,'' I am talking about the \nnegotiations between the principals about how to get to a balanced \nbudget.\n  I am inclined, based on what I know, to support it. I have observed \nand asked those involved in the negotiations to consider that the \nSocial Security surpluses are still not dealt with appropriately, and \nthey need to do more in order to make certain that we have not claimed \nto have balanced the budget, when, in fact, we have done so by using \nSocial Security surpluses. That will not complete the job. I hope those \nwho are negotiating that will not stop short of the goal. We need a \nbalanced budget and we need to preserve the Social Security surpluses \nabove that to save for the baby boom generation when it retires.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/09/senate-section/article/S4278-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4278-S4279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AMERICA'S JUSTICE SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Finally, Mr. President, on a subject I came to the floor \nto speak about for a couple of minutes, I have been to the floor of the \nSenate repeatedly to talk about our justice system. Our judicial \nsystem, in many respects, is a remarkable and interesting system. In \nsome respects, it is broken.\n  I have talked on this floor of case after case of violent crimes, \ncommitted\n\n[[Page S4279]]\n\nby violent criminals, who we knew were violent, but yet were turned out \nof prison, and in many cases turned them out of prison or jail early \nbecause they earned good time for early release.\n  Parole, probation, early release for good time means that the young \nboy I have spoken about on the floor of the Senate, Jonathan Hall, \nmurdered, stabbed over 50 times, by a man who had kidnapped and \nmurdered twice before and was out early on good time, living in young \nJonathan Hall's neighborhood, killed that young boy and threw him down \na pond. The young boy, when they found him, had dirt and grass between \nhis fingers, because he obviously had not been dead, despite being \nstabbed 50 times, and tried to climb out of the pond before he died.\n  Why was he dead? Because someone was let out of jail early to live in \nthat neighborhood and kill young Jonathan.\n  Bettina Pruckmayr, a young woman who came to Washington, excited \nabout a wonderful future, stabbed many, many times by someone at an ATM \nmachine, someone who had been in jail and let out of jail early, who \nshould never have been let out on the streets. I will come again to \ntalk about that.\n  It is disgraceful that the average sentence served for committing \nmurder in this country is 7\\1/2\\ years. The average sentence served in \njail or prison is 7\\1/2\\ years--that is a broken system.\n  There is more to the broken system that I want to mention today. That \nis the trial that is now going on in Denver, CO, about the Oklahoma \nCity bombing case. I will not talk about the merits or what I think \nabout the case, but I want to talk about something that is haywire in \nthe public defender system.\n  The 6th amendment to the Constitution offers a right to every \nAmerican to a fair trial. Therefore, an indigent defendant has a right \nto a public defender. We have an alleged murderer on trial in Denver \nwho drove a truck up in front of a courthouse and killed many, many \npeople. No one will forget the memory of the fireman holding that young \nchild from the day care center in his arms, dead as a result of some \nmurderous coward who decided to kill innocent people with a truck bomb.\n  Now, what happens when someone who is indigent is arrested and goes \non trial for committing a crime of that type? Let me tell you what \nhappens.\n  The public defender system in this country today offers that \ndefendant, on trial now in Denver, 14 attorneys. Yes, Mr. McVeigh has \n14 lawyers working for him, paid for by us, and 6 investigators on top \nof the 14 lawyers. We are also paying 25 expert witnesses, and we paid \nfor 9 foreign trips by his lawyers and his investigators to Israel, \ntrips to Italy, Great Britain, Syria, Jordan, Hong Kong, the \nPhilippines, and all these trips were paid for by the American taxpayer \nunder the public defender system, which offers someone who allegedly \ncommitted murder by a truck bomb at the Oklahoma City courthouse offers \nhim 14 lawyers, 6 investigators, 25 witnesses, and 9 foreign trips to 8 \nforeign countries. It is estimated to cost $10 million of taxpayers' \nmoney for a defense.\n  I support the sixth amendment. I support public defenders being \noffered to indigent people accused of crimes. But, Mr. President, the \nAdministrative Office of the Courts estimates that there is a 68-\npercent jump in the cost of court-appointed attorneys in Federal \ncapital cases. In 1 year alone, there is a 68-percent jump in the cost. \nThe Administrative Office of the Courts will overrun 1997 \nappropriations for these expenditures. The appropriation was $308 \nmillion. It will overrun by $25 million.\n  Now, I am not a lawyer. I suppose some will say, well, you need to \nunderstand this. I do not understand this. The sixth amendment \nguarantees the right to a fair trial. I believe it guarantees the right \nfor an indigent defendant to be given a defense, and for that defense \nto be paid for by the American taxpayer. I do not believe any twisted \ninterpretation of that should persuade us, the American taxpayer, to \npay for 14 lawyers, 6 investigators, 25 expert witnesses, and trips to \nforeign countries in a case like the Oklahoma City bombing case.\n  Now, I don't know what the answer is. But I know this is broken. I am \nhoping, as I sift through this with some of my colleagues, that we can \nfind a way, yes, to preserve the rights under the sixth amendment to \nevery defendant, but to stop this sort of nonsense. The records, \nincidentally, in this case are sealed, so we don't know exactly what \nhas been spent. It has been estimated that from $3 million to $10 \nmillion, in early April, was spent in this circumstance. But when I see \nthis sort of thing happening, I get angry again about a judicial system \nthat seems broken. I am tired of people being let out of jail early to \nkill again. We have over 3,000 people in prison in this country right \nnow who were in for having committed a murder and, while they were out \nearly, have committed another capital crime. At least 3,000 families \nought to feel that someone is an accomplice when they let out a known \nviolent criminal early only to commit murder again.\n  That system is broken, and one more evidence of a broken system is \nthe lack, somehow, of restraint in a circumstance where we take a \npublic defender requirement under the sixth amendment and decide this \nis a pot of money that has no bottom, hire as many lawyers as you want, \nand somebody will say, yes, dig as deep as you like and some will say, \nyes, because the old taxpayer pays for that. There ought to be a limit, \nand we ought to start talking about it when we see this kind of twisted \nlogic resulting in this kind of waste. I think it is time for Congress \nto act.\n  Do I know the specific answer? No, I don't. But I think we need to \ndefine, decide, and discuss limits in this area, so we tell those folks \ninvolved in the public defender system that there is a limit. No, there \nis not a limit on sixth amendment rights, but there is a limit on the \nuse of taxpayer funds to hire 6, 8, 10, 12, or 14 lawyers. It is time \nthat we use a little common sense. I hope when we come around on the \nappropriations side--and I am on the Appropriations Committee--and look \nat appropriating again in this account, we can start thinking about how \nthis money ought to be used. Is there a sensible limit? I sure hope to \nbe one of those who helps to find that out in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/09/senate-section/article/S4278-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4279-S4280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HAPPY BIRTHDAY KATHARINE HEPBURN\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nOhio, who has quite graciously allowed me to go forward for a few \nmoments to join my colleague from Connecticut in kind of a statement of \npride and gratitude, to commemorate and recognize the birthday this \nMonday of a beloved constituent but really one of the great motion \npicture actresses of all time, Katharine Hepburn.\n  As Senator Dodd said, we have known Katharine Hepburn in Connecticut \nnot only as one of our own, but as somebody who, quite appropriately, \nhas preserved her privacy. We try our best to do that, and I suppose it \nis inconsistent to publicly acknowledge that this great lady is \napproaching her 90th birthday, on May 12. But in this case, we \nrespectfully and humbly break the privacy and want to publicly honor \nher for the extraordinary career that she has had.\n  She grew up in a small Connecticut town and has always consider \nherself--and still does--the ``local girl,'' as she puts it. She is the \nonly four-time winner of the Academy Award for best actress, as I say, \nfor the great roles she has played, 3 of which were won after the age \nof 60. Katharine Hepburn is, in the words of my colleague--and it is \ninteresting that we both chose the same phrase, working independently--\na national treasure.\n  For nearly 70 years of a brilliant acting career, she has captured \nthe essence of not just what it means to be a great woman and a great \nperson, but the American spirit both on and off the silver screen. In \nher leading roles and in her life, Katharine Hepburn has stood as a \nsymbol of dignity and of independence, someone who, in the best \nAmerican/New England traditions, has proudly lived life on her own \nterms, and with it, great results came.\n\n  Katharine Hepburn once said of her home in Connecticut, ``I think I'm \nlucky because people with careers are\n\n[[Page S4280]]\n\nattracted to the big city and lose track of where they come from. \nThis''--speaking of our State and her beloved town--``is where I come \nfrom. I have roots, a sense of belonging somewhere.''\n  As much as we are honored that Katharine Hepburn has said she belongs \nin Connecticut, we are very proud to say that we belong to her and she \nto us. People around the Old Saybrook section of the State will tell \nyou how thrilled they are to have seen her taking those dips into Long \nIsland Sound, not only in the summer but occasionally in winter, and \nhow grateful they are for the way in which, in her quiet way, she has \nbecome involved in the kinds of concerns that local communities have, \nsuch as buying a ladder truck for the fire department. She reaches an \nextraordinary age this Monday and can look back on a remarkable career.\n  Katharine Hepburn's artistic brilliance, her outlook on life, her \nspirit, have served as a beacon of light and of truth for people in \nAmerica and, really, throughout the world. I am delighted to join with \nmy colleague, and I am sure everyone else in our State and everyone \nhere in the Senate, in thanking her for what she has meant to us as an \nartist, in expanding our own sense of reality, our own horizons, our \nown appreciation of life. She reaches a substantial age on Monday, but \nthe truth is that Katharine Hepburn, through the miracle of the movies, \nis ageless and immortal, forever beautiful, forever graceful, forever \nmagnificently intelligent, forever brilliant, forever spirited, forever \nKatharine Hepburn. Happy 90th birthday.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/09/senate-section/article/S4279-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4280-S4281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 HAITI\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like at this point to turn to a \ntopic that I began the discussion about this morning. That is the topic \nof Haiti.\n  I said this morning, Mr. President, that the situation in Haiti is at \nanother critical point. President Clinton will meet tomorrow with the \nPresident of Haiti, President Preval. In that discussion, what will \ntake place, I think, is very, very important.\n  I talked earlier today about my recent trip to Haiti, which was the \nfourth trip that I have taken to Haiti in the last 2 years.\n  I talked about what I considered to be some of the imperatives, some \nof the things that absolutely have to take place if this fledgling \ndemocracy in Haiti is to survive.\n  They have to have privatization. They have a schedule now for \nprivatization. It is laid out with a timetable. Everyone who I talked \nto in Haiti, all Government officials, assured me that they would \nfollow this timetable. But, as I expressed to them, no one, frankly, in \nthis country is going to take that seriously until we actually see \nprivatization take place.\n  So it is important that, as we approach the date of the first \nprivatization in July, it actually takes place. It is important because \nthat democracy cannot survive just on elections. People have to have \nhope. People will only have hope if there is food to feed their \nchildren and if there is hope and opportunity for their future and the \nfuture of their children. That will only occur if some of the state-\ncontrolled industries that have really strangled the economy in Haiti \nfor so long can be freed up, if they can be privatized, and if the \neconomy can then begin to grow.\n  Privatization is also important because by privatizing these \nindustries, that will send a sign to the international community that \nthe leadership in Haiti, from President Preval down, is in fact serious \nabout doing the things to create a market-oriented economy that will in \nfact allow Haiti's economy to begin to grow.\n  That is No. 1.\n  No. 2 is Haiti must make progress in regard to these high-profile \npolitical murders. Based on my own investigation when I went to Haiti, \nI believe they have the capability of doing this. I believe that some \nof these cases can in fact be solved--the case for example, of Reverend \nLeroy. I believe that case can be solved. But it can only be solved if \nthere is political leadership. It can only be solved if there is \nleadership from the top, from President Preval down saying it is a \npriority that we bring these people who committed this act to justice.\n  I would like to turn now, Mr. President, to a third area; that is, \nthe agricultural situation in Haiti.\n  Seventy percent of Haiti's people live in rural areas. That is about \n4 million out of a total population of 7 million. Eighty percent, it is \nestimated, of these rural Haitians farm on hillsides. But Haiti's \nagriculture clearly is troubled, to say the least. Haiti loses about 36 \nmillion metric tons of topsoil every year to erosion. That is enough to \ncover, they tell me, about 15,000 acres. About half a million people in \nthe northwest part of Haiti are facing today a very serious drought.\n  Mr. President, 30 years or so ago Haiti produced most of its own \nfood. Today it imports two-thirds of its food. Haiti is having trouble \nfeeding itself, and a number of causes have been assigned to that. I \nwill mention just a few.\n  The environment in Haiti is certainly fragile. Seventy percent is \nhillside land. Intensive cropping of 60 percent of the land-surface \nbusinesses have been decapitalized--less capital. Effective loss of \ncapital has been magnified by the 1991-1994 embargo. Land plots are \nsometimes too small. There is a lack of land security under the land \ntenure system, and, as a result of the country's weak infrastructure, \nfarmers are many times isolated from their markets.\n  The USAID has instituted two programs to address these programs. The \nAgriculturally Sustainable Systems for Environmental Transformation, or \nASSET, as it is called, is a $45 million program to improve hillside \nfarming to help poor urban neighborhoods, improve water supply and \nwaste management, and strengthen the Haitian Government's agricultural \nfood security and environmental policy.\n  Mr. President, the Program for the Recovery of the Economy in \nTransition, or PRET, is an $8 million program aimed at strengthening \nthe Haitian private sector's role in national economic and business \npolicymaking, providing innovative sources of credit, and helping key \nindustries export the domestic market potential.\n  Mr. President, under ASSET's coffee project, USAID has helped over \n20,000 coffee farmers produce a premium coffee that is now marketed \nunder the trademark of ``Haitian Blue.'' Since 1990, farmers have \nexported almost 200,000 pounds of this coffee. USAID has implemented a \nprogram of tree planting to reverse the impact of almost 30 million \ntrees being cut each year. USAID plans to expand the ASSET program to \nassist the Haitian Government in establishing an agricultural data \ncollection system, disseminate technology, and provide environmental \nmanagement.\n\n  There is currently not a single--this is amazing--not a single source \nof information on agricultural production in Haiti, no central \ncollection of this data, even though agricultural production affects \nthe lives of approximately 70 percent of the people who live in Haiti.\n  The USAID Agribusiness Loan Guarantee Fund provides incentives for \nfinancial institutions to extend credit to midsized agribusinesses. By \nfinancing these businesses such lending institutions also help small \nfarmers from whom the middlemen buy their goods. In the first 18 months \nof its operation, the fund had resulted in 1,300 permanent jobs and \n10,000 seasonal jobs.\n  While our program has shown some success, I think it is important to \npoint out to my colleagues in the Senate that United States assistance \nin the agricultural area still only reaches approximately 1 out of 7 \nHaitian farmers. Clearly the goal of our policy is and always must be \nself-sufficiency for Haiti.\n  The outlines of the bipartisan United States policy toward Haiti I \nthink are clear. The United States should help Haiti become self-\nsufficient in food. We should help them build a system of law and \norder. After all, United States law enforcement is the best in the \nworld and the Haitians can benefit greatly from our expertise. We \nshould help the Haitians attract the kind of private investment that is \nthe cornerstone of long-term economic growth.\n  I cannot stress enough that our good intentions cannot succeed, will \nnot succeed in and of themselves. No matter how much we want to help \nHaiti, there is a limit to what we can do.\n\n[[Page S4281]]\n\n There is a limit to what we will do. Ultimately, the democracy that is \nslowly growing in Haiti can only be preserved by Haitians themselves. \nHaiti has to have the will, Haiti has to have the perseverance to carry \nthrough with the real reforms that we have talked about today. And that \nis what I believe President Clinton must underscore in the conversation \nthat he will have tomorrow with Haitian President Preval. Our message \nto President Preval and to the Haitian people must be very simply this: \nWe can help you, we will help you, but the destiny of your country \nreally lies in your own hands.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/09/senate-section/article/S4280-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CHARLES D. ``CHUCK'' SHIPLEY\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, this afternoon I honor the memory of a \ntruly great figure in the history of Ohio, Charles D. ``Chuck'' \nShipley, who died on April 5 of this year at the young age of 54.\n  Chuck Shipley leaves Ohio a better place than he found it. Chuck \ndedicated his whole life to public service, to improving the lives of \nhis fellow Ohioans. He first spent 16 years in the Ohio State Highway \nPatrol. Chuck was later director of the Ohio Department of Public \nSafety and served under Gov. George Voinovich in that position from \n1991 to 1997. He served as the director of the department of public \nsafety for the entire 4 years that I served as Lieutenant Governor of \nthe State of Ohio. While he served in that capacity, he was in charge \nof several agencies including the highway patrol, and he was in charge \nin general of highway safety for the 11 million people who live in our \ngreat State.\n  Chuck and I both had experiences in law enforcement that dramatically \nshaped our attitudes toward highway safety. I had been a local county \nprosecutor and in that capacity I dealt with the shattered lives of \nfamilies who had lost loved ones who had been killed in auto \nfatalities, sometimes by drunk drivers.\n  When I was in the State senate, a little 7-year-old boy in my home \ncounty, a little boy by the name of Justin Beason was struck and killed \nby a driver who had been driving and drinking. Little Justin was killed \nas he was getting off his school bus. In response to this tragedy, with \nthe help of Mothers Against Drunk Drivers, we succeeded in 1983 in \nwriting a tough new drunk driving law in the State of Ohio.\n  While I was working on safety issues as a prosecutor and as a State \nsenator, Chuck Shipley was on the front lines as a highway patrolman. \nHe saw much more often than I ever did the devastation that is brought \nby highway fatalities. It was Chuck who was often the one to notify the \nparents of a child who had been killed in a highway accident.\n\n  Chuck told me about that experience, and as he told me about it I \ncould see it had left an unbelievable impression on him. He told me it \nwas the toughest thing he ever had to do in his life, and tragically he \nhad to do that more than once. That kind of experience, as Chuck told \nme, leaves a deep impression on a person. It certainly left an impact \non Chuck.\n  Chuck Shipley became a committed, dedicated fighter in the cause of \nhighway safety. When I was Lieutenant Governor and he was director of \nthe public safety department, I was, frankly, very grateful time and \ntime again for the passion that Chuck brought to his work. It was \ncontagious. His energy and enthusiasm helped him change attitudes. It \nhelped him win converts who had worked to make Ohio safer.\n  Chuck and I spent a great deal of time together traveling the State, \nmany times on holidays because that is when you always try to put the \nemphasis on highway safety--Memorial Day, Labor Day, or some other \nholiday. We spent a lot of time talking and a lot of time traveling the \nState to promote antidrunk-driver campaigns or designated-driver \ncampaigns and just overall highway safety. Chuck helped us implement, \namong other things, administrative license suspensions, to help crack \ndown on drunk drivers, and he took many, many other actions in his \nofficial capacity to save lives in Ohio. He was a worker, a hard worker \nin a good cause, and Chuck got results. I can truly say something about \nChuck Shipley that any of us would be incredibly proud to have said \nabout ourselves: There are people alive today who would not be alive \nbut for Chuck Shipley.\n  I join all Ohioans in being grateful for the life he dedicated to our \nState but even more I am grateful for our friendship. He was a \nwonderful human being, a person who would not get upset even in the \nmost difficult circumstance. I do not ever recall, all the hours I \nspent with Chuck, him ever getting upset. He always had a smile. He was \nalways calm. He always went about his business. I am very proud to have \nknown Chuck Shipley, and I want to express my condolences to Chuck's \nfamily, express to all of them my greatest sympathy for the loss of \nChuck, to his wife Jana, their children David and Carli, and their \nfamily. Their loss is great, and so is Ohio's.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/09/senate-section/article/S4281-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4281-S4282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                BETTER PHARMACEUTICALS FOR CHILDREN ACT\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I turn at this point to a matter that was \nbrought up a little while ago by my distinguished colleague from \nConnecticut, Senator Chris Dodd. He spoke very eloquently about the \npiece of legislation that he and I are introducing, a piece of \nlegislation that we believe will dramatically improve health care \navailable to America's children.\n  We as a nation need to do a better job making sure our children get \nthe pharmaceuticals that are appropriate for them. This is a matter I \nhave been concerned about for some time, and it is a matter that as the \nfather of eight children is near and dear to my heart.\n  We are introducing the Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act. This \nlegislation will provide an incentive in the form of 6 months of market \nexclusivity to encourage pharmaceutical companies to conduct the \nnecessary clinical trials for FDA approval of their products for \nchildren. These studies would take away the guesswork that too many \nphysicians and parents go through in trying to treat their sick \nchildren. These studies would do away with this guesswork by giving an \nincentive to the drug companies, by giving them a 6-months extension on \ntheir patent exclusivity so as to give them the incentive to do the \ntrials and do the studies that would give parents and give physicians \nbetter information.\n  This is not a new product. Let me give several examples to show my \ncolleagues what the problem is. The first example goes back to 1960. \nThere was a drug called chloramphenicol that was approved for use in \nadults to control bacterial infections. This drug was widely used with \nadults and it was successful, but when it was used on children the \nresults were devastating. It shut down their liver. Many children got \nsick and, tragically, a number of them died. This came to be known as \nthe gray baby syndrome.\n  Let me give another example of the problem that our bill attempts to \naddress. There was a little 4-year old leukemia patient named Stewart \nBaxter who had to scream through a spinal tap, had to go through \nimmense pain because the doctors were advised they could not give him \nan anesthetic. The anesthetic was thought to be harmful to young \npatients. However, later they found that was not true. A few weeks \nlater he was allowed to undergo the same procedure--this time, however, \nunder the anesthetic. Better information earlier would have prevented \nthat child's agony and would have made it possible for the parents not \nto have had to undergo that trauma as well in watching their child go \nthrough that pain.\n  Let me give you another example. Dr. Ralph Kaufman, representing the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, testified in the House of \nRepresentatives about a 1-month-old infant that he treated. He was \ntreating it for a life-threatening infection, the kind of infection \nthat was resistant to all available antibiotics except one. That one \nantibiotic was not labeled for children. They had not done the testing. \nAnd it certainly was not labeled for a 1-month-old infant. But Dr. \nKaufman took the chance, combining his knowledge with the physiology of \nthe 1-month-old child with how the instructions said the antibiotic \nshould be used for adults. In this case Dr. Kaufman said the gamble \npaid off. But sometimes the outcome is not so favorable. Physicians \nhave to gamble, due to a lack of information. Sometimes physicians do \nnot take the chance and they lose the availability of a very useful \ndrug. Other times they do take the\n\n[[Page S4282]]\n\nchance and maybe the results are not what they had expected. By passing \nthis bill, we will change that. As a result, children can be treated \nfor diseases with greater safety and with greater confidence.\n\n  The problem this bill addresses is a very serious one. About 80 \npercent of the drugs on the market today have not been approved by the \nFDA for use in at least one pediatric age group--80 percent. As a \nconsequence, the drugs do not carry labeling information explaining how \nthey should be taken by children. This is because clinical trials are \nexpensive. It is a dollars-and-cents issue, and often there is little \nmarket incentive for pharmaceutical companies to conduct these tests. \nThe result is that drugs are usually prescribed for children on the \nbasis of adult trials and the pediatrician's own experience. Children \nare not just small adults, and therefore this is a somewhat risky \nbusiness. Physicians deserve better information and children deserve, \nas well as their parents, better information.\n  I had experience in my own family. Senator Dodd alluded to this a \nmoment ago. He just heard me talk about it. When you have children, you \nhave a lot of medical experiences. But a number of years ago, my \ndaughter Becky, who was very young, had developed asthma. As is the \nexperience, sadly, of many parents who have children with asthma, we \nended up spending many evenings and sometimes the middle of the night \nin emergency rooms when Becky would have an attack.\n  Finally, the physician who was treating Becky said: Look, we need to \ndo something about this. I don't think we should allow this to \ncontinue. There is something that is on the market today. We have \ninformation about its use by adults. I think we should go ahead and try \nit and I think we should see if it will work with Becky.\n  He prescribed to her an inhaler that looks similar to the one that I \nam carrying right now, and gave it to Becky. She was able to use that. \nI was able to help her, and it lessened the trips to the emergency room \nfor asthma attacks. She was able to get through childhood without \nanymore serious, horrible trauma, going to the emergency rooms because \nof asthma attacks.\n  So I think this is an experience that many people have had. It is \nimportant, I think, to make the change in the law to give the drug \ncompanies the incentive so they can go out and do these tests. There \nare many drugs that are in this category, including those used to treat \nAIDS, as well as, as I mentioned, those to ease asthma attacks, drugs \nto alleviate pain, drugs even to treat other illnesses. Too often, \nphysicians and parents are forced to guess about dosages or possible \nside effects. They should not have to play this kind of Russian \nroulette with their sick children.\n  This problem has been around for a long time. In the last session of \nCongress this bill was passed by the Labor Committee, but unfortunately \nit did not reach the floor.\n  We have had extensive discussions with the Food and Drug \nAdministration, pediatric community, pharmaceutical companies, and \nmakers of generic drugs. I am confident that we have come up with a \npractical way to remedy this problem. This bill is supported by health \nproviders, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National \nAssociation of Children's Hospitals, and the Pediatric AIDS Foundation.\n  I intend and hope to work with the FDA to solve this problem and find \nthe best approaches, both legislatively as well as administratively. I \nlook forward to continuing our dialog with the FDA. But I am not going \nto and Senator Dodd is not going to wait around for a proposal that \nthey might make. This is our proposal. It is a legislative proposal. I \nbelieve it will do the job. I look forward to moving this bill through \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. President, we all want to see better labeling for drugs used to \ntreat our sick children. Today, I believe, with this bill, we are \ntaking the first step to resolve a very serious national health \nproblem. Senator Dodd and I are serious about seeing this legislation \npass both Houses of Congress this session. This project is a very high \npriority and we will do all we can to make it happen. I encourage my \ncolleagues to cosponsor the legislation and encourage their help and \nassistance when the bill reaches the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/09/senate-section/article/S4281-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          REPORTS OF COMMITTEE\n\n  The following report of committee was submitted:\n\n       By Mr. JEFFORDS, from the Committee on Labor and Human \n     Resources:\n       Report to accompany the bill (S. 717) to amend the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, to reauthorize \n     and make improvements to that Act, and for other purposes \n     (Rept.

A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to expand the coverage of \nthe single transport region established to control interstate pollution \nand to apply control measures throughout the region, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n           THE ACID DEPOSITION AND OZONE CONTROL ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \naddress a scourge that has long afflicted the State of New York and \nmany parts of the Northeast. That scourge is acid rain.\n  Ending the scourge of acid rain will not be easy. In fact, it is \nlikely that additional congressional efforts will be necessary to fully \naddress this issue and I intend to continue to work on such efforts. \nHowever, I believe that it is necessary to introduce this legislation \nat this time to make the Senate aware that serious measures must be \ntaken to solve the acid rain problem that continues to impact New York \nand the Northeast. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \ndevelop the most sensible and cost-effective approach to eliminate the \ndamages of acid rain.\n  Over the past 15 years, Congress and the Federal Government have \nattempted to address this problem. Unfortunately, efforts to date have \nnot yielded the success in may State that New Yorkers had wished. \nLakes, streams, and trees in the Adirondacks are still dying due to \nsulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions that are transported from \nupwind sources. The health of New Yorkers and New York's environment \ncontinue to be affected by fuel burning activities in other regions of \nour Nation. That must change. This bill will see that significant \nreductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are achieved so that \nNew Yorkers and also others in the Northeast will be able to enjoy a \ncleaner environment.\n  Acid rain forms when sulfur dioxide [SO2] and nitrogen \noxides [NOx]--created from the burning of fossil fuels--\nreact with water vapor in the atmosphere to create dilute amounts of \nsulfuric and nitric acid. These acids then fall to Earth either through \nprecipitation or as gases and dry particles--dry deposition. Congress \nfirst passed legislation to address acid rain in the 1982 Clean Air Act \namendments. It soon became clear, though, that the provisions would not \neffectively curb acid rain. The New York State Legislature in 1984 \nrecognized this problem and enacted programs leading to specific \nreductions of in-State acid rain sources. The success of those efforts \nhave produced a 40-percent reduction to date of in-State emissions of \nsulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.\n  New York's efforts notwithstanding, only a small amount of the acid \nrain that impacts New York State actually originates in New York State. \nTo truly protect New York's environment, it was necessary for \nfacilities in other parts of our Nation to reduce their emissions. \nPartly as a result of New York's efforts, Congress included title IV in \nthe 1990 Clean Air Act amendments to require a 50-percent decrease \nnationwide in sulfur dioxide emissions by the year 2000. Because of the \nrequirements of title IV, significant reductions in sulfur dioxide have \noccurred already. Nevertheless, these reductions are not enough to \nfully protect the Adirondacks, nor will they reverse the damage that \nhas been done. To do this, further decreases in sulfur dioxide \nemissions will be necessary.\n  Even with all the many efforts to date and those that need to be \nachieved in the future, reductions in sulfur dioxide alone will not be \nsufficient to protect New York's environment from continued acid \ndeposition. Other pollutants, mainly nitrogen oxides [NOx], \nhave also been shown to play a significant role in the acidification of \nour waters and forests. Without further controls of nitrogen oxides, \nthe EPA estimates that the number of acidic lakes in the Adirondacks \nwill increase to 43 percent by the year 2040. Such an increase will see \napproximately 1,300 lakes out of the 3,000 in the Adirondacks become \nchronically acidic. This is not the kind of legacy that we should pass \nalong to future generations.\n  Even with the controls that the Clean Air Act of 1990 imposed, more \nmust be done if the Adirondacks are to be spared further acidification. \nThis legislation will require the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] \nto promulgate regulations to reduce utility emissions of sulfur dioxide \nand nitrogen oxides by two-thirds from 1990 levels. This legislation \ntargets those areas of the Nation that are the primary contributors of \nthese pollutants. Such reductions will produce dramatic decreases \nin acid deposition in New York and throughout the Northeast, as well as \ndecreases in the level of fine particulates, ozone and haze.\n\n  The bill would also expand the membership of the existing Ozone \nTransport Commission from the current 12 States to include additional \nStates that have been shown to contribute to the long-range transport \nof ozone and acid rain. The Ozone Transport Commission is authorized \nunder the Clean Air Act to make recommendations for pollution controls \nto be enacted by member States. The EPA can either approve or \ndisapprove any recommendations. However, the EPA would have to provide \nequivalent alternatives in those cases\n\n[[Page S4286]]\n\nwhere it disapproves the recommendations.\n  Once enacted, this bill would require those States that contribute to \nacid rain pollution to implement control measures like those currently \nin place in New York and the Northeast. These include activities like \nscrubbers on smokestacks, low NOx burners, and the use of \nlow-sulfur coal, although the bill would not mandate which technology \nto use.\n  For some time now, New York has played by the rules and has gone the \nextra mile to reduce the emissions that cause acid rain within her \nborders. While I recognize that the reductions associated with title IV \nof the Clean Air Act will move us in the right direction, no amount of \neffort on the part of New York or other similarly afflicted States in \nthe Northeast can be effective if other parts of our Nation do not do \ntheir fair share. Enough is enough. I only ask for equity from our \nneighbors so that New York may be able to enjoy a cleaner environment \nand the resulting health benefits. It can be done.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 733\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Acid Deposition and Ozone \n     Control Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1)(A) reducing atmospheric nitrogen oxide will reduce \n     acidic deposition, and the serious adverse effects of acidic \n     deposition on public health, natural resources, building \n     structures, and ecosystems; and\n       (B) acidic deposition has been demonstrated to result in \n     increased morbidity in fish and severe damage to water bodies \n     and forest lands;\n       (2)(A) reducing atmospheric nitrogen oxide will provide \n     further benefits by decreasing ambient levels of tropospheric \n     ozone, fine particulate matter, and regional haze associated \n     with poor visibility; and\n       (B) such conditions have been demonstrated to result in \n     severe threats to public health, including lung irritation, \n     increased incidence of asthma and bronchitis, and increased \n     human morbidity;\n       (3)(A) nitrogen deposition into affected watersheds can \n     result in excessive nutrient enrichment leading to algal \n     blooms and increased biological oxygen demand; and\n       (B) such conditions can lead to increased morbidity in \n     marine life and severe degradation of economic and \n     recreational opportunities;\n       (4) additional reductions in sulfur dioxide beyond levels \n     currently required by the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et \n     seq.) will result in decreases in acidic deposition, regional \n     haze, and ambient levels of fine particulates;\n       (5) the allowance trading program established in the Clean \n     Air Act for the reduction of emissions of sulfur dioxide has \n     been highly effective at creating cost-effective control \n     measures;\n       (6) the technology exists to inexpensively reduce sulfur \n     dioxide emissions beyond the levels currently required by the \n     Clean Air Act;\n       (7) the ozone transport region established by the Clean Air \n     Act to reduce long-range transport of ozone does not \n     currently include all the States necessary to achieve the \n     intended reduction; and\n       (8) this Act shall support the Environmental Protection \n     Agency's stated objective of controlling ground level ozone \n     through regional controls, as developed by the Ozone \n     Transport Assessment Group and referred to in the January 10, \n     1997, advanced notice of proposed rulemaking for State \n     implementation plans under section 110(k)(5) of the Clean Air \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 7410(k)(5)).\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to recognize the scientific evidence that emissions of \n     nitrogen oxide present a substantial threat to public health \n     and the environment;\n       (2) to require reductions in the emission of nitrogen \n     oxide;\n       (3) to recognize that the means exist to cost-effectively \n     reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide beyond the levels \n     currently required by the Clean Air Act;\n       (4) to require reductions in the emission of sulfur \n     dioxide;\n       (5) to recognize that tropospheric ozone is a regional \n     problem;\n       (6) to recognize that the single ozone transport region \n     created by the Clean Air Act does not currently include all \n     the States necessary to adequately address the problem of \n     ozone; and\n       (7) to amend the Clean Air Act to expand the membership in \n     the ozone transport region by using the best currently \n     available science to include those States that contribute to \n     ozone levels in noncompliance areas within the current single \n     ozone transport region.\n\n     SEC. 3. CONTROL OF INTERSTATE OZONE AIR POLLUTION.\n\n       (a) Additional States.--Section 184(a) of the Clean Air Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 7511c(a)) is amended after the first sentence by \n     inserting the following: ``The Administrator, using the best \n     available science and models developed by the Ozone Transport \n     Assessment Group, shall add any State to the single ozone \n     transport region that contributed 4 parts per billion or more \n     to ozone via aerial transport to the ozone level of any \n     noncompliant area in the single ozone transport region for \n     any 1 of the second through tenth worst ozone days that \n     occurred during the previous 10 years.''.\n       (b) Control Measures.--Not later than 18 months after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, any control measure adopted \n     under section 184(a) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. \n     7511c(a)) before the date of enactment of this Act shall \n     apply to any State added to the single ozone transport region \n     under the second sentence of section 184(a) of the Clean Air \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 7511c(a)) after the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n\n     SEC. 4. ADDITIONAL NITROGEN OXIDE EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS.\n\n       Section 184 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7511c) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(e) Additional Emissions Reductions.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Not later than 18 months after the date \n     of enactment of this subsection, the Administrator shall \n     promulgate regulations requiring reductions in the emissions \n     of nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide in any State added to \n     the single ozone transport region under the second sentence \n     of subsection (a) to \\1/3\\ of the 1990 levels by the year \n     2003.\n       ``(2) Affected units.--The regulations shall apply to \n     affected units, as defined under section 402.\n       ``(3) Allowance program.--The Administrator may establish \n     an allowance trading program to carry out this subsection.\n       ``(4) Effect on other law.--This subsection shall not \n     affect any law (including regulations) that requires a \n     greater reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxide or sulfur \n     dioxide than is required by this subsection.''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/09/senate-section/article/S4285-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4286-S4287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                  S. 8\n\n  At the request of Mr. Smith, the names of the Senator from Indiana \n[Mr. Coats], the Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Faircloth], the \nSenator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], the Senator from Idaho [Mr. \nKempthorne], the Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe], the Senator from \nWyoming [Mr. Thomas], and the Senator from Utah [Mr. Bennett] were \nadded as cosponsors of S. 8, a bill to reauthorize and amend the \nComprehensive Environmental Response, Liability, and Compensation Act \nof 1980, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 25\n\n  At the request of Mr. Feingold, the name of the Senator from West \nVirginia [Mr. Byrd] was added as a cosponsor of S. 25, a bill to reform \nthe financing of Federal elections.\n\n\n                                 S. 293\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the name of the Senator from Indiana \n[Mr. Lugar] was added as a cosponsor of S. 293, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to make permanent the credit for clinical \ntesting expenses for certain drugs for rare diseases or conditions.\n\n\n                                 S. 422\n\n  At the request of Mr. Domenici, the names of the Senator from \nArkansas [Mr. Hutchinson] and the Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye] were \nadded as cosponsors of S. 422, a bill to define the circumstances under \nwhich DNA samples may be collected, stored, and analyzed, and genetic \ninformation may be collected, stored, analyzed, and disclosed, to \ndefine the rights of individuals and persons with respect to genetic \ninformation, to define the responsibilities of persons with respect to \ngenetic information, to protect individuals and families from genetic \ndiscrimination, to establish uniform rules that protect individual \ngenetic privacy, and to establish effective mechanisms to enforce the \nrights and responsibilities established under this Act.\n\n\n                                 S. 623\n\n  At the request of Mr. Inouye, the name of the Senator from Minnesota \n[Mr. Wellstone] was added as a cosponsor of S. 623, a bill to amend \ntitle 38, United States Code, to deem certain service in the organized \nmilitary forces of the Government of the Commonwealth of the \nPhilippines and the Philippine Scouts to have been active service for \npurposes of benefits under programs administered by the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs.\n\n\n                                 S. 713\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dodd, the names of the Senator from \nMassachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] and the Senator\n\n[[Page S4287]]\n\nfrom Maryland [Ms. Mikulski] were added as cosponsors of S. 713, a bill \nto amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to allow for \nadditional deferred effective dates for approval of applications under \nthe new drugs provisions, and for other purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/09/senate-section/article/S4286-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TAX FREEDOM DAY\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today is National Tax Freedom Day--\nthe day when families around the country finally start working for \nthemselves and not for the Government. For families in my home State of \nWashington, however, Tax Freedom Day does not come until May 14. In \nWashington State, families must work 5 additional days before the \nincome they earn can go to meet their own needs and not the \nGovernment's.\n  The residents of Washington State will bear the Nation's fifth \nhighest tax burden in 1997 with each man, woman, and child of the State \nowing $6,572 in Federal taxes. Add this with State and local taxes and \neach Washington citizen will owe $9,881 or almost 37 percent of the \naverage, annual income to support the Government .\n  It is no wonder today's families are feeling squeezed. It is no \nwonder more and more families must rely on dual incomes and parents \nmust work longer and longer hours. Families are paying more in taxes \ntoday than ever. They are now spending more just on taxes then they do \non food, clothing, shelter, and transportation combined.\n  This is not fairness. It is robbery.\n  Clearly, it is time for Congress to seriously reexamine our current \ntax system. As Betty Dursh from Spokane, WA, stated in her recent \nletter to me:\n\n       It is past time to reform the Tax Code. We are now in our \n     fifth year, hear this, our fifth year, of working almost half \n     the year before the taxes are paid. That is unconscionable! \n     It is wrong!\n\n  Yes, Ms. Dursh, it is wrong and it is far past the time for Congress \nto begin the work of reforming our tax system.\n  The budget agreement announced by the President and Congress 1 week \nago today gives me hope--hope that we can finally begin to put our \nfiscal house in order and provide some tax relief for the American \npeople. If our efforts are successful this summer and we are able to \nbegin the job of reforming some of our most oppressive taxes it will be \na good step. But it will only be the first, small step in the direction \nof the real reform we need--reform that will, at last, provide us with \na tax system that respects the right of American's to keep their \nearnings and investments. This will require much more than one or two \nchanges to the volumes of provisions in the Tax Code, however. It will \nrequire a complete examination and, eventually, overhaul of the entire \nsystem.\n  I want to leave my colleagues with one final thought--the words of a \n52-year-old woman from Marysville, WA who lost both her husband and her \njob this past year and who is unable to sell her home to make ends meet \nbecause she would be required to give the Government 40 percent of the \nproceeds of the sale in capital gains tax. Ms. Linda Blasengame has \nthis message for all of us here in Congress:\n\n       I have lost so much and have always fought back but I can't \n     imagine the pain of having to lose my dignity too. Please, \n     look inside your heart and help me and so many others that \n     are in my shoes. . . . I don't need a handout, I need your \n     help.\n\n  Congress must heed the cries for help from people like Ms. Blasengame \nand we must respond to the outrage of people like Ms. Dursh. The \nAmerican people are slowly losing patience with our bandaid approaches. \nAmericans overwhelming want a fairer and simpler tax system. They \ndeserve this and they are relying on us to work toward this \nend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/09/senate-section/article/S4287-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4287-S4289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             MURRAY KEMPTON\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on Monday of last week, Murray \nKempton died. With his passing, we mark the end of a legend in New \nYork, and in American journalism. Kempton was the kindest man and \ntoughest reporter we have known in our time. A certain incandescent \nsweetness now departs. Yet his memory and, yes, his legacy remain.\n  The Daily News' columnist Sidney Zion captured Kempton's unique \nability and thus legacy when Zion wrote: ``Kempton used his power to \ncondemn, but loved his right to absolve. And when he absolved the \nsinner, he owned the territory.''\n  This was Kempton's singular power. With characteristic flair, Kempton \nwould challenge corruption with voracity. Then instead of reveling in \nvictory, would show compassion for the humans beneath the deeds and \nabsolve the sins of some of the greatest losers in New York's history. \nCarmine DeSapio, Alger Hiss, Carmine Persico, Roy Cohn. Such was the \npower of the words which Kempton wielded.\n  When the reformers in the City had finally overcome DeSapio, one of \nthe great Tammany bosses, Kempton wrote, as only he could: ``The age of \nPericles had begun because we were rid of Carmine DeSapio. One had to \nwalk carefully to avoid being stabbed by the lilies bursting in the \npavements. I wish the reformers luck--with less Christian sincerity \nthan Carmine DeSapio does. I will be a long time forgiving them on this \none.'' Kempton felt sympathy and respect even for the rogue. He stood \nup for the loser whether it was Carmine DeSapio, a deposed dictator, or \na shunned local New Yorker.\n  J. Edgar Hoover once called Mr. Kempton a snake and a rat. From one \nwho was once referred to by Mr. Hoover as a skunk, I take pride in \nknowing that my work was seen in the same light as Kempton's. But I \nfear no one else has what the Washington Post called, ``[Kempton's] \nskeptical sympathy'' required to continue his work.\n  The Age of Kempton is over. Budding writers would do well to re-read \nand emulate his work; public figures continue to thank and rue the day \nKempton chose them to be subject of his column; and for we who knew \nhim, only sorrow bursts through the cracks in our hearts today.\n  I ask that the following articles about Murray Kempton be printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n\n                 [From the New York Post, May 9, 1997]\n\n              Kempton's Funeral Is a Lesson in Simplicity\n\n                      (By Christopher Francescani)\n\n       Even in death, Murray Kempton's disarming humility ruled \n     the day.\n       There were no eulogies at the legendary columnist's simple \n     Upper West Side funeral yesterday, although hundreds of the \n     city's greatest literary, political and newspaper voices were \n     on hand.\n       There were no limousines, although Kempton was considered \n     royalty among the city's press corps.\n       And there were no gaudy floral tributes, only small bursts \n     of potted cherry blossoms, Casablanca lilies and white \n     azaleas perched unassumingly on the altar.\n       But the Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist, who sounded off \n     for decades on every aspect of the city he loved, was \n     remembered--and remembered well.\n       ``The funeral was pure Murray,'' Post columnist Jack \n     Newfield said. ``His manner, his grace, his kindliness, his \n     humility beyond self-effacement. He was the benchmark.''\n       Kempton, 79, whose gentle elegance and amusing \n     eccentricities won him the respect of virtually all of his \n     ``fellow workers,'' died Monday at a Manhattan nursing home.\n       In a note written in 1989, entitled, ``My Funeral,'' he'd \n     requested a brief ceremony with no eulogies. His body was \n     cremated earlier this week.\n       ``He chose a simple ceremony in the classic Anglican \n     manner, which focuses on God's love and the equality of all \n     persons in the face of death,'' said the Rev. Gaylord \n     Hitchcock of the Church of St. Ignatius of Antioch.\n       ``His [funeral] runs against the grain of most American \n     funerals, where the Mass turns into a celebration of the \n     person.''\n       Kempton, known among his colleagues as much for his \n     intricate sentence structure as for riding his three-speed \n     bicycle to news events--jazz humming through his headphones--\n     spent most of his 55-year career at the New York Post and \n     Newsday.\n       The Baltimore-born scribe, who once ran copy for H.L. \n     Mencken, won a Pulitzer for commentary in 1985.\n       The pews of the tiny Gothic-style church where Kempton \n     worshiped for decades were filled to capacity 30 minutes \n     before the ceremony began.\n       William F. Buckley Jr. and Mayor Giuliani pressed their way \n     through the crowd. Writer Nora Ephron sat pensively in a rear \n     pew as the church bell rang out 79 times, once for each year \n     of Kempton's life.\n       Columnist Jimmy Breslin, Post editor Ken Chandler, Daily \n     News editor Pete Hamill, writers Kurt Vonnegut, Phillip Roth \n     and Calvin Trillin, and cartoonist Jules Feiffer were there--\n     as were former Mayor David Dinkins, Manhattan Borough \n     President Ruth Messinger and hosts of other dignitaries.\n       Off to the side of the altar, a choir clad in black sung \n     hymns softly in Latin.\n       Some of Kempton's favorite passages from the Bible took the \n     place of speeches.\n       Instead, eulogies were whispered between pews and among the \n     crowd of mourners outside the chapel.\n\n[[Page S4288]]\n\n       ``He was the last great gentleman poet,'' said Post \n     columinist Liz Smith.\n       Writer David Halberstam said,\n       ``I'll miss meeting him on the street, and having the \n     choice of talking about the Knicks, the mayor, the Clintons, \n     anything. He was great fun on every subject.''\n       ``He was the soul of kindness,'' said WCBS Radio reporter \n     Irene Cornell.\n       New York Post managing editor Marc Kalech edited Kempton's \n     copy in the late 1970s, when the columnist worked at The \n     Post.\n       ``Editing Kempton was like editing Shakespeare,'' Kalech \n     said. ``You'd read it, you'd struggle to understand it, and \n     then you wouldn't touch it.''\n       But perhaps the greatest tribute to one of New York's \n     greatest columnists came from someone who never met Kempton.\n       ``I'm just a reader,'' explained Ray Belsky, a retired \n     health-care consultant who sat alone in the back of the \n     church.\n       ``He touched me with his integrity. There was a courtliness \n     about everything he wrote. Even when he wrote about common \n     men, and common problems, he gave them the dignity they \n     deserved.\n       ``I never met him. I just admired him and I read him . . . \n     every day.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                   [From the Daily News, May 8, 1997]\n\n                   Murray Kempton Was No Paper Saint\n\n                            (By Sidney Zion)\n\n       I left the courtroom for the newsroom 35 years ago by \n     parodying Murray Kempton, and if I were true to his newly \n     minted ghost, I'd slip this fact into a fog bank somewhere \n     around midstream in this piece.\n       But every journalist who got a nod from Kempton became his \n     memorialist before I could get a word in edgewise, given the \n     tyranny of column calendars. He died Monday, and here it is \n     Thursday, so I play my credentials on top.\n       In December 1962 the New York newspapers were in the throes \n     of their longest strike. Victor Navasky, today the publisher \n     of The Nation, decided to put out a parody of the New York \n     Post, and he asked me to do Kempton. I was an assistant U.S. \n     attorney in New Jersey, but Navasky knew I was a Kempton \n     buff.\n       I wrote the column, and the next thing I knew I was being \n     pursued by the Post. I took a leave of absence from the \n     Justice Department and never got back to court.\n       Murray was bemused. He thought I was more than a little \n     crazy for this move, but I insist that it establishes me as \n     his true short biographer. Who else changed his profession, \n     his life, because of Kempton?\n       And I say that he wouldn't like the canonization that \n     greeted his death. Nothing bothered him more than good \n     intentions, so I feel free to patronize those who \n     sentimentalized him as the patron saint of the losers of the \n     world.\n       The losers' dressing room was indeed his locker, but only \n     because there were winners. He used his power to condemn, but \n     loved his right to absolve. And when he absolved the sinner, \n     he owned the territory.\n       Carmine DeSapio, Alger Hiss, Carmine Persico, Roy Cohn--all \n     cases in point.\n       Every phone call I received upon Kempton's death from old \n     pals mentioned first his great column on DeSapio the day the \n     Village reformers destroyed the Tammany boss.\n       Kempton had been in the forefront on the reform movement, \n     but when DeSapio was beaten, he wrote: ``The Age of Pericles \n     had begun because we were rid of Carmine DeSapio. One had to \n     walk carefully to avoid being stabbed by the lilies bursting \n     in the pavements. I wish the reformers luck--with less \n     Christian sincerity than Carmine DeSapio does. I will be a \n     long time forgiving them this one.''\n       This column drove the Village reformers crazy. But it was \n     classic, and Kempton repeated the theme until his death. Let \n     anyone else praise DeSapio, and Murray would have at him. He \n     knew why DeSapio was a dignified loser, but if you said so, \n     watch out.\n       The same with Hiss, and then some. Murray knew Hiss was \n     guilty because like Hiss, Kempton was a shabby-genteel \n     Gentile out of Baltimore--and a former Communist. (Everybody \n     I knew, Jew or Gentile, assumed Murray was a Jew--who knew \n     his first name was James?--and he wrote for the then-liberal-\n     Jewish New York Post.)\n       But Kempton had no time for the right-wing attackers of \n     Hiss. Hiss was his, and the rest were know-nothings.\n       None of this came to me until the day Murray ran into me on \n     Broadway and said he had attacked my book on Cohn. Always the \n     gentleman, Kempton said: ``Don't worry, I put it in a paper \n     that nobody will read.''\n       I said, ``But you were at every party for Roy, and with a \n     better table than I had.''\n       Murray cringed, and in that cringe I recognized that only \n     he could absolve the sinner. I had crossed over the line and \n     had to be punished.\n       He was the best there was in his time, don't get me wrong. \n     But he was the best because he was sly, he knew everything \n     about everybody, and only when he didn't want you to know it \n     he ran into fog banks, each one chartered by Kempton out of \n     Henry James.\n       And he was always ``cosmic,'' despite his denials. Murray \n     Kempton knew the cosmos and played it every time, whether \n     with Adlai Stevenson or John Gotti. They bury him today. He \n     smiles at the Maker, and vice versa.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                      [From Newsday, May 6, 1997]\n\n    ``One of a Kind''--Murray Kempton Dies; ``Kindest Man, Toughest \n                               Reporter''\n\n                           (By Fred Bruning)\n\n       Murray Kempton, the erudite, pipe-smoking scribe whose \n     penetrating intellect made complicated issues seem simple and \n     whose audacious sentences made the English language more \n     joyously complex, died yesterday at the Kateri Residence, a \n     skilled nursing facility in Manhattan. Kempton was 79.\n       A son, Arthur Kempton, 48, said his father died at 4:40 \n     a.m., apparently of heart failure.\n       In January, Kempton, a columnist at Newsday since 1981, was \n     diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, his son said. Kempton \n     recently underwent surgery and was being treated by \n     physicians at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in \n     Manhattan.\n       Kempton's death prompted expressions of sympathy from a \n     multitude of admirers--President Bill Clinton among them.\n       ``Hillary and I were deeply saddened today to learn of the \n     death of Murray Kempton,'' Clinton said in a statement. \n     ``Murray's reporting during his illustrious 45 years in \n     journalism was marked by courage, honesty and compassion. He \n     represented the very finest of his profession and we will all \n     miss him.''\n       Kempton covered the campaign of Republican challenger \n     Robert Dole last year. Yesterday, Dole mourned Kempton. \n     ``Murray is a longtime friend,'' Dole said. ``I enjoyed his \n     presence on the campaign plane. He will be greatly missed by \n     friends and family and his objective voice will be missed in \n     the world of journalism.''\n       Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) said of Kempton: ``He \n     was the kindest man and toughest reporter we have known in \n     our time. A certain incandescent sweetness now departs.''\n       Newsday publisher Raymond Jansen said Kempton's absence \n     from the paper represented a major loss. ``We certainly are \n     going to be poorer for his not appearing in our pages any \n     longer,'' Jansen said. ``He was unique. That term so many \n     times applies to people who really aren't, but in this case \n     he was truly one of a kind.''\n       Jansen said Times Mirror of Los Angeles, Newsday's parent \n     company, was to have presented Kempton with its Special \n     Distinction Award tomorrow in recognition of achievements \n     ``epitomizing the very top of his field.''\n       For colleagues at Newsday, and for thousands of devoted \n     readers in New York and elsewhere, it will be difficult to \n     imagine a world without the wry, unyielding Murray Kempton to \n     help sort out the daunting issues of the day.\n       His last columns, published in January, were typically \n     eclectic--the pieces dealt with Presidential politics, bad \n     cops and corporate greed--and resonated with trumpet blasts \n     of the brash but sophisticated voice that Kempton had \n     cultivated over a half-century.\n       Writing about a woman who was suing the manufacturer of \n     artificial breast implants, Kempton said: ``Her case, whether \n     won or lost, will likely pass unremarked, because we are \n     already satiated with reminders that American corporations \n     are fixedly future-blind in engagements with the welfare of \n     their customers and for that matter of themselves.''\n       The paragraph was vintage Kempton--insightful, challenging, \n     artfully obtuse. In characteristic fashion, Kempton was \n     gleefully standing newspaper convention on its head by taking \n     the longest, not the shortest, path between two points. Aware \n     that his prose was viewed by some as unorthodox and \n     difficult, Kempton joked that he likely never would be \n     successfully sued for libel because no judge or jury would be \n     able to untangle his sentences.\n       Kempton could afford to be self-effacing. He knew that many \n     considered him a master of contemporary letters, a reporter \n     who took the journalistic form about as far as it could go, a \n     rare breed who found a way to survive as much on his powers \n     of analysis and abstraction as the assorted facts scribbled \n     in his notebook.\n       ``He was like one of those comets hurtling past,'' said Les \n     Payne, a News Day assistant managing editor and a long-time \n     friend of Kempton.'' We will not likely see his kind again.''\n       In addition to the admiration of fans and co-workers, \n     Kempton earned the esteem of the publishing establishment. He \n     won a Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 1985 and twice took \n     the respected George Polk Award. His book ``The Briar Patch'' \n     won the National Book Award for contemporary affairs in 1974, \n     as well as a number of other honors. Among his most cherished \n     was a 1987 Grammy from the National Academy of Recording Arts \n     for liner notes accompanying the album, ``Sinatra--\n     Standards.''\n       Though he wrote regularly for News Day, Kempton contributed \n     to a wide range of publications. Over the years, his work \n     appeared in Esquire, Playboy, Commonweal, Life, Harper's, and \n     Atlantic Monthly.\n       He published four books. The last ``Rebellions, \n     Perversities, and Main Events,'' released in 1994, was \n     dedicated to his old pal, William F. Buckley Jr. The \n     conservative stance of Buckley, editor of the National \n     Review, did nothing to discourage Kempton, whose politics \n     strayed in another direction.\n       Kempton enjoyed persons who held contrary views and, in \n     turn, was revered by Americans of many persuasions. ``Murray \n     set a high journalistic standard,'' Sen. Alfonse\n\n[[Page S4289]]\n\n     D'Amato (R-N.Y.) said, ``He was tough, but fair.''\n       Since a young man, James Murray Kempton prepared himself to \n     move easily among the American throng--as attentive to the \n     struggles of the ordinary citizen as the maneuverings of the \n     rich and powerful.\n       He was born in Baltimore on Dec. 16, 1917, and, as a young \n     man, became a devoted reader of the Baltimore Evening Sun--\n     and particularly of the Sun's iconoclastic essayist H.L. \n     Mencken. Drawn to newspaper work, Kempton found a job at the \n     Sun, attending his first national convention as a copy boy \n     for Mencken, his hero.\n       After graduation from Johns Hopkins University, Kempton \n     followed his leftist political instincts. He worked as a \n     labor organizer, wrote for the Young People's Socialist \n     League and the American Labor Party. Even in later years as a \n     reporter, Kempton played off his lefty background by greeting \n     colleagues as ``fellow workers.''\n       In 1942, Kempton joined the New York Post as a reporter but \n     with World War II intensifying, soon enlisted in the Air \n     Force.\n       During a three year hitch, Kempton served in New Guinea and \n     the Philippines. He once noted that he was assigned to a unit \n     called the Cyclone Division. ``They call it the Cyclone \n     Division because all its tents got blown down on maneuvers,'' \n     said Kempton. ``That's how it is with my team every time.''\n       After the war, Kempton returned to New York and began his \n     writing career in earnest. He worked again for the Post and \n     then a succession of other publications--New Republic \n     magazine, New York World Telegram, New York Review of Books. \n     He taught journalism at Hunter College and ``political \n     journalism'' at the Eagleton Institute at Rutgers University.\n       While covering the civil rights movement for the Post in \n     1961, Kempton showed his wily instincts. Freedom Riders were \n     traveling by bus through the South to illustrate how blacks \n     were denied access to public accommodations. There had been \n     violence along the way, and likely, there would be more. In \n     Montgomery, Ala., journalists were told a busload of Freedom \n     Riders were heading out at 7 a.m. Other reporters piled into \n     cars to follow the bus. Kempton went them one better--he \n     bought himself a ticket that allowed him on the bus.\n       ``He wrote a helluva story,'' said Michael Dorman, who \n     covered the Freedom Rides. ``It was a master stroke to buy \n     that ticket--and just the sort of thing Murray would do.''\n       At Newsday, Kempton's reputation preceded him but the new \n     man--a star by any measure--proved affable and without the \n     aura of celebrity.\n       Working out of the now defunct New York Newsday, Kempton \n     looked like an aging Ivy Leaguer--shirt and tie, natty suit \n     well-pressed--but had a gift for gab and generous nature that \n     neatly undercut his formal bearing. He loved jazz and the \n     blues and, as if that weren't enough to cement his man-of-\n     the-people reputation, Kempton traveled to the office by \n     bicycle. Murray Kempton couldn't drive.\n       On his 75th birthday, Kempton got a plant from a fan--the \n     wife of alleged mobster Carmine Persico, about whom Kempton \n     had written. Kempton said he had no talent for horticulture \n     and gave the plant, an amaryllis, to staff member Anthony \n     Destefano. The amaryllis thrived, but never flowered until \n     this spring, Destefano said, when it bloomed red, and bright.\n       By then, Kempton was seriously ill and his own brilliant \n     season almost through. But even feeling poorly, Kempton kept \n     his edge. Spencer Rumsey, a Newsday editor who checked \n     Kempton's columns, said that Kempton told him he likely got \n     sick because New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani kicked the Mafia \n     out of the Fulton Fish Market. ``When the mob was in charge, \n     you could always count on safe fish,'' Kempton said.\n       It was Kempton as Kempton would want to be remembered--\n     sassy, sardonic and unexpected. ``He represented the very \n     best that there is in this business,'' said Newsday Editor \n     Tony Marro. ``It was our great good fortune to have him as a \n     colleague and mentor, and we'll miss him terribly.''\n       Kempton is survived by three sons, Arthur, of \n     Massachusetts; David, of Fallsburg, N.Y. and Christopher, of \n     New York; and a daughter, Durgananda, also of Fallsburg. His \n     first wife, Mina, lives in Princeton, M.J. His second wife, \n     Beverly, died last year. A son, Murray Jr., died in an auto \n     accident in 1971. Kempton also leaves a companion, Barbara \n     Epstein.\n       A funeral is set for 11 a.m. Thursday at St. Ignatius \n     Episcopal Church, 552 West End Avenue, New York.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n             [From the New York Post, Tuesday, May 6, 1997]\n\n                       Murray Kempton (1917-1997)\n\n       Murray Kempton, who died yesterday at 79, was one of the \n     mainstays of New York journalism. For more than half a \n     century--most of that time here at The Post--he brought to \n     his craft a unique perspective that made him a legend.\n       Though his famously wordy style could be dizzying, Kempton \n     had a reputation as a master phrasemaker. A congressman once \n     said that ``Sometimes I can't understand what he's saying, \n     but the end effect is enormous.''\n       Kemption never thought of himself as an oracle, but rather \n     as an observer. He was attracted to society's rogues and \n     underdogs and made an art form out of covering criminal \n     trials.\n       He described himself as a Normal Thomas Socialist--but he \n     avoided political orthodoxies of any stripe and believed \n     journalists should not wear labels.\n       ``The trouble with thinking of yourself as a liberal or a \n     conservative,'' Kempton once wrote, ``is the danger that you \n     might unwittingly die to preserve an unconscious image. It's \n     not the reporter's responsibility to lie for a political \n     party, no matter what it is.''\n       Such attitudes might explain the esteem in which Kempton \n     was held by ideological friends and foes alike. When Kempton \n     won a Pulitzer Prize in 1985, George Will proclaimed him \n     ``the class of our class.'' William F. Buckley, Jr., even \n     while chiding his good friend's political naivete added: ``As \n     a columnist, Murray Kempton is the noblest of us all.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                   [From the Daily News, May 6, 1997]\n\n                             One of a Kind\n\n       The death of columnist Murray Kempton will provide over the \n     coming days an outpouring of praise and affection from the \n     journalistic community. And not a few anecdotes aiming to \n     capture Kempton's huge talent and equal heart.\n       What is remarkable is that all the best eulogies will have \n     the distinct advantage of being true. Kempton was a giant, a \n     man whose contributions to his craft, his city and his \n     country were unique to his generation. To say he will be \n     missed doesn't begin to capture the void he leaves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/09/senate-section/article/S4287-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL ARSON AWARENESS WEEK\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the \nend of a significant week in our Nation. May 4 through May 10 was \nNational Arson Awareness Week around the country. This year's theme was \n``Target Arson.'' The Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA], along \nwith local law enforcement officers, firefighters, and teachers chose a \ntremendously important and vulnerable group close to my heart for \nspecial emphasis in their crusade to promote safety and crime \nprevention--children. Their mission was and is to educate children on \nthe dangers of fire by asking parents to control their children's \naccess to matches and cigarette lights, and asking all adults to set a \ngood example for our Nation's youth.\n  Arson affects all Americans. It accounts for more than 700,000 deaths \nnationwide and causes more than $2 billion worth of property damage. \nThe cost to the community as a whole is great when we consider that the \ntaxpayer must foot the expenses for the fire, police, and medical \npersonnel who are needed when a fire occurs, and not to mention the \nlosses to a community when a church, business, or home is destroyed. \nThat is why it is imperative that we work together to prevent arson \nfrom destroying another community, and most important, another life.\n  Today I commend FEMA and communities across the country for their \nlaudable efforts in raising awareness about the tragic consequences of \narson and its devastating effect on our communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/09/senate-section/article/S4289-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR MONDAY, MAY 12, 1997\n\n  Mr. DeWINE.
