Mr. President, I will be on the floor at 11 o'clock \nwith an amendment to the ISTEA legislation, but let me pick up on \ncomments I made yesterday on the floor of the Senate about a resolution \nthat Senator Mack from Florida and I have submitted dealing with the \nwhole question of human rights in China.\n  There is an editorial today in the Washington Post--and I think it is \na very important editorial--called ``A Choice on China.'' I ask \nunanimous consent to have that printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                           A Choice on China\n\n       The Clinton administration long ago abandoned human rights \n     as a primary consideration in dealing with China, but it \n     claimed an intention at least to continue speaking out on the \n     issue. The substance of U.S.-China relations--in other words, \n     trade, military contacts, high-level summits--would go \n     forward no matter what abuses China's leaders committed \n     against their own people, but the United States would, in \n     Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's famous phrase, ``tell \n     it like it is'' nonetheless. Now, however, it\n\n[[Page S1216]]\n\n     seems the administration may sacrifice even truth-telling so \n     as not to offend China's Communist regime.\n       The immediate issue is whether to sponsor a resolution at \n     the United Nations Commission on Human Rights when it \n     convenes in Geneva next month. You wouldn't think this would \n     be a tough call. Such a resolution would moderately criticize \n     China's record and call for improvements; it would impose no \n     penalty beyond well-deserved embarrassment. Democracy \n     advocate Wei Jingsheng nevertheless calls the resolution ``a \n     matter of life and death'' for reform in China. President \n     Clinton explicitly promised, back when he delinked trade and \n     human rights in 1994, that the administration ``would step up \n     its efforts'' to get such a resolution approved. China's \n     regime remains as oppressive today as it was then.\n       That much is clear, in fact, from the State Department's \n     own human rights report, which--despite a touch of whitewash \n     this year--does mostly tell it like it is, painting a dismal \n     picture of China's ``widespread and well-documented human \n     rights abuses.'' These include torture, extrajudicial \n     killings, arbitrary arrest and detention, forced abortion and \n     sterilization, crackdowns on independent Catholic and \n     Protestant bishops and believers, brutal oppression of ethnic \n     minorities and religion in Tibet and Xinjiang and, of course, \n     absolute intolerance of free political speech or free press. \n     Just this month, the FBI arrested two Chinese citizens for \n     allegedly marketing human organs harvested from some of the \n     6,000 prisoners China executes each year. If prisoners are \n     being killed in order to provide organs, it ``would be among \n     the grossest violations of human rights imaginable,'' Stanley \n     O. Roth, assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs, \n     said last summer.\n       Yet from Mr. Clinton, still no word on plans for Geneva. \n     Last year the administration similarly dithered and delayed, \n     eventually hiding behind tiny Denmark, which sponsored a \n     resolution. China responded, with grace matching America's \n     courage, by warning that the human rights resolution would \n     ``become a rock that smashes on the Danish government's \n     head.'' This year, while the administration again has been \n     unable to make up its mind, the entire European Union opted \n     out, cravenly vowing not to co-sponsor any resolution. The EU \n     then cited a series of inadequate ``benchmarks'' to measure \n     future Chinese progress in the human rights field, such as \n     that the visit of the U.N. human rights commissioner to China \n     ``should be taken seriously by the Chinese leadership.''\n       It may be too late now for the United States to rally a \n     coalition of countries that would guarantee a fair hearing \n     for a resolution on China, but it is not too late for Mr. \n     Clinton to support such a measure nonetheless. He can still \n     send a message that America supports, or at least sympathizes \n     with, the fighters for freedom inside China; alternatively, \n     he can send a message that his friendship with their \n     oppressors is too important to put at risk with any impolite \n     words. For someone who hopes to become this year the first \n     president to visit China since the massacre at Tiananmen \n     Square, this should be an easy choice.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the immediate issue, as the Post \neditorial points out, is whether or not the United States is going to \nsponsor a resolution at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights gathering \nin Geneva, which is going to be coming up, I think, this month, or \nmaybe at the beginning of next month, but within a very short period of \ntime.\n  I had a chance to meet with Wei Jingsheng who wrote a wonderful book \ncalled ``The Courage to Stand Alone.'' He spent many years in prison in \nChina, I think 16 years, for his courage to speak out. He has made it \nvery clear, and I quote the Post editorial, that the resolution is `` \n`a matter of life and death' for reform in China. President Clinton \nexplicitly promised, back when he delinked trade and human rights in \n1994, that the administration `would step up its efforts' to get such a \nresolution approved.''\n  Mr. President, China remains as oppressive today as it was a few \nshort years ago. I want colleagues to know that this is a separate \nquestion from whether or not you were in favor of most-favored-nation \nstatus for China. Some people believe trade policy is too blunt an \ninstrument to be focused on human rights. Others do not. I do not share \nthat sentiment. Regardless, let me repeat for colleagues what we know.\n  The State Department's own human rights report, which has been \nsomewhat controversial because some think it is a bit of a whitewash \nthis year, still nevertheless paints a dismal picture of China's \n``widespread and well-documented human rights abuses'':\n\n       These include torture, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary \n     arrest and detention, forced abortion and sterilization, \n     crackdowns on independent Catholic and Protestant bishops and \n     believers, brutal oppression of ethnic minorities and \n     religions in [countries like] Tibet . . .\n\n  And the list goes on.\n\n       Just this month, the FBI arrested two Chinese citizens for \n     allegedly marketing human organs harvested from some of the \n     6,000 prisoners China executes each year. If prisoners are \n     being killed in order to provide organs, it ``would be among \n     the grossest violations of human rights imaginable,'' Stanley \n     O. Roth, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs, \n     said last summer.\n\n  We haven't yet heard from the White House as to whether or not they \nare going to be sponsoring a resolution which would raise all of these \nquestions. I think this is a commitment we have made as a country.\n  Let me conclude by reading the last paragraph of this Post editorial:\n\n       It may be too late now for the United States to rally a \n     coalition of countries that would guarantee a fair hearing \n     for a resolution on China, but it is not too late for Mr. \n     Clinton to support such a measure nevertheless. He can still \n     send a message that America supports, or at least sympathizes \n     with, the fighters for freedom inside China; alternatively, \n     he can send a message that his friendship with their \n     oppressors is too important to put at risk with any impolite \n     words. For someone who hopes to become this year the first \n     president to visit China since the massacre at Tiananmen \n     Square, this should be an easy choice.\n\n  The resolution that Senator Mack and I submitted yesterday calls on \nthe President to move forward with this resolution at the U.N. \nCommission on Human Rights, which is going to be meeting in Geneva. My \nunderstanding was that we were going to mark up this resolution in the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee today, but one Senator on the \ncommittee has basically blocked that and has exercised his prerogative \nso we won't be able to mark it up in committee.\n  I want to make it clear to colleagues that I have every intention--\nand I hope I will be joined by other Senators--of bringing this \nresolution to the floor as an amendment on a bill, probably the ISTEA \nbill. I will wait and see and work, of course, very closely with my \ncolleague Senator Mack.\n  It is extremely important that the U.S. Senate go on \nrecord supporting a resolution passed by this U.N. Commission on Human \nRights at its meeting in Geneva. Sometimes I get the feeling that when \nI speak on the floor of the Senate--in a few minutes we will have a \ndebate, there will be more people here--but when I am on the floor of \nthe Senate and speaking about something like this, I sometimes get the \nfeeling it is unimportant. It is not unimportant. When Wei Jingsheng \nwho spent all those years in prison, when Harry Wu, and others, who \nhave given up years of their life because of their courage to speak up \nfor just basic human rights, call on us in the U.S. Senate, ``Won't you \nplease at least adopt a resolution''--I guess it is going to have to be \nan amendment now--``which really calls on the President and your \ncountry to take leadership at this U.N. Commission on Human Rights and \nhave some criticism of what has been going on in China, the torture of \npeople, the execution of people, the imprisonment of people just for \nspeaking up, the persecution of religious groups, won't you at least do \nthat,'' I am telling you, when I get a request from someone like Wei \nJingsheng, who I think is a giant, then I am certainly going to follow \nthrough on it.\n\n  I believe that in the U.S. Senate there will be overwhelming support \nfor this resolution, which I think now will be an amendment since we \nhave been blocked from being able to mark it up in the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee.\n  I guess I will say to colleagues, if you don't agree that our country \nat the very least ought to be speaking up on these human rights \nquestions and supporting people like Wei Jingsheng, that that is at \nleast the minimum we can do at this very important U.N. Commission on \nHuman Rights, then you can come to the floor of the Senate and you can \ndebate it.\n  From my own point of view, one Senator, who happens to be my \ncolleague from Minnesota who doesn't agree and is not going to let this \ngo forward on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I would be \npleased to debate him and other Senators as well. But my hope is that \nwe will have overwhelming support for this.\n  Again, this doesn't say you are for or against most-favored-nation \nstatus. This doesn't say you are for or against assistance for IMF or \nnot. This is not\n\n[[Page S1217]]\n\nabout GATT. This is not about NAFTA. This is about something else which \nwe ought to have a consensus on, which is, at this upcoming meeting in \nGeneva--I think our Government has given people in China every reason \nto believe that we would--and I guess I will quote Secretary of State \nMadeleine Albright's famous phrase, ``Tell it like it is.'' We ought to \ntell it like it is. We ought to tell it like it is. The Post editorial \nis right on the mark, we ought to do it at this very important meeting \nof the U.N. Commission on Human Rights. That is the time for the United \nStates to speak out.\n  Silence is betrayal, and our country must not be silent in the face \nof these kinds of abuses of elementary human rights of citizens in \nChina and, for that matter, in other countries as well.\n  I hope that I will be doing this on the floor with Senator Mack. I \ncertainly am going to be bringing an amendment to the floor. We have to \nhave a vote on this. I can't let one Senator block a committee from \nmarking up this bill and then have it delayed a month, which will be \ntoo late for this U.N. Commission on Human Rights. We will take action \non it before the Senate. I hope we get 98, 99 Senators voting in favor \nof it. It is the least we can do.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/03/senate-section/article/S1215-6", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL SPORTSMANSHIP DAY\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today is the eighth annual National \nSportsmanship Day--a day designated to promote ethics, integrity, and \ncharacter in athletics. I am pleased to say that National Sportsmanship \nDay was a creation of Mr. Daniel E. Doyle, Jr., Executive Director of \nthe Institute for International Sport at the University of Rhode \nIsland. Participation this year will include over 10,000 schools in all \n50 states and more than 100 countries.\n  Today, the Institute is holding a day-long town meeting in which \nathletes, coaches, journalists, students, and educators are engaged in \nan in-depth discussion of racial issues in sports. I believe that the \nInstitute's work in addressing the issues of character and \nsportsmanship, and its ability to foster good dialogue among our young \npeople is significant.\n  As part of the Day's celebration, the Institute selects Sports Ethics \nFellows who have demonstrated ``highly ethical behavior in athletics \nand society.'' Past recipients have included: Kirby Puckett, former \nMinnesota Twins outfielder and 10-time All Star; Joan Benoit Samuelson, \ngold medalist in the first women's Olympic marathon in 1984; and Joe \nPaterno, longtime head football coach at Penn State University. This \nyear, the Institute will honor over 15 individuals including Mills \nLane, district court judge of Reno, Nevada and internationally known \nprofessional boxing referee; Bud Greenspan, renowned Olympic \ncinematographer; Billy Packer, CBS sports commentator; and Ken Dryden, \npresident and general manager, Toronto Maple Leafs.\n  Another key component of National Sportsmanship Day is the Student-\nAthlete Outreach Program. This program encourages high schools and \ncolleges to send talented student-athletes to local elementary and \nmiddle schools to promote good sportsmanship and serve as positive role \nmodels. These students help young people build self-esteem, respect for \nphysical fitness, and an appreciation for the value of teamwork.\n  If all those activities were not enough, the Institute has found \nanother avenue to promote understanding and good character for \nyoungsters. A new program called Renaissance Education was instituted \nin 1996 to expose students to the foundations of ``total education.'' \nThe Renaissance Education concept gives students the opportunity to \ncontribute to a team effort and profit from the benefits of team \nparticipation. To kick-off this program, the Institute will host its \nfirst-ever Renaissance Games in April where students will participate \nin sports, leisure, cultural, and academic activities such as: \nbasketball, volleyball, photography, public speaking, creative writing, \nchess, board games, spelling bees, and library research.\n  I remain very proud that National Sportsmanship Day was initiated in \nRhode Island, and I applaud the students and teachers who are \nparticipating in the events of this inspiring day. Likewise, I \ncongratulate all of those at the University of Rhode Island's Institute \nfor International Sport, whose hard work and dedication over the last \neight years have made this program so successful.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that S. 1173 will be the matter \nbefore the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/03/senate-section/article/S1217-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In determining economic self-\n     sufficiency, the Secretary shall consider--\n       ``(A) the number and percentage of such recipients that \n     are, as of the date of the assessment, employed;\n       ``(B) the number and percentage of such recipients earning \n     incomes at or above 150 percent of the poverty line (as \n     defined in section 673(2) of the Community Services Block\n\n[[Page S1218]]\n\n     Grant Act (42 U.S.C. 9902(2)), including any revision \n     required by such section for a family of the size involved); \n     and\n       ``(C) the number and percentage of such recipients that \n     have access to housing, transportation, and child care.\n       ``(2) Reports to congress.--Beginning 4 months after the \n     date of enactment of this subsection, the Secretary shall \n     submit biannual reports to the appropriate committees of \n     Congress on the assessment conducted under this subsection. \n     The reports shall analyze the ability of former recipients of \n     assistance under the State programs funded under this part to \n     achieve economic self-sufficiency. The Secretary shall \n     include in the reports all available information about the \n     economic self-sufficiency of such recipients, including data \n     from quarterly State reports submitted to the Department of \n     Health and Human Services (in this paragraph referred to as \n     the `Department'), data from State applications submitted to \n     the Department for bonuses, and to the extent the Secretary \n     determines they are relevant to the assessment--\n       ``(A) reports prepared by the Comptroller General of the \n     United States;\n       ``(B) samples prepared by the Bureau of the Census;\n       ``(C) surveys funded by the Department;\n       ``(D) studies conducted by the Department;\n       ``(E) studies conducted by States;\n       ``(F) surveys conducted by non-governmental entities;\n       ``(G) administrative data from other Federal agencies; and\n       ``(H) information and materials available from any other \n     appropriate source.''.\n\n\n                         privilege of the floor\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that privilege \nof the floor be given to Mikki Holmes, who is an intern with me, during \nconsideration of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Both she and Kelly Ross have helped me a great deal on \nthe amendment, so I would love for her to be able to be out on the \nfloor, and I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me give my colleagues a bit of \nbackground on this amendment--some context. I am, if you will, changing \nthe conversation. We are going to be getting into ISTEA amendments \nsoon, and I will have some other amendments on ISTEA. But this is a \nvehicle out here on the floor and this is a time for me to raise \nanother question, which I think is a very important one. This amendment \nwould require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report on \nthe number of former welfare recipients, recipients of public \nassistance under the State Temporary Assistance to Needy Families \nprograms, who are economically self-sufficient. In other words, what we \nwant to do is have some clear understanding about what is going on in \nthe country right now.\n  When we debated the welfare bill, I had an amendment which said \nsomething like: Let's please get Health and Human Services to take a \nlook at what is going on in the country. And if it should be the case--\nand I certainly hope it will not be the case--that, as opposed to \nfamilies being moved from welfare to work with more economic self-\nsufficiency, which is what our goal is, we are seeing families that are \nactually becoming more impoverished, children becoming more \nimpoverished, then what we need to do is take corrective action. Let's \nat least monitor what is happening. That amendment was defeated.\n  What I am saying to colleagues today is that by passing that piece of \nlegislation, we have a certain responsibility to make sure that we know \nwhat is going on throughout the country. Gunnar Myrdal, a Swedish \nsociologist, once said that ignorance is never random. I think we have \nto be very careful that we at least make an effort, as responsible \npolicymakers, to understand what is happening.\n  What I mean by ``economic self-sufficiency'' is we just need to know \nwhether or not, as the rolls drop--and we have heard reports about how \nthe welfare rolls have dropped by 4 million--whether this reduction in \nthe rolls or reduction in welfare caseload is a reduction of poverty. \nIt can't be viewed as reform unless we are talking about a reduction of \npoverty. We just need to know whether or not these parents, mainly \nwomen, are now working at jobs that provide them a decent wage. The \noperational indicator that I have in this amendment is we need to know \nwhether or not these families are at 150 percent of poverty. Are they \nnow out of poverty? We need to know whether or not there is child care \navailable for the children. We need to know what the housing situation \nis. We need to know whether or not there is transportation available \nfor people so they can get to jobs. We just do not know that.\n  What I am saying in this amendment is, at the very minimum--and I \nhope there will be support for it--we ask the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services, based upon the data that she has--some reports from \nStates, some Census Bureau survey statistics, some agency data--to pull \ntogether all the available data--someone has to do that--and provide to \nthe Senate, to the Congress, a report 4 months from enactment of this \namendment, and then every 6 months, as to what is going on in the \ncountry--whether or not these families are reaching economic self-\nsufficiency.\n  Let me talk a little bit about some of my own travel, and why I bring \nthis amendment to the floor, and also just let me draw from some \ndocumentation, empirical data, that I think will help colleagues as \nthey make up their minds. This is very reasonable. This is very \nreasonable, Democrats and Republicans. The only thing I am saying is, \nplease let us know.\n\n  Now, when I travel around the country--and I have spent some time in \nlow-income communities--I am not just focused on welfare. Personally, I \nthink the most important policy goal for us is to make work pay. I \nthink if people work almost 52 weeks a year and almost 40 hours a week, \nthey ought not be poor in America.\n  I think some of that is skills development for people who are looking \nfor work. Some of that is access to capital, especially for small \nbusinesses, whether it be in Kansas or Minnesota, so we can have more \nentrepreneurs and have more economic opportunities. And some of that is \naffordable child care and affordable health care. If you can put that \npackage together, that is probably the best single thing you can do for \nfamilies in America, especially families, if you will, in the bottom 50 \npercent of the population.\n  I hope that is the direction we will go. But as I travel the \ncountry--from Delta, MS, to East LA, Watts, to the Pilsin neighborhood \nin South Side Chicago, to public housing projects, the Ida Wells \nhousing project, to the Robert Taylor Holmes housing project, to inner \ncity Baltimore, to inner city Minneapolis, to rural Aitkin County, to \nLetcher County, Appalachia, eastern Kentucky--what I find is a bit of a \ndisturbing picture. And I have been trying to check with people in \nother States.\n  I am finding another thing. First of all, what I do when I travel \naround the country is say, OK, now you have seen a drop in caseload and \nyou have fewer people on welfare. That is being applauded. But can you \ntell me where they are? Where are the people? What kinds of jobs do \nthey have? At what wages? How about the children? Is there decent child \ncare for the children?\n  Generally speaking, the answer--and it will not just be what I am \ngoing to tell you on the basis of my own travel, but I also want to \nquote from some reports--is people do not know. People do not know. \nState by State they do not really know. There ought to be some way to \nassemble that data and at least get a report on what has happened.\n  I can tell you, I talked a little bit about this on the floor of the \nSenate before. This is why I bring this amendment to the floor. It is \nwhy I am changing the conversation on the floor of the Senate at least \nat the beginning of this bill. It is why I think this is a matter of \nurgent importance.\n  What I find is that I will go to a community, like in Delta, MS, or, \nfor that matter--let us start with rural Aitkin County, MN, or, for \nthat matter, maybe even more importantly, in Whitesburg, KY, and people \nwill say in rural communities two things. No. 1--and in a lot of inner \ncities; I hope every colleague at some point in time can read William \nJulius Wilson's book, ``The Disappearance of Work,'' just an eminent \nsociologist, African American sociologist, who has done superb work; \nrave reviews for his very careful research.\n  There are a lot of communities in our country where work still does \nnot exist, even with a record low official unemployment rate. We have \ncommunities in our country where there are no jobs.\n\n[[Page S1219]]\n\n  So there are two issues here. If you are going to tell people they \nare going to be off assistance, we have to make sure the job \nopportunities are there.\n  Now, a lot of people in rural America are saying, ``Look, in our \ncommunities we don't have the jobs. And just as importantly, we don't \nhave the transportation to be able to get to some of those jobs that \nare 50 or 60 miles away.'' So I think we need to know what is \nhappening. I mean, in Whitesburg, KY, in Letcher County, KY, boy, I \nwill tell you what--I say this to the Senator from Kansas--you want to \ntalk about a group of people that are independent, you want to talk \nabout a group of people that are self-reliant and self-sufficient--I am \na little biased. That is where my wife's family is from. This is the \ncommunity.\n  People say, ``We want to be able to work. And if you give us the \ntools whereby we can have some access to capital, we can chart our own \neconomic future.'' And there are jobs for people. We are all for this. \nBut right now, in a couple of years from now, everybody please remember \nin that bill that we passed, there is a drop dead date certain where, \ndepending upon the State, 2 years from now or 4 years from now or a \nyear and a half from now everybody is going to be off assistance. All \nthese parents--women; almost all women--and children will be cut off \nall assistance.\n\n  Before that finally happens, Mr. President, we need to know whether \nor not these families are now reaching economic self-sufficiency. We \nneed to know what is going on. We cannot just cut all people off \nassistance without knowing whether or not there are jobs available, \nwhether or not any will be available, or, worse--and I am visiting a \nlot of communities around the country, and I think Senators are \nprobably hearing this now as we implement this legislation--they are \ntelling me there are no jobs.\n  Same thing in a lot of inner cities I visit where people tell me in \nBaltimore. And you know what? I am in complete agreement on this. I \nwant my conservative colleagues to know that I am now changing my \nideology. I am becoming a conservative Democrat. I cannot go quite as \nfar as being a Republican. But I am in complete agreement with the \nproposition that you can have all of the social services imaginable, \nyou can have the WIC program, and you can have the Head Start Program, \nand you can have outreach programs, but it does not work unless people \nhave an employment opportunity. That is dignity for people.\n  But you know, when I visit some just great people in Baltimore--they \nare doing great work--what they tell me is, ``Look, all the social \nservices in the world don't cut it unless there are job opportunities \nhere. And the jobs are not available in our ghettos and boroughs. They \nare available in some of the suburbs, but people cannot get out to \nthem. A lot of poor people do not own cars. And a lot of people rely on \nthe public transportation.''\n  So what I am saying, colleagues, is, let us find out--find out--\nwhether or not people are moving to economic self-sufficiency. Let us \nfind out what this reduction in caseload means. Because I think \notherwise we could be doing something here in Washington, DC, that \ncould be unbelievably harsh and unbelievably cruel and just really \nunconscionable, which is eventually supporting the idea that all \nfamilies are cut off all assistance even when people have tried to find \na job and have not been able to find a job, even when the child care \nisn't available.\n  Now, as I travel the country--I wanted to also mention this to \ncolleagues--I have met with entirely too many families who tell me that \neither their 3- or 4-year-olds, part of the time, are home alone \nbecause it is a single parent working because the child care isn't \navailable, or their children, small children, age 2, age 3, one week \nare with a cousin, another week with another relative, another week \nwith a friend somewhere, because there is no affordable child care.\n  Or I talk to parents--and I would like for every Senator to put \nhimself or herself in the place of some of these parents--who tell me \nthat before this legislation passed, they would go to school, and they \nwould pick up their first grader--this happened to me in East LA--and \nthis mother, who was just weeping, she was saying, ``I work.'' She \nwanted me to know she was working. She wanted me to know that she wants \nto work. I was asking her, how was it going? And it was at that point \nthat she broke down crying, when she said, ``It's fine until about 3 \no'clock every day,'' because that is when she would pick up her first \ngrader--now a second grader--at school, and walk her home, sometimes \npassing gangs in a pretty violent neighborhood. Too much violence \nstill. And she would walk her child home, and then she would be with \nher child. Now she tells her second grader, ``You know, when you get \nhome at the housing project, you're to lock the door, and you're to \ntake no phone calls.''\n  Colleagues, I want you to know that even when there is good weather, \nthere are too many children in America who are not outside playing \nbecause there is no supervision for them. Now, we ought to know what is \nhappening around the country to these children. Just because these \nchildren are low-income children, just because their mothers are low-\nincome mothers does not make them any less important than anybody else. \nThey are all God's children.\n\n  Mr. President, let me just read from a very important article that \ncame out last week in the National Journal by Burt Solomon called \n``Monitoring Welfare Reform--Sort Of.'' This is why I want to see us at \nleast call on the Secretary of Health and Human Services to assemble \nsome data, to provide us with reports as to what is going on. That is \nall. How many families are reaching economic self-sufficiency? Are \npeople who are now off welfare, have they found jobs? At what wage \nlevel? Are the children OK? Is there decent child care? That is all \nthat says. We all ought to want to know that. There should not be one \nvote against this. We should want to know. We should want to know.\n  Now, to provide some evidence or marshal some evidence for this \namendment, let me just read from this very fine piece by Burt Solomon. \nIn quoting one Federal official:\n\n       ``I don't think we will be following enough people \n     thoroughly enough''--or long enough--``to get a [strong] \n     understanding of what's going on,'' a federal official \n     steeped in welfare policy said. Queried about whether there \n     are plans to better organize monitoring, the official \n     replied: ``I think the answer is, not really.''\n\n  Mr. President, I think that is sort of an apt summary. We just do not \nright now have any coordination. We do not have anybody who is \nresponsible for collecting the data to be able to tell us what is \nhappening to these families.\n  Secretary Shalala gave a speech at the American Enterprise Institute \non Friday, February 6. I will start out at the beginning of her speech. \nShe said:\n\n       But we also have a moral obligation to keep making \n     improvements in welfare reform, and in our social policies.\n\n  She is talking about how, now that we have had this law for a while, \nit is time to ask the questions and figure out where we need to go from \nhere.\n\n       ``Today, fewer than 4 percent of Americans are on welfare. \n     What we don't know is precisely what is happening to all of \n     these former welfare recipients.'' We know that some have \n     married or moved in with family or friends. Others have left \n     the rolls and are holding on to jobs that they were already \n     going to--what is sometimes called the smoke out effect. But \n     what's important is that many are looking for work--and \n     finding it.\n\n  Many are looking for work and finding it. But the real issue is that \nwe still do not know what is happening to these 4 million people who \nare no longer on the rolls.\n  I go on to quote from her speech:\n\n       States are working hard to enforce the mandatory work \n     requirements in TANF. Sanctions were actually rising even \n     before TANF. Still, most of the 33 states that were \n     authorized by waivers to impose full-family sanctions rarely \n     did so. Now, when sanctions are imposed, it's usually because \n     recipients fail to show up for their initial appointments--\n     not because they refuse to comply with work requirements.\n\n  Mr. President, I just want to make the point that one of the things \nthat is happening--it is happening in my State of Minnesota--is a lot \nof people are basically getting cut off welfare because they are \nsanctioned. They do not show up for some of their initial appointments. \nBut the question is whether they do not show up for their initial \nappointments because they do not want to work, or is it because they do \nnot have transportation? Or is it because there is not adequate \noutreach?\n\n[[Page S1220]]\n\n Or it is because we are imposing a kind of stability in the lives of \npeople who sometimes have to deal with crisis after crisis? Or is it \nbecause, with a lack of child care arrangements, they cannot be there?\n  I mean, we want to make sure that people are not just being \neliminated from the rolls and then, not having any employment \nopportunities or having jobs that barely pay minimum wage, are worse \noff a year from now, and they no longer have any health care. I read \nfrom an editorial from the Minnesota Star Tribune entitled ``Life After \nWelfare--States Must Ask the Right Questions.'' I just quote one \nrelevant section.\n\n       The federal law requires states to submit lots of data on \n     the number of clients who receive benefits and who find jobs, \n     but it is almost silent on the issue of family well-being \n     after clients leave welfare. As federal bureaucrats draft new \n     reporting requirements, there's a danger that Washington and \n     the governors will define ``success'' as merely cutting \n     caseloads.\n\n  And this is the conclusion of the editorial:\n\n       It's worth remembering that Congress didn't tackle welfare \n     reform because caseloads were rising--they were already \n     falling by 1996. It wasn't because assistance costs were \n     climbing--cash welfare to families has been stable at less \n     than 2 percent of the federal budget since Richard Nixon was \n     in office. It was because welfare was seen as a failed \n     program that fostered other social pathologies: idleness, \n     drug use, broken marriages and neglected children. Having \n     blamed welfare for these problems, it seems only fair to find \n     out whether welfare reform is solving them.\n\n  Again, what I am saying to my colleagues is that I think it is \nterribly important that at least we understand--and to ask the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to provide some reporting of \ndata as to--what is happening around the country so that we have some \nunderstanding how many of these families have found work, how many of \nthese families are reaching self-sufficiency. Or are matters worse off? \nWhat has happened to those parents? And what is happening to these \nchildren?\n  If it is, colleagues, the best-case scenario, I am all for it. If we \npass this amendment and the Secretary provides us with some data, \nassuming she has the data--if she can't pull together data, then we \nhave to figure out what we need to do in order to understand what is \nhappening in the country--if she provides data that shows us that, as \nwe look at this reduction of caseloads by 4 million, that many of these \nmothers and many of these children are better off, great.\n  But if, in fact, we find that people have been cut off but haven't \nfound a job, or they find a job that barely pays minimum wage and there \nis not adequate child care and some of their children are in harm's way \nas a result of this legislation, then we need to know that as well. \nCertainly we can't just follow through on eliminating all assistance \nfor all families until we understand whether or not these families have \nreached economic self-sufficiency.\n  Mr. President, I quote from an article in the Philadelphia Inquirer \non a recent study by Tufts University:\n\n       Despite numerous reports of welfare reform's early success, \n     most states have enacted measures that hurt the families \n     they're supposed to help, a national study at Tufts \n     University pointed out that only 14 states have welfare \n     policies that are likely to improve the economic conditions \n     of poor families.\n\n  Let me read a hard-hitting statement by J. Larry Brown, who is \ndirector of the poverty center at Tufts University, which I concede has \nbeen controversial because they have issued reports over the years. \nThey have been at this for decades, and they focus a lot on \nmalnutrition, hunger and poverty, especially among children in America. \nSometimes we don't like what they say because it is just unpleasant \nnews. But I think their research is terribly important, and I will read \nfrom J. Larry Brown:\n\n       The evidence shows that as of now welfare reform is \n     failing, and it is failing badly. The vast majority of states \n     are not developing programs to improve the economic \n     circumstances of the poor.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an executive summary of \nthe Tufts University study be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  [From the Tufts University Center on Hunger and Poverty, Feb. 1998]\n\n Are States Improving the Lives of Poor Families?--A Scale Measure of \n                         State Welfare Policies\n\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       The Tufts Scale measures whether each state is making \n     progress toward increasing the economic security of poor \n     families under the newly ``devolved'' welfare system created \n     by Congress in 1996. It also compares whether each state's \n     progress toward this goal is better or worse than that of \n     other states. Results of the study show that:\n       The majority of states have created welfare programs that \n     ultimately will worsen the economic circumstances of the \n     poor.\n       More than two-thirds of all states (35) have implemented \n     state welfare policies that will make the economic situations \n     of families worse than under the old welfare system.\n       Less than a third of all states (14) have implemented state \n     welfare policies that are likely to improve poor families' \n     economic conditions.\n       Overall, more states in the Northeast and Western region \n     received positive scores on the Scale, indicating they have \n     created state welfare programs that are more likely to help \n     families achieve economic self-sufficiency, while more states \n     in the South and Midwest received negative scores, indicating \n     that their new welfare policies are likely to make self-\n     sufficiency harder to achieve.\n       Of the fourteen states whose new welfare policies are \n     likely to improve family economic well-being, seven (VT, RI, \n     PA, NH, ME, CT and MA) are in the Northeast, four (OR, CA, \n     WA, and UT) are in the West, two (IL and MN) in the Midwest, \n     and one (TN) in the South.\n       Of the fourteen states whose new welfare policies are \n     likely to worsen family economic security the most, seven \n     (FL, NC, LA, MS, AL, GA and DC) are in the South, four (OH, \n     IA, MO and KS) are in the Midwest, two (WY and ID) in the \n     West, and one (NJ) in the Northeast.\n       Two states represent the extremes in measuring progress and \n     failure to date:\n       Vermont, with a score of +12, is the state whose new \n     welfare policies are most likely to improve the economic \n     security of recipient families.\n       Idaho, with a score of -15.5, is the state whose new \n     welfare policies are most likely to worsen the economic \n     conditions of poor families.\n       The cornerstone of the newly decentralized national welfare \n     system is the TANF Block Grant. Under TANF, states are given \n     unprecedented flexibility to create and implement customized \n     state welfare programs to help families become economically \n     self-sufficient. Yet the Scale results show that the vast \n     majority of states have adopted policies under their TANF \n     Block Grants that are likely to worsen the economic security \n     of poor families instead.\n       Forty-two states have adopted policies under their TANF \n     Block Grants that are likely to worsen the economic security \n     of poor families.\n       Eight states (VT, OR, NH, MA, WA, RI, ME, and CT) have \n     implemented policies under their TANF Block Grants that are \n     likely to improve poor families' economic security in \n     comparison to the old welfare system.\n       Vermont received the highest score on the TANF section of \n     the Scale (+7), indicating that it has implemented policies \n     under its TANF Block Grant that are more likely than all \n     other states to improve family economic security. Idaho \n     received the lowest Scale score for TANF (-15.5), indicating \n     that its TANF policies are more likely than those of any \n     other state to worsen family economic security.\n       The Child Care and Development Fund was created under \n     PRWORA to assist families in obtaining child care so that \n     adults could engage in activities eventually leading to self-\n     supporting employment. According to the Scale, all states \n     except one have adopted child care policies which are likely \n     to improve family economic security compared to their \n     policies under prior law.\n       All states except Wyoming have implemented child care \n     policies in their new state welfare programs that are likely \n     to improve family economic security.\n       Six states (CA, MS, NE, PA, RI and VT) received the highest \n     score on the child care part of the Scale.\n       The Tufts Scale was designed to provide early feedback to \n     help evaluate the likely impact of state welfare program \n     inputs on family economic well-being while the nation waits \n     for longer-term measures of their outcomes. Each state's \n     score provides a measure of whether that state is using its \n     newly available flexibility to invest in the economic \n     circumstances of poor families.\n       Concerns have been raised by some critics of the 1996 \n     welfare reform law that ultimately it will further impede the \n     economic viability of poor families. The data reported here \n     suggest that these concerns may be well founded. While a few \n     states have made choices which can improve the lives of poor \n     families in their states, most are disinvesting in the poor.\n\n\n              Comparing States' Overall Tufts Scale Scores\n\n       Table 2 shows overall state scores ranked in descending \n     order (highest to lowest). Recalling from Table 1 that the \n     range of possible overall scores is -38 to +22, it is clear \n     that no state did as little, or as much, as could have been \n     done to change the impact of its welfare programs on the \n     economic security of poor families with children. The\n\n[[Page S1221]]\n\n     highest overall score of +12 points, received by VT, fell 10 \n     points short of the maximum score. The lowest score of -15.5 \n     points, received by ID, was also 22.5 points higher than the \n     minimum.\n\n        TABLE 2.--OVERALL TUFTS SCALE SCORES WITH STATE RANKINGS\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       State                           Rank      Score\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nVT................................................          1       12.0\nOR................................................          2        7.5\nRI................................................          3        6.5\nPA................................................          4        4.5\nNH................................................          4        4.6\nME................................................          4        4.5\nCA................................................          4        4.5\nWA................................................          8        4.0\nCT................................................          8        4.0\nUT................................................         10        2.5\nIL................................................         10        2.5\nMN................................................         12        2.0\nMA................................................         12        2.0\nTN................................................         14        1.5\nNY................................................         15        0.0\nNE................................................         15        0.0\nVA................................................         17       -0.5\nTX................................................         17       -0.5\nMT................................................         19       -1.0\nDE................................................         20       -1.5\nNV................................................         21       -2.0\nHI................................................         21       -2.0\nCO................................................         21       -2.0\nAR................................................         21       -2.0\nAK................................................         25       -2.5\nNM................................................         26       -3.0\nND................................................         26       -3.0\nMI................................................         28       -3.5\nMD................................................         28       -3.5\nWV................................................         30       -4.0\nWI................................................         30       -4.0\nSC................................................         30       -4.0\nAZ................................................         30       -4.0\nSD................................................         34       -5.0\n0K................................................         34       -5.0\nKY................................................         34       -5.0\nIN................................................         34       -5.0\nOH................................................         38       -6.0\nFL................................................         38       -6.0\nNC................................................         40       -6.5\nLA................................................         40       -6.5\nIA................................................         40       -6.5\nNJ................................................         43       -7.0\nMO................................................         44       -8.0\nMS................................................         45       -9.0\nAL................................................         45       -9.0\nGA................................................         47       -9.5\nDC................................................         48      -10.0\nKS................................................         49      -11.0\nWY................................................         50      -12.0\nID................................................         51      -15.5\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Generally, states in the Southern region scored lower than \n     states in the Northeast. Among the fourteen states receiving \n     overall scores above zero, seven are in the Northeast region \n     (VT, RI, PA, NH, ME, CT and MA), and four are in the Western \n     region (OR, CA, WA and UT). Two states in the top fourteen \n     are in the Midwestern region (IL and MN), and one (TN) is in \n     the South. Of the fourteen states with lowest overall scores, \n     seven are in the Southern region (FL, NC, LA, MS, AL, GA, and \n     DC), four are in the Midwest (OH, IA, MO and KS), two in the \n     West (WY and ID), and one in the Northeast (NJ).\n       During the 1996 policy debate over ``devolving'' welfare to \n     the states, leaders in six states were particularly active in \n     efforts to obtain greater state prerogatives. In the states \n     of CA, MD, MI, NJ, OH, and WI, governors made welfare reform \n     a major component of their policy agendas \\18\\. All of these \n     states except one are doing worse than their peers in terms \n     of promoting the economic security of recipient families. \n     With one exception, all these states received scores at or \n     below the median value of -3 points, while two (OH and NJ) \n     scored among the worse in the nation. CA scored among the top \n     fourteen states with an overall score of +4.5 points (though \n     several of its newer policies were not implemented until \n     after October 1997).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\18\\ Norris, D.F., and L. Thompson, The Politics of Welfare \n     Reform, SAGE Publications, Thousand Oaks, CA, 1995.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Overall, fourteen states created welfare programs \n     demonstrating greater investment in the economic security of \n     poor families, while two states maintained the status quo \n     under prior law. Thirty-five states (including DC) designed \n     welfare programs which are likely to worsen the economic \n     security of poor families.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me cite two other pieces of \nevidence to support this amendment and to explain to my colleagues why \nI have been out here from the word ``go'' trying to get us to go on \nrecord on this question.\n  This is a piece from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. The title is \n``Few Leave Welfare Earning Above Poverty Level.'' This is about a \nstudy of welfare recipients in Wisconsin.\n\n       Only about 1 in 6 families that left welfare in Milwaukee \n     County in 1996 earned more than poverty-level wages. This is \n     in Wisconsin, which has really put an all-out effort to \n     invest in this reform.\n\n  Let me read again:\n\n       Only about 1 in 6 families that left welfare in Milwaukee \n     County in 1996 earned more than poverty-level wages in a \n     three-month period, according to the most conclusive \n     examination yet of what is happening to local families under \n     Wisconsin's sweeping welfare initiatives.\n\n  It goes on to point out that ``the turnover rate among those workers \nwas extremely high--in part because the jobs were concentrated in \nindustries that typically have plenty of part-time spots and a more \ntransient work force.''\n\n       By the first quarter of 1997, welfare recipients had left \n     most of the jobs for which they were hired the previous year.\n\n  So again, let's just understand that this is a study that comes out \nbased on what is happening in Milwaukee County in Wisconsin, saying one \nout of six families that left welfare earned more than poverty level \nwages--only one out of six. Moreover, a lot of the jobs are part-time \njobs, jobs that people can't count on, and a lot of people had to \nswitch from one job to another.\n  Finally, Mr. President, an article that appeared in the Star Tribune \nin my State, ``Parents Face Cuts In Welfare Checks.''\n\n       Hundreds of Minnesotan parents are in danger of having \n     their welfare checks reduced starting March 1, the first wave \n     of penalties meted out under the state's new welfare law.\n\n  Interestingly, in Hennepin County about 50 percent of the parents \nconverting to the new welfare system are showing up for orientation \nmeetings at work; about 70 percent are showing up in Ramsey County.\n  A lot of these families are in crisis. Some don't plan well--the bus \ncan be late, they can't work out arrangements for kids. The question is \ngoing to be whether or not we are going to basically be sanctioning \npeople and cutting people off, even people who want to work.\n  Now, summarizing what this amendment says, we call on the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services to take a look at those families who have \nnow been moved off welfare around the country and to provide us with \nsome data as to what the current situation is. The whole goal of this \nbill was to move families from ``welfare'' to ``workfare,'' to move \nfamilies to economic self-sufficiency. That is what we said it was \nabout.\n  I have said to colleagues today on the floor of the Senate that from \narticles that are now coming out, looking at what is happening around \nthe country, we see some evidence that a lot of people who have been \nmoved off welfare have not been able to obtain jobs that pay a decent \nwage, have not been able to obtain employment that gets a family \nanywhere close to 150 percent of poverty--out of poverty. I am saying \nto colleagues that Secretary Shalala, who has been very direct and \nhonest herself, has said we need to know more about what is happening \nwith these reform efforts.\n  I'm saying to colleagues today that there have been some pretty hard-\nhitting studies that have come out, the Tufts University study being \none, which have said that actually it is pretty harsh what is happening \naround the country. I'm saying that as I travel around the country I \nhave tried to spend time in low-income communities. I have tried to be \nwith people. I have tried to understand what is happening. I don't have \nall the empirical data, but I am just saying to colleagues what I have \nobserved, and I think I have been honest in my observation. I have been \nin too many communities with long waiting lists for affordable child \ncare for working poor, moderate income families, and now welfare. \nTherefore, a lot of these mothers go to work but there is not adequate \nchild care for their children.\n\n  I don't want to see, nor should any of my colleagues want to see, \nmore children put in harm's way because of action that we have taken. I \nam saying to colleagues that in too many inner-city communities and too \nmany rural areas, people have said to me that the jobs aren't there, \nnor is the transportation available to enable them to get to some of \nthe jobs, that they would work, for themselves and their families.\n  I am saying to colleagues that you cannot argue that because there \nhas been a reduction of 4 million recipients, that that represents \nreform if it hasn't led to reduction in poverty. You can't say \nsomething is working well if what is happening is that many of these \nfamilies are economically worse off and many of these children are not \nbetter by what we have done.\n  I am saying to colleagues that I have heard enough speeches on the \nfloor of the Senate about children. I have heard enough speeches about \nthe very early years being very important for nurturing of a child, \nvery important to fire up a child's imagination. I am saying to \ncolleagues that in a whole lot of cases these single parents--almost \nall women, even with children younger than 1--are being told they have \nto leave the home and take a job. We\n\n[[Page S1222]]\n\ndon't know what is happening to those 1-year-olds, those 2-year-olds, \nthe 3-year-olds and their 4-year-olds. It is our obligation to know \nwhat is happening to those children.\n  I am making a plea to my colleagues. This is, I say to Senator Chafee \nand Senator Baucus, a moderate Paul Wellstone amendment. This is a \nmoderate version. All this does is say, please, let's ask the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services to pull together some data and make \nreports to us every half a year as to how many of these families are \nreaching economic self-sufficiency so we have some understanding of \nwhat is going on in the country.\n  Before I yield the floor--and I am not prepared to yield the floor--\nmight I ask the Senator from Missouri, because I don't want to keep him \nwaiting long, but before yielding the floor, might I ask my colleague \nwhether he is here to debate the amendment or intends to introduce \nanother amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am interested in knowing when I might have \nthe floor. I have a brief statement on the measure.\n  I will have something to say about this, but I ask my colleague how \nlong he intends to go on.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if I understand my colleague from \nMissouri, if he has a statement on the overall legislation or something \nelse aside from the amendment, then I want to inquire of the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island as to whether or not this amendment will be accepted. \nIf it will be accepted, then we can dispose of it and move on.\n  If the Senator from Missouri means he has another point of view and \nwants to speak on this amendment, I am glad to yield the floor and then \ncome back and respond to some of his arguments. I am not quite sure \nwhat he has in mind.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, it is my understanding the Senator from \nMissouri is going to speak on the underlying bill. Is that correct?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am prepared to address the finance \namendment that we reported out today and that will be brought up for \ndebate, we hope, perhaps later today or tomorrow under the unanimous \nconsent agreement. I wanted to speak briefly about that.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Might I ask the leader as to whether or not he has any \nadditional information as to how he wants to proceed?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. What I suggest, Mr. President, is that the Senator from \nMissouri is not going to be very long. We will be in 45 minutes anyway, \nor more, before we recess. So I suggest if we could just let the \nSenator from Missouri go ahead, and then I have some comments I will \ndirect to the Senator from Minnesota. That is my suggestion.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I don't want to keep my colleague from \nMissouri waiting. It would be fine with me, I say to the Senator from \nRhode Island. I await eagerly his response. I hope we can reach some \nagreement on this.\n  I do have more to say about this amendment, but I don't want to \ninconvenience my colleague from Missouri. I am pleased to relinquish \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has relinquished the floor.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I say in response to my colleague from Minnesota, be careful about \nrelying on the Tufts study. The officials in charge of public \nassistance in my State and other States have pointed out some rather \nserious flaws in that study. We all share concerns about assuring there \nis adequate transportation, adequate day care, child care, for people \nmoving from welfare to work, and I am not here to debate that \namendment. At the appropriate time, we will review that amendment.\n  What I wanted to call to the attention of my colleagues is the fact \nthat yesterday my good friend, the distinguished chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, Senator Chafee, along with \nSenator Baucus, Senator Gramm, Senator Byrd and the very distinguished \nchairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, announced agreement \non funding levels for the highway authorization for the next 6 years. \nIt will be $171 billion for highways.\n  Let me explain what that means for my State of Missouri. Under the \nformula that was passed out of the committee as a committee amendment \ntoday, Missouri would receive $3.6 billion--that is billion dollars--\ncompared to $2.4 billion that Missouri received over the last 6 years \nof the 1991 transportation bill. Missouri's average allocation per year \nwould be around $600 million, as opposed to the $400 million the State \nwas receiving under the old.\n  That is tremendous progress. I am deeply indebted to the leadership \nof our committee and particularly to the budget chairman for making \nthese dollars available. This is vitally important. Everybody in this \nChamber knows how important funding for transportation is.\n  I was not a cosponsor of the Byrd-Gramm amendment, but I have always \nmade clear and reiterated my support that highway money and \ntransportation money should go for highways. In Missouri and across the \ncountry, when people go to the gas pump, buy gas and pay a tax, they \nthink it is going to the highway trust fund. They think it is going for \ntransportation purposes. And that is a reasonable assumption, except \nthat in this body we have divorced the revenue from the spending stream \nand in the past we have had that money siphoned off to cover \noverspending elsewhere. In the 1993 major tax increase, a 4.3-cent tax \nwas levied for deficit reduction.\n  Now, I believe that the transfer of the 4.3 cents back to the highway \ntrust fund instead of deficit reduction has not only made a \nsignificantly increased amount of money available for transportation \nneeds, but it has, I think, put the ``trust'' back into the highway \ntrust funds. That is what we ought to be about; that is what we ought \nto be telling the people who are paying those taxes. We are \nrecommitting ourselves to the basic principle and promise that we made, \nwhich is that when we provide the revenues to the Government under the \ndedicated gas tax money, we are going to use it for roads, bridges, \nhighways and transportation when it's collected.\n  In Missouri, these funds are desperately needed. I daresay that I \nhave heard stories from other States where they understand the \nimportance of highway dollars. I came to the floor last week and \nexplained that the debate over transportation funding and policy was \nnot just an academic debate for Missourians. It is about, obviously, \nconvenience and ease of transportation. It is about economic growth \nbecause, in our State, you can see where jobs occur. They occur where \nthere are good highways. But most important, good highways and bridges \nare matters of life and death in Missouri. Highway fatalities in the \nState of Missouri increased 13 percent from 1992 to 1995, and many of \nus in Missouri know somebody or several people who have lost their \nlives on highways. And 77 percent of the fatal crashes during this \ntimeframe occurred on two-lane roads.\n  Mr. President, it is a simple matter. When you have heavy traffic on \ntwo-lane roads, you have traffic delays, somebody gets anxious and \npulls out to pass, and if there is a hill, if there is a curve, or if \nthere is an unseen hidden spot in the road, a head-on crash occurs. \nThat has happened too many times, and it happens because the two-lane \nroads that we are driving on are carrying traffic that everybody agrees \nshould be carried on four-lane roads. This is why I say it is a matter \nof life and death.\n  In Missouri, 62 percent of the roads on the National Highway System, \nwhen you exclude the Interstate System, are two-lane roads--two-lane \nroads that are supposed to be part of our National Highway System. We \nare in the top 10, in terms of highway count, in the number of cars \ntraveling those roads. Many of those National Highway System roads \ndon't even have shoulders on them. So if somebody comes across the line \nand you are passing a large truck, if you move too far to the right, \nyou are off on the shoulder, and that can be deadly.\n  In addition, my State of Missouri has the oldest--I repeat, the \noldest--bridges in the country. There are a number of things that we \nlike to be No. 1 in, but having the oldest bridges and some of the \nworst conditions in the country is not one of them. This is a dubious \ndistinction. We are sixth from\n\n[[Page S1223]]\n\nthe bottom in the condition of our bridges. These are the reasons that \nthe highway funding formula and the transportation bill is so vitally \nimportant in my State. The potential funding that this bill provides is \na huge step in the right direction to save lives on Missouri's \nhighways, roads, and bridges. Last week, I told the story of driving \nacross some of the bridges in our State where you can look down and see \nthe water. That is not reassuring. They don't design them as ``see-\nthrough'' bridges. Years and years of decay have opened up gaping \nholes, which is a frightening prospect when you are crossing the \nMissouri River or the Mississippi River.\n  I urge my colleagues to work through the budget and the \nappropriations process to determine that we will make the real funding \ncommitment and that we will meet that funding commitment that we put \nforward in this bill.\n  When I began this process, when I started work on it, I had two \nprimary goals. One was for the transportation bill to increase the \noverall size of the pie for highways, and getting that 4.3 cents in is \nvitally important. Secondly, Missouri, as one of the donor States, \nneeded to get its share up. I believe these two conditions are met.\n  You may recall last fall when filibusters held up the bill I crafted \na bipartisan interim solution that enabled highway funding to continue \nthrough May 1 of this year, which means, as the distinguished occupant \nof the chair knows, we will be the bedeviled by those orange and white \nbarrels this year. They will be springing up on our highways like the \nsummer road flowers along the highways. They are going to be \nblossoming. I am pleased to be causing those headaches. But we need to \ncontinue the orange and white barrels; we need to continue that \nconstruction.\n  I know the funding debates are far from over. As I mentioned last \nFriday, there are reasonable people who have passionate differences, \nand there is nothing like a highway funding fight to bring out those \ndifferences. We hope that it is merely a matter of verbal debate. But \nwhen it comes to highway funding, these differences have been visible \nand audible. I want to express again my sincerest thanks to Senator \nChafee, Senator Baucus, and Senator Warner, for their leadership in \nworking with committee members to avoid the ``guerrilla warfare'' that \nhas been known to erupt on the highway bill in the past. I told the \ncommittee that I thought the leadership had achieved a rough system of \njustice that would make it possible for us to move this bill forward.\n  Nobody is going to get everything that they want, but I believe that \nreasonable compromises have been made, and there may still be more \nmade. We need to get this bill moving. I look forward to working with \nthe members of the committee and my other colleagues throughout this \nprocess to achieve the goals that we all have for our States, that I \nhave for my State of Missouri, but, most important, that we all must \nhave for our national transportation policy.\n  Again, my thanks to the leadership and my congratulations for the \ngreat staff work. We look forward to working on it. It will be an \ninteresting debate.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Missouri for those kind comments. We have worked closely together, \nand he has been a valuable member of the committee, not only on highway \nmatters, but in other matters likewise. We look forward to his vigorous \nsupport as we move forward with this legislation.\n  Now, the Senator from Minnesota, I believe, has matters to discuss.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me also associate myself with the \nremarks of the Senator from Missouri. I think all of us owe a debt of \ngratitude to our colleagues, Senator Chafee and Senator Baucus, for \ntheir determination and doggedness in getting this bill on the floor. \nThis is a very important piece of legislation, I think, for all of our \nStates.\n  Mr. President, I think the Senator from Rhode Island, in a moment or \ntwo, has some questions he wants to put to me. While I am waiting for \nthat, let me just, for my colleagues' information, give the official \npoverty level income for a family of one woman and two children. It is \n$12,516. And 150 percent is $18,774.\n  This amendment, everybody should understand, doesn't dictate \nanything. It doesn't say that every family of three ought to be able to \nmake that income of $18,000. It doesn't mandate anything; it doesn't \ndictate anything. It simply says--look, I think people trust me, and I \nhave traveled the country, and I am telling you that some of what is \ngoing on--I am not pointing the finger at any particular point, \nalthough it is uneven. It is harsher in some States than in others, but \nwe do need to understand exactly what is going on, whether or not these \nfamilies are able to find jobs and whether or not these are jobs with \ndecent wages, and what is going on with their children. We need for the \nSecretary to kind of bring together some data and present reports to us \nso we have knowledge about this.\n  I see the majority leader on the floor. I would be happy to yield to \nthe majority leader. Then if my colleague has questions he wants to put \nto me, I would be pleased to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for \nyielding me this moment of time. It won't be long.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/03/senate-section/article/S1217-3", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1223-S1224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              GOLDEN GAVEL AWARDED TO SENATOR PAT ROBERTS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, since the 1960s, the Senate has recognized \nthose dedicated Members who preside over the Senate for 100 hours with \nthe Golden Gavel Award. Today, we add to the list of Golden Gavel \nrecipients the current Presiding Officer, Senator Pat Roberts of the \ngreat State of Kansas, whose presiding hours now total over 100 hours, \neffective as of today.\n  I want to say this, too: I have found that, as Presiding Officer, \nSenator Roberts is reliable and enthusiastic. He maintains order, \nsometimes running the majority leader from the floor of the Senate \nChamber if he insists on talking when not properly recognized. He \nmaintains order with a firm hand, but, most importantly, he is \nconsistently willing to come to the Chamber and preside over the \nactivities here in this Chamber. He is able to handle problems that \narise in an appropriate way and without hesitation. So it is with \nsincere appreciation that I announce the newest recipient of the Golden \nGavel Award, Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas.\n  I have already determined that when we have moments of really \nimportant legislation, and when rulings of the Chair are going to be \nnecessary and need to be made rather quickly so we can complete the \nbusiness of the day, we have a new suspect that can assume the position \nas Presiding Officer, Senator Roberts of Kansas. Thank you very much \nfor the job you have done in helping us to preside and keep the Chamber \nin order.\n  [Applause.]\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Presiding Officer observes that under the \nSenate rules the Presiding Officer cannot participate in debate or \ncomment from the dais. Should that rule not be in effect, the Presiding \nOfficer would publicly state his thanks to the majority leader for the \nkind comments. But that is not permitted under the rules. The Presiding \nOfficer is unclear about the majority leader's intent. Does the \nmajority leader intend to introduce that in the form of a resolution, \nor does he intend that it be simply made part of the Record?\n  Mr. LOTT. I think it would be appropriate just to be made part of the \nRecord. I appreciate the ruling of the Chair on this matter, which I \ndid not ask a question about. Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will add a half minute to what the \nmajority leader said. I think one of the most important things that the \nSenator from Kansas does--and I mean this--is that, regardless of \nwhether or not he is in agreement with you, he is looking at you. A lot \nof the times that doesn't happen. It means a lot when you have somebody \npresiding who has\n\n[[Page S1224]]\n\nthe graciousness to be looking at you with respect and to be listening \nto the debate. He always does that. I can never tell whether he is in \nagreement or disagreement. That means a lot to me. I suspect that he is \nusually in agreement with me, but I am not so sure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/03/senate-section/article/S1223-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1224-S1225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        INTERMODAL SURFACE TRANSPORTATION EFFICIENCY ACT OF 1997\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1679\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I might ask the Senator from Rhode \nIsland if he has any questions. He said he wanted to ask some questions \nof me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to direct, if I might, a \ncouple of questions to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  I have looked over this amendment, and it's an amendment, obviously, \nthat is in the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee, as the Senator \nfrom Minnesota has indicated. And the amendment has just been \nintroduced, so, obviously, there have been no hearings before the \nFinance Committee, and it's not a matter that has previously been \nconsidered by the Finance Committee, if I understand this correctly. I \nask the Senator from Minnesota if that is accurate.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, that is accurate. Since we are not in \ncourt, and the Senator from Rhode Island is always gracious, let me go \nbeyond the ``yes or no'' answer. It is not at all clear that there will \nbe necessarily a welfare bill from the Finance Committee or a bill that \nI can raise this question on. We now have a vehicle out here on the \nfloor. My feeling was that, since this amendment calls for nothing more \nthan just to ask the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide \ndata and analysis to us, based upon what data she has as to what is \ngoing on with welfare reform, it doesn't seem to me that this really \nneeds a hearing. It is pretty clear and straightforward and, I think, \npretty noncontroversial.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am voting against Senator Wellstone's \namendment because I think it is inappropriate to place it on the \npending bill, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act.\n  I do believe it is a good idea to have the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services obtain information from the States as to the impact of \nthe welfare reform law on current and former recipients of federal aid, \nbut this critical transportation bill should be moved as expeditiously \nas possible to get highway, transit, and safety funding moving to the \nStates and our communities as rapidly as possible.\n  When the 1996 welfare reform law was considered, I noted that only \ntime will tell if that legislation resulted in an unacceptable level of \nhardship on poor Americans, particularly children. Current law contains \ndata collection requirements with respect to the impact of the changes \nin welfare law, and as Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee \nwhich funds the Department of Health and Human Services, I was pleased \nto provide $26 million for Fiscal Year 1998 for the Department to \nundertake the kinds of research and analysis we need to determine the \ntrue impact of the 1996 law. Further, as Chairman, I will continue to \nmonitor closely the Department's performance in administering the new \nwelfare regime. If Senator Wellstone offers this amendment on an \nappropriate bill, I will likely support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I note that this is a piece of legislation \nthat would direct the Secretary to develop a plan. In other words, as I \nread page 2 here, it says the Secretary shall develop a plan, to the \nextent possible based on all available information, and so forth.\n\n  What I would like to do, Mr. President, is hear from our people on \nthe Finance Committee, which should be very shortly, and I will then \nsee that the Senator from Minnesota has every opportunity to bring this \nto a vote, should he wish to, this afternoon. We will work it out. He \nis not going to be blocked in any fashion. But I would like to hear, \nand it may well be that we can accept the amendment, and that would \nsave us all some time.\n  We are now just trying to check with the Finance Committee. It may be \nwell that something from the Labor Committee is involved likewise, \nalthough it seems to me that this is pretty much a Finance Committee \nmatter. When we get back, after our luncheon recess has concluded, I \nwill speak to the Senator from Minnesota, and we will then be able to \ngo from there.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island. \nI say to him that I will bring the amendment to the floor in good faith \nwith some sense of urgency, because I think it is important that we \nknow what is happening in this matter. I take the Senator at his word. \nI am pleased that we will proceed this way. I say to my colleague that \nI hope there will be support for it. That is, of course, the whole \npurpose of my effort. If there should be some disagreement, then I \nwould want, of course, the opportunity to respond to whatever other \npositions are taken on this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to discuss a very important \nmatter relating to the safety of our Nation's highways and streets, and \nthat is DWI-related injuries and fatalities. To use more common \nparlance, drunk driving. This is a problem that, in spite of many \nprevention efforts, remains a very serious concern in our country.\n  The statistics are compelling. For example, on Thanksgiving, \nChristmas, New Year's Eve and New Year's Day 1996, those 4 days \ncombined, there were 576 DWI-related fatalities on our Nation's \nhighways. In that same year, 1996, nearly 1.1 million people were \ninjured in alcohol-related crashes.\n  Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for 15- to 20-\nyear-olds. I think that statistic alone should get the attention of the \nU.S. Senate and the Congress of this country. Motor vehicle crashes are \nthe leading cause of death for 15- to 20-year-olds throughout this \ncountry. About 3 in 10 Americans will be involved in an alcohol-related \ncrash at some time in their lives. Alcohol-related crashes cost society \n$45 billion annually, and to make matters worse, the loss of quality of \nlife and pain and suffering costs are estimated to total over $134 \nbillion annually.\n  My home State of New Mexico is not exempt from these problems. In \nfact, the National Traffic Safety Administration reports that my State \nof New Mexico leads the country in DWI-related deaths per capita. The \nrate in New Mexico is 11.79 deaths per 100,000 people. This rate is 19 \npercent higher than the No. 2 State, which is Mississippi, and it is \nmore than twice the national rate, which is merely 5.05 deaths per \n100,000 people.\n  Indeed, these statistics paint a very grim picture. What makes the \npicture even more tragic, Mr. President, is that DWI-related injuries \nand fatalities are preventable. It clearly is within our national \ninterest to do what we can to reverse this statistic. One obvious way \nto prevent further deaths is to ensure the sobriety of drivers. That is \nwhy I am proud to cosponsor the bill that Senators Lautenberg and \nDeWine have introduced to establish a national blood-alcohol content \nstandard of .08. Additionally, I am cosponsoring Senator Dorgan's bill \nto prohibit open containers of alcohol in automobiles. I urge my \ncolleagues to help pass these bills this year.\n  Another contributing factor to the problem that I believe would make \na significant difference in eliminating the problem is the practice of \nselling alcoholic beverages through drive-up\n\n[[Page S1225]]\n\nsales windows. This practice only makes it more easy for a drunk driver \nto purchase alcohol and contributes heavily to the DWI fatality rate in \nmy home State and throughout the country. Eliminating these drive-up \nliquor windows is essential to reducing these injuries and fatalities.\n  Tomorrow I will introduce legislation entitled the ``Drunk Driving \nCasualty Prevention Act of 1998'' to prohibit the sale of alcohol \nthrough drive-up sales windows. I hope to have some cosponsors for that \nprovision at that time.\n  Mr. President, this ban will make a difference. According to one \nstudy, there are 26 States that do not permit drive-up windows. In \n1996, these States had, as a combined effort, a 15-percent lower \naverage drunk driving fatality rate than the 24 States that permit \nsales through drive-up windows.\n  In the States with the ban, the average rate was 4.6 for 100,000 \npeople as opposed to 5.46 in all other States. On a percentage basis, \nStates with a ban had a 14.5 percent lower drunk driving fatality rate \nthan States that permit sales through windows.\n  In 1996, comparing 19 Western States in particular, the nine States \nthat have a ban in place had a 31 percent lower average drunk driving \nfatality rate than the States that permit sales.\n  In 1995, there were 231 drunk driving fatalities in my home State of \nNew Mexico. Based on the 14 percent lower drunk driving fatality rate, \nit is estimated that closing drive-up liquor windows could have saved \nbetween 32 and 35 lives in that year in my State. Nowhere is it more \ntrue that if we can save one life by closing these windows, we need to \ndo that.\n  The difference can be explained because there are three main benefits \nthat accrue when you close drive-up liquor windows.\n  First, once the windows are closed, it is easier and more accurate to \ncheck the identification when the customers have to purchase their \nliquor over the counter. Minors have testified that it is very easy to \nillegally purchase alcohol at a drive-up window where it is difficult \nto determine their age.\n  A second benefit is that it is easier to visually observe a customer \nfor clues that that customer is impaired by alcohol or other substances \nif they have to walk into a well-lighted establishment to make their \npurchase.\n  In one municipal court in New Mexico, 33 percent of the DWI offenders \nreported having purchased their liquor at drive-up windows. Some \nmembers of Alcoholics Anonymous say they now realize they could have \nknown each other years earlier if they only looked in their rearview \nmirror while waiting in line at the drive-up window to buy their \nliquor.\n  And third, it sends a clear message to the population that drinking \nand driving will not be allowed to mix.\n  The Behavior Health Research Center of the Southwest conducted a \nstudy, the purpose of which was to determine the characteristics and \nthe arrest circumstances of DWI offenders who bought alcohol at drive-\nup liquor windows compared to those who obtained it elsewhere. Nearly \n70 percent of the offenders studied reported having purchased the \nalcohol that they drank prior to arrest. Of those offenders, 42 percent \nbought packaged liquor, and the drive-up window was the preferred place \nof purchase.\n  The study showed that drive-up window users were 68 percent more \nlikely to have a serious alcohol problem than other offenders. Drive-up \nwindow users also are 67 percent more likely to be drinking in their \nvehicle prior to arrest than other offenders are.\n  Mr. President, we have had one sort of test case in New Mexico, and \nthat is in McKinley County. It was one county in our State that had a \nterrible problem with DWI and petitioned our legislature for permission \nto close the windows in that county, the drive-up windows. They did \nclose those windows. Businesses in that community did not see their \nprofits cut in two--the liquor businesses. In fact, they saw their \nprofits jump. The DWI prevention strategy that was employed in McKinley \nCounty reduced the fatality rate from 272 per 100,000 in 1989 to 183 \nper 100,000 in 1997.\n  Mr. President, I believe we have a great opportunity here to reduce \nDWI injuries and fatalities. I plan to offer this amendment to the \nISTEA legislation tomorrow or later this week. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in cosponsoring that legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold suggesting the \nabsence of a quorum?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I do withhold.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/03/senate-section/article/S1224-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the pending business, as I understand it, \nis the Wellstone amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CHAFEE.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself and Mr. \n     Hollings, proposes an amendment numbered 1680.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first of all, I thank Senator Chafee for \nall of his efforts on this ISTEA issue. He has done a remarkable job. \nHe is a remarkable man. I had the privilege of working for him when he \nwas Secretary of the Navy, and he sometimes felt he didn't provide me \nwith enough leadership at that time. But I am grateful for everything \nthat he has done, and I'm especially grateful for his leadership on \nthis very, very important issue to our Governors, our mayors, our \ncounty supervisors, and our city councils.\n  I say to my friend from Rhode Island, about 50 county supervisors \nfrom my State were in yesterday, and this issue dominated their \nconversation. I am grateful that he has been able to work through this. \nSo the small amount that we are responsible for in the Commerce \nCommittee, I hope, adds to this bill and helps us to move forward as \nrapidly as possible.\n  This amendment contains the proposal of the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation to reauthorize ISTEA programs through \nfiscal year 2003.\n  The amendment seeks to reauthorize the National Highway Traffic \nSafety Administration [NHTSA] State safety grant programs, the Motor \nCarrier State Assistance program, and the Hazardous Materials \nTransportation Safety Enforcement programs.\n  The amendment also authorizes new and innovative safety initiatives \nat the Department of Transportation, including programs focusing on \nperformance-based safety standards and advanced information data \nanalysis.\n  The amendment is designed to improve travel safety on our Nation's \nroads and waterways, promote the safe shipment of hazardous materials, \nprotect underground pipelines and telecommunications cables from \nexcavation damage, and ensure that our\n\n[[Page S1226]]\n\nNation's commercial motor vehicle fleet is well maintained and safely \noperated.\n  Mr. President, this is a bipartisan product. It incorporates many of \nthe proposals requested in the administration's ISTEA reauthorization \nsubmission. The committee product also includes a number of new \ntransportation safety proposals.\n  Senator Hollings and I have worked to accommodate as many Members' \nrequests and concerns as possible, but there are some outstanding \nquestions.\n  One of the more difficult areas we faced concerned the many requests \nwe received to provide statutory exemptions for one industry or another \nfrom certain motor carrier safety rules. Exemptions were sought from \nhours-of-service regulations and commercial driver's license \nrequirements. These requests are not new. We face them every time \nCongress considers legislation affecting Federal motor carrier safety \nregulations.\n  Senator Hollings and I worked diligently to avoid any statutory \nexemptions or regulation carve outs for single industries but to ensure \nthere is a fair process by which all requests can be considered \nappropriately.\n  Let me be clear. I agree that under certain circumstances, exemptions \nfrom regulations may make sense. For example, I believe it's \nappropriate to acknowledge the special transportation time constraints \nof farmers during the planting and harvesting seasons, and that we \nshould recognize the need to permit infrastructure maintenance and \nrepair to operate during weather emergencies.\n  But blanket exemptions and wholesale legislative carve outs for \nselected businesses and enterprises can weaken safety. The answer is a \nfair and credible administrative process.\n  The Secretary of Transportation currently has the authority to grant \nexemptions. However, the authority is relatively meaningless because \nprior to granting a waiver or exemption, it must first be proven the \nexemption would not diminish safety. That's an appropriate \nconsideration, but how can DOT assess an exemption's safety risk if it \ncan't first test the concept on a limited pilot basis?\n  In an attempt to address this problem and recognize the Secretary \nshould be permitted to examine innovative approaches or alternatives to \ncertain rules, Senator Hollings and I have worked to define a process \nwhereby the Secretary may more appropriately grant waivers and \nexemptions. This legislation would also authorize the Secretary to \ncarry out pilot programs to test the affects of limited regulatory \nexemptions. I believe this pilot approach is reasonable and could be \ncarried out in a structured manner that does not impose a risk on \npublic safety.\n  The committee's amendment includes three amendments adopted by voice \nvote when the Committee considered the safety amendment. The three \namendments incorporate exemptions for three industries.\n  When these three amendments were debated in the Commerce Committee, I \npledged that I would work with the sponsor to craft a safe alternative \nto the exemptions. These efforts have not succeeded yet, and I want to \ninform my colleagues that there will be some proposals in the next \nhours or days to alter those exemptions.\n  Finally, I want to thank Senator Hollings and the other members of \nthe Commerce Committee who worked so long and hard to get to the Senate \nFloor today with this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this critical and comprehensive \namendment.\n  Mr. President, before yielding the floor I want to comment briefly on \nthe issue of airbags. Last year a compromise was reached on language to \nbe inserted in the ISTEA legislation.\n  I want to thank Senator Kempthorne for his leadership on this issue. \nHe has done the nation a great service by leading the effort to ensure \nthat airbags will not pose a risk to infants.\n  We are all aware of the tragic accident in Idaho last year where an \ninfant was decapitated by an airbag and of the other infants and \nchildren whose lives have been taken. Senator Kempthorne feels this \nissue personally and deeply and this amendment will help us address \nthis very serious problem.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Hollings, and Senators Bryan, \nGorton, Abraham, Ashcroft, and others without whose involvement and \nhelp this compromise would not be possible.\n  I also thank the Secretary of Transportation and the head of the \nNational Highway Transportation Safety Administration.\n  I will submit a more detailed statement on this issue later, but I \nwould like to quickly summarize what's happening. This amendment \ndeletes the airbag provision in the pending measure and replaces it \nwith an alternative that codifies the current rule suspending the \nunbelted crash barrier test and requires the Secretary to begin \nrulemaking on advanced airbags that are more protective of infants, \nchildren and other occupants no later than June 1, 1998.\n  The Secretary would complete the rulemaking next year and the rule \nwill include a phase-in of advanced airbags beginning with model year \n2001 and completed by no later than model year 2005.\n  The pace of the phase-in shall be determined by the Secretary and \nshall be as rapid as practicable, but does permit the Secretary to \npostpone benchmark dates by one year with cause. Any further delays \nwould require an Act of Congress.\n  Again, I thank all Members who were a part of this effort. I believe \nit will contribute significantly to traffic safety and I will submit a \nmore detailed statement for the Record at a later time.\n  I want to say, Mr. President, that Senator Kempthorne saw that this \nissue entailed enormous tragedies. I don't know how one could see an \ninfant being decapitated without being deeply moved. Unfortunately, it \nwasn't a single incident. There have been numerous fatalities of \nchildren. I think Senator Kempthorne's amendment which he will be \nproposing will be shortly forthcoming.\n  Mr. President, pending the appearance of Senator Kempthorne, I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer along with \nCommerce Committee Chairman, Senator McCain, the Commerce Committee \namendment to S. 1173, the International Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act (ISTEA).\n  Mr. President, the Commerce Committee has worked together, in a true \nshowing of bipartisanship, to craft this amendment. In this amendment \nthe Committee has developed proposals to improve travel safety on our \nnation's roads and waterways, promote the safe shipment of hazardous \nmaterial, advance pipeline transportation safety, and ensure that our \nnation's commercial motor vehicle fleet is well maintained and \noperated. This is not to say that we have left all of our policy \ndisagreements behind us with this amendment. There are several that \nremain to be resolved and we are still attempting to resolve those \nissues. But on balance we have an amendment with which we all may be \nproud. I will take a few minutes to outline the amendment's more \nimportant provisions.\n  The amendment reauthorizes various grant programs administered by the \nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), designed to \nimprove road safety. The amendment reauthorizes grants to develop \ncountermeasures to alcohol-impaired driving. Two new grant programs are \nalso created. One encourages States to provide for the primary \nenforcement of seat belt laws. The second encourages states to improve \nthe quality of their highway safety data.\n  The amendment reauthorizes funding and strengthens the programs to \nensure the safe transportation of hazardous materials. It expands \nhazardous materials training access by allowing states to use a portion \nof these grants to assist in training small businesses in complying \nwith regulations. We also strengthen enforcement by giving the \nSecretary of Transportation the authority to issue emergency orders \nwhen it is determined that an unsafe condition poses an imminent \nhazard.\n  The amendment also reauthorizes the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance \nProgram (MCSAP) which provides funding to the states for commercial \ndriver and vehicle safety inspections, traffic enforcement, compliance \nreviews, and safety data collection. Moreover, the amendment removes \nmany of the program's prescriptive requirements in favor of a \nperformance based approach.\n\n[[Page S1227]]\n\nThe Secretary will have the authority to order unsafe carriers to cease \noperations. We also authorize additional funds to ensure the timely and \naccurate exchange of important carrier and driver safety records.\n  Perhaps most importantly, we provide the Secretary with the authority \nto establish pilot programs and grant waivers of regulations to motor \ncarriers. If carriers can show that an alternative approach to \nregulation will aid safety and be less burdensome, the Secretary can \nauthorize such an alternative. Regulation can be tailored to specific \ncircumstances rather than ``one-size-fits-all'' regulation.\n  In the area of rail and mass transportation safety as requested by \nthe Administration we provide for criminal sanctions in cases of \nviolent attacks against railroads, their employees, and passengers. The \namendment also extends the basic Wallop-Breaux Aquatic Resources Trust \nFund for boating safety and reauthorizes the Clean Vessel Act, \nallocating $10 million annually for state marine sanitation device \nprojects and $10 million annually for state boating infrastructure \nprojects.\n  As I noted earlier, not all of our policy disagreements have been \nsolved. I continue to be concerned about three provisions which seem to \nundermine our efforts to achieve safer highways. These provisions would \nallow exemptions from federal regulations for utility drivers and those \nengaged in agri-business. Specifically, the federal hours of service \nact which governs how long a driver may drive in any one day, the \nhazardous materials transportation requirement that ensures that \nemergency response teams have the necessary information to combat a \nhazard material incident, and the Commercial Driver's License (CDL) \nrequirements are waived under these provisions.\n  I think these exemption provisions ``go the wrong way'' on safety. \nIndeed, the provisions are also unnecessary given the other provision \nthat allows DOT to develop safe pilot programs and waivers for \nindividuals, companies, and industries. I would like these provisions \nmodified and I remain hopeful that we can work out these issues.\n  With that caveat I believe that the Commerce Committee has under the \nleadership of Senator McCain, given us an ISTEA amendment that we all \ncan support and I commend it to the Senate.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, let me just express my appreciation to the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee for the leadership which he has \nprovided us and for the bipartisan approach he has taken in crafting \nthe amendment which is before us. I would like to associate myself with \nhis comments and observations with respect to the so-called ``industry \nexceptions'' in airbag provisions.\n  There are generic provisions that provide for pilot projects which I \nthink is appropriate. And, as the Senator has pointed out, a commitment \nwas made during the markup to try to work out some of the concerns that \nhave been voiced by some of our colleagues who want these wider \nexceptions in airbags. Unfortunately, as the Senator from Arizona has \npointed out, we have not yet reached an agreement on those areas. But I \nwant to work with him, and I pledge my support in trying to fashion a \ncompromise that does not emasculate the safety provisions and give \nblanket exceptions and waivers under the provisions of the amendment \nwhich is currently part of the amendment which has been proffered.\n  Let me also acknowledge and compliment the chairman on his leadership \nin bringing those of us together who have worked for many years on the \nairbag legislation. That legislation has its genesis in the 1991 ISTEA \nmarkup, at which time the senior Senator from Washington and I worked \nto incorporate those airbag provisions into the legislation. We \nrecognize, as do all Members, that the unexpected infant fatality count \nas a result of by and large the inappropriate placement of infant seats \nhas caused the problem that we want to respond to. I believe, \nunder Senator McCain's leadership, he brought a group of us together, \nand through several sessions we have worked out a compromise that is \npart of this legislation. I am pleased to endorse it.\n\n  So I look forward to working with the distinguished Senator from \nArizona as we process this part of the highway legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the amendment be \nconsidered as original text for the purposes of amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning \nbusiness for approximately 7 minutes. It is relevant to the bill but \nnot to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized to speak as if in morning business for up to 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I want to preface my remarks by thanking the \nleadership on both sides of the political aisle, the able and \ndistinguished chairman, Senator Chafee, as well as the able and \ndistinguished ranking member, Senator Baucus, for an agreement which \nhas put an additional $26 billion in terms of contract authority into \nthis legislation that we are processing. This is no inconsiderable \naccomplishment. I recognize that leadership effort lasted for a number \nof months. It involved Senators Phil Gramm, Senator Byrd, and others. \nBut this is a very important thing. It is bipartisan. I am pleased to \nsupport that effort.\n  There are many Federal programs that provide important services to \nthe States. But, as a former Governor, I can tell you that there is no \nFederal program that is more important than the highway program.\n  In addition, the funding mechanism for Federal transportation \nfunding--the gas tax--creates an even great and moral and ethical \nobligation for us to do our work, and to provide a long-term \nreauthorization of ISTEA.\n  The mechanism that my colleague has chosen in putting this compromise \ntogether; namely, using the highway component of the additional 4.3 \ncent gas tax to provide this additional contract authority, I think is \nparticularly appropriate and very sound and a sensible means to provide \nthat enhanced contract authority.\n  Although Nevada is still small by the national standard, in the last \ndecade we have experienced the most rapid growth rate of any State in \nthe Nation.\n  Although there are still plenty of sparsely populated, wide-open \nspaces, we have also become the most heavily urbanized State. While in \nmany respects this tremendous growth has been a positive development, \nthe growth has brought with it a host of infrastructure demands that we \nare currently struggling to meet.\n  Perhaps the greatest current need in Nevada is highway improvements. \nOur limited interstate system and other Federal highways were largely \ndesigned in the 1950s and early 1960s when Nevada was a far different \nplace than it is today. Despite a tremendous effort by State and local \ngovernments over the past decade, nearly every one of the major \narteries is currently operating far beyond its capacity, and there is \nno end in sight to the increased demand.\n  We need more capacity on our highways, and the Federal Highway \nProgram is a major partner in that effort. The highway needs of Nevada \nare even more acute when viewed in the context of our State's heavy \ndependency upon our largest industry, which is tourism.\n  Despite our increased reliance on air travel, highways, particularly \nroads that connect us to our major markets in California, are the key \nto Nevada's commerce. Some of these major arteries, particularly I-15, \nLas Vegas' major connection to southern California, operate so far \nbeyond capacity that they threaten to become an impediment to Nevada's \nincredible economic success story.\n  In fact, one of the most important demonstration projects the Nevada \ndelegation is pressing for in the pending\n\n[[Page S1228]]\n\nlegislation is a project outside our borders, and that is the widening \nof Interstate 15 in California from Barstow to Victorville. The passage \nof this ISTEA legislation is imperative, and sooner better than later.\n  As we will recall, in the 1991 reauthorization we were successful in \nincluding funding for the ``Spaghetti Bowl,'' the most congested part \nof the downtown access in Las Vegas. Nearly 6 years later, the ground \nbreaking for that project occurred late this last fall. That is an \nindicator of the time lag that it takes for us to get projects \nauthorized and funded to contract and to construction. This time \naround, Nevada's highway needs are even greater than in 1991, and the \nprojects we need to fund in the coming years dwarf the ``Spaghetti \nBowl'' project which previously had been the largest highway project in \nour State's history.\n  Throughout the State, in both northern and southern Nevada, many \nlarge and vital highway projects will need to be financed, and financed \nsoon, and the Federal Government through the ISTEA formula is going to \nbe an essential partner.\n  In southern Nevada, the State plans to expand the major artery to the \nrapidly growing northwest sector of Clark County by greatly expanding \nthe capacity of US-95. In northern Nevada, we need to complete the \nlong-awaited connection between Reno and the State capital in Carson \nCity along US-395, and Carson City itself needs a freeway bypass around \nthe capital and commercial areas. We need money to build a new, safer \nbridge over the Colorado River, taking existing hazardous traffic off \nthe Boulder Dam.\n  Highways and roads are not the only transportation solutions in the \nworks in Nevada. To an extent which would have been unthinkable only a \nfew short years ago, we are becoming increasingly dependent on mass \ntransit. Both of our major metropolitan areas, Las Vegas and Reno, have \nsignificant public bus and paratransit systems which make a major \ncontribution to both mobility and air quality in their respective \ncommunities.\n  The Citizen Area Transit system, or CAT, in southern Nevada, in \nparticular, has been an incredible success story in only a few short \nyears of operation, and it is currently planning on more than doubling \nits bus fleet in the next several years to more than 500 vehicles. CAT \nis also well along in the planning process for a major fixed guideway \nsystem serving the heavily traveled resort corridor.\n  Both the bus fleet expansions and the fixed guideway system are \ncounting on their fair share of Federal transportation dollars, \nsomething that will simply not be there any time soon if we do not \nfinish our work on ISTEA as quickly as possible.\n  The State of Nevada and the assorted local governments have all \nstepped up to the plate. We heard frequently in this partnership with \nthe Federal and State and local governments that local governments must \ndo their fair share. In Nevada, State and local governments have done \ntheir fair share. They have imposed some of the highest highway taxes \nin the Nation upon our residents to provide for those additional \nimprovements which I have alluded to.\n  What we are currently lacking is a solid, long-term commitment from \nthe Federal Government as part of the Federal Government's requirement \nto live up to its partnership responsibilities. In fact, the Federal \nhighway and transit programs are just that, they are bargains, \ncommitments made with the American people.\n  Unfortunately, in what has been a long source of frustration to me, \nfirst as a Governor and now as a U.S. Senator, the Federal Government \nhas not lived up to its side of the bargain. Every time any one of us \nbuys a gallon of gasoline, we pay 18.4 cents to the Federal Government, \nmoney that is supposed to be set aside and dedicated and spent for \nhighway and transit improvements. As we all know, this is often not the \ncase. Somehow, a good part of this funding never makes it back to the \nStates for highway improvements.\n  The trust fund balance now stands at more than $20 billion. By the \nyear 2003, the balance of the trust fund could exceed $70 billion, all \nof which has essentially been taken from the American people under \nfalse pretenses; that is, the money is collected for highway \nimprovements but not fully allocated for that purpose. I am hopeful \nwith the compromise that has been effected that we will work to address \nwhat I believe is a failure of Federal responsibility.\n  The time is right for us to increase transportation funding to levels \nthat more accurately reflect the payments taxpayers have been making to \nthe trust fund and to get to work on some of the very transportation \nand infrastructure problems facing our State and our Nation. Nothing \ncan happen, of course, unless we complete ISTEA soon, and that is why I \nbelieve that it is one of the most important priorities for us to deal \nwith in this session of the Congress.\n  Again, Mr. President, I thank my colleagues who have worked out the \ncompromise that has increased the contract authority by some $26 \nbillion. That is something that every State will benefit from, and a \nState such as my own with a backlog of infrastructure needs will need \nthis additional funding in order to complete these projects.\n\n\n                        wallop-breaux trust fund\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the amendment to S. 1173 offered by me and \nSenator Hollings, on behalf of the Commerce Committee, includes a \nsubtitle relating to the Sport Fish Restoration and Recreational Boat \nSafety programs authorized and funded by several laws comprising the \nFederal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Program. These laws include the \nDingell-Johnson Act of 1950, the Wallop-Breaux Amendments of 1984, the \nWetlands Restoration Act of 1990, and the Clean Vessel Act of 1992. \nThese laws, and the provisions of subtitle F in the amendment that I am \noffering today, are admittedly under the jurisdiction not only of the \nCommerce Committee, but also the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks. However, for the sake of expediency in reauthorizing ISTEA, the \nprovisions relating to the Dingell-Johnson/Wallop-Breaux program in the \nISTEA bill are being considered through this amendment.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I applaud my colleagues on the Commerce Committee, \nparticularly the distinguished Chairman Senator McCain, the ranking \nmember Senator Hollings, and Senators Snowe and Breaux for their hard \nwork on these provisions. Although the subtitle regarding the Dingell-\nJohnson/Wallop-Breaux program is included in the amendment offered on \nbehalf of the Commerce Committee, I would like to express my gratitude \nto my colleagues on that Committee for the opportunity to remain \ninvolved in the negotiations leading to the language in the subtitle, \nand for the recognition that jurisdiction for that subtitle remains \nwithin both Committees. Indeed, the Federal Aid in Sport Fish \nRestoration program, taken in its entirety, is primarily under the \njurisdiction of the Environment and Public Works Committee.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Our Committees have worked together on legislation \nrelating to this program in the past, and on this particular amendment \nthat we are offering today. Both the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works and the Committee on Commerce each maintain jurisdiction \nover different components of this program. Both the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service and the U.S. Coast Guard implement different \ncomponents of the program. The Aquatic Resources Trust Fund, which is \nthe funding source for the Program, is divided into the Sport Fish \nRestoration Account and the Boat Safety Account, which are closely \nintertwined with each other. For example, funds for boat safety \nprograms come not only from the Boat Safety Account but also from the \nSport Fish Restoration Account. In addition, unexpended funds in the \nBoat Safety Account roll over into the Sport Fish Restoration Account. \nThis complicated flow of funds makes the programs almost inseparable. \nIt is my opinion that while each Committee maintains jurisdiction over \ndifferent components of the program, both Committees should work \nclosely and collaboratively on legislation relating to this program.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I wholeheartedly agree with the distinguished Chairman of \nthe Committee on Commerce.\n  Mr. McCAIN. In engaging in this colloquy, Senator Chafee and I \nrecognize that each committee maintains jurisdiction over different \ncomponents of this program and different provisions relating to the \nprogram contained in\n\n[[Page S1229]]\n\nsubtitle F, and further reaffirm our joint commitment, responsibility, \nand jurisdiction regarding the Dingell-Johnson/Wallop-Breaux program. I \nthank the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island for his cooperation \non this matter.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Commerce Committee \nSafety amendment, and wish to commend the Senator from Arizona, Mr. \nMcCain, for his efforts to bring this amendment to the floor. In \nparticular, I commend him and the Committee for its incentive approach \nto the serious problem of drunk driving. The Committee amendment \nprovides four grants that provide additional funding to states that \ntake the zero tolerance approach to drunk driving. States that have \nalready enacted tough laws, like my own State of Maine, are eligible \nfor additional funding, while these grant programs will serve as an \nincentive for other states to pass the tough laws necessary to keep \ndrunk drivers off the roads.\n  I would also like to briefing explain my provision in this amendment \nthat requires Maine and the Department of Transportation to create a \nperformance based system to evaluate a state trucking law to determine \nif it is a safety concern.\n  Maine has lost half of its Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Programs \n(MCSAP) for the last two years--$145,000 per year--because of a state \nlaw providing an exemption from motor carrier safety regulations for \ntrucks traveling within 100 air mile radius of their home base. This \nloss of funding means that the State cannot hire more state troopers \nfor the Motor Vehicle Enforcement Unit and in fact may have to lay off \nanother trooper if this issue is not resolved soon.\n  The Maine law in question is used primarily by construction \ncompanies, farmers, loggers, sand and gravel, landscaping and local \ndelivery vehicles. In another words, small businesses who do intrastate \ndelivery work or must travel some distance to a work site. Maine did a \nstudy for Federal Highway to show that the exemption was not a safety \nproblem, but Federal Highway would not give the state a waiver. The \nState's study, done by the Maine State Police found no safety problems. \nAnd in 1995, the Governor's Task Force on Motor Vehicle Safety, which \nreviewed Maine's truck laws, recommended that this exemption be kept \nbecause it did not have an impact on safety.\n  My language seeks to end this impasse in order to improve safety by \nfirst giving the state its full funding so it can hire more troopers \nand second to evaluate whether or not the exemption is a safety \nproblem. The language requires the State and the Department to work \ntogether to establish a review system for the State to carry out to \ndetermine, based on empirical evidence, whether or not this exemption \nhas a negative impact on safety.\n  The burden will be on Maine to show whether or not there are safety \nimplications to this particular state law. I am confident that this \ncooperative effort will reassure the Department while at the same time \nallowing Maine to improve safety on our roadways.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. McConnell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1681 to Amendment No. 1676\n\n                  (Purpose: To improve airbag safety)\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment will \nbe laid aside. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Kempthorne] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1681 to Amendment No. 1676.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 40, after line 10, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 3106. IMPROVING AIR BAG SAFETY.\n\n       (a) Suspension of Unbelted Barrier Testing.--The provision \n     in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 208, Occupant \n     crash protection, 49 CFR 571.208, that requires air bag-\n     equipped vehicles to be crashed into a barrier using unbelted \n     50th percentile adult male dummies is suspended until either \n     the rule issued under subsection (b) goes into effect or, \n     prior to the effective date of the rule, the Secretary of \n     Transportation, after reporting to the Commerce Committee of \n     the House of Representatives, and the Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation of the Senate, determines by rule \n     that restoring the test is necessary to accomplish the \n     purposes of subsection (b).\n       (b) Rulemaking to Improve Air Bags.--\n       (1) Notice of proposed rulemaking.--Not later than June 1, \n     1998, the Secretary of Transportation shall issue a notice of \n     proposed rulemaking to improve the occupant protection for \n     all occupants provided by Federal Motor Vehicle Safety \n     Standard No. 208, while minimizing the risk to infants, \n     children, and other occupants from injuries and deaths caused \n     by air bags, by means that include advanced air bags.\n       (2) Final rule.--The Secretary shall complete the \n     rulemaking required by this subsection by issuing, not later \n     than June 1, 1999, a final rule consistent with paragraph \n     (1). If the Secretary determines that the final rule cannot \n     be completed by that date to meet the purposes of paragraph \n     (1), and advises the Congress of the reasons for this \n     determination, the Secretary may extend the date for issuing \n     the final rule by not more than one year. The Congress may, \n     by joint resolution, grant a further extension of the date \n     for issuing a final rule.\n       (3) Methods to ensure protection.--Notwithstanding \n     subsection (a) of this section, the rule required by \n     paragraph (2) may include such tests, including tests with \n     dummies of different sizes, as the Secretary determines to be \n     reasonable, practicable, and appropriate to meet the purposes \n     of paragraph (1).\n       (4) Effective date.--The final rule issued under this \n     subsection shall become effective in phases as rapidly as \n     practicable, beginning not earlier than September 1, 2001, \n     and not later than September 1, 2002, and shall become \n     effective not later than September 1, 2005, for all motor \n     vehicles in which air bags are required to be installed. If \n     the Secretary determines that the September 1, 2005, \n     effective date is not practicable to meet the purposes of \n     paragraph (1), the Secretary may extend the effective date \n     for not more than one year. The Congress may, by joint \n     resolution, grant a further extension of the effective date.\n       (c) Report on Air Bag Improvements.--Not later than 6 \n     months after the enactment of this section, the Secretary of \n     Transportation shall report to Congress on the development of \n     technology to improve the protection given by air bags and \n     reduce the risks from air bags. To the extent possible, the \n     report shall describe the performance characteristics of \n     advanced air bag devices, their estimated cost, their \n     estimated benefits, and the time within which they could be \n     installed in production vehicles.\n       On page 167, after the matter appearing after line 18, \n     insert the following:\n       Strike section 1407 of the bill.\n       In the table of sections for the bill, strike the item \n     relating to section 1407.\n       Amend the table of sections for the bill by inserting the \n     following item at the appropriate place:\n\nSec. 3406. Improving air bag safety.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, this amendment deals with the airbag \nissue. Before I describe this amendment, I want to commend and thank \nSenator McCain, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, for all of his \ntremendous help and leadership and assistance on this issue of airbag \nsafety, as well as Senator Bryan of Nevada who has had a keen interest \nin this for a number of years also. I appreciate the comments Senator \nMcCain made a few moments ago about my involvement in this issue of \nairbag safety.\n  This amendment does a variety of things, but one of the things that \nis very important is that it affirms that airbags are to be \nsupplemental restraint systems, which is stamped on all the cars, \n``SRS,'' supplemental restraint systems. They are not the primary \nrestraint system, which is your seatbelt. I think whatever source you \nmay look to, you will find that the seatbelt is the safest device that \nyou can use in your car.\n  With the airbags that have been placed in cars, we now see on the new \ncars it points out that this airbag may kill children. The tragedy is \nthat, in fact, it has killed children. The numbers that just came out \nhave indicated that 54 kids now have been killed by airbags, 36 drivers \nhave been killed by airbags and four adult passengers, for a total of \n94 individuals who have been killed by these airbags.\n  I am one who believes that airbags certainly can be a good safety \ndevice when they are designed to standards\n\n[[Page S1230]]\n\nthat place them in their intended role as supplemental safety devices. \nThis allows us now, and I will not go into the details because Senator \nMcCain has laid that out very well, but this now allows us to go \nthrough with the Secretary of Transportation the rulemaking and the \ntesting. It allows us to have a testing of these airbags for all sizes \nof adults. It is going to allow us to now have safer bags that will \nsave lives so that we will not see these costly tragic numbers that I \nhave just recited, and it will protect occupants of all sizes.\n  I do believe that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, \nNHTSA, has had the authority to go forward with this. Their repeated \nconclusion is that they did not.\n  Mr. President, recognizing that Senator McCain is the chairman of the \nSenate Commerce Committee with jurisdiction over issues related to \ntraffic safety, is he aware that the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration says current law does not allow airbags to be regulated \nas supplemental restraint systems, and specifically that NHTSA does not \nhave the legal authority to repeal the so called unbelted test \nstandard?\n  As the Senator knows, the American Law Division of the Library of \nCongress has reviewed this issue and has concluded that NHTSA has ample \nlegal authority to repeal the unbelted test. The view of the Library of \nCongress is supported by a number of other legal experts as well.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I agree that NHTSA currently has the statutory authority \nto modify the testing methodology for airbags to advance their safety \nor efficiency.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Is it the Senator's view that this amendment is \nconsistent with the statutory interpretation that airbags are \nsupplemental restraint systems, not primary restraint systems, and \nshould be regulated in such a fashion and do you agree that airbags do \nnot substitute for lap and shoulder belts and that all occupants should \nalways wear safety belts regardless of whether there is an inflatable \nrestraint in the vehicle?\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator raises an important point. Airbags are an \nimportant safety device, but they are designed to supplement the \nprotection offered by safety belts. Safety belts are the primary safety \ndevice and should be worn by all vehicle occupants.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Does the Senator agree that the pending amendment \naffirms the responsibility of the Secretary of Transportation to \nimprove the occupant safety of all occupants provided by Federal Motor \nVehicle Standard No. 208 while minimizing the risk to infants, \nchildren, and other occupants from injuries and death caused by airbags \nand, in order to accomplish the rule making required by this amendment, \nthe Secretary shall include tests with dummies of different sizes \nrepresenting the full range of occupants from infants to adults? The \namendment only allows the Secretary of Transportation to reimpose the \ncurrent safety standard after giving full advance notice to Congress, \nafter giving the public time and opportunity to comment and then only \nif he or she concludes that doing so would protect infants and \nchildren, as well as other occupants, from death and injury. This \namendment does not change the policy that airbags are still a \nsupplemental, not a primary restraint system.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Airbags are certainly not a substitute for safety belts. \nI want to emphasize again that all vehicle occupants should always wear \na safety belt.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Thank you. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record two legal opinions that make clear NHTSA had and retains the \nlegal authority to repeal or modify the unbelted seat belt standard.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Mayer, Brown & Platt,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 22, 1997.\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n     To: Phillip D. Brady.\n     From: Erika Z. Jones.\n     Re NHTSA's authority to repeal or suspend the unbelted test \n         in FMVSS 208.\n       You asked for a legal analysis of the question of whether \n     NHTSA could lawfully repeal or suspend the current \n     requirement in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208 \n     requiring manufacturers to certify compliance in both the \n     belted and unbelted conditions. We conclude that there are no \n     legal constraints on NHTSA's authority to do so.\n\n\n                               background\n\n       FMVSS 208 (49 C.F.R. Section 571.208) specifies performance \n     standards for occupant protection in crashes. Among its \n     requirements, FMVSS 208 currently requires manufacturers to \n     certify compliance with the performance standards in two \n     conditions: first, with the crash test dummy belted with the \n     manual three-point safety belt, and second, with the dummy \n     unbelted. See S10(b)(1) of FMVSS 208.\n       In 1991, Congress enacted the Intermodal Surface \n     Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) (Pub. L. 102-240). Part \n     B of the ISTEA, cited as the National Highway Traffic Safety \n     Administration Authorization Act of 1991, included Section \n     2508 which mandated that the Secretary of Transportation \n     shall amend FMVSS 208 to provide that ``the automatic \n     occupant crash protection system'' of each new passenger car \n     and light truck ``shall be an inflatable restraint complying \n     with the occupant protection requirements under section \n     4.1.2.1'' of FMVSS 208. The section continued that it \n     ``supplements and revises, but does not replace, Federal \n     Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208, including the amendment to \n     such Standard 208 of March 26, 1991 [citation omitted] \n     extending the requirements for automatic crash protection . . \n     . to trucks, buses and multipurpose passenger vehicles.''\n       In 1994, Congress enacted Public Law 103-272 on July 5, \n     1994. Section 1 of that Act explained that general and \n     permanent ``laws related to transportation . . . are revised, \n     codified, and eanacted . . . without substantive change.'' \n     Thus, the codification Act transferred the provisions of the \n     former National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act from \n     Title 15 to Title 49. In the process of the codification, \n     most provisions of the Act were restated, with some omitted \n     as unnecessary or amended for clarity, although none of the \n     omissions or amendments was intended to introduce substantive \n     change.\n       The air bag mandate in the ISTEA found itself codified at \n     49 U.S.C. Sec. 30127, ``Automatic Occupant Crash Protection \n     and Seat Belt Use.'' The codified language reads as follows:\n       ``(b) Inflatable restraint requirements.--(1) . . . The \n     amendment shall require that the automatic occupant crash \n     protection system for both of the front outboard seating \n     positions for [passenger cars and light trucks] be an \n     inflatable restraint (with lap and shoulder belts) complying \n     with the occupant protection requirements under section \n     4.1.2.1 of Standard 208.''\n       The codification also retains most of the statement of \n     intent that originally appeared as part of the air bag \n     mandate. The original statement of intent asserted that \n     ``[t]his section supplements and revises, but does not \n     replace, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208 . . .''. \n     In the codification, however, the new placement of this \n     provision is in Sec. 30127(f), now stating that ``[t]his \n     section revises, but does not replace, Standard 208 as in \n     effect on December 18, 1991, . . .''. The reference to \n     ``supplement[ing]'' FMVSS 208 was omitted in the \n     codification, apparently due to a view that it was \n     unnecessary.\n       In addition, the codification did not substantively change \n     the ISTEA provisions that instructed NHTSA to amend FMVSS 208 \n     to require that each owners' manual explain that ``the `air \n     bag' is a supplemental restraint and is not a substitute for \n     lap and shoulder belts'' and that ``occupants should always \n     wear their lap and shoulder belts, if available, or other \n     safety belts, whether or not there is an inflatable \n     restraint.'' Sec. 30127(c)(2) and (4).\n       The evidence suggests that the requirement for FMVSS 208 \n     certification in the unbelted condition is dictating air bag \n     inflation output that is greater than would be necessary if \n     the unbelted certification test were eliminated or suspended. \n     NHTSA has recently acknowledged that the substantial \n     inflation output of current air bags designs can pose risks \n     to some front seat occupants, particularly children and small \n     statured adults. For example, NHTSA's recent rulemaking \n     notices extending the air bag cutoff switch option in certain \n     vehicles, proposing to permit depowering of air bags and \n     proposing to authorize disconnection of air bags by dealers \n     all contain substantial discussions of the ``adverse effects \n     of current air bag designs.'' See 62 Fed. Reg. 798-844 \n     (January 6, 1997).\n       In its original incarnation, FMVSS 208 was intended \n     primarily to protect unbelted adult occupants, because safety \n     belt use was very low. In 1984, when FMVSS 208 was \n     reinstated, NHTSA observed that driver safety belt use in the \n     front seat was approximately 14% nationwide. Today, however, \n     adult safety belt use in the front seat is estimated to be \n     close to 70%, due in large measure to the success of state \n     safety belt usage laws, all of which were enacted within the \n     last thirteen years. Today, all states but one require safety \n     belt usage by vehicle occupants, and these requirements, \n     coupled with seat belt usage education efforts, have been \n     successful in raising safety belt usage to levels far in \n     excess of those contemplated in 1984.\n       Of at least equal significance, there is no sign that \n     Congress considered any evidence of the risks to children and \n     small adult front seat occupants from air bags designed to \n     meet the requirements of FMVSS 208 when the ISTEA was enacted \n     in 1991.\n     \n                                *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n[[Page S1231]]\n\n\n       NHTSA has now concluded that the ISTEA air bag mandate, as \n     codified in Title 49, requires the agency to retain the \n     unbelted compliance test because its repeal would eviscerate \n     the requirement for ``automatic occupant crash protection \n     system[s].'' In a letter dated January 13, 1997 to Senator \n     Dirk Kempthorne, NHTSA Administrator Martinez explained the \n     agency's reasoning as follows:\n       ``If the unbelted test were eliminated from FMVSS No. 208, \n     such that vehicles only had to satisfy the performance \n     requirements of the standard with the manual belts attached, \n     there would be no way to ensure that the air bags would in \n     fact provide ``automatic'' protection to front seat \n     occupants.''\n       NHTSA thus advised Senator Kempthorne that it ``lack[s] \n     legal authority to eliminate the unbelted test''.\n       For reasons discussed in more detail below, we do not \n     concur that NHTSA is so constrained in its authority to \n     interpret the statute and the standard. In particular, NHTSA \n     retains authority to interpret the statute and the standard \n     in a manner that achieves the safety objectives of FMVSS 208 \n     and the ISTEA mandate for an automatic crash protection \n     system--which is an air bag as a supplemental restraint.\n\n\n                                analysis\n\n       General principles of administrative law recognize that \n     regulatory agencies ``must be given ample latitude to adapt \n     their rules and policies to the demands of changing \n     circumstances,'' as long as the changed policy is accompanied \n     by a ``reasoned analysis for the change.'' Motor Vehicle \n     Manufacturers' Ass'n. v. State Farm, 463 U.S. 29, 42 (1983) \n     (internal quotations and citations omitted). Therefore, \n     unless there is an explicit or implicit restriction in the \n     Vehicle Safety Act, as amended by ISTEA, precluding NHTSA \n     from responding to the newly acknowledged information about \n     safety risks posed by current air bag designs, NHTSA retains \n     ``ample latitude'' to amend FMVSS 208 to remove the unbelted \n     test.\n     1. The Vehicle Safety Act Does Not Explicitly Preclude NHTSA \n         From Repealing or Suspending the Unbelted Test\n       Nothing in 49 U.S.C. Sec. 30127 or in Sec. 2508 of ISTEA \n     explicitly precludes NHTSA from repealing or suspending the \n     unbelted certification test in FMVSS 208.\n       First, nothing in ISTEA Sec. 2508 amends, restricts or \n     otherwise affects NHTSA's plenary authority to amend safety \n     standards, authority which is incorporated in the general \n     rulemaking authority to ``prescribe'' motor vehicle safety \n     standards in 49 U.S.C. Section 30111(a). In fact, the \n     ISTEA language carefully states that the amendment \n     ``supplements and revises, but does not replace'' FMVSS \n     208. And, as discussed above, administrative law \n     principles recognize the authority agencies have to amend \n     their rules to reflect changed circumstances. Absent an \n     explicit Congressional direction limiting that plenary \n     authority in the case of FMVSS 208, NHTSA retains its \n     general authority to amend its safety standards.\n       Second, when Congress wishes to ``freeze'' a regulation in \n     place, it knows how to do so. For example, Section 216(7) of \n     the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 7550(7)) ``froze'' the \n     then-existing EPA definitions for certain terms for purposes \n     of the emission standards established by that Act, in the \n     following way:\n       The terms ``vehicle curb weight,'' ``gross vehicle weight \n     rating'' (GVWR), ``light-duty truck'' (LDT), ``light-duty \n     vehicle,'' and ``loaded vehicle weight'' (LVW) have the \n     meaning provided in regulations promulgated by the \n     Administrator and in effect as of November 15, 1990. The \n     abbreviations in parentheses corresponding to any term \n     referred to in this paragraph shall have the same meaning as \n     the corresponding term. 42 U.S.C. Sec. 7550(7).\n       Since no such explicit restriction ``freezing'' the 1991 \n     edition of FMVSS 208 in general, or S4.1.2.1 in particular, \n     was incorporated into the ISTEA amendments, NHTSA is not \n     precluded by statute from amending FMVSS 208, or interpreting \n     it in such a way as to repeal or suspend the unbelted \n     compliance test.\n       Althouth some may argue that the language is the codified \n     Vehicle Safety Act referring to a revision to FMVSS 208 ``as \n     in effect on December 18, 1991'' is tantamount to a \n     ``freezing'' of the requirements of FMVSS 208 as stated on \n     that date, such an argument cannot survive. First, the quoted \n     language did not appear in the ISTEA itself. Since the \n     codification expressly stated that it was not intended to \n     introduce any substantive change, the inclusion of the \n     December 18, 1991 effective date in the codification (but not \n     the original enactment of ISTEA) cannot have any substantive \n     meaning, and surely cannot convey an intent by Congress in \n     1991 or 1994 to ``freeze'' FMVSS 208 in the context of the \n     December 18, 1991 provisions. Second, the quoted language \n     does not appear in the substantive requirements for air bag \n     installation, which appear in subsection (b) of Section \n     30127. Rather, the quoted reference to the December 18, 1991 \n     version of FMVSS 208 appears in subsection (f) of that \n     section, which states that the air bag mandate ``revises, but \n     does not replace, Standard 208 as in effect on December 18, \n     1991.'' In that context, the citation to the December 18, \n     1991 version of Standard 208 is nothing more than a reference \n     point, rather than a legislative desire to ``freeze'' the \n     requirements. Finally, NHTSA has already compromised any \n     theory that the December 1991 provisions of FMVSS 208 are \n     legally ``frozen''; for example, NHTSA has already amended \n     FMVSS 208 to allow air bag cutoff switches which clearly \n     amended FMVSS 208 to allow air bag cutoff switches which \n     clearly affect the ``automatic'' nature of the protection \n     afforded by the air bag.\n       The ISTEA, as codified in Title 49, thus does not \n     explicitly limit NHTSA's plenary authority to amend FMVSS 208 \n     to respond to the concerns about air bag inflator output in \n     general, or to repeal the unbelted test in particular.\n     2. The Vehicle Safety Act Does Not Implicitly Preclude NHTSA \n         From Repealing or Suspending the Unbelted Test\n       For several reasons, there is no implicit constraint on \n     NHTSA's authority to amend FMVSS 208, including S4.1.2.1 if \n     necessary, to eliminate the requirement for certification \n     with an unbelted test dummy.\n       First, as noted above, there was no express constraints \n     included in ISTEA or the codified Vehicle Safety Act on \n     NHTSA's authority to amend FMVSS 208 in any respect. As long \n     as the proposed amendment otherwise satisfies the Vehicle \n     Safety Act's criteria for rulemaking (objectively, \n     practicability, safety necessity), nothing precludes NHTSA \n     from promulgating such an amendment, particularly in light of \n     Congress intent to consider air bags as supplemental \n     restraints, as well as the more recent acknowledgement by the \n     agency that current air bag designs may pose safety risks for \n     some small front seat occupants.\n       Second, nothing precludes NHTSA from electing to test \n     compliance with FMVSS 208 with a belted (as opposed to an \n     unbelted) test dummy. In enacting ISTEA, Congress expressed a \n     preference--indeed, a mandate--for an occupant protection \n     system that included both an air bag and a ``lap/shoulder \n     belt'', which NHTSA has interpreted to mean a manual, three-\n     point seat belt. NHTSA has ample authority to revise FMVSS \n     208 to reflect supplemental occupant protection, and to \n     decide to evaluate compliance in accordance with this \n     Congressional preference, i.e., with air bags in combination \n     with manual three-point seat belts. The literal language of \n     the codified Vehicle Safety Act strongly supports this \n     interpretation, noting that the automatic protection shall \n     ``be in inflatable restraint (with lap and shoulder belts)'' \n     (Emphasis supplied).\n       Third, even if NHTSA were not persuaded that it should \n     interpret the ISTEA mandate to authorize (indeed, prefer) \n     testing the air bag as a supplemental restraint in \n     combination with lap/shoulder belts pursuant to the currently \n     prescribed belted test, NHTSA has substantially overstated \n     the concern (as expressed in the letter to Senator \n     Kempthorne) that elimination of the unbelted test would mean \n     that there would be ``no way to ensure that the air bags \n     would in fact provide `automatic' protection to front seat \n     occupants. If NHTSA wished to assure that the air bag was \n     providing some additional ``protection'' over and above the \n     lap/shoulder belt, then the agency could modify the standard \n     to evaluate in the belted test the incremental protection \n     provided ``automatically'' (i.e., separately) by air bags. \n     There is no legal reason why such a separate evaluation has \n     to be an unbelted test measuring the same four injury \n     criteria currently in force. For example, NHTSA could add to \n     the belted test some injury criterion which likely could not \n     be met in a vehicle without an air bag. NHTSA has not taken, \n     and could not take, the position that it is without authority \n     to change the injury criteria by which air bag performance is \n     measured. Indeed, NHTSA is proposing elsewhere to do exactly \n     that--revise the injury criteria for thorax acceleration--\n     although that is being proposed for other reasons.\n       While it is true that NHTSA could not, consistent with the \n     ISTEA mandate, amend FMVSS 208 in such a way as to eviscerate \n     the air bag mandate entirely, an amendment of FMVSS 208 to \n     eliminate the unbelted test would not be such a radical \n     change to the standard. Indeed, there is nothing in ISTEA to \n     suggest that Congress subscribed to the original FMVSS 208 \n     notion that the occupant protection afforded by air bags \n     should necessarily be evaluated without manual safety belts. \n     The Congressional mandate that lap/shoulder belts \n     (interpreted by NHTSA to mean manual three-point safety \n     belts) be provided along with air bags--a substantial \n     enlargement of the original requirements of FMVSS 208, which \n     would have protected unbelted occupants--along with the \n     mandate for owner's manual revisions regarding air bags as \n     supplemental restraints, all suggest instead that Congress \n     understood the modern view that air bags are supplemental, \n     not primary, occupant protection and must be used along with \n     manual safety belts for optimal protection. Given that \n     Congress directed this substantial revision to FMVSS 208 as \n     part of the ISTEA amendment, it would be entirely reasonable \n     for NHTSA to conclude that compliance with the new FMVSS 208 \n     requirements should be evaluated with a belted, not an \n     unbelted, test dummy.\n     3. NHTSA's Own Recent Rulemaking Actions Show That The Agency \n         Retains Substantial Discretion to Amend FMVSS 208, \n         Including With Respect to the Air Bag Mandate\n       NHTSA has recently adopted an amendment to FMVSS 208 \n     extending the previously authorized cutoff switch to vehicles \n     manufactured after the affective date of the ISTEA mandate \n     for ``automatic'' protection. This amendment belies any \n     proffered limitation on NHTSA's authority to change the \n     nature of the ``automatic'' protection provided\n\n[[Page S1232]]\n\n     under FMVSS 208. Indeed, if NHTSA could not lawfully \n     eliminate the unbelted compliance test, because it would \n     leave unevaluated the Congressional mandate that \n     ``automatic'' protection be provided by means of ``inflatable \n     restraints,'' then how could NHTSA permit cutoff switches, \n     which permit the ``automatic'' protection to be eliminated \n     altogether when the switch is activated?\n       In fact, NHTSA is not constrained by ISTEA or the codified \n     Vehicle Safety Act from adopting an amendment that eliminates \n     the unbelted compliance test, if the rulemaking record \n     justifies doing so. NHTSA's amendment of FMVSS 208 to permit \n     cutoff switches is an implicit acknowledgement of the \n     agency's authority to revise FMVSS 208 to reflect \n     contemporary developments in motor vehicle safety.\n       NHTSA's recent proposals to amend the test conditions of \n     FMVSS 208 in other respects, such as by raising the thorax \n     injury criterion to 80 G's, from the current level of 60 G's, \n     further reflect the agency's acknowledgement of its plenary \n     authority to revise FMVSS 208 to reflect modern \n     understandings of motor vehicle safety needs.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Nothing in the ISTEA or the codified Vehicle Safety Act \n     explicitly or implicitly constrains NHTSA's authority to \n     repeal the unbelted compliance test for certification with \n     FMVSS 208.\n       Although the statute indisputably requires ``automatic'' \n     protection by means of ``inflatable restraints,'' NHTSA \n     retains full authority to define what the protection criteria \n     will be, and how the protection will be evaluated. Congress \n     did not evidence any intention of constraining NHTSA's \n     authority and responsibility to do so.\n                                  ____\n\n                                   Congressional Research Service,\n\n\n                                      The Library of Congress,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 31, 1997.\n     To: Honorable Dirk Kempthorne; Attention: Gary Smith.\n     From: American Law Division.\n     Subject: Whether the Administrator of the National Highway \n         Transportation Safety Board Has the Authority to Amend, \n         Alter, Change or Otherwise Supplement the Test Procedures \n         for Automatic Restraints Set Out in Paragraph S10(b)(1) \n         of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208 (49 C.F.R. \n         Sec. 571.208, para. S10(b)(1)).\n\n       You are concerned that the current testing of vehicle \n     airbags has led to a standard for airbag deployment which may \n     in some situations actually imperil vehicle occupants, and \n     would, therefore, like for the Administrator of the National \n     Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) to order \n     tests to determine whether and to what extent airbag \n     deployment pressure might be reduced. The Administrator has \n     informed you that it is his belief that he is prohibited from \n     doing so. Accordingly, you have asked that we review a \n     memorandum prepared by the law firm, Mayer, Brown & Platt, \n     which concludes that the Administrator does have the \n     authority to amend the vehicle safety standard which sets \n     forth the test dummy positioning procedures for crash-testing \n     motor vehicles (Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) \n     208 para. S10(b)(1), Occupant crash protection, 49 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 571.208 para. S10(b)(1)). For the reasons discussed \n     below, we conclude that there is ample evidence to support \n     that conclusion; and further, that there may not be any need \n     to amend the language of the referenced paragraph.\n\n\n                               Background\n\n       In 1966, Congress determined that it was necessary to \n     ``establish motor vehicle safety standards'' in order to \n     protect the public against ``unreasonable risk of accidents \n     occurring as a result of the design, construction or \n     performance of motor vehicles [or the] unreasonable risk of \n     death or injury to persons in the event accidents do occur.'' \n     The same Act required the Secretary of Transportation ``to \n     establish by order appropriate Federal motor vehicle safety \n     standards.'' and further authorized the Secretary ``by order \n     [to] amend or revoke any Federal motor vehicle safety \n     standard established under this section . . . [taking into \n     consideration] relevant available motor vehicle safety data, \n     including the results of research, development, testing and \n     evaluation activities conducted pursuant to this Act.''\n       In response, the Secretary, through the Administrator of \n     NHTSA, promulgated Part 571 of 49 C.F.R., ``Federal Motor \n     Vehicle Safety Standards,'' which include FMVSS 208, Occupant \n     crash protection. The stated purpose for promulgating the \n     Standard was ``to reduce the number of deaths of vehicle \n     occupants, and the severity of injuries . . .''\n       In the ``National Highway Traffic Safety Administration \n     Authorization Act of 1991,'' Congress directed the Secretary \n     of Transportation ``to promulgate, in accordance with the \n     National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 . . \n     . an amendment to [FMVSS] 208 to provide that the \n     automatic crash protection system for the front outboard \n     designated positions of [certain described vehicles] . . . \n     shall be an inflatable restraint [i.e., an airbag]. . . \n     .''\n       The same section states that it ``revises, but does not \n     replace [FMVSS] 208,'' merely extending the ``automatic crash \n     protection'' requirement to ``trucks, buses, and multipurpose \n     vehicles.''\n       FMVSS 208 para. S10(b)(1), which sets forth the way in \n     which ``automatic restraints'' are to be tested, states that \n     ``In a vehicle equipped with an automatic restraint at each \n     front outbound seating position . . . each test dummy is not \n     restrained during one frontal test . . . by an means that \n     require occupant action. If the vehicle has a manual seat \n     belt provided by the manufacturer . . . then a second front \n     test is conducted . . . and each test dummy is restrained \n     both by the automatic restraint system and the manual seat \n     belt . . .''\n\n\n                               Discussion\n\n       As the Mayer, Brown memorandum correctly states, \n     ``[g]eneral principal of administrative law recognize that \n     administrative agencies `must be given ample latitude to \n     adapt their rules and policies to the demands of changing \n     circumstances,' as long as the changed policy is accompanied \n     by a `reasoned analysis for the change.' '' \\11\\ Only in the \n     case of a mandate in which Congress has specified some or all \n     of the specifies to be included in any Agency's promulgations \n     would an Agency be precluded from altering or amending those \n     specifics; the statute which first required that motor \n     vehicle safety standards be enacted contained only the \n     directive to the Secretary of Transportation that he \n     promulgate ``appropriate Federal motor vehicle safety \n     standards,'' and further gave the Secretary the authority to \n     ``by order amend or revoke any Federal motor vehicle safety \n     standard established under this section.'' Accordingly, it \n     would appear that the Administrator of NHTSA not only has the \n     authority to amend his own agency's safety standards, but may \n     be expected to do so when he is in possession of ``relevant \n     available motor vehicle safety data.''\n       That the provision which requires airbags does not envision \n     that ``automatic crash protection'' is to be construed as \n     ``protection afforded in the absence of a seat belt'' is \n     illustrated by the future requirement that\n       ``the owner manuals for passenger cars and trucks, buses, \n     and multipurpose vehicles equipped with an inflatable \n     restraint include a statement in an easily understandable \n     format that\n       ``(1) either or both of the front outboard seating \n     positions . . . are equipped with an inflatable restraint \n     referred to as an `airbag' and a lap and shoulder belt;\n       ``(2) the airbag is a supplemental restraint;\n       ``(3) lap and shoulder belt also must be used correctly . . \n     . to provide restraint or protection. . . .''\n       The only statutory reference to ``automatic'' that our \n     research has uncovered appears in the Conference Report that \n     accompanied ISTEA: ``the Senate notes that the current \n     regulations of the Department of Transportation . . . require \n     that passenger cars be equipped with `passive restraints,' \n     which include either airbags or automatic seatbelts that do \n     not require actions by the occupant in order to be engaged'' \n     (House Conf. Rep. No. 102-404 at 400). In other words, it \n     appears that the statute which requires the installation of \n     airbags as automatic, or passive, restraints neither \n     envisions nor requires (because airbags are considered as \n     ``supplemental'' restraints to be used in conjunction with \n     seatbelts) that they must be tested in unbelted conditions.\n       Finally, we note the improbability, given the languages set \n     out above to emphasize that airbags are to be considered only \n     as a ``supplemental'' restraint, that FMVSS 208 para. \n     S10(b)(1) requires that crash tests to evaluate airbag \n     deployment pressure be conducted on completely unbelted test \n     dummies in order to determine the pressure at which \n     protection from frontal impact crashes would be available.\n                                                  Janice E.

Mr. President, without going back and reciting all of \nthe past history, this is an amendment that, through a collaborative \nprocess, will now bring us to the point of safer air bags.\n  A little girl who was killed in Boise, ID, was the reason for my \ninvolvement in this whole issue. So I hope that the family will find \nsome consolation, some peace, in knowing that the loss of that precious \nlittle child will now lead us to a new era of safer air bags so that \nother families will not have to experience the tragedy that they have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1681) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I personally am in support of the \namendment of the Senator from Idaho. I think it is a good amendment. \nAnd he has moved his amendment, hasn't he?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has been agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Well, put me down as in favor of it.\n  I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S1233]]\n\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded and that I may speak for up to 10 minutes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, the amendment that was agreed to by the Environment \nCommittee with respect to funding for these critical transportation \nprograms for our country really ought to be called the ``Truth In \nTransportation Funding Act'' because it ensures that gasoline taxes \ncollected for transportation purposes will actually be spent on those \ncritical transportation projects.\n  For too long in America, the Congress has played a budgetary shell \ngame--pretending to put funds away in various transportation programs \nbut actually slipping those funds into other spending accounts.\n  Mr. President and colleagues, this con game has been closed down. Now \nCongress is on the way to making the highway trust fund sacrosanct \nagain. Transportation taxes will, indeed, pay for transportation \nservices. This means that the dollars will be used on the ground where \nthey are needed, not squirreled away in some account that never seems \nto be spent.\n  Today, the Congress will be in a position to bring much-needed relief \nto citizens who face transportation gridlock across our country. The \nCongress is adding an additional $26 billion of transportation spending \nto what is now in the Senate ISTEA II bill. This translates for our \nState into an additional $40 million per year.\n  In our State, transportation dollars are now stretched so thin that \nthe State department of transportation is not developing new projects. \nWe have focused our efforts on merely maintaining existing roads \nbecause we did not have funding available to pay for improvements. \nUntil now, there was little hope on the horizon that more funding would \nbe forthcoming.\n  The Environment Committee's amendment is like emergency surgery for \nOregon's clogged transportation arteries. If Congress now passes this \nbill, it will be possible to think in terms of improving the health of \nour transportation system instead of how to avoid further \ndeterioration. We will be in a position to plan improvements to reduce \ncongestion in an already overtaxed system. We can start to think about \nthe future and how to handle our State's growing population, and many \nother parts of our country will be able to do the same.\n  Mr. President and colleagues, I have always believed that you cannot \nhave big league quality of life with little league transportation \nsystems. In the modern world, a transportation bill is about so much \nmore than how you get from point A to point B. A strong infrastructure \nis one of the basic ingredients to any recipe for economic growth. It \nis one of the key things that our businesses look at as they consider \nwhere to locate and one of the principal contributors to our quality of \nlife.\n  I support the Environment Committee's amendment, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support the additional funding needed to build the \ntransportation system our Nation will need to compete in the 21st \ncentury.\n  Let me conclude, Mr. President, by saying that I intend, in the days \nahead, to take to this floor to discuss other parts of this important \nlegislation. Our State has been a leader nationally in developing an \ninnovative approach to managed growth in our country. This legislation \nallocates $20 million per year to reward those States and communities \nthat have been willing to take fresh, creative approaches to handling \ngrowth.\n  I am also working, and there was discussion in the Environment \nCommittee today, with Senator Graham, Senator Bob Smith, and others, on \na way to streamline the process and ensure that the dollars that are \nallocated for transportation projects are spent in the most effective \nway. In the past, there has really been a disconnect between the way \ntransportation dollars are allocated and the environmental permits that \nare associated with actually getting those projects built and on line. \nWe have been working on a bipartisan basis to bring together \nenvironmental leaders, builders, and those who were involved in \nplanning our roads, and we believe that we are on our way to coming up \nwith a streamlined system that is going to make it possible for us to \nsave dollars and ensure that the transportation projects are built \nexpeditiously while we still comply with the critically needed \nenvironmental laws for our country. I intend, in the days ahead, to \ntalk about those commendable features of this legislation as well.\n\n  I want to conclude by congratulating my friend, Senator Baucus, from \nMontana, and Senator Chafee for an extraordinary bit of work. This bill \nis heavy lifting. There are Senators with very strong views. There are \nregional differences of opinion. But I think we have been able to forge \na piece of legislation that is going to make a difference in the 21st \ncentury.\n  I conclude my remarks by especially praising our chairman, who has \nentered the Chamber, John Chafee, and Senator Baucus, the ranking \nminority member, because it is their work that has made it possible for \nus to come to the floor today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Oregon for \nhis kind comments. He has done yeoman's work on the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, not only in connection with this legislation, \nbut with a whole series of environmental legislation. So having praise \nfrom him is doubly satisfying.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Now, Mr. President, we have the so-called Lautenberg \namendment that we would like to take up. This is the amendment that \ndeals with the alcohol content in blood. The amendment would lower the \nalcohol content, which is a test, for drunken driving, from .1 to .08.\n  Mr. President, we would like to enter into a time agreement on this. \nThe time agreement would be something in the neighborhood of an hour \nand a half apiece. And now is the time for those Senators to come to \nthe Chamber if, one, they object to this time agreement, and, two, the \nplan, further, would be that we would vote this evening. In other \nwords, that would take us up to about 6:30, if all the time were used.\n  So I want to send the word out, we are about to enter into this \nagreement. I trust offices are listening to what we are saying here and \nwill come on over or call the cloakroom with their views because we \nwant to move on.\n  We have legislation we have to make progress on. We have been on this \nfloor for some time but now we are ready for this particular amendment, \nthe drinking amendment, which most people are familiar with.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If I might ask my good friend, the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Chafee, wouldn't it also be a good idea for Senators \nwho are interested in an amendment that might be offered by Senator \nMcConnell, with respect to the disadvantaged business enterprise, to \nalso have their staffs come over to the floor so we can potentially \nbegin to work on it, an agreement on that amendment? That is another \namendment that is going to take some time. It is contentious. The more \nwe start working on the provisions of the debate, the more quickly we \ncan reach a time agreement. I guess that would be another subject we \nshould address as well.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Well, I certainly agree with the distinguished ranking \nmember. Senator McConnell has been very thoughtful. He has been on the \nfloor. He is ready to go. We want to find out how many people want to \nspeak on Senator McConnell's amendment so we can get some concept of \nthe time that should be set aside. But that is another amendment.\n\n[[Page S1234]]\n\n  My thinking now is, if we can work out proceeding with the Lautenberg \namendment, tomorrow morning we would take up the financing amendment \nthat was agreed to in the committee today as a result of the agreement \nthat was reached yesterday. There may be some debate on that. I do not \nknow. But we are free to take that up tomorrow.\n  My hope is we would do that tomorrow morning. And then tomorrow \nafternoon we would go to the McConnell amendment. But the Senator from \nKentucky legitimately wants to know how many people want to speak on \nhis amendment. We want a time agreement. He wants a time agreement. I \nam for a time agreement, enthusiastically for a time agreement.\n  So, therefore, would individuals who want to speak on the McConnell \namendment call up the cloakroom, let us know how long they think they \nneed, and which side they will be on so we can figure that out. The \nsame goes with the Lautenberg amendment.\n\n  Time is of the essence. We will reach an agreement pretty quickly on \nthe Lautenberg amendment. Now is the time for people to call with their \nthoughts.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1679\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Now, Mr. President, before the Senate we have the \nWellstone amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I will talk a little bit about that. We \nhave no time agreement, but I will be relatively brief, maybe 10 \nminutes. The Senator from Minnesota will be roughly how long?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I think I can probably try to keep my \nremarks about 20 minutes or so.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Then we would like to go to a vote. At that time I will \nmove to table. We will have a rollcall vote at that time, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Now, Mr. President, the amendment offered by the Senator from \nMinnesota would be timely if the Finance Committee were now considering \na welfare bill. The matter before the Senate, the basic underlying \nbill, is a highway bill, financing for highways.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Minnesota deals with welfare and \naccounting for those welfare recipients who have gone off the rolls, \nhow have they succeeded and what has become of them. That is all well \nand good. But that has nothing to do with highways.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I have urged the Senator to attach it to a \ndifferent bill or withdraw it. I tried to stress to him that what we \nwant to do today is consider bills that deal with the subject before \nus; namely, highways, their funding, how to build them, and different \nideas connected therewith.\n  If the Finance Committee were debating a welfare bill, the amendment \nwould be germane. But we would also oppose it even under those \nconditions because it is costly and unnecessary.\n  Now, when Congress passed the Personal Responsibility and Work \nOpportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996--that was only 18 months ago--\none of the important features of that legislation was a commitment to \nfind out whether the sweeping changes were effective in helping the \nfamilies get off welfare dependency. What we had before us was a \nwelfare bill. In it we had some provisions to ascertain, to do research \non how the bill was working out. Congress appropriated about $44 \nmillion a year to conduct research on the benefits, the effects, the \ncosts of the State programs that were funded under this new law. This \nnew law was a radical departure from the way business had been done in \nthe past. Furthermore, we were provided money to study the costs of the \nState programs funded under the new law and to evaluate innovative \nprograms they might have.\n  Now, is the impact of welfare reform being studied? One of the points \nthe Senator from Minnesota makes is that this is a subject worthy of \nstudy. Our point, Mr. President, is that it is being studied. HHS, \nHealth and Human Services, has awarded grants to conduct rigorous \nevaluations of State programs including a 5-year comparative study of \nthe Minnesota Work First Program. In the Senator's own State a study is \ntaking place. There are also studies on child care and child welfare \nbeing conducted by organizations such as the Urban Institute of \nColumbia University and Harvard.\n  Now, under the Welfare Act, the Secretary of the Department of Health \nand Human Services is required to make an annual report to Congress on \nwhether the States are increasing employment and earnings of needy \nfamilies, and are they increasing child support? I think the child \nsupport was one of the points that the Senator mentioned. The report \nthat is required from the Secretary of HHS, the annual report, has to \ninclude progress on decreasing out-of-wedlock pregnancies, how are we \ndoing on child poverty, reducing that. It is to include demographic and \nfinancial characteristics of families applying for assistance, the \nfamilies receiving assistance, and families that become ineligible for \nassistance. I know the Senator is particularly concerned about the \neffectiveness of employment programs. He mentioned that in his \namendment.\n\n  The Welfare Act requires a specific study on moving families out of \nwelfare through employment. That is already required. It requires an \nannual ranking of the States in terms of the most and the least \nsuccessful work programs. The new $1 billion high-performance bonus \nprogram will reward States which are successful in increasing earnings \nfor welfare families.\n  Beginning in 1999, just a year from now, the Secretary is required to \nconduct an annual report on a broader set of indicators, including \nwhether or not children and families have health insurance, the average \nincome of these families, and educational attainment of these families. \nThanks to the efforts of Senator Moynihan, Congress now receives an \nannual report. It is called Indicators of Welfare Dependence. It has a \nwealth of information. Mr. President, here is a copy of the report. \nThis is no light-weight work. It is filled with graphs and percentages \nof children, age 0 to 5 in 1982, living in poverty by number of years \nin poverty; percentage of individuals living in poverty by numbers of \nyears in poverty. On and on it goes. It has average monthly AFDC \nbenefits by family and recipients in current and constant dollars. It \nis a very, very thorough report.\n  Now, my concern is that States have been developing and implementing \ndata collection systems for more than a year now. For Congress to \nsuddenly impose, as the Senator's amendment does, new requirements for \nmore information to track all former welfare recipients is a major \nundertaking and something we should not enter into lightly. The impact \non States is likely to be costly and burdensome.\n  The Senator's amendment is good news for computer and data processing \nvendors, but it is unlikely to mean anything, I suspect, for families \nand our efforts to combat welfare dependency. The amendment also calls \nfor a report which may give an inaccurate picture about the lives of \nindividuals who enter and leave the welfare system.\n  Now, the accent of the Senator's amendment is on employment. \nEmployment is an important reason that families find economic self-\nsufficiently, no question, but it is not the only reason. Families \nleave welfare because child support is being collected for the first \ntime. They will leave because their children will have health insurance \nand no longer need take a risk of having their children without health \ninsurance if their earnings are increased.\n  Mr. President, these are the reasons that I find the amendment well \nmeaning but unnecessary, particularly in view of the massive amount of \nreports that are already being required, one of which I briefly \nindicated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. First of all, let me thank my colleague from Rhode \nIsland for his graciousness. For those who might be watching this \nproceeding, my colleague could have just simply tabled this amendment. \nHe didn't do that. He will eventually, but he has given me an\n\n[[Page S1235]]\n\nopportunity to respond to his arguments. I want him to know that I \nappreciate it.\n  Mr. President, I won't spend a lot of time on the question of this \namendment on the ISTEA bill--which is essentially the highway bill for \nhighways and, hopefully, more mass transit--because, as my colleagues \nknow, Democrats and Republicans alike, we look for vehicles whereby we \ncan come out and introduce amendments that really speak to what we \nthink are some real concerns in the country. All of us do that all of \nthe time. I am doing it now. I am not so sure there will be, I say to \nmy colleague, a welfare bill that will be before the U.S. Senate any \ntime soon. I introduce this amendment with some sense of urgency. I \ndon't think there is any evidence whatever that we will have a welfare \nbill before the U.S. Senate. So if I am going to have an opportunity to \nmake an appeal to my colleagues, now is the time to do so.\n\n  Second, I want to just make it clear what this amendment does and \nwhat it does not do. I am puzzled by the opposition, with all due \nrespect to my colleague from Rhode Island. This amendment just simply \nsays to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, please give us a \nreport based upon--not your going out and collecting all sorts of other \ndata--but based upon the data that is available to you.\n  My colleague just said that there will be some good data available. \nMost people that I know--I have a social science background--that have \nlooked at this are saying you have a number of different people \nstudying a number of different things and it is fragmented and does not \nfocus on the main question I am asking. Exactly how many of the \nfamilies are reaching economic self-sufficiency? This amendment just \nsays to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, please pull \ntogether the data that is available, reports prepared by the \nComptroller General, samples of the Bureau of Census, surveys funded by \nyour own department, studies conducted by States, studies conducted by \nnongovernment organizations, and administrative data from other Federal \nagencies. Please bring that data together, coordinate that data and \nprovide reports to us every 6 months as to exactly how many families \nare reaching economic self-sufficiency. The goal of that being to \nanswer the question, Are these families now at 150 percent of poverty? \nAre they over poverty? What kind of jobs do they have? What kind of \nwages? Where are the children? Is child care available? How are people \ndoing on transportation? Are they able to get to work? Have we had \nsituations where people couldn't take jobs in rural areas because they \ncouldn't get to the jobs? Have we had situations where people don't \ntake jobs in the suburbs and metro areas because they couldn't get from \nghettos to suburbs because of lack of transportation? That is all this \namendment calls for. That is all this amendment calls for.\n\n  So I say to my colleagues that, in a way, I think those that oppose \nthis amendment are trying to have it both ways. On the one hand, they \nare arguing that we have already collected all of this data. I think \nnot, but if so, it's hardly an onerous requirement to say to the \nSecretary: Please assemble this data and give us a report every 6 \nmonths as to what is really happening out there in the country.\n  If the opposition to my amendment--which I have heard from some \npeople on the other side--is, ``Wait a minute, you are going to be \nasking the Secretary for too much,'' I say eventually we are going to \nget to the point where there is going to have to be more of an \ninvestment. Because if the Secretary isn't going to be able to provide \nus with the data we need, with the report we need, based upon the data \nout there, then I say to you we will need more. That is all the more \nreason to go forward with this.\n  So I am puzzled by the opposition. ``We already have these studies \nthat are providing us with the information we need,'' they say. So what \nis the harm in having the Secretary present reports to us every 6 \nmonths so we can have some reassurance that these mothers, these single \nparents, have now been able to obtain employment that they can support \ntheir family on, and the children aren't home alone, and first graders \ndon't go home alone after school, and more children aren't \nimpoverished? Why in the world, if we already have the studies out \nthere, would we not want to ask the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to provide us with this report?\n  If, on the other hand, the basis of the opposition is what I think it \nis--because I think this is the case--is that this is already being \ndone, as a matter of fact what's being done is pretty fragmented. There \nis good work being done. Senator Moynihan would be the first to say \nthat we can do better, and that is what this amendment says. Let's ask \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services to take the additional \nstudies that are out there--and my colleague talked about some of \nthem--and provide us with the report. If she cannot really provide us \nwith the information we need, then we will cross that bridge when we \ncome to it. I am not mandating that she has to provide additional \ninformation. I am saying what would be helpful to us, asking her to \nplease bring together the data that is out there, based on these \nreports, and give us a report on the current situation. That is what \nthis amendment is all about.\n  Now, after having said that, I would make an appeal to my colleagues. \nI think on our side, I know Senator Baucus is going to support the \namendment. On our side I think there is pretty strong support for this. \nI hope there will be support for this on the other side as well. I \nthink the Senator from Rhode Island--we all have these great things to \nsay about other people and half of it may be true--is a great Senator. \nI wanted to get his support. I am disappointed because I don't \nunderstand what the harm is in this amendment.\n  With all due respect, you can get into all this language that sounds \nkind of impersonal and kind of cold like, ``We already have studies, we \ndon't need it,'' or ``It is going to require us to obtain additional \ninformation, which might cost more money,'' and ``Somebody is going to \nhave to make the investment.''\n  Well, Mr. President, imagine just for a moment, just ponder this \nquestion: What if I'm right?\n  Maybe other Senators have traveled the country. I think I have done \nas much travel as any other Senator in this Chamber, at least in poor \ncommunities, low-income communities. I think I have tried to stay as \nclose to this as any other Senator. I am telling you that in a whole \nlot of communities it is crystal clear that people live in communities \nwhere the jobs aren't there. And in a whole lot of situations--and you \nwill have a lot of people from your States who will tell you the same \nthing--these women are obtaining jobs, but they hardly pay a living \nwage. And one year from now, or whatever, when they no longer receive \nmedical assistance, their families are going to be worse off.\n\n  I am hearing from a lot of States, including my own State of \nMinnesota, which has a very low unemployment level and which is doing \nwell economically. I am not here to bash States, but there are studies \nthat raise a whole lot of questions, and there have been some articles \nthat have raised a whole lot of questions about situations where some \nwomen haven't shown up for orientation sessions, and sometimes for good \nreason, and it's said that they don't necessarily want to work. There \nare communities that have incredibly long waiting lists. The city of \nLos Angeles had a waiting list of 30,000 for affordable child care \nbefore the welfare bill.\n  Now, look, if I am right about this, if I am right that what has \nhappened--because all too often we know what we want to know and we \ndon't know what we don't want to know--all too often, what is going on \nhere is, we say there are 4 million fewer recipients, a 4 million \nreduction in the welfare rolls. The reform is a huge success, but that \ndoesn't mean we have seen a reduction of poverty. I am just saying, \nshould we not know what the situation is in the country? Should we not \nknow what kind of jobs, what wages, the child care situation, and \nshould we not know whether these families are better off or worse off? \nShould we not know all of that, especially since built into that \nlegislation is a date certain whereby, depending on the State, families \nwill be eliminated from all assistance, the assumption being that all \nthese people are now working and can support themselves and their \nchildren. Is that assumption valid?\n\n[[Page S1236]]\n\n  Now, why in the world, I say to my colleagues, would you oppose this \namendment? Why would you oppose this amendment?\n  One final time. This amendment just asks the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to please provide to us a report based on the existing \nstudies with data that is out there, on what the situation is around \nthe country, on how many of these families are reaching economic self-\nsufficiency. Are they out of poverty now? Are their children better \noff? That's what we want. Or are more families impoverished? Are the \njobs just minimum wage? Is there a lack of child care? Is the \ntransportation available or not? Why would we not want to know that?\n  You know, I didn't mention this earlier, Mr. President, but there is \nanother amendment I will bring out here on the higher ed bill. I wonder \nif my colleagues know this. In all too many States, single parents who \nare in school and community colleges are now being told they have to \nleave college to take a job. Now, here are the parents that are on the \npath to economic self-sufficiency. They are in school. They are trying \nto complete their college education so they can get a good job and \nsupport their families. They are being told that, because of the \nwelfare reform bill, they can't complete their education. Talk about \nsomething that is shortsighted and harsh, something that is myopic. \nWell, that is another story and another amendment later on.\n  But for now, please support this amendment. Please ask the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services to provide us with the data. Please, \ncolleagues, at least let's have a focus on this, let's have the \ninformation before us, let's know what is going on, let's make sure \nthat these women and children are doing better. That would make us more \nresponsible policymakers.\n  Finally, I say to my colleague, if it doesn't pass--and I hope it \nwill--this is an amendment on ISTEA, but I will come back with these \namendments over and over again. Because it is my firm belief as a U.S. \nSenator that we can't turn our gaze away from this. These are citizens \nwho are not the heavy hitters, these are citizens that are not the \ngivers, these are citizens that do not have the lobbyists. These are, \nin the main, poor people--mainly women and children. I think it is \nimportant that we understand what is happening to them, and it is \nimportant that we have the right information, and it is important that \nwe do our very best to be responsible policymakers and make sure that \nthese families aren't worse off and that these children are not in \nharm's way. How in the world, colleagues, can you vote against the \nproposition that we ought to have as much information as possible \nbefore us so that we make sure these children are not endangered, so \nthat we can make sure these families are better off?\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, as I mentioned before, we are dealing with \na highway bill here. This isn't the appropriate place for that. When we \ndid the welfare bill, I was the one who included in the welfare bill \ndata collection provisions. Should those data collection provisions be \ninadequate and need to be expanded along the lines the Senator has \nsuggested, I would be glad to work with him and see if we could not \ninclude those by working with the Secretary of HHS. This, plainly, \nisn't the right place for this amendment.\n  If the Senator has nothing further, I move to table the amendment of \nthe Senator from Minnesota and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the amendment of the Senator from Minnesota. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Allard) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Glenn), the \nSenator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye), are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 54, nays 43, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 19 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--54\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kempthorne\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--43\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Cleland\n     Coats\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Allard\n     Glenn\n     Inouye\n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 1679) was agreed \nto.\n  Mr. CHAFEE.

Without objection, the motion to lay on the \ntable the motion to reconsider is agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, what we would like to do now is move to a \nLautenberg amendment dealing with alcohol-blood content. The proposal \nis that there be 3 hours of debate equally divided.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nLautenberg be recognized to offer an amendment on blood-alcohol content \nand that there be 3 hours for debate, equally divided, under the \ncontrol of Senator Lautenberg and Senator Chafee. I further ask \nunanimous consent that there be 1 hour remaining, equally divided, for \ndebate. In other words, do 2 hours tonight and 1 hour tomorrow. The \nleader has indicated that we are to come in at 9 a.m. and that the vote \nwill be at 10 a.m.; at 10 a.m., the Senate proceed to vote on or in \nrelation to the Lautenberg amendment.

I am happy to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I urge Senators who are opposed to the \namendment to come to the floor. I am designated as in control of the \ntime in opposition, but I will confess I am for the amendment so I will \nnot be speaking against it. And for those Senators who wish time, now \nis the time to come over.\n  There are 2 hours. We have an hour in opposition to the amendment. \nObviously, I am prepared to turn over the time to anybody in \nopposition. But I will not be speaking against it. So I wish Senators \nwho are opposed to this amendment would come to the floor.\n  Thank you. I want to thank the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I offer this amendment with my \ncolleague from Ohio, Senator Mike DeWine, and I include, as cosponsors, \nSenator Lieberman, Senator Faircloth, Senator Boxer, Senator Helms, \nSenator Glenn, Senator Durbin, Senator Feinstein, Senator Bingaman, \nSenator Moynihan, Senator Hatch, Senator Wellstone, Senator Akaka, \nSenator Dodd, Senator Kerry from Massachusetts, Senator Inouye, Senator \nMoseley-Braun, Senator Bumpers, Senator Reed, Senator Smith of Oregon \nand Senator Rockefeller join me as cosponsors in the amendment; and \nSenator Chafee, the chairman of the committee. And all together, we \nhave 23 bipartisan cosponsors. That is the way it ought to be because \nthis is on behalf of the victims of drunk driving crashes--over 17,000 \ndeaths and about one million injuries each year.\n  This amendment, the Safe and Sober Streets Act, establishes the legal \nlimit for drunken driving at .08 blood alcohol content in all 50 \nStates. Establishing .08 as the legal definition of drunk driving is \nresponsible, effective, and it is the right thing to do. This \namendment, if enacted into law, will save lives. And it is our moral \nimperative, as legislators, to pass legislation that will make our \ncommunities, our roads and, of course, our families safe.\n  This is the logical next step in the fight against drunk driving. It \nwill build on what we started in 1984, when Democrats, Republicans, and \nPresident Reagan joined together to set a national minimum drinking age \nto 21. And since that time, we have saved over 10,000 lives. And \ncontrary to the concern of the restaurant and the liquor business, \nthose businesses have not gone under, like many warned us about at the \ntime.\n  Mr. President, the question before us is, should a 170-pound man be \nallowed to have more than four beers in 1 hour, on an empty stomach, \nand get behind the wheel of a car? And our answer is, absolutely not. \nThis amendment goes after drunk drivers, not social drinkers.\n  And while we are pushing for enactment of this legislation, I have \nhad the honor of getting to know some families who have experienced the \nultimate tragedy--the Frazier family from Maryland. Randy and Brenda's \ndaughter Ashley, 9 years old, was tragically killed by a .08 drunk \ndriver 2 years ago. This person's blood alcohol content level was .08. \nWhat we are trying to do is to establish the fact that .08 is a \ndangerous level for people on our roads and highways. The Fraziers have \nlent themselves courageously to this fight,\n\n[[Page S1238]]\n\nto enact this .08 BAC level across the land.\n  Last March, Randy Frazier issued a call to Congress, a call that I \nbelieve captures what this issue is all about. He said, ``It is time \nfor leadership and action here in the Congress to draw a safer, saner, \nand more sensible line against impaired driving at .08. If we truly \nbelieve in family values, then .08 ought to become the law of the land.\n  Four beers-plus in an hour--now, that is on an empty stomach, Mr. \nPresident. That is not casual. That is not a casual level. An empty \nstomach, four beers in an hour--a 170-pound person is already impaired \nin their reaction to situations. They should not be allowed to get \nbehind the wheel of a car and create a situation that is the antithesis \nof what we call the protection of the family.\n\n  As we debate this issue, I want each of my colleagues to consider two \nthings: First, ask yourself, have we done enough to combat drunk \ndriving in this country? The answer to that question, in my view, is \nabsolutely not. Second, is a person whose blood alcohol content is .08 \npercent a threat to themselves and others on the road? And the answer \nto that one, of course, is a resounding yes.\n  Adopting this amendment will simply bring the United States of \nAmerica into the ranks of most other industrialized nations in this \nworld in setting reasonable drunk driving limits.\n  Canada, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, all have \na .08 BAC limit. France, Belgium, Finland and the Netherlands have a \nlimit of .05 BAC--half of what we commonly have in our country. Sweden \nis practically down to zero--.02 BAC.\n  We heard today from President Clinton. He is very aggressively \nsupporting this amendment. Other supporters include Transportation \nSecretary Rodney Slater. They include organizations like the National \nSafety Council; the National Transportation Safety Board; the National \nCenter for Injury Prevention and Control of the Center for Disease \nControl; the American Automobile Manufacturers Association; Kemper \nInsurance; State Farm and Nationwide insurance companies; MADD, Mothers \nAgainst Drunk Driving, of course; the American College of Emergency \nPhysicians.\n  I had a talk with a physician today at the White House when we \npresented this BAC .08 bill. And a physician, the head of an emergency \nroom in the State of Wisconsin, told me that emergency rooms are \nsometimes so filled with drunk drivers who had been in accidents, that \nthey cannot adequately calibrate the blood alcohol testing machine. The \nroom is sometimes so filled from the victim's liquor-stained breath \nthat they had to leave the room to set the calibration on the blood \nalcohol testing machine.\n  Other supporters include the Consumer Federation of America, National \nFire Protection Association--the list goes on--Advocates for Highway \nand Auto Safety.\n  And we have had newspaper editorials, such as the New York Times and \nthe Washington Post and the Baltimore Sun. I ask, Mr. President, \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters and editorials \nin support of this amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 26, 1998]\n\n                       One Nation, Drunk or Sober\n\n       The danger posed by an intoxicated driver does not change \n     when the driver crosses state lines. Neither should the legal \n     test for sobriety. That is the practical thinking behind \n     pending legislation in Congress to create one uniform Federal \n     standard for drunken driving. Some critics say the measure \n     would infringe on states' rights. But this is a problem that \n     transcends state boundaries, requiring a tough, consistent \n     national approach.\n       The measure, sponsored by Senators Frank Lautenberg of New \n     Jersey and Mike DeWine of Ohio, and Representatives Nita \n     Lowey and Benjamin Gilman of New York, would set a national \n     blood alcohol limit of .08 percent. States would have three \n     years to enact this limit before losing a percentage of their \n     highway construction funds. This same approach was used to \n     encourage compliance with the lifesaving 1984 law that \n     established the 21-year-old drinking age.\n       Currently, only 15 states set their drunken-driving \n     threshold at .08. Elsewhere it takes a higher level, .10, to \n     put a driver over the legal limit. Thus most of the country \n     would have to adopt the stricter .08 standard or lose Federal \n     funding. This has lobbyists for liquor interests trying to \n     depict the bill as a heavy-handed assault on harmless social \n     drinking. But a blood alcohol level of .08 is sufficient to \n     cause unacceptable damage to a driver's reflexes, judgment \n     and control. Moreover, the .08 level still allows for \n     considerable consumption. An average 170-pound man, experts \n     say, could imbibe more than four shots of hard liquor in an \n     hour--and on an empty stomach--before reaching a blood \n     alcohol concentration of .08.\n       Far from a moralistic assault on moderate social drinking, \n     the bill is a reasonable effort to save lives. Over 40 \n     percent of all traffic fatalities are alcohol-related, and \n     close to one-fourth of those crashes involve drivers with an \n     alcohol level under the generous .10 standard. As many as 600 \n     lives would be spared each year, and countless other serious \n     accidents avoided, if .08 were imposed nationwide.\n       With support from President Clinton and lawmakers from both \n     parties, the measure stands a good chance of winning approval \n     when the Senate tackles the contentious issue of highway \n     funding beginning next week--provided, of course, that \n     generous political giving by liquor interests does not \n     overshadow the needs of public safety.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Nov. 8, 1997]\n\n                   Drunk in One State, Not the Other?\n\n       Drunk drivers are deadly threats no matter where they speed \n     or weave in this country. Yet a driver who is certifiably \n     drunk in Virginia can roll to a ``sobriety'' of sorts merely \n     by crossing into Maryland. That is a life-threatening \n     inconsistency that exists around the country because there is \n     no uniform standard of drunkenness on the roads. There could \n     and should be a clear and effective standard--and Congress \n     has legislation before it to bring this about.\n       Nearly all highway safety organizations and physicians \n     groups consider a blood alcohol content reading of .08 as \n     sufficient evidence of a drunk driver. That is the standard \n     in Virginia and 14 other states, and it is hardly an \n     unreasonable limit: A 170-pound man could consume four drinks \n     in one hour on an empty stomach and still come in below .08; \n     a 135-pound woman could down three drinks and do the same. \n     But Maryland, the District and 34 other states have a looser \n     standard--of .10. Why not agree on .08?\n       There ought to be a national standard, and such a \n     proposition is now before Congress, with support from across \n     the political spectrum. Legislation cosponsored in the Senate \n     by Sens. Frank Lautenberg and Mike DeWine and in the House of \n     Reps. Nita Lowey, Connie Morella and more than 40 other \n     members would withhold federal transportation funds from \n     states without a .08 standard. The logic is simple enough: \n     Driving is an interstate activity.\n       One sorry explanation for the failure of states to adopt a \n     .08 limit is that lobbyists for liquor interests have worked \n     to kill the idea in state legislatures. In Congress they have \n     trotted out states' rights objections. But states that are \n     softest on drunk driving could keep their looser standards--\n     it's just that federal taxpayers would not underwrite \n     transportation projects for these states. Why should they, \n     when looser laws mean more tragedies that cost the public \n     that much more in health bills--and in lives lost?\n       Federal incentives to adopt safety measures do work. There \n     are now 44 states that have a zero-tolerance policy for \n     minors who drink and drive, and results show that the number \n     of traffic deaths involving teenagers and alcohol has fallen \n     nearly 60 percent between 1982 (before the federal law) and \n     last year. All of this long ago should at least have \n     propelled Maryland, the District and state legislators to \n     move on their own. But now Congress can bring still better \n     sense to highways by approving a uniform, nationally \n     understood definition of a dangerous driver.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, Oct. 25, 1997]\n\n                  Lower Threshold for Drunken Driving\n\n       You're driving on the beltway. The motorist in the next \n     lane consumed four beers during the past hour. To paraphrase \n     Clint Eastwood, do you feel lucky?\n       Amazingly, that tipsy driver may be within his legal rights \n     in Maryland and 34 other states where a blood-alcohol \n     concentration of 10 is the minimum to be considered drunk. In \n     recent years, Virginia and 14 other states have stiffened \n     their definition of intoxicated driving to .08. That's still \n     more than four drinks for a 170-pound man on an empty \n     stomach, more than three for a 135-pound woman.\n       Yet the state-by-state movement to .08 has stalled, often \n     because lobbyists for liquor interests have successfully \n     smothered it in the various legislatures. The liquor industry \n     is foolish, because automobile deaths rooted in alcohol will \n     only heap scorn on the business, but it is reflexively \n     battling .08 laws nonetheless.\n       President Clinton and several lawmakers believe it is time \n     to confront drunken driving with a national thrust, as the \n     government is doing now to battle another killer, tobacco.\n       Under Senate Bill 412, authored by Sens. Frnak R. \n     Lautenberg, a New Jersey Democrat, and Michael DeWine, an \n     Ohio Republican, transportation funds would be withheld from \n     states without a .08 standard.\n       Washington took a similar stand on teen drinking and \n     driving in 1984--with dramatic effect. Traffic deaths \n     involving teen-agers and alcohol dropped nearly 60 percent \n     between 1982, prior to the federal law, and 1996.\n\n[[Page S1239]]\n\n     That was twice the drop in alcohol-related traffic fatalities \n     for the population at large.\n       There was also a 25 percent drop in surveys of teens who \n     described themselves as heavy drinkers, suggesting that the \n     force of law nudges people to drink more responsibly. That's \n     a critical and little recognized benefit of a 08 law. In \n     fact, states that switched to .08 recorded an 18 percent \n     decline in fatal crashes involving drivers with blood-alcohol \n     rates of .15.\n       Medical researchers estimate 600 lives would be saved a \n     year with a .08 law. That has been the experience in other \n     nations with stricter standards than ours, including wine-\n     rich France and Japan, which has fewer drunken driving deaths \n     than Maryland alone 475 vs. 671). Even in the U.S. though, \n     the public isn't as willing to wink at tipsy drivers as it \n     was years ago, after hearing of or being hurt by the deaths \n     of individuals, of families, even a princess.\n       Four drinks in one state make you no less drunk than four \n     drinks in another. The abundant evidence justifies a national \n     response.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                       Kemper,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 20, 1997.\n     Hon.

Drunk driving fatalities actually increased in 1995 \n     for the first time in a decade.\n       Your legislation would require the states to enact a blood \n     alcohol concentration threshold of .08% for impaired driving \n     or suffer a loss in federal highway construction funding. \n     This provision should reverse the drunk driving fatality \n     trend and save several hundred lives each year. The .08 \n     threshold is currently in place in Canada, many western \n     European countries and in fifteen states in the U.S. All of \n     the medical evidence indicates that .08 is a sensible \n     threshold to measure driver impairment.\n       You may feel confident of our companies' wholehearted \n     support of your joint initiative.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Michael F.

Champion, MD,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      National Safety Council,\n\n                                     Itasca, IL, December 8, 1997.\n     The Hon. Frank Lautenberg,\n     The Hon. Mike DeWine,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Lautenberg and DeWine: The National Safety \n     Council is writing to offer our strong support for The Safe \n     and Sober Streets Act of 1977, S. 412, and for your plan to \n     include the bill in legislation to reauthorize the Intermodal \n     Surface Transportation Efficiency Act.\n       Drunk driving remains a national shame. Despite progress \n     over the years, 41% of all motor vehicle fatalities--more \n     than 17,000 lives lost--involve alcohol. Yet the current \n     legal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) in most states is \n     .10, the highest in the industrialized world.\n       The National Safety Council long has supported setting the \n     BAC limit for adult drivers at .08, a point at which driving \n     skills are proven to be compromised. If every state adopted \n     .08, an estimated 500-600 lives a year could be saved. \n     Although 15 states now have BAC limits of .08, incentive \n     grants and public policy arguments alone have not succeeded \n     in ensuring wider adoption of .08 laws. Strong federal \n     leadership is needed to achieve a uniform national BAC limit \n     of .08.\n       That is why we believe enactment of S. 412, which links \n     adoption of .08 laws to federal highway funding, is a \n     necessary and important step. Laws which set the legal BAC \n     limit at .08 are a needed part of the combination of programs \n     and policies which must be in place if we are to win the \n     fight against drunk driving.\n       The National Safety Council commends and thanks you for \n     your leadership on this critical issue.\n            Sincerely,\n                                               Gerard F. Scannell,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               American College of\n\n\n                                         Emergency Physicians;\n\n                                   Dallas, TX, September 24, 1997.\n     The Hon. Frank R. Lautenberg,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: The American College of Emergency \n     Physicians (ACEP), representing 19,000 emergency physicians \n     and the patients they serve, urges you to cosponsor S. 412, \n     the ``Safe and Sober Streets Act of 1997,'' introduced by \n     Senators Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) and Mike DeWine (R-OH).\n       Emergency physicians witness first-hand the serious \n     injuries and fatalities that result from drunk driving. Last \n     year, drunk driving caused more than 17,000 deaths on our \n     nation's highways. Epidemiologic data has well established \n     that all drivers are impaired at a blood alcohol \n     concentration (BAC) of .08. Furthermore, at this level, the \n     risk of being in a crash increases significantly.\n       For many years, the College has supported the National \n     Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) \n     recommendation that states adopt .08 BAC as the legal \n     standard for intoxication. The ``Safe and Sober Streets Act'' \n     would establish a national standard for defining drunk \n     driving at .08 BAC by encouraging all states to adopt this \n     limit.\n       The facts cannot be disputed. Too many lives have been lost \n     and many more are put at risk every day by drunk drivers. As \n     emergency physicians, we believe that our success is measured \n     not only by the lives we save in the emergency department, \n     but also by the lives we save through prevention. Thus, we \n     urge you to support and help pass this important highway \n     safety measure.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        Larry A. Bedard, MD, FACEP\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              American Automobile,\n\n\n                                    Manufacturers Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 2, 1998.\n     The Hon. Frank R. Lautenberg,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: This letter is to urge your \n     support for legislation that would provide states with an \n     incentive to adopt and enforce an anti-drunk driving standard \n     of 0.08 Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC). Such a proposal is \n     contained in S. 412, the Safe and Sober Streets Act, co-\n     sponsored by Senators Lautenberg, DeWine and twenty-one \n     others. This proposal is expected to be offered as an \n     amendment to S. 1173, the ISTEA reauthorization bill.\n       According to the U.S. Department of Transportation's most \n     recent report, alcohol-related crashes account for 40 percent \n     of all traffic fatalities. While good progress has been made \n     over the past decade, the number of alcohol-related deaths is \n     still over 17,000 each year. In addition, some 1.4 million \n     drivers were arrested in 1995 alone for driving under the \n     influence of alcohol.\n       Moreover, safety belt use, now required by 49 states, is \n     markedly lower among drivers and occupants involved in \n     alcohol-related crashes.\n       Clearly, more needs to be done. Currently, in most states \n     the standard for ``legal'' intoxication is 0.10 BAC, while \n     states that have enacted .08 BAC legislation have witnessed \n     significant reductions in alcohol-related traffice \n     fatalities, according to statistics compiled by Mothers \n     Against Drunk Driving.\n       AAMA and its member companies, Chrysler, Ford and General \n     Motors strongly urge your support of this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Andrew H. Card, Jr.\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. But more important than the scores of businesses, \nhealth and science organizations, governmental agencies, public opinion \nleaders, is the support from the families and friends of victims of \ndrunk driving--like, as I mentioned before, the Fraziers. They come \nfrom Westminster, MD. They lost their 9-year-old daughter Ashley.\n  I have also gotten to know very well some people from New Jersey, \nLouise and Ronald Hammell of Tuckerton, NJ. They lost their son Matthew \nwho was growing up in the full bloom of life--very positive, doing \nthings for the community and others. He ultimately sought to be a \nminister, the wonderful young man. He was rollerblading on the other \nside of the highway from the car that became involved in his death, and \nthat driver crossed over the yellow line dividing the two lanes of \ntraffic, and came all the way to the shoulder\n\n[[Page S1240]]\n\nand killed this young man, and so early in his life that he had not \nreally yet begun to develop.\n  Who opposes this amendment? That is the question we have to ask \nourselves. The American Beverage Institute, the National Restaurant \nAssociation, the Beer Wholesalers, what is it that they have in mind \nwhen they oppose this? They say that ``Oh, we're going to lose \nbusiness,'' that you ought to be targeting the chronic heavy drinker.\n  Well, we are after the heavy drinker. That is why we have those \nroadblocks. And it is sometimes very hard to stop those who are so \naddicted to a substance that they cannot control themselves and wind up \nharming others. But does that mean that we ought not to bother because \nsome get away with it? We know that we have to have traffic rules, we \nhave to have red lights. Some people do not obey them. But the fact of \nthe matter is, the majority is well-served by having rules that protect \nthe public.\n  Organizations, Mr. President, which support this amendment have one \nthing in mind--the public's interest, the health and safety of our \ncommunities and of our roads and of our families. Organizations who \noppose this amendment have one interest in mind--they only care about \nprotecting their narrow special interest.\n  We have to make that judgment here. Drunk driving continues to be a \nnational scourge that imposes tremendous suffering on the victims of \ndrunk driving crashes and their loved ones.\n  In 1996, 17,126 people were killed in alcohol-related crashes. About \none million people were injured in alcohol-related crashes. And I point \nout, Mr. President, that in the worst year of the Vietnam war--an event \nthat scarred the hearts and the minds of people across our country--in \n1 year, the worst year in Vietnam, we lost just over 17,000 people. So \nhere, every year, we lose 17,000-plus people in drunk driving crashes. \nAnd it compares to the worst year of a war that left our Nation in \nmourning for many years.\n  Every one of these deaths and injuries could have been prevented had \nthe driver decided to call for a ride, hand the keys to a friend, or do \nanything other than taking that wheel. When that person takes that \nwheel, it is as if they are carrying a gun. The only question--when is \nthat thing going to go off? It is no different. Murder is murder, and \nthe victim is just as dead whether it comes from a drunk driving \naccident or whether it comes from the pulling of a trigger.\n  Deaths and injuries that are due to drunk driving are not \n``accidents.'' They are predictable and preventable. Every 30 minutes \nsomeone in America--a mother, a husband, a child, grandchild, brother, \nsister--dies in an alcohol-related crash.\n  In the United States, 41 percent of all fatal crashes are alcohol-\nrelated. Alcohol is the single greatest factor in motor vehicle deaths \nand injuries. The first step in combating this epidemic is to inject \nthe sense of sanity in our Nation's drunk driving laws and by enacting \nthe Safe and Sober Streets Act. The amendment we have in front of us \nwill go a long way toward reducing the deadly combination of drinking \nand driving.\n  Mr. President, my amendment, which would have the effect of lowering \nthis Nation's tolerance for drinking and driving by 20 percent, is what \nought to be considered now. This amendment requires all States to \ndefine the point at which a driver would be considered to be drunk as \n.08 blood alcohol content. Fifteen States already have .08 BAC and \nwould be unaffected by my amendment. My State of New Jersey does not \nhave a .08 BAC, nor does the State of my chief colleague in this, \nSenator Mike DeWine, from Ohio, who is well aware of that deficiency in \nthe State law.\n  Mr. President, .08 is a reasonable and responsible level at which to \ndraw the line in fighting drunk driving. Despite what we are all \nhearing from special interests and their lobbyists, at .08 a person is \ndrunk and should not be driving. Their reaction is impaired. They can't \nstop quick enough; they accelerate too fast; they turn too erratically.\n  In fact, Congress, in its wisdom, set the limit for commercial motor \nvehicle drivers at .04 BAC in the 1980s. So, Congress clearly \nunderstands the connection between the consumption of alcohol and the \ncritical ability needed to drive a vehicle safely on our highways.\n  Mr. President, .08 BAC is just common sense. Think of it this way: \nYou are in your car, driving on a two-lane road at night. Your child is \ntraveling with you. You see a car's headlights approaching. The driver \nin this case is a 170-pound man who just drank five bottles of beer in \nan hour on an empty stomach in a bar. If he were driving in Maryland, \nhe would not be considered drunk. But if he were driving in Virginia, \nhe would be. Does it make sense? We should not have a patchwork quilt \nof laws when we are dealing with drunk driving.\n  We had the privilege of hearing the chief of police of Arlington \nCounty, VA, today at the White House. He talked about what has happened \nsince Virginia reduced its BAC level to .08. They saw a marked \nimprovement in the reduction of deaths on their highways. Here was \nsomeone who had the practical responsibility, the practical knowledge \nof seeing these victims, of tending to the injured people. He said it \nworks. Let's do it.\n  Regarding this amendment, .08 utilizes what sound science and \nresearch proves, and interjects some reality in our definition of drunk \ndriving and applies it to all 50 States so someone can't drink more and \ndrive in New York than in New Jersey, or in this case, someone drinking \nin Maryland and driving to Virginia when their blood alcohol level is \nbeyond .08.\n  Mr. President, there are 10 facts that demonstrate the need for this \namendment:\n  Fact No. 1: Drunk driving continues to be a shameful epidemic that \ndestroys our families and communities: 17,000 deaths each year to drunk \ndriving. Isn't 17,000 too many? Each year in this country more people \nare killed in alcohol-related crashes than are murdered by firearms. \nFamilies and friends of drunk driving victims experience tremendous \ngrief which changes their lives forever. Moreover, deaths and injuries \nfrom alcohol-related crashes have an enormous economic impact as well. \nAlcohol-related crashes cost society over $45 billion every year.\n  One alcohol-related fatality is estimated to cost society about \n$950,000, and an injury averages about $20,000 in emergency and acute \nhealth care costs, long-term care and rehabilitation, police and court \ncosts, insurance, lost productivity, and social services.\n  The problem exists, and we must do more to reduce drunk driving. The \nAmerican people agree. Reducing drunk driving is the No. 1 highway \nsafety issue for the American people.\n\n  Mr. President, here is a chart reflecting a Lou Harris poll conducted \n1 year ago that found that 91 percent of the respondents believe that \nthe Federal role in assuring highway safety is critical. What do \nAmericans consider to be the No. 1 highway safety problem? Fifty-two \npoint nine percent look at drunk driving as the No. 1 highway safety \nproblem; 18.6 percent look at drivers who exceed the posted speed limit \nby more than 15 miles per hour; 13.7 percent, young or unexperienced \ndrivers; 6.2 percent, elderly drivers; 5.7 percent, highways in poor \ncondition.\n  The poll showed the two principal causes of problems on our highways \nare drunk driving and those who are speeding, with drunk driving \noverwhelmingly the most feared matter for highway safety.\n  Fact No. 2: It takes a lot of alcohol for a person to reach .08, \ncontrary to what most people think and contrary to information being \ngiven out by the alcohol lobby. I want to clear this up. According to \nthe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National \nSafety Council, a 170-pound man would have to drink four and one-half \ndrinks in 1 hour on an empty stomach to reach .08 BAC; a female \nweighing 137 pounds would have to have three drinks in 1 hour, no food, \nand she is still below .08. The male, at 170 pounds, drinks four drinks \nand is still below .08. We are not talking about the kind of drinking \nthat is a casual single glass of wine with dinner, contrary to what the \nlobbyists would have you think.\n  Mr. President, people with .08 BAC are drunk. Or as others say, they \nare blitzed, wasted, trashed, bombed. The last thing they should do is \nget behind the wheel. We used to use an expression around the country, \nand I remember hearing it often, ``Let's have one more\n\n[[Page S1241]]\n\nfor the road.'' That is the last thing that we want to encourage. That \nis out. That happy hour is long since gone.\n  Fact No. 3: Virtually all drivers are seriously impaired at .08 BAC \nand shouldn't be driving. Here is a chart from the National Highway \nTraffic Safety Administration. They say at .08, concentrated attention, \nspeed control, braking, steering, gear changing, lane tracking and \njudgment are impaired. When you get down to even lower levels, half of \nwhat the current level is in 35 States in the country, .05, you are \ntalking about problems with tracking, divided attention, coordination, \ncomprehension, and eye movement.\n  We are not looking to abolish social drinking. We are not looking to \ncreate a new temperance in society. What we are saying is that .08 is \ndangerous if you are driving.\n  Fact No. 4: The risk of being involved in a crash increases \nsubstantially by the time a driver reaches .08 BAC. The risk rises \ngradually with each BAC level, but then rises rapidly after a driver \nreaches or exceeds .08 BAC compared to drivers with no alcohol in their \nsystem. In single vehicle crashes, drivers with BAC's between .05 and \n.09 are 11 times more likely to be involved in a fatal crash than \ndrivers with a BAC of zero.\n  Fact No. 5: .08 BAC laws have proven to reduce crashes and \nfatalities. One study of States with .08 BAC laws found that the .08 \nBAC laws reduced the overall incidence of alcohol fatalities by 16 \npercent. In other words, the involvement in fatal crashes is pervasive \nwhen alcohol is taken before the driver gets behind the wheel.\n  This study also found that .08 laws reduced fatalities at higher BAC \nlevels, meaning they had an effect on extremely impaired drivers. \nSeparate crash statistics have confirmed that finding. When the \nNational Highway Traffic Highway Safety Administration studied the \neffect of .08 in five States--California, Maine, Oregon, Utah, and \nVermont--it found significant reductions in alcohol-related crashes in \nfour out of the five States, ranging from 4 percent to 40 percent when \ncompared to the rest of the States with .10 BAC laws. You may hear that \nthere is no ``objective evidence'' showing that .08 works. We have \nheard statements like that before from the tobacco industry, always \ndeclaring it is not proven, it is not sure, and it is not certain, but \nthe person who is dead is dead and the family that is broken-hearted \nstays broken-hearted for life.\n\n  Fact No. 6: Lowering the BAC limit to .08 makes it possible to \nconvict seriously impaired drivers whose levels are now considered \nmarginal because they are at or just over the .10 BAC, and the judge \nsays, in many cases, ``OK, you are at 0.11; listen, watch yourself and \ndon't do it again.'' Drinking and driving is a serious offense which \nshould be handled by the appropriate authorities.\n  Because .08 BAC laws are a general deterrent and have proven to deter \neven heavier drinkers from driving, the public has an increased \nawareness and understanding of what it takes to be too impaired to \ndrive. After Virginia passed the law I mentioned before, not only did \ntraffic fatalities go down but arrests also were reduced. Mr. \nPresident, .08 laws are not the problem. They are the solution.\n  Fact No. 7: Most other Western countries already have drunk driving \nlaws that are .08 or less. Here are some of the countries: Canada and \nGreat Britain are .08; Australia varies between .05 and .08; Austria, \n.08; Switzerland, .08; France, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, \nFinland, .05; Sweden, .02. Are we owned by the liquor-producing \nestablishment? Are our families to be governed by rules established by \nthe liquor lobby? I think not. This amendment would bring us into the \ncivilized world when it comes to drunk driving laws.\n  Most other countries have adopted these laws because they work. For \nexample, over the past few years France has systematically reduced its \nlegal limit for drunk driving and has seen measurable results. In \nFrance, the country that is first in per capita wine consumption, a \nmotorist can have his or her license revoked at .05 BAC and can be \njailed if caught driving at .08 BAC. It is estimated that 33 percent of \nall traffic fatalities in France are alcohol-related.\n  Fact No. 8: The American people overwhelmingly support .08. When the \nquestion is asked, Would you be in favor of lowering the legal blood \nalcohol limit for drivers to .08, 66 percent of the males said yes, 71 \npercent of the females said yes; the female, the mother, the one who \ninevitably feels most pain in a family when there is a loss, 71 percent \nsaid, Please, America, stop this; get the blood alcohol limit down to a \nsensible point. And as we saw even at .05 people's actions are \nimpaired. So what we are doing is the right thing here. We hope we can \nget the liquor people and some of the restaurant people and beer \nwholesalers to come on over, join us, and be the kind of corporate \ncitizens that we know you would like to be.\n\n  So NHTSA surveys all show that most people would not drive after \nhaving two or three drinks in 1 hour and believe that the limit should \nbe no higher than that which would get them there.\n  Fact No. 9: We need a national drunk driving limit. The best approach \nis the one we employ because it works. This amendment is written the \nsame way as the 21-year-old drinking age law. If the medical and \nscientific evidence show that a person is impaired at .08 BAC and \nshould not be driving, why should someone be deemed to be drunk in one \nState but not the other? If they cross the State boundary and kill \nsomebody, that person is just as dead, and that family is just as \nwounded. This bill will save lives, and it is a much more compelling \nargument than any other.\n  As President Reagan said when he signed the 21 minimum drinking age \nbill into law, ``We know that drinking, plus driving, spells death and \ndisaster . . . The problem is bigger than the individual States . . . \nIt's a grave national problem, and it touches all our lives. With the \nproblem so clear-cut and the proven solution at hand, we have no \nmisgivings . . .'' President Reagan, who was strictly a person who \nliked to limit Federal power, said that. ``. . . we have no misgivings \nabout this judicious use of Federal power.''\n  Sanctions, which is what we are proposing, work and soft incentives \ndo not work. Since .08 BAC laws were part of the incentive grant \nprogram in 1993, only a handful of States have adopted .08. Incentive \ngrant problems are the alcohol industry's best friend because they \nrarely have positive effects. Most telling, no single State lost \nhighway funds as a result of the 21 drinking age law, and we expect no \nState to lose highway funds from the zero tolerance law. Some \ninitiatives are important enough to employ that tool.\n  Fact No. 10: Based on past history, adopting .08 will not hurt the \neconomy. There is no evidence that per capita consumption of alcohol \nwas affected in any of the five .08 BAC States examined by NHTSA. A \ndifferent, four-State analysis conducted by several alcohol industry \norganizations showed virtually no effect on overall consumption.\n  In the alcohol industry analysis, Maine, which adopted .08 in 1988, \nsaw a slight dip in alcohol consumption in 1988, but restaurant sales \nactually increased 11 percent. Restaurants and the alcohol industry \nshould support this bill because they care about their patrons. They \ndon't want to hear about someone who just left their establishment and \nwound up killed on a road a few miles away. I don't care how much \nsomebody drinks. They can drink until they fall off the bar stool; but \njust don't get behind the wheel of a car. This is a reasonable \namendment.\n  We are not talking about prohibition. Remember, when you are in a bar \nand look at a table full of people, .08 applies to only one of those \npeople--the driver.\n  As my colleagues read the materials disseminated by the opponents of \nthis measure, you have to think to yourself, is .08 the right or the \nwrong thing to do? You can only have one conclusion if you care about \nyour constituents. Don't get tangled up in whether this is too broad a \nreach for the Federal Government. Is it too broad a reach when the \nFederal Government saves lives, or when the Federal Government enacts \nenvironmental legislation that takes lead out of public buildings? Is \nit too much of a reach when the Federal Government posts warnings about \nair quality? Not at all. So don't get fooled by the alcohol lobby's \nmachinations out there, saying, ``You can't prove it. It's not so. You \nshould work on the chronic alcoholic.'' Yes, we want to work on the \nchronic alcoholic, but we want the casual drinker, someone who doesn't\n\n[[Page S1242]]\n\nrealize that when they get to .08, they are in dangerous territory when \nthey get behind the wheel. So I hope my colleagues will all join in and \nsupport this amendment.\n\n  Consider what the Wall Street Journal said:\n\n       Safe alcohol levels should be set by health experts, not \n     the lobby for Hooter's and Harrah's. The Lautenberg amendment \n     isn't a drive toward prohibition, but an uphill push toward a \n     health consensus.\n\n  Mr. President, the Senate has heard my policy arguments. The facts \nare on our side. I want all Senators to weigh those facts carefully. \nBut I also want them to think about one other issue--not a fact, but a \nperson. I want them to think about the Ashley Fraziers in their State. \nThe child in this photograph was 9 years old. We heard her mother and \nfather talk about her today. This accident took place about 2 years \nago. They still mourn every day. When her mother Brenda talked about \nAshley, she said they still set a table for four, even though they know \nthere are only going to be three people sitting at that table, because \nthey don't want to forget Ashley. Ashley was killed by a woman, \nunderage, driving with a .08 blood alcohol content. Mr. President, I \nhope that Senators and the American people can see this child, because \nthere isn't any one of us who is a parent or a grandparent who doesn't \nso treasure the life of a child like this that we would give our own \nlives to protect her. We are not being asked to give our lives; we are \nbeing asked to give our judgment, we are being asked to give our \nsupport.\n  Two years ago, Ashley's parents heard a noise and saw a sight that \nthey will never forget. She said this morning at the White House, in \nthe presence of the President, that they want to make sure that this \nnever happens to other people. They were unselfishly baring their \nsouls, anguish, and grief to prevent the possibility of someone they \ndon't even know from losing a child like this beautiful young girl. \nThis was a tragedy. Stop and think about the senseless death of this 9-\nyear-old. It pulls our heartstrings, all of us. I ask all Senators to \nthink of this when they vote on this amendment. Think of a family's \npain when they lose a child, a loved one, and help us to try to prevent \nthis from happening again.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Lautenberg-DeWine amendment to \nkeep drunk drivers off the roads and keep them away from our kids.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, could you give the time situation? The \nagreement is that each side will have 1 hour. I see Senators here who \nwill speak for the amendment. I think we can yield time to the \nproponents of the amendment. I am not worried about that. But I want to \nprotect the rights of any Senators who might come over and would be \nagainst the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from New \nJersey has 22\\1/2\\ minutes remaining. The Senator from Rhode Island has \n59 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. All right. If the Chair could announce when the \nproponents of the amendment have reached their 60 minutes, that would \nbe helpful, and then we can figure out how to go from there. I am \nconfident there will be time that we can yield from the side I control. \nBut if the Chair could let us know when 60 minutes of the proponents' \ntime is up, I would appreciate it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield such time as I have available to my colleague \nfrom Ohio, Senator DeWine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Would the Chair mind repeating the time available?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has 22 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I understood the manager on the other side to say he \nwould be willing to accommodate by yielding time from his available \ntime to other proponents. I ask the Senator from Ohio how much time he \nthinks he needs?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I state to my colleague, I wonder if I can have 20 \nminutes, and if the Chair can notify me after 20 minutes, we will see \nwho is on the floor and wants to speak at that point.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I am confident that we will have time for the Senator \nfrom Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me first thank and congratulate my \nfriend and colleague from New Jersey, not just for his very eloquent \nstatement and leadership today, but for his work over the years. His \nwork has made a tremendous difference in saving a number of lives.\n  Mr. President, at 10:30 tomorrow morning, Members are going to have \nthe opportunity to do something that we don't always have the chance to \ndo. Many times, we vote on issues and we think we are right, but we \ndon't know what the ultimate effect is going to be. This is one of \nthose times where when we cast our vote, we know what the effect is. \nMembers who come to the floor tomorrow morning at 10:30 to cast their \nvote on this amendment and vote ``yes'' will clearly be saving lives. \nThere is absolutely no doubt about it. That is one thing we know. We \nknow it based on statistics and based on history. We know it based on \ncommon sense. That is, I think, a great opportunity that we will have \ntomorrow. This amendment, make no mistake about it, will save lives.\n  As we consider legislation to authorize funds for most of our \nNation's highways, we cannot avoid the issue of the safety of those \nhighways. Tragically, in the last couple of years we seem to have been \nlosing ground in highway safety. After well over a decade of progress, \nwe are starting slowly to move backward.\n  According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, \nalcohol-related traffic fatalities dropped from 24,050 in 1986 down to \n17,274 in 1995. That was a 28 percent decrease in drunk driving \ntragedies over a decade. We as a nation, Mr. President, can take pride \nin the progress that we made.\n  However, unfortunately, from 1994 to 1995, alcohol-related traffic \nfatalities rose 4 percent--the first increase in over a decade. In \n1995, alcohol-related traffic fatalities increased for the first time \nin a whole decade. That year, there were 17,274 fatalities from \nalcohol-related crashes.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is an attempt to gain back some of the \nground that we have lost in the battle against highway fatalities. It \nwould set a national blood alcohol standard--a standard above which the \ndriver is legally under the influence and should not be driving an \nautomobile. All widely accepted studies indicate that the blood alcohol \nstandard should be set at .08 BAC, the blood alcohol content.\n\n  Mr. President, at .08 blood content, no one should be driving a car. \nI don't know any expert, I don't know any police officer, I don't know \nany scientist who has seriously looked at this issue in the whole \ncountry who does not agree with that--who does not agree that at .08 \nyou are under the influence of alcohol, and your judgment, your \nreflexes, your control of the car, everything is appreciably impaired. \nThere is no doubt about it.\n  Mr. President, the facts are that the risk of being in a crash rises \ngradually with each increase in the blood level content. We know that. \nNHTSA reports that in single-vehicle crashes the relative fatality risk \nfor drivers with blood alcohol content between .05 and .09 is over 11 \ntimes greater than for drivers with a blood alcohol content of zero--11 \ntimes. When a driver reaches or exceeds the .08 alcohol level, the risk \ngoes up even more. In fact, it dramatically shoots up even above that \nhigh standard.\n  Mr. President, at .08, one's vision, one's balance, one's own \nreaction time, one's hearing, judgment, self-control, all are seriously \nimpaired. Moreover, at .08, the critical driving task, concentration, \nattention, speed control, braking, steering, gear change, lane tracking \nare all negatively impacted and affected.\n  We have all heard the arguments. The alcohol industry, in arguing \nagainst this standard, claims that--get this now--only 7 percent of the \nfatal crashes involve drivers with blood alcohol content between .08 \nand .09--only 7 percent. But what does that mean? What that translates \ninto, if you use 1995 figures, it translates into 1,200 people in that \nyear alone dying--1,200 people who are at precisely that level.\n  Some of the opponents of this bill would argue, ``Oh, it is only 7 \npercent.'' Tell that to the parents who lost a child. Tell that to the \nbrothers who lost a sister, or children who lost siblings or who lost \nparents. Changing the\n\n[[Page S1243]]\n\nblood alcohol level content to .08 could have saved many of these \nlives.\n  Where the .08 laws have been tried, they have been proven to reduce \ncrashes and fatalities. A study done at Boston University found that \n.08 laws reduced the overall incidence of alcohol-related fatalities by \n16 percent. Moreover, that same study found that .08 laws also reduced \nfatalities at higher blood alcohol levels by 18 percent.\n  So it doesn't just have an impact on the .08 and .09 level; it serves \nas a deterrent, which affects the entire scale.\n  Lowering the blood alcohol limit to .08 makes it possible to convict \nseriously impaired drivers whose blood alcohol contents are now \nconsidered marginal, because they are just at or just over .10. \nFurther, the .08 blood alcohol level is a supremely reasonable \nstandard.\n  Let's look at the chart again that my colleague from New Jersey, \nSenator Lautenberg, showed a moment ago. I think it is important to \nlook at this because there always is in debates such as this some \nmisinformation that is going around. I think you have to get back to \nthe scientific data and to look at this.\n  In order for a 170-pound male to reach a blood alcohol content of \n.08, that male would have to consume four drinks, four beers, four \nshots, four glasses of wine, four in 1 hour on an empty stomach. Is \nthere anyone in this Chamber, is there anyone in the Senate, who \nbelieves that they could sit down, drink four shots in an hour, and \nthen get behind the wheel and drive? You might be able to do it. But \nwould you be able to do it very well? I think the answer is clearly no.\n  Maybe a better question we all should ask ourselves is how many of \nus, knowing a friend of ours, or acquaintance, or neighbor who had four \ndrinks in an hour on an empty stomach, would say to that person, ``Why \ndon't you take my daughter, Anna, uptown to McDonald's, put her in your \ncar, and drive her?'' It is ludicrous. There isn't a person who would \ndo that. We know that. Yet, that is what it would take to reach the .08 \nstandard.\n  A 135-pound female typically would have to consume three drinks in \nthe same period of time.\n\n  In other words, Mr. President, the .08 standard is targeted towards \nthose who engage, frankly, in binge drinking--not, let me repeat, \nsocial drinking. This bill will not impact social drinkers.\n  The opponents of this legislation apparently want the public to \nbelieve that our legislation would target for prosecution individuals \nwho have had a beer or two, or had a beer and a pizza. That is the \nopposite of the truth.\n  I think we should ask ourselves the simple question: Should the \naverage person who has consumed four shots of distilled spirits in an \nhour, four beers, four glasses of wine on an empty stomach, be behind \nthe wheel of a car? We all know what the answer to that is.\n  Mr. President, the .08 legislation sets an intelligent national \nminimal standard, the same kind of commonsense standard that President \nReagan pointed to in 1984 when he signed legislation raising the \nnational minimum drinking age to 21. The results are in. The results of \nthat action by this Congress and that President are in. In every year \nfor which the national minimum drinking age was changed, roughly 1,000 \nlives were saved.\n  No one believes in States rights more than Ronald Reagan. No one \ntalked about it more eloquently. And there were those when Ronald \nReagan took that position in 1984 who said that is inconsistent, that \nis wrong. We understand that argument. I think Ronald Reagan had it \nright, as he did a lot of times. His answer was very eloquent. This is \nwhat he said about really the same type issue. I quote from President \nReagan:\n\n       This problem is much more than just a State problem. It's a \n     national tragedy. There are some special cases in which \n     overwhelming need can be dealt with by prudent and limited \n     Federal influence. And, in a case like this, I have no \n     misgivings about a judicious use of Federal inducements to \n     save precious lives.\n\n  President Ronald Reagan, 1984, on a very similar issue.\n  Mr. President, our purpose here today is really exactly the same as \nPresident Reagan's was back in 1984. We are working together in a very \nbipartisan way to guarantee a fundamental right, because this really is \nabout rights. It is about freedom--the right of freedom to know that \nwhen you put your family in a car on a highway and you put your child \nin a car, there will be an absolute minimum national standard for how \nsober some other person has to be to drive on that same highway. So, if \nthere is some minimum standard when I am in Cincinnati and leave Ohio \nand go into Kentucky, and maybe a few minutes later go into Indiana, \ncross State lines, that there is some national floor, a minimum \nstandard of responsibility. That is about my freedom as a driver. That \nis about my family's freedom. That is about, I think, responsibility.\n  That is the rationale behind the .08 standard embodied in this \namendment. Simply put, a person at the .08 blood alcohol level is under \nthe influence. No one disputes that. No one. And that person simply \nshould not be driving a car. Our amendment would make this principle \nthe law of the land, and it would save many, many lives.\n  Mr. President, I see that my time is about up. I at this point \nreserve the remainder of the time. I do not know if anyone--Senator \nChafee is on the floor--who wants to speak against the bill at this \npoint wants me to yield time. I see my colleague from Illinois is on \nthe floor. I will reserve the remainder of our time at this point.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you, very much.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for yielding time. I will be \nvery brief because I know time is short. In addition, I would like to \nmake some comments regarding the underlying bill, the ISTEA bill.\n  But, in the first instance, with regard to this amendment, I am very, \nvery pleased to be a cosponsor of the amendment and proud to stand in \nsupport of it today. We were over at the White House this afternoon for \nan announcement regarding this important amendment, the .08 amendment. \nI was just so struck by the families who were there who had lost young \nones, who had lost family members to drunk drivers; struck, also, by \nthe fact that what is being called for in this legislation is \nultimately very, very reasonable.\n\n  This legislation is not prohibition. It does not require someone not \nto drink at all. What it says essentially is you not get plastered when \nyou get behind the wheel, and not get so impaired in your physical \ncapacity that you put other pedestrians and other drivers at risk.\n  Listening to the mother this morning talk about how she was taking \nher daughter to the schoolbus when a drunk driver just came out of \nnowhere and took the little girl's life was enough to send chills \nthrough the heart of any mother, any parent, and certainly ought to \ncommit our attention to the gravity of this matter and the importance \nof it.\n  There is no question but that the .08 blood alcohol level saves \nlives. Studies have shown that States which have adopted .08 laws have \nhad significant drops in alcohol-related traffic deaths and that a \nnational .08 law could prevent up to 600 deaths a year. That does not \neven take into account the injuries, the loss of capacity, the trauma \nto people that could be avoided as well--just in fatalities alone, 500 \nto 600 fatalities a year.\n  My home State of Illinois has a .08 limit.\n  I want to report to everybody who is looking at this issue that the \nresults were immediate and dramatic upon the adoption of this statute \nby the Illinois legislature. In the first holiday weekend in Illinois, \nunder the .08 statute, which was the 4th of July, 1997, alcohol-related \nfatalities were 68 percent lower than the same period in 1996--68 \npercent fewer deaths on a weekend. That is a dramatic result from a \nsimple step that is a reasonable step and that ought to be taken for \nthis entire country.\n  The question has been raised whether or not this is something the \nStates themselves can do. I would point out that, again, my State of \nIllinois has a .08 level. Other States have higher levels. It should \nnot be an accident of geography for Americans to be secure in the \nknowledge that drunk drivers will not confront them on the highways. \nIndividuals should be able to have the\n\n[[Page S1244]]\n\nconfidence that if they cross over the border from Illinois to Indiana, \nor Illinois to Wisconsin, or Illinois to Missouri, that they will enjoy \nthe same safety that they do in our State.\n  I think that this is a commonsense law, a commonsense amendment, it \nis a life-saving amendment, and certainly an amendment whose time has \ncome. I urge my colleagues to support the Lautenberg-DeWine .08 \namendment to ISTEA.\n  Mr. President, I would like to ask unanimous consent--I ask the \nmanager of the bill--to be allowed to speak on the underlying bill and \nthat it not be charged to this amendment.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. What I suggest, Mr. President, is that I am perfectly \nprepared to give 10 minutes from the opponents' side of the amendment \nto the Senator from Illinois, if that is adequate time.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I think it will be. Yes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. All right.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I appreciate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time will be so allocated.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, the good news about ISTEA today is \nthat an agreement has been ratified by the committee that will provide \n$26 billion in additional funding to improve our Nation's highways. The \nbetter news for States like mine and for the Nation's intermodal \ntransportation system is that this additional money will be distributed \nin more effective and fairer ways than the rest of the money authorized \nunder ISTEA. This addition to the underlying ISTEA formula will make \nthis landmark legislation better serve the interests of our entire \ncountry. I congratulate the budget negotiators and the members of the \ncommittee for their sensitivity to the needs of States like Illinois \nand to the role of transportation as an activity that touches all of \nour country and brings us together as a people.\n  My home State of Illinois serves as the transportation hub for our \nNation's commerce. It is home to the world's busiest airport and two of \nthe world's busiest rivers. It is where the Nation's freight railroads \ncome together to move goods from one side of the country to another. It \nis the center of the Nation's truck traffic. If you add up the value of \nall truck shipments in the country, Illinois has by far the largest \nshare of any State. If you count the ton-miles of truck shipments that \npass through States on their way to their final destinations, Illinois \nhas by far the largest share of any State.\n  This map shows very clearly how we are the hub. We are the hub not \nonly for the Midwest but, really, we are the crossroads of the country.\n  Illinois's roads, therefore, must literally bear the weight of the \nlargest share of the Nation's commercial activity and our roads are \nsuffering as a result. According to some estimates, nearly 43 percent \nof Illinois roads need repair, and almost one-fourth of our bridges are \nin substandard condition. Every year, Illinois motorists pay an \nestimated $1 billion in vehicle wear and tear and other expenses \nassociated with poor road conditions.\n  In Chicago the traffic flow on some of the major highways has \nincreased sevenfold since those highways were built in the 1950s and in \nthe 1960s. According to a recent study, Chicago is the fifth most \ncongested city in America.\n  Today's agreement provides relief to Illinois and to our Nation's \ntransportation system, above and beyond the original ISTEA proposal. \nToday's agreement creates a new program, targeted toward high-density \nStates like Illinois. The plan allocates $1.8 billion over the next 5 \nyears for this program, of which Illinois will receive at least $36 \nmillion, and up to $54 million, a year. All told, Illinois will receive \napproximately $900 million more for highway improvements over the next \n6 years under the agreement approved this morning by the Environment \nand Public Works Committee.\n  This is very good news for Chicago area residents who are counting on \nFederal funds to fix the Stevenson Expressway, and not just Chicago \narea residents but everybody who comes through the State using the \nStevenson. This highway was built in 1964 and has become one of the \nmost important arteries in the area, making connections to the Tri-\nState Tollway and the Dan Ryan Expressway. The road, the Stevenson, is \nliterally falling apart. The State has asked for $175 million over the \nnext 2 years to aid in this project, and today's agreement provides \nenough additional funds to Illinois, an additional $200 million every \nyear for the next 6 years, and with that money the State will be able \nto repair the Stevenson on the schedule that is most desirable to \nfacilitate traffic.\n  There is more good news. Wacker Drive, a major two-level road in the \nheart of downtown Chicago, is collapsing. If anyone has ever driven \nWacker Drive in Chicago--it is green, and we used to call it Emerald \nCity down there, but it's a double-decker road. According to a recent \nreport, water leaks through joints of the double-decker road when it \nrains, loosening already fractured concrete and threatening to pour \nchunks of debris onto vehicles on the lower level. If no repairs are \nmade, Wacker Drive will have to be closed in 5 years. This agreement \nallows not only for full funding of the Stevenson repair, but \nadditional funding for Wacker Drive.\n\n  There is more good news, even greater good news for natives of \nwestern Illinois who are counting on Federal assistance for a variety \nof projects along U.S. 67, which runs from just outside of St. Louis, \nin the southwest corner of Illinois, to the Quad Cities in the \nnorthwest corner. So, over in this area.\n  There are literally hundreds of road repair projects planned in my \nState, and today's agreement goes a long way toward turning those plans \ninto actual road improvements.\n  I want to thank Senator Chafee, Senator Baucus and Senator Lautenberg \nfor their hard work in putting this arrangement together.\n  Now, this, today's announcement, I am so pleased about this part of \nit, but I think I would be remiss in not mentioning my sadness that we \nhave not been able to do better by mass transit. We have increased, in \nthis agreement, transportation spending by $26 billion, but not one \nadditional dime will be devoted to mass transit improvements. \nHistorically, there has been a split between spending increases for \nsurface transportation and mass transit in an 80/20 ratio. Preserving \nthis ratio is, I think, essential to ensuring the viability of transit \nsystems around the country.\n  Mass transportation not only moves people from one place to another; \nit helps the environment. Without public transportation, without public \ntransit, there would be 5 million more cars on the road and 27,000 more \nlane miles of road, again increasing the pollution of our environment. \nTransit is also a great economic investment. The net economic return on \npublic expenditures for public transportation is 4 or 5 to 1. When mass \ntransit improvements are made, land values go up, commercial \ndevelopment increases, jobs are created and people can get where the \njobs are. They can get to work. Without transit, congestion alone would \ncost our national economy some $15 billion annually. In the Chicago \narea, in my State, congestion and bottlenecks already sap economic \nproductivity, it is estimated, by about $2.8 billion every year. \nWithout the additional investments in the area's transit system, that \nnumber could increase.\n  Again, it is regrettable that we have not been able to do more for \nmass transit. We have great needs. The Regional Transportation \nAuthority of Northeastern Illinois, the Chicago Transit Authority, \nMetra, and all of the transit authorities in the State, are in dire \nneed of additional support. I hope before this legislation is \nfinalized, we will understand the importance of mass transit to the \nIntermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, to the efficiency of \nour surface transportation effort in this country.\n  But in the meantime, I did want to take this opportunity--I thank \nSenator Chafee for indulging me this time--but also to say thank you to \nhim and the other budget negotiators for the additions and for the \nimprovements, in my opinion, to the underlying formula. I think this \ngoes a long way, again, to achieving the goals of the ISTEA, achieving \nthe goals of intermodal surface transportation efficiency.\n  We ought to talk about transportation as a people issue, which it \nreally is. It's not just about roads and bridges and cars and trucks; \nit is about the people of this country being connected one to the other \nand being able to\n\n[[Page S1245]]\n\ncarry out the commerce and the activity that keep this country strong. \nI thank these negotiators for their work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois for those very kind comments. I am glad we are able to be of \nhelp.\n  I will say she is a tenacious battler for Illinois, so I was \nparticularly glad we were able to be of some help in the particular \nsituation Illinois faced.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Arkansas has some comments. How much \ntime do I have? Is the proponents' time--perhaps you could give us an \naccount of the time.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the proponents has expired. The \nSenator from Rhode Island has 53 minutes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I yield such time as the Senator from Arkansas needs.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I appreciate this indulgence. I ask consent to speak \nin morning business. I am going to speak on a different subject. If the \nchairman would like that not to count against his time----\n  Mr. CHAFEE. That is fine. How long will my colleague be, roughly?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Up to 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Fine.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask consent to speak 15 minutes as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, may I just say one other thing? I would \nlike to say to all Senators who are listening that now is your chance \nto come over and speak against the amendment if you so choose. Time is \nrunning out here and, frankly, at the conclusion of the comments of the \nSenator from Arkansas and then a couple of minutes that the Senator \nfrom Ohio wants, unless there are people present wanting to speak, it \nis my intention to yield back the remainder of our time and have the \nSenate go out.\n  So, anybody who wants to speak about this amendment--they will have a \nhalf-hour tomorrow, that is true. But now is the time to come over. We \nhave some 50 minutes. The Senator will be taking 15, so there will be \n35 or 40 minutes left. Now is the time to speak against the measure if \nanybody wishes to.\n  If the Senator will proceed?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I take a moment to commend the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island and compliment him for the outstanding leadership he \nprovided the Environment and Public Works Committee on the ISTEA II \nbill.\n  It has been suggested he should be nominated, if you have not been, \nfor a Nobel Peace Prize for bringing all the various factions together \nin what is, I think, a very worthwhile bill that will be to the benefit \nof all Americans. I commend the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/03/senate-section/article/S1225-2", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1245-S1246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PRESIDENT CLINTON'S STATEMENT CONCERNING THE TAX CODE TERMINATION ACT\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, yesterday, while millions of American \nhouseholds across the country were struggling to understand which of \nthe 480 separate IRS tax forms applied to them, while they were \ntrudging along, trying to read through the accompanying 280 \nsupplemental explanatory IRS pamphlets, while their tax accountants and \ntax attorneys worked hard to keep them abreast of the more than 800,000 \nwords which make up this country's Tax Code, and while families \nnervously anticipated the impending IRS deadline of April 15, which is \nnow less than 6 weeks away, President Clinton had the audacity to call \nmy efforts to sunset this country's incomprehensible maze that we call \na Tax Code in the year 2001--irresponsible.\n  Following his speech, President Clinton's chief economic adviser Gene \nSperling equated my bill, the Tax Code Termination Act, with ``reckless \nriver boat gambling.'' Worse yet, President Clinton's Deputy Treasury \nSecretary stated, ``We have a Tax Code today that works better for \nAmericans as they do what is crucial to them in their lives.'' He said \nthat the Tax Code works for Americans.\n  No; Americans may feel they work for the Tax Code. They surely do not \nbelieve that the Tax Code works for them. In short, the President and \nhis advisers were telling the American people in the midst of their \n``tax season migraines,'' that this Tax Code works just fine. Are the \nAmerican people to believe that President Clinton and his economic \nadvisers do not see anything wrong with Americans spending a combined \ntotal of 5.4 billion hours--the equivalent of 2 full work weeks--\ncomplying with tax provisions? Are Americans to believe that their \nPresident does not see anything wrong with the Tax Code that costs this \ncountry more than $157 billion per year? Is it possible that the \nPresident and his key advisers see nothing wrong with spending $13.7 \nbillion per year enforcing the Tax Code, yet the IRS fails to provide \ncorrect answers to taxpayers seeking assistance almost one-quarter of \nthe time?\n\n  I think the American people will be able to decide who is being \nirresponsible and will be able to easily separate the ``river boat \ngamblers'' from the sincere legislators working to better their \neveryday lives.\n  President Clinton's criticism of the Tax Code Termination Act centers \naround the notion that one should not set a date to sunset a law until \na new law is written and ready to replace it. Doing so, in President \nClinton's eyes, would be irresponsible. Well, is it irresponsible to \nsunset this country's transportation programs, which spend over $23 \nbillion per year, before a new transportation program is written and \nready to be put into law? Is it irresponsible to sunset this country's \nhigher education programs before a new law is drafted? Of course not. \nIn fact, right now this Congress is in the midst of debating a new \ntransportation spending program and a new higher education program for \none simple reason. When these major spending bills were passed and \nsigned into law, they contained sunset provisions which terminated \nthese programs 5 years after they were implemented. In fact, every \nmajor spending program currently on the books contains similar sunset \nlanguage.\n  The truth of the matter is that President Clinton doesn't mind \nsunsetting provisions when the law allows the Government to spend \nbillions of dollars in taxpayers' money. The President does not mind \nsunsetting Head Start, doesn't mind sunsetting Pell grants or school \nlunches. Sunsetting only becomes irresponsible to this President when \nthe law being sunset deals with provisions which take money from the \npockets of hard-working Americans.\n  The Tax Code Termination Act is anything but ``irresponsible.'' This \nact simply sets a date certain, well into the future, when the Tax Code \nwill need to be reauthorized, which will simply place taxes and \nspending on equal footing. This bill will force Congress to completely \nrethink how we collect hard-earned taxpayer money and, as with major \nspending programs, it will allow a healthy debate to ensue on the \nmerits, effectiveness and efficiency of the law as it is currently \nwritten.\n  Why is the President afraid to treat taxes and spending equally? Why \nshould sunset provisions only apply to one but not the other? Maybe it \nis because the President knows that this tax system cannot withstand \nclose scrutiny--that it can't even stand cursory scrutiny. Maybe the \nPresident is afraid that Americans will feel empowered to force this \nCongress to rethink the amount and methods used to take their hard-\nearned money. Maybe the President is afraid that he will lose the power \nto hide tax provisions that benefit favored special-interest groups \ndeep within this large and complex Tax Code? Finally, the President \nstated yesterday that the Tax Code Termination Act would create \nuncertainty--skillfully noting that ``uncertainty is the enemy of \neconomic growth.'' Mr. President, is there any certainty in this \nsystem? Can one be sure that despite trying diligently to comply with \nthis complex and incomprehensible tax system, one still won't be \ndragged into court and fined for failure to accurately comply with \nevery jot and every tittle of the Tax Code? Can one be certain that \nthey haven't overpaid or underpaid, that they haven't missed a \ndeduction that is owed them or claimed a deduction for which they don't \nqualify?\n\n  No; the only thing certain about this system is that it guarantees \none's rights can be trampled by an overempowered IRS and that one's \neconomic freedom can be jeopardized by overzealous tax collectors.\n\n[[Page S1246]]\n\n  While the President claims that his opposition to the Tax Code \nTermination Act is to protect business by ensuring them a long-term \nlandscape on which to make major business investment decisions, most \nbusiness-led tax organizations actually support our efforts to \nterminate this Tax Code. The National Federation of Independent \nBusiness, Citizens for a Sound Economy, and others know firsthand how \nmany billions of dollars per year they waste trying to understand this \nTax Code, much less comply with the Tax Code. They see their profits \neaten up by tax lawyers and tax accountants. They know full well that \nthe real uncertainty is in the current code, not in any distant sunset \nof the current code, and they know that the Tax Code Termination Act \nwill create a clean slate on which a fairer, simpler Tax Code can be \nbuilt.\n  I am certain that when and if President Clinton attempts to take this \ndebate outside the beltway, he will quickly learn who is being \nirresponsible; he will quickly see where the American people stand on \nthis important issue.\n  Finally, the Tax Code Termination Act, sponsored by myself and \nSenator Brownback of Kansas, is currently supported by the entire \nSenate Republican leadership and is being cosponsored by 26 fellow \nSenators. I urge the President to rethink his position, and I urge my \nfellow Members to get behind this effort and take the first step in \nsimplifying our Tax Code by setting a date certain that this code will \nexpire.\n  It is one thing, Mr. President, to be cautious. It is one thing to be \nprudent. It is quite another to be controlled by timidity and frozen \ninto inaction. As my colleagues have said, the Tax Code has had its \nplace in history, now we need to make it a part of history. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in that effort.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/03/senate-section/article/S1245-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1246-S1249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        INTERMODAL SURFACE TRANSPORTATION EFFICIENCY ACT OF 1997\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The Senator from North Dakota wants to speak in favor of \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is correct.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. How much time does the Senator want?\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield 10 minutes, I will try not to \nuse all 10.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. That is fine, 10 minutes, from the time of the opponents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to support the Lautenberg amendment. I \nintend to vote for it, and I am pleased to support a piece of \nlegislation I think will be important in saving lives in our country.\n  Before I do, I want to talk about three quick items. One is the \namendment that has just been adopted, the McCain amendment. I would \nthen like to talk about the Lautenberg amendment and then, finally, an \namendment I am going to offer following the disposition of the \nLautenberg amendment.\n  The McCain amendment which has been adopted now contains a provision \nI want to call attention to dealing with high-speed police pursuit. It \nis an issue I have been involved with for some long while. I care a \ngreat deal about it, and I have introduced legislation for a number of \nyears, part of which has now been included in the McCain amendment \ndealing with safety.\n\n  There are in this country many instances in which high-speed police \npursuits are not only necessary but virtually mandatory, and I \nunderstand that. There are other circumstances in this country, where \nhigh-speed police pursuits are inappropriate and result in the death of \ninnocent people. Nearly 400 people a year are killed and many others \nare injured in high-speed police pursuits.\n  One ought to be able to expect all across this country, no matter \nwhere one is driving, that law enforcement jurisdictions are given good \ntraining and have good policies dealing with high-speed police \npursuits. That is my intention with the legislation.\n  I also feel that I would like to do more. I would like to make sure \nthat in the future, with respect to high-speed police pursuits, that we \nhave a provision that anyone who believes they should be able to flee \nfrom law enforcement when law enforcement attempts to apprehend them \nwill lose their vehicle and will have certain jail time. We ought to \nsend the message to all people in this country that you are the villain \nin high-speed police pursuits. If you don't stop when a law enforcement \nofficer attempts to stop you, there are going to be consequences, and \nsignificant consequences. We can save lives by that. And the McCain \namendment just adopted includes my provision dealing with high-speed \npolice pursuits and incentives for more training and uniform policies. \nI think that is a step forward.\n  Second, the Lautenberg amendment, which I am pleased to support, and \nI hope will have the support of a majority of Members in the U.S. \nSenate. I understand that some can quibble here or there about .08 or \n.10 or .12--this, that, or the other thing. I do not think anyone will \nquibble with the statement made earlier today by one of my colleagues \nin which he asked the question: Would you like to put your son or \ndaughter in a car with someone who had four drinks in the last hour and \nhas a .08 blood alcohol content?\n  Under current law, that person is not drunk. But is that the car you \nwould like your son or daughter in? I think not. Mr. President, .08, I \nam told, relates to the blood alcohol content of a man roughly 170 \npounds who has had four drinks in an hour.\n  In this country, we license people to drive. No one in this country \nshould be empowered to drive and drink at the same time. It can turn an \nautomobile into an instrument of murder and does every 30 minutes, \ncausing someone else to die on America's roads and streets because \nsomeone decided to drink alcohol and drive.\n  We have had incentive programs previously dealing with drunk driving. \nSome have worked, some have worked a bit, some have worked well, and \nsome have not worked at all. The Senator's amendment is very simple. \nThe proposition of this amendment is to say that our road programs in \nthis country are national programs. We know they are national because \nwe come here and talk about roads being a national priority. Even the \nsmallest, the most remote, and the least populated areas of our country \nhave roads because those roads allow people to get from one place to \nanother.\n  Yes, my State is a smaller State, and less populated, but as they \nmove frozen shrimp and fresh fish from coast to coast, guess what? They \ntruck that through North Dakota, and we need roads in all parts of our \ncountry to have a first-class economy. A country with a first-class \neconomy needs good infrastructure, and that means good roads.\n  Because roads represent a national priority and are a national \nprogram, it seems to me perfectly logical to understand that anyone \ndriving in this country ought to have some assurance that they are not \ngoing to run into someone coming down the other lane who is driving in \na jurisdiction or a State where they are told it's OK to have .10 or \n.12. No one in this country should expect to meet someone at the next \nintersection, in the next State, or the next county where the driver is \ndrinking. So I am going to support this amendment that calls for a \nnational standard of .08.\n  Let me tell you about the other amendment I am going to offer \nfollowing this amendment, which I hope my colleagues will support as \nwell.\n  Mr. President, did you know there are five States in this country \nwhere you can put a fist around a bottle of whiskey and the other \naround the steering wheel, and you are perfectly legal? There is not \none jurisdiction in America where that ought to be legal--not one city, \none county, one township where it ought to be legal for anyone to get \nbehind the wheel of a car and drink. Five States now allow that.\n  Over 20 States allow, if not the driver to drink, the rest of the \npeople in the car to have a party. They can get plenty of whiskey and \nplenty of beer, and they can go down the road and have a great old \nparty. Over 20 States say that is fine, as long as the driver doesn't \ndrink, and in five of them the driver can drink as well. There is not \none jurisdiction that ought to allow that.\n  My amendment has the same sanction as the amendment proposed by the\n\n[[Page S1247]]\n\nSenator from New Jersey. It simply says that every State in this \ncountry, because we have a national roads program, that as drivers, we \ncan expect some uniformity in treatment across this country when we are \ndriving up to the next intersection. We should expect that no one we \nwill meet in this country is going to be legally empowered to drive the \nvehicle and drink in the same set of actions.\n  I will offer that on the floor. I offered it previously several years \nago, about 3 years ago, and I missed having that amendment adopted by \nthree votes--only three. I don't know how many people have died because \nwe didn't do that, but some. I don't know their names. But some \nfamilies have gotten the call, families like the wonderful family of \nthe Senator from Ohio and others in this Chamber, the Bumpers family--\nSenator Bumpers, who several years ago gave one of the most eloquent \nspeeches on the floor of the Senate about the tragedy in his family.\n  Families have gotten that call because we didn't do what we should \ndo. We should, as a country, decide that there are certain and \nsignificant sanctions for those who drink and drive and that we can \nexpect on a national basis that everywhere you go in America, \neverywhere you drive a car, you will not only have a .08 standard, but \nyou will have some assurance that you are not going to meet at the next \nintersection or on the next county, State, or even township road \nsomeone who is drinking and driving.\n  Someone said earlier today that you have a right to drive in this \ncountry, but you ought not to have a right to drive and drink. I \nattended a ceremony today that the Senator from New Jersey and the \nSenator from Ohio attended and heard the statement by a young woman who \nhad just lost her 9-year-old daughter in the not-too-distant past. She \nspoke again of the tragedy that her family experienced because someone \nelse decided they were going to drink and drive.\n  To close this discussion, I want to say this. It is one thing for us \nto come to the floor of the Senate and talk about devoting resources, \nenergy, and effort to try to do something about something we are not \ncertain how to cure. This is not some mysterious illness for which we \ndo not know the cure. We understand what causes these deaths, and we \nunderstand how to stop them.\n  Mothers Against Drunk Driving, God bless that organization and the \npeople who every day in every way fight to make things better on this \nsubject. And we have made some progress. We have made some improvement. \nBut we can do much, much better. We are not near the standard that many \nof our European allies and our European neighbors have adopted on these \nissues, saying to people: ``Understand this about drinking and driving. \nIf you are going to be out and you have a vehicle, you better not be \ndrinking, because the sanctions are tough. If you get picked up for \ndrunk driving, you are in trouble.''\n  That is what this country ought to say as well. Have a designated \ndriver, take a taxi, do any range of things, but understand as a \ncountry that we take this seriously and we intend to do some things on \nthe floor of this Senate in this piece of legislation to say to the \nAmerican people: We care about this issue, and we can save lives in a \nthoughtful manner without abridging anyone else's right.\n  I do not know who said it today--perhaps it was the Senator from \nOhio--that you have a right to get drunk, I guess, in this country, but \nyou do not have a right to get drunk and drive. That ought to be a \nmessage from the .08 amendment, and I hope from my amendment that \nfollows, that this country says that to everyone living here and \neveryone intending to drive in the future. Mr. President, I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I have said several times tonight that the \nopportunity for those who wish to speak against this amendment is now. \nNo one showed up to speak against the amendment. Therefore, I have been \nyielding time to the proponents of the amendment. We have the Senator \nfrom Washington who wishes to speak in support of the amendment for \nabout 10 minutes, and then after the conclusion of that, I will yield \nan additional 3 or 4 minutes to the Senator from Ohio. Then it is my \nintention to close up shop here and put the Senate out.\n  So, I do not know how much time we have left.\n  How much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 31 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. So, anybody who wants to speak against the amendment, now \nis the time, or they will be relegated to tomorrow where there will be \nhalf an hour to speak against it. So I yield the Senator from \nWashington such time as he needs, maybe 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Ten minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, last week, when I was first informed of \nthe proposal by the Senator from New Jersey, I was torn. I agreed \ntotally with his philosophy, but I also have a great deal of respect \nfor the States and for their legislatures that, of course, have full \njurisdiction over this problem. Many States have acted, and other \nStates are in the process of acting.\n  Over the weekend, however, I ceased to be pulled in two separate \ndirections on this subject by a remarkable article directly on point in \nthe Sunday Seattle Times.\n  I would like to share with my colleagues some of that article. Then \nat the end, I will place the entire news story in the Record. The news \nstory was on a great success story in American society, the reduction \nin automobile deaths. While it deals with the State of Washington, I am \ncertain that it is of relatively universal application, to a greater or \nlesser extent, all across the United States.\n  An early paragraph in the article reads:\n\n       The numbers are clear: The state's roads are not just a \n     little safer in the 1990s than in decades past, they're much \n     safer. You're a lot less likely to be in an accident than in \n     earlier times. And if you are in one, you're less likely to \n     be seriously injured or killed.\n       Last year, there were 1.3 deaths for every 100 million \n     miles driven on Washington's roads and highways. In 1953, as \n     far back as comparable statistics are available, the figure \n     was four times higher--at 5.1 deaths per 100 million miles.\n\n  Incidentally, Mr. President, 1953 was the year in which I moved to \nthe State of Washington straight out of school. So our roads are now \nfour times safer than they were in 1953.\n  The article goes on to speak about causes for this remarkable social \nsuccess, and says:\n\n       Dr. Fred Rivara, director of Harborview Medical Center's \n     Injury Prevention and Research Center, says the long-term \n     improvement is ``clearly due to a combination of a lot of \n     factors''--safer cars, high seat-belt use, air bags, a \n     gradual reduction in drunken driving, construction of \n     interstate highways and improved trauma care for the \n     seriously injured.\n       Moffat, of the Traffic Safety Commission, identifies \n     freeway construction as ``the single most significant safety \n     factor'' because interstates are roughly three times as safe \n     as other roads and city streets. . . .\n\n  They go on to say--and it is relevant directly to the amendment of \nthe Senator from New Jersey--\n\n       With the freeways built, the traffic-safety focus shifted \n     to drunken driving and the simple defensive measure of \n     encouraging drivers to use their seatbelts.\n       ``Organizations such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving \n     deserve a lot of credit for bringing that about,'' says \n     Rivara. ``They succeeded in changing public attitudes about \n     drunk driving.''\n       One result has been a renewed effort in Olympia to pass \n     tougher drunken-driving laws. One bill would lower the blood-\n     alcohol concentration for driving under the influence to 0.08 \n     percent from 0.10 percent. . . .\n\n  Precisely what the Senator from New Jersey proposes.\n\n       The state's death rate essentially has remained at its \n     record-low level for the past six years. Further improvement \n     will require a renewed focus on drunken drivers and seat-belt \n     use, Moffat says, because at this stage ``belts and booze are \n     the secrets of success.''\n       Figures from the National Highway Transportation Safety \n     Administration clearly indicate part of the problem. \n     Nationwide, alcohol played a role in about 41 percent of \n     traffic deaths in 1996. . . . In California, the figure was \n     40 percent and in Oregon, 42 percent.\n       But in Washington, alcohol was involved in fully half of \n     all traffic fatalities. Furthermore, NHTSA figures show that \n     the influence of alcohol in traffic deaths hasn't dropped \n     nearly as much in Washington as it has nationally or in \n     California and Oregon.\n       Moffat, a Seattle policeman for 25 years before moving to \n     the Traffic Safety Commission in 1995, is convinced that \n     tougher\n\n[[Page S1248]]\n\n     drunken-driving laws are the key to safer roads. Oregon and \n     California both have them, and they work, he says. Moffat \n     estimates that similar legislation here would cut fatalities \n     by at least 10 percent.\n       ``What that means in real terms is 70 fewer deaths'' each \n     year, he says.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, that, in one State, is what we are discussing \nhere in this amendment. In the State of Washington, with roughly 2 \npercent of the population of the United States of America, \napproximately 70 fewer traffic deaths per year.\n  Now, that figure may be smaller in some States that already have the \n.08 standard. I suspect it may be larger in those whose drunken-driving \nlaws are less significantly enforced.\n  But, Mr. President, this brings it down to the basic level of \nindividual deaths in individual parts of our country. I found that \narticle to be overwhelmingly persuasive. I trust that the legislature \nof my State will in fact pass a law which is now halfway through the \nlegislative process. But to encourage strongly, to encourage every \nState to do exactly the same thing is the key to fewer traffic deaths.\n  We are not dealing with unknowns here. We are not dealing with \npredictions. We are dealing with now a history, a history of more than \n40 years of keeping track of traffic deaths in my State, a four-times \nreduction in traffic deaths. And now we have an opportunity to reduce \nthem by another 10 percent, perhaps more than 10 percent through this \naction.\n  It is, Mr. President, action that we ought to take and ought to take \npromptly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the entire news \narticle printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Seattle Times, March 1, 1998]\n\n                   State's Roads Are The Safest Ever\n\n                             (By Tom Brown)\n\n       Forget road rage, rampaging sport-utility vehicles and \n     tailgating semis.\n       Despite those and two more-serious road hazards--drunken \n     drivers and failure to buckle up--driving in Washington is \n     safer than it has ever been.\n       The numbers are clear: The state's roads are not just a \n     little safer in the 1990s than in decades past, they're much \n     safer. You're a lot less likely to be in an accident than in \n     earlier times. And if you are in one, you're less likely to \n     be seriously injured or killed.\n       ``When we're frustrated by some civic problems, this is one \n     where we're actually making progress,'' says John Moffat, \n     director of the Washington Traffic Safety Commission.\n       This progress gets overlooked amid reports of pistol-waving \n     road-ragers and horrific accidents such as one last month in \n     Bothell in which three people died when a van was crushed \n     between two trucks and exploded in flames.\n       Last year, there were 1.3 deaths for every 100 million \n     miles driven on Washington's roads and highways. In 1953, as \n     far back as comparable statistics are available, the figure \n     was four times higher--at 5.1 deaths per 100 million miles.\n       Despite a big increase in population and a jump in the \n     number of miles driven in the state, the actual number of \n     people who die annually in traffic accidents has declined \n     over the past 20 years.\n       The last time more than 1,000 people died on Washington \n     roads was in 1979. Last year, there were 663 traffic deaths, \n     even though 73 percent more miles were traveled on \n     state roads than in 1979.\n       One of the most striking aspects of the traffic record is \n     that the major measures of safety--death rate, serious-injury \n     rate and collision rate--have all either declined or held \n     steady despite worsening congestion and the consequent driver \n     frustration that leads to occasional violence.\n       In the past decade, while the central Puget Sound region \n     was establishing its reputation as one of the most-congested \n     driving areas in the country, both the state's traffic-death \n     rate and serious-injury rate have declined by about 50 \n     percent.\n       Dr. Fred Rivara, director of Haborview Medical Center's \n     Injury Prevention and Research Center, says the long-term \n     improvement is ``clearly due to a combination of a lot of \n     factors''--safer cars, high seat-belt use, air bags, a \n     gradual reduction in drunken driving, construction of \n     interstate highways and improved trauma care for the \n     seriously injured.\n       Moffat, of the Traffic Safety Commission, identifies \n     freeway construction as ``the single most significant safety \n     factor'' because interstates are roughly three times as safe \n     as other roads and city streets. The first major decline in \n     the state's traffic-death rate coincided with the replacement \n     of Highway 99 by Interstate 5 as the state's north-south \n     arterial in the 1960s.\n       More recently, the new Interstate 90 Floating Bridge also \n     has helped cut the death toll, Moffat says. The original \n     bridge across Lake Washington, which sank in 1990, had an \n     awkward bulge in the middle where it opened occasionally for \n     shipping. It also had reversible lanes during rush hours.\n       These features produced six or seven deaths a year, Moffat \n     says, while traffic deaths on I-90's two new bridges are \n     rare. He estimates the new bridges, alone, have saved about \n     70 lives in the past decade.\n       With the freeways built, the traffic-safety focus shifted \n     to drunken driving and the simple defensive measure of \n     encouraging drivers to use their seat belts.\n       The first major legislative shots in the state's war on \n     drunken driving were fired in 1979, when traffic deaths \n     peaked at 1,034. Since then, the death rate has plummeted by \n     nearly two-thirds, from 3.6 to 1.3 per 100 million miles.\n       ``Organizations such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving \n     deserve a lot of credit for bringing that about,'' says \n     Rivara. ``They succeeded in changing public attitudes about \n     drunk driving.''\n       Celebrated cases also have galvanized people to act. One \n     such case was the death last year of Mary Johnsen of \n     Issaquah, who was struck and killed by a van driven by a \n     repeat drunken driver while walking along a residential \n     street with her husband.\n       ``I don't know that Mary Johnsen's death was inherently any \n     more tragic than any of the 300 other drunk-driving deaths \n     last year, but it touched a lot of people,'' says Moffat.\n       One result has been a renewed effort in Olympia to pass \n     tougher drunken-driving laws. One bill would lower the blood-\n     alcohol concentration for driving under the influence to 0.08 \n     percent from 0.10 percent. Another would allow authorities to \n     impound and forfeit the vehicles of drunken drivers.\n       The state's death rate essentially has remained at its \n     record-low level for the past six years. Further improvement \n     will require a renewed focus on drunken drivers and seat-belt \n     use, Moffat says, because at this state ``belts and booze are \n     the secrets to success.''\n       Figures from the National Highway Transportation Safety \n     Administration (NHTSA) clearly indicate part of the problem. \n     Nationwide, alcohol played a rule in about 41 percent of \n     traffic deaths in 1996 (1997 figures are not yet available). \n     In California, the figure was 40 percent and in Oregon, 42 \n     percent.\n       But in Washington, alcohol was involved in fully half of \n     all traffic fatalities. Further more, NHTSA figures show that \n     the influence of alcohol in traffic deaths hasn't dropped \n     nearly as much in Washington as it has nationally or in \n     California and Oregon.\n       Moffat, a Seattle policeman for 25 years before moving to \n     the Traffic Safety Commission in 1995, is convinced that \n     tougher drunken-driving laws are the key to safer roads. \n     Oregon and California both have them, and they work, he says. \n     Moffat estimates that similar legislation here would cut \n     fatalities by at least 10 percent.\n       ``What that means in real terms is 70 fewer deaths'' each \n     year, he says.\n\n\n                       more of us use seat belts\n\n       Despite more drunks on the road, Washington's highway-death \n     rate is substantially below the national average, which was \n     1.7 per 100 million miles in 1996. That's because more \n     drivers here use their seat belts--about 85 percent, Moffat \n     says, compared with an average of about 60 percent \n     nationally, a figure that varies widely from state to state.\n       In Washington, of those who die in auto accidents, only 35 \n     or 40 percent have their seat belts on.\n       ``Some accidents are going to kill anyway,'' Moffat says. \n     But in a potentially fatal crash--defined as two vehicles \n     colliding head-on at 35 mph or an auto hitting a solid object \n     at 60 mph--seat belts raise the chances of survival to 50 \n     percent.\n       Moffat concludes that of the 60 percent or so who die \n     unbelted each year, half could save themselves with this \n     simple, two-second maneuver. That would be perhaps another \n     150 lives saved.\n       But as Rivara notes, those most at risk for fatal \n     accidents--the intoxicated and young, male drivers--are the \n     least likely to use seat belts.\n       As for road rage, it's no laughing matter--particularly for \n     those who have been shot at or otherwise threatened. But \n     statistically, it is a minuscule contributor to highway-\n     safety problems, and Moffat suggests that residents keep \n     their focus on more fundamental concerns.\n       ``When I look at 330 drunken-driving deaths, that is a \n     tremendous problem,'' he says. ``Road rage doesn't even raise \n     the needle.''\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Ten minutes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. All right, fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the great State of Ohio is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleague and thank the Chair.\n  This amendment has received a great deal of attention from the \neditorial boards across this country. I would like just to read \nexcerpts from several of them because I think their reasoning is quite \ngood.\n  Let me cite first the Austin American Statesman, October 30:\n\n       Let's say it one more time: DWI laws don't have a thing to \n     do with prohibition,\n\n[[Page S1249]]\n\n     partying, or Puritanism. They aren't intended to interfere \n     with anyone's right to drink alcohol socially or \n     antisocially, responsibly or irresponsibly, in vast or \n     moderate quantities. The law just asks drinkers not to \n     operate heavy machinery on the States' roads and highways \n     while under the influence of alcohol.\n\n  The Baltimore Sun:\n\n       You're driving on the beltway. The motorist in the next \n     lane consumed four beers during the past hour. To paraphrase \n     Clint Eastwood, ``Do you feel lucky?'' Amazingly, that tipsy \n     driver may be within his legal rights.\n\n  And they end up:\n\n       Four drinks in one State makes you no less drunk than four \n     drinks in another State. The abundant evidence justifies a \n     national response.\n\n  The Omaha World-Herald:\n\n       Yes to a national drunk driving law. Congress uses the \n     threat of withheld funds too often, in our opinion, to force \n     its will upon the States. In this case, however, the States \n     would merely be required to set an intoxication standard that \n     reflects research on how alcohol affects driving.\n\n  That is the Omaha World-Herald, October 29.\n  The Wall Street Journal said this:\n\n       Safe alcohol levels should be set by health experts, not \n     the lobby for Hooters and Harrah's. The Lautenberg-DeWine \n     amendment isn't a drive toward prohibition, but an uphill \n     push toward health consensus.\n\n  The Toledo Blade:\n\n       Complaints from the beverage industry that the new limits \n     would target social drinkers and not alcoholics are \n     ridiculous and dangerous. All that matters is whether the \n     person behind the wheel has had too much to drink. Whether he \n     or she is a social drinker is irrelevant.\n\n  Finally, New York Newsday:\n\n       It should be obvious that cracking down on drunk driving is \n     an urgent matter of health and safety. The attack is not \n     against drinking; it's against drinking and driving.\n\n  Mr. President, my colleagues have said it very, very well. My \ncolleague from North Dakota a few moments ago said it well. He says it \nis not complicated. It is not complicated how you reduce auto \nfatalities. This is an easy way to save lives. And this is a way that \nwill save lives.\n  At 10:30 tomorrow morning we are going to have a chance to do \nsomething very simple. We are going to have the chance to come to this \nfloor and cast a yes vote on this amendment. It is one time when we \nwill know the consequences of our act. And the consequence of that act, \nif we pass this, if it becomes law, will be simply this: Fewer families \nwill have their families shattered, fewer families will have their \nlives changed forever. That is what the loss of a child or loss of a \nmother or father to drunk driving does--it changes your life forever.\n  We will save some families from that tragedy. We will never know who \nthey are. They will never know. But we can be guaranteed that we will \nhave done that and done that much tomorrow morning. This is a very \nrational and reasonable proposal. I say that because it sets the \nstandard at .08.\n  I will repeat something I said a moment ago--and I am going to \ncontinue to state it because I think it is so important --and that is: \nNo one, no expert who has looked at this believes that someone who \ntests .08 has not had their driving ability appreciably impaired. No \none who has looked at this thinks that someone who tests .08 should be \nbehind the wheel of a car. If any of my colleagues who might be \nlistening doubt that, tonight or early tomorrow morning--we all know \npolice officers; we all know people who have been in emergency rooms; \nwe all know people who have seen DUIs and who know who they tested--\npick up the phone and call one of your police officers.\n  Pick up the phone and call a member of the highway patrol who may \nhave picked up someone, who has picked up probably dozens of people who \nhave been drinking and driving, and ask them if, in their professional \nopinion, they think someone who tests .08 or above has any business \nbeing behind the wheel of a car. I will guarantee you, the answer will \nbe unanimous.\n  The fact is, the more someone knows about the subject, the more \nadamant they will be about that. I became involved in this issue a \nnumber of years ago when I was an assistant county prosecuting \nattorney. One of my jobs was to prosecute DUI--DWI cases we used to \ncall them in those days.\n  I can tell you from my own experience, someone who tests .08--and I \nhave seen the videotape, as they say. I have seen the replays. I have \nseen the tapes that are taken right before the person takes the test. \nAnd I have compared those videotapes where you can see the person \nstaggering, you can see the person's speech slurred, you can see their \ncoordination impaired. I compared that with the tests. I will tell you \nfrom my own experience in observing, a person at .08 absolutely, no \ndoubt about it, should not be behind the wheel.\n\n  Look what other countries have done. Senator Lautenberg showed the \nchart. Canada, Great Britain, Australia, Austria, all at .08 or below. \nThis is a rational and reasonable thing to do. It is reasonable, as \nRonald Reagan said, to have some minimum national standards that assure \nhighway safety.\n  We live in a country where we get in a car and we think nothing of \ncrossing one, two, three, four, five State lines, and we do it \nliterally all the time. There ought to be some national standard, some \nfloor, some assurance when you put your child in a car, when you get in \nthe car with your wife and your loved ones, some assurance that \nwhatever State you are in, wherever you are driving, that level is .08. \nThat is a rational floor. It is a rational basis.\n  Again, despite all the scientific evidence, despite all the \narguments, still there are some who would say this bill is an attack \nagainst social drinkers; this amendment will mean if I have two beers \nand a pizza I will not be able to drive. That is simply not true. All \nthe scientific data, all the tests, all the anecdotal information tells \nus that is simply not true.\n  Let me again go back and repeat what the scientific data shows. It \nshows that when a male weighing 160 pounds has four drinks in an hour--\nit takes four drinks on an empty stomach in an hour for that adult male \nat 160 pounds to reach the .08 level. I don't think anyone believes \nthat person should be behind the wheel, and I don't think there is \nanyone in this Chamber who will turn their child over to that person.\n  Mr. President, again we will have the opportunity tomorrow to save \nlives. I urge my colleagues to cast a ``yes'' vote on the Lautenberg-\nDeWine amendment. It will, in fact, save lives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Now, Mr. President, we have made valiant efforts to get \nthe opponents of this measure here. We have given them every chance in \nthe world. They have not shown up. Any opponents who want to speak will \nhave half an hour tomorrow to speak.\n  I therefore propose that we close shop here.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/03/senate-section/article/S1246-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the distinguished \nMinority Leader, the distinguished Chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee and with the distinguished Senator from New York, Mr. \nMoynihan. Both Senator Moynihan and Senator Helms served with \ndistinction on the Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government \nSecrecy. They are to be congratulated for their efforts. Senator \nMoynihan and I have spoken repeatedly about his commitment to \ndeclassifying information while protecting legitimate secrets.\n  S. 712, the Government Secrecy Act of 1997, is a complex piece of \nlegislation. Chairman Thompson has already held a hearing in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. Other committees have legitimate and \nappropriate concerns about elements of this legislation, including \nForeign Relations, Judiciary, Armed Services and the Select Committee \non Intelligence on which I serve as an ex officio member. Their \nconcerns should be addressed as we move through the legislative \nprocess.\n  I also have a number of concerns that I hope are addressed as the \ncommittees consider this legislation. I am concerned about allowing \njudicial review of executive branch classification decisions. I do not \nthink it is wise or necessary to allow judges to second-guess\n\n[[Page S1250]]\n\nclassification decisions. I am concerned about cost--the cost of \nclassification and the cost of declassification. I hope we can arrive \nat a legislative outcome that reduces the cost of both. I am concerned \nabout creating a new layer of bureaucracy in an already overly \nbureaucratic process. It is the agencies themselves that should retain \nthe authority to declassify documents. I am most concerned that we give \npriority to protecting intelligence sources and methods rather than to \na vague and subjective ``public interest'' test. We need to ensure that \noriginating agencies are expressly involved in any declassification \nprocess to avoid the mistakes that have recently been made. I also hope \nthere is adequate authority for agencies to meet their legitimate \nbudgetary and source-protection concerns.\n  I am confident that the deliberative process of committee \nconsideration will address my concerns and the legitimate concerns \nexpressed by the Defense Department, the intelligence community, and \nothers. I know that the Director of Central Intelligence testified last \nmonth that he wants to sit down with Senator Moynihan and address those \nconcerns in such a way that we protect sources and methods while \nopening more old intelligence files to the serious researcher and the \ngeneral public. I hope that this process of committee consideration can \nbe completed this spring and that we can expeditiously schedule floor \ntime for legislation addressing this important issue.\n  I want to close with a special tribute to Senator Moynihan's \ndiligence in this effort. He is not just motivated by the fact that too \nmuch information is classified and is kept secret too long. He is also \nmotivated by a scholar's desire to know the truth, and by the \nhistorian's desire to fully explain past events. I salute his efforts \nand share his concerns. Openness is important in our democracy. In the \nwords of the Secrecy Commission, chaired by Senator Moynihan, ``Secrecy \nis a form of government regulation . . . some secrecy is vital to save \nlives, bring miscreants to justice, protect national security, and \nengage in effective diplomacy . . . National Security will continue to \nbe the first of our national concerns, but we also need to develop \nmethods for the treatment of government information that better serve, \nnot undermine, this objective.'' In the words of Chairman Moynihan \nhimself: ``It is time also to assert certain American fundamentals, \nforemost of which is the right to know what government is doing, and \nthe corresponding ability to judge its performance.'' I could not agree \nmore.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Moynihan and others \nin enacting legislation on government secrecy this year.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Majority Leader for raising this important \nissue and am pleased to join him as a co-sponsor of the Government \nSecrecy Act. I look forward to working with him, the other co-sponsors \nof the bill, and the relevant committees to move this legislation early \nin this session. Although some modifications to this legislation may be \nnecessary, I think we can all agree that a democratic government \ndepends on an informed public. This legislation will greatly improve \naccess to government information. By reducing the number of secrets, \nthis legislation will enhance the public's access while at the same \ntime enabling the government to better protect information which is \ntruly sensitive.\n  As the Majority Leader mentioned, for the past five decades, the \nsecrecy system has been governed by a series of six Executive Orders, \nnone of which has created a stable system that protects only that \ninformation deemed vital to the national security of the United States.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the two leaders for their support and welcome \nthem to an effort that began in the 103rd Congress with the adoption of \nP.L. 103-236, establishing the Commission on Protecting and Reducing \nGovernment Secrecy. This bi-partisan commission, which I had the \nprivilege of chairing, and on which Senator Helms played an important \nrole, issued its unanimous report last March. The Commission found that \nthe current system neither protects nor releases national security \ninformation particularly well.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished leaders, but I am \nalso deeply grateful to the able senior Senator from New York. For too \nlong the government has classified information which has no business \nbeing classified. When I came to the Senate, I was a member of the \nArmed Services Committee and I remember that I went to many classified \nbriefings, only to be informed, in great detail, of everything that was \nin the New York Times and Washington Post that morning. The most \nfrustrating thing was that we could not talk about the information from \nthose meetings because it was classified.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The central fact is that we live today in an \ninformation age. Open sources give us the vast majority of what we need \nto know in order to make intelligent decisions. Analysis, far more than \nsecrecy, is the key to security. Decisions made by people at ease with \ndisagreement and ambiguity and tentativeness. Decisions made by those \nwho understand how to exploit the wealth and diversity of publicly \navailable information, who no longer simply assume that clandestine \ncollection, i.e. ``stealing secrets'', equates with greater \nintelligence.\n  We are not going to put an end to secrecy. It is at times legitimate \nand necessary. But a culture of secrecy need not remain the norm in \nAmerican government as regards national security. It is possible to \nconceive that a competing culture of openness might develop which could \nassert and demonstrate greater efficiency.\n  Mr. HELMS. The Commission by law had two goals: to study how to \nprotect the important government secrets while simultaneously reducing \nthe enormous amount of classified documents and materials. We began our \ndeliberations with the premise that government secrecy is a form of \nregulation, and like all regulations, should be used sparingly. But I \nfeel obliged to reiterate and emphasize the obvious. The protection of \ntrue national security information remains vital to the well-being and \nsecurity of the United States.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I agree with the Senator. One of the important \nrecommendations of the Commission was a proposal for a statute \nestablishing a general classification regime and creating a national \ndeclassification center. The four Congressional members of the \nCommission, Representatives Combest and Hamilton, Senator Helms, and I, \nproposed just such a statute last May, the Government Secrecy Act, \nS.712.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. In deciding that we needed to design a better, more \nrational classification system, I was moved by the fact that under the \ncurrent system we are classifying an enormous amount of information \neach and every year. For example, in 1996 alone, the Federal Government \ncreated 386,562 Top Secret, 3,467,856 Secret, and 1,830,044 \nConfidential items: a total of 5,789,625 classification actions.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Last year the number of officials with the authority to \nclassify documents originally decreased by 959 to 4,420. Presumably, \nthis should reduce the number of classifications, but the number of \nclassifications increased by nearly two-thirds, over 5.7 million. There \ncannot be 5.7 million secrets a year which, if revealed, would cause \n``damage'' to the national security. To paraphrase Justice Potter \nStewart's decision regarding the Pentagon Papers, when everything is \nsecret, nothing is secret.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. In addition to costing the taxpayer billions annually, \nthis excessive government secrecy leads to a host of other problems. \nSecrecy hampers the exchange of information within the government, \nleads to public mistrust, and makes leaking classified information the \nnorm.\n  I think it would be useful at this point to note that this \nlegislation will not require the disclosure of a single document or \nfact deemed vital to our national security. Instead, this legislation \nwill prevent the government from stamping ``Classified'' on information \nthat is not sensitive.\n  The Clinton administration has made significant reforms to open \ngovernment information. For example, last month, Secretary of Energy \nFederico Pena announced that he would seek to end the practice that \nconsidered all atomic weapons information as ``born\n\n[[Page S1251]]\n\nclassified'' and instead would only classify ``where there is a \ncompelling national security interest''. The Department of Energy is to \nbe commended for its efforts in recent years to make available \ninformation concerning nuclear tests conducted in this country and \ntheir effects on human health and the environment. This is a useful \nstep. However, as the statistics I cited above for 1996 make clear, \nthere is still much more to be done.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Such efforts are welcome and should be encouraged. \nHowever, to ensure that they are carried out across the government and \nin a sustained manner, our Commission proposed that legislation be \nadopted.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Greater Congressional oversight of classification policy \nis long overdue. For too long, classification and declassification \npolicy have been both developed and implemented by bureaucrats, often \nanonymously. Consideration of the Government Secrecy Act, S.712, will \npromote an open discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of \nsecrecy, a discussion which is not limited to the views of those who \nare charged with implementing classification policy.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. If the Report of the Commission on Protecting and \nReducing Government Secrecy is to serve any large purpose, it is to \nintroduce the public to the thought that secrecy is a mode of \nregulation. In truth, it is the ultimate mode, for the citizen does not \neven know that he or she is being regulated. Normal regulation concerns \nhow citizens must behave, and so regulations are widely promulgated. \nSecrecy, by contrast, concerns what citizens may know. The citizen is \nnot told what may not be known.\n  With the arrival of the New Deal agencies in the 1930s, it became \nclear that public regulation needed to be made more accessible to the \npublic. In 1935, for example, the Federal Register began publication. \nThereafter all public regulations were published and accessible. In \n1946, the Administrative Procedure Act established procedures by which \nthe citizen can question and even litigate regulation. In 1966, the \nFreedom of Information Act, technically an amendment to the original \n1946 Act, provided citizens yet more access to government files.\n  The Administrative Procedure Act brought some order and \naccountability to the flood of government regulations that at time bids \nfare to overwhelm us. Even so, ``over-regulation'' is a continuing \ntheme in American life, as in most modern administrative states. \nSecrecy would be such an issue, save that secrecy is secret. Make no \nmistake, however. It is a parallel regulatory regime with a far greater \npotential for damage if it malfunctions.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. One of the most striking aspects of the Commission \nreport is the lack of Congressional involvement in the secrecy system. \nApart from the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Atomic Energy Act, which \nonly applies to atomic secrets, there are few statutes dealing with \nthese issues. If secrecy is a form of regulation, then this legislation \nwill serve a similar purpose to the Administrative Procedure Act for \nthe secrecy system.\n  And there has been little Congressional oversight. I believe the \nCommission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy, which Senator \nMoynihan chaired, is only the second statutory examination of the \nsecrecy system.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. That is correct--there has been only one other \nstatutory inquiry into this subject. This was the Commission on \nGovernment Security, established in 1955 by the 84th Congress, known as \nthe Wright Commission for its Chairman, Lloyd Wright, past President of \nthe American Bar Association. This was a distinguished bipartisan body, \nwhich included in its membership Senators John C. Stennis of \nMississippi and Norris Cotton of New Hampshire, along with \nRepresentatives William M. McCulloch of Ohio and Francis E. Walter of \nPennsylvania.\n  The Commission report, issued 40 years ago, is a document of careful \nbalance and great detail. The Commission was concerned with \nclassification as a cost. Free inquiry, like free markets, is the most \nefficient way to get good results. The Commission set forth a great \nmany proposals ranging from Atomic Energy to Passport Security, but its \nlegislative proposals were concise: the proposal to outlaw by statute \n``disclosures of classified information. . . by persons outside as well \nas within the Government'' was quickly perceived as prior restraint: \npress censorship. The response was swift and predictable. The \nrecommendation was criticized strongly in articles and editorials in a \nvariety of newspapers, notably by James Reston. And the Commission's \nrecommendations were dropped.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Government Secrecy Commission has learned from \nhistory and issued much more prudent proposals. Some individuals have \nraised constitutional concerns regarding this legislation, but the \nGovernment Secrecy Act (S. 712) respects the President's constitutional \nprerogatives by maintaining the authority of the President to establish \ncategories of classified information and procedures for classifying \ninformation. The precedent for Congressional action has already been \nestablished by the Atomic Energy Act, the Espionage Act, and the \nNational Security Act.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The Government Secrecy Act will provide a framework for \nour secrecy system which can limit the number of documents initially \nclassified and significantly reduce the backlog of already classified \ndocuments. It sets standards for declassification whereby information \nmay not remain classified for longer than 10 years unless the head of \nthe agency which created the information certifies to the President \nthat the information requires continued protection. Information not \ndeclassified within 10 years may not remain classified for more than 30 \nyears without another certification. It requires that a balancing test \nbe established in making classification and declassification decisions \nso that officials must weigh the benefit from public disclosure of \ninformation against the need for initial or continued protection of the \ninformation under the classification system.\n  The bill also establishes a national declassification center to \ncoordinate and oversee the declassification policies and practices of \nthe Federal Government to ensure that declassification is efficient, \ncost-effective, and consistent.\n  I thank the Majority Leader for raising his concerns. It is my \nsincere intention to work with the Majority Leader and other interested \nSenators to perfect this legislation, so that we might pass it in the \ncoming months.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise because I have some grave concerns \nwith the current form of the Government Secrecy Act of 1997 (S. 712) \nand I am pleased that the distinguished Majority Leader and my \ndistinguished colleagues are open to a discussion of this legislation \nwith the goal of establishing the basic principles on which Federal \nclassification and declassification programs are to be based. More \nstability, reliability, and consistency are needed in the government's \napproach to both the protection--and I emphasize protection--as well as \nthe release of classified information to the public. The recent \ncompromise of sensitive information through rushed declassification \nhighlights the need for more oversight and accountability of the \ndeclassification process. I have serious concerns that S. 712 does not \nadequately protect sensitive intelligence sources and methods and will \nunnecessarily cost the taxpayers many hundreds of millions of dollars.\n  I support the Commission on Government Secrecy's finding that the \npublic has a right of access to the large majority of government-held \ninformation and that, in general, too much information is classified \nand kept secret too long. However, secrecy is essential to \nintelligence, and U.S. security has depended and still depends on \nsecrecy to succeed. We must proceed with caution in our commitment to \nmake more classified information available to the public. In this \nregard, I am concerned that some provisions of S. 712 erode the \nDirector of Central Intelligence's statutory authority and ability to \nprotect intelligence sources and methods.\n  Further, the bill will cost untold millions to declassify and release \nthe tremendous amount of currently classified material in a way that \nstill protects the most sensitive sources and methods. For example, DOD \nreports to have over 1.2 billion pages of 25 year and older material of \nhistorical value that requires review for declassification. The current \nestimated average cost of\n\n[[Page S1252]]\n\nreview is $1 a page. This means that the cost of declassification of \nthis group of documents alone will be over $1.2 billion--that's billion \nwith a ``B'', Mr. President.\n  I am also concerned that the so-called Declassification Center \ncreated in S. 712 will not correct the problems facing the current \ndeclassification system. It will end up being another costly and \nunnecessary government bureaucracy. Instead, to promote greater \naccountability, I propose that we create a more effective and enhanced \nExecutive branch oversight function for classification and \ndeclassification programs. In addition, I believe sanctions for \nunauthorized disclosures should be added to the bill. We need to \nconsider new and unique categories of secrecy for our most sensitive \nintelligence operations--perhaps to include very serious penalties for \npublic discussion of these activities.\n  Finally, I am troubled that the bill leaves open the possibility of \njudicial review of Executive branch classification decisions. This will \nundoubtedly lead to costly legal challenges that could result in \njudicial second-guessing of the Commander-in-Chief on national security \nmatters.\n  I look forward to addressing these and other concerns in our \nCommittee. Our collective goal should be to craft legislation that \nestablishes a sensible framework for a classification and \ndeclassification system that continues to protect sources and methods \nwhile improving oversight and accountability at an affordable cost.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, for Americans government secrecy is a \nparadox. In a democracy, it's an unusual action for us to decide to \nkeep something secret from the public, because it's their government. \nWhat we do is for the people. It's carried out in their name. So it's \nunusual to do the public's business in secret.\n  There is only one legitimate reason for our government to keep \nsomething secret from its citizens: To keep America safe. As Vice \nChairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I have been \nexposed to many things that, if made public, would threaten the \nsecurity of our citizens and our nation. But I have also seen valuable \ninformation unnecessarily kept from the public view. Which is why I \nsupport this effort to change the way our government classifies and \ndeclassifies its information.\n  Secrecy is the exception, not the rule, in these matters for a number \nof reasons. The first and foremost is that this is government of, by \nand for the people. The second stems from that old adage ``sunshine is \nthe best disinfectant''. We do a better job in the open, where our \nideas and actions are subject to the test of scrutiny, criticism and \nfeedback, than we do in secret. And third, because information we \ngather belongs to the people, we should make sure information they can \nuse--in their own lives, in their own businesses, and, most important, \nin making decisions as citizens in a democracy--is provided to them \nwhen we can make it available without compromising our safety.\n  We make the unusual decision to keep things secret for a reason: \nBecause those secrets help to keep Americans safe. Our government \nclassifies information to help protect our citizens and preserve the \nsecurity of our nation. When the Director of Central Intelligence goes \nto the President or to Congress to tell us of the threats our nation \nfaces, he can do so because there are men and women around the globe \nrisking their lives to provide our nation's leaders with the \ninformation they need to protect our country. Whether the intelligence \ndeals with foreign leaders, terrorists, narcotics traffickers, or \nmilitary troop movements, our government needs to keep certain \ninformation secret or our nation's security will suffer.\n  Yet much of the information on foreign countries collected by our \nIntelligence Community can and should be shared with the American \npeople. With the growth of open source information and widespread \navailability of information technology, the American public is also \nincreasingly a consumer of intelligence. We live in a very complex \nworld, with intertwining relationships between nations shaped by \nhistory and culture. It is difficult for policymakers--those of us who \nstudy foreign policy, who have access to classified information and \nanalysis, and who receive detailed government briefings--to get the \ninformation we need for an informed view on foreign policy issues. Our \ncitizens have an even more limited amount of information available to \nhelp them understand what occurs outside our nation's border. Which is \nwhy I believe the more information the American public has with which \nto understand foreign policy the better.\n  Mr. President, we need to continue to protect ``sources and \nmethods'', a term of art which refers to the people working to collect \nintelligence and the means by which they do so. Yet, when we acquire \ninformation whose release will not threaten sources and methods, or \nhave information so dated that the people and means used to collect it \nare no longer in jeopardy, the government should release this \ninformation to the public.\n  We must act this year to reverse a fifty year trend and reduce \ngovernment secrecy, including intelligence secrecy. The classification \nsystem has been regulated by executive order for five decades, with new \nexecutive orders contradicting previous ones and producing new costs \nfor all agencies involved. What is or is not a secret should not be \nsubject to a change in political leadership. Congress should place in \nstatute the concept of what is or is not classified information, and \nprovide general standards for classifying and declassifying \ninformation.\n  Mr. President, Congress bears some of the responsibility for the \nstatus of our nation's classification policy. The Commission on \nProtecting and Reducing Government Secrecy was not able to find a \nsingle example of a congressional hearing on the issue of executive \nbranch secrecy policy. At the very least, Congress needs to improve its \noversight of this issue. As part of this effort, the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence is scheduled to hold a hearing on this issue \nlater this year.\n  Senators Moynihan and Helms have shown great leadership in addressing \nthe issue of governmental secrecy. Their work on the Secrecy Commission \nhas helped provide the Senate with the necessary context and analysis \nof government secrecy we need to address this issue. Their legislation \nS. 712, the Government Secrecy Act of 1997, goes a long way towards \noutlining a balanced government policy which protects the most \nsensitive information while allowing the public access to as much \ninformation as possible.\n  In my discussions with Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet, \nI have learned that the Intelligence Community does have concerns with \nthe current version of S. 712. The CIA's concerns include their desire \nthat the originator of classified information be in charge of its \ndeclassification, and that the classification and declassification \nprocess not be subject to judicial review. I look forward to working \nwith Senators Helms and Moynihan, with Director Tenet, and the \nAdministration to develop legislative language which meets the twin \ngoals of keeping America safe and ensuring our government responds to \nthe needs of its citizens for information.\n\n  Because the Department of Defense and the Central Intelligence Agency \nare responsible for the vast majority of information that requires \nclassification, I believe the committees responsible for oversight of \nthese entities--the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence--should have the opportunity to review \nS. 712. I hope that such a sequential referral can be arranged.\n  Mr. President, we seek legislation that is in balance. We seek \nsecrecy legislation which protects the safety of our citizens and the \nsecurity of our nation, but also ensures that our government's \npolicies, actions, and information will be as open as possible to its \ncitizens. We must help keep America safe, while also assuring that our \nactions truly reflect those of a government of, by and for the people. \nI look forward to the challenge. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I appreciate the attention being given \nto the Government Secrecy Act, S. 712, by Senator Lott and Senator \nDaschle. I also wish to commend Senators Moynihan and Helms for the \nhard work they have put into this issue as Senate members of the \nCommission on Protection and Reducing Government Secrecy.\n\n[[Page S1253]]\n\n  To review the entire secrecy system, Congress established the Secrecy \nCommission in 1994. Last year, the Commission issued its final report. \nThe Governmental Affairs Committee held a hearing on the Commission's \nrecommendations when they were first issued. Among the recommendations \nof the Commission was establishing a statutory basis for our secrecy \nsystem. Apart from nuclear secrets, there has never been a coordinated \nstatutory basis for establishing and maintaining government secrets. \nConsequently, there is little coordination among agencies on how \ninformation is determined to be secret, little accountability among \nclassifying officials, and little Congressional oversight of the \ngovernment's secrecy activities.\n  The Commission also described how the secrecy system functions as a \nform of government regulation, imposing significant costs on the \ngovernment and the private sector. It is time to begin reviewing these \ncosts and identify which secrets really need to be kept and which do \nnot. Like other areas of government regulation, we need to inject a \ncost/benefit analysis into the process to be sure that those secrets we \ndo keep are worth the cost.\n  The Government Secrecy Act is an issue of good government reform that \nneeds consideration by Congress. I intend to work with Senator Glenn, \nthe Ranking Member of the Governmental Affairs Committee, to report an \namended S. 712 very soon. The United States needs a secrecy system that \ndoes a better job of identifying those secrets which truly must be \nkept, and which then can truly keep them secret.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I concur that this is an important issue \nthat our Committee takes very seriously. We held a hearing on the \nCommission's report last year, and I know that the Chairman has wanted \nto return to this matter this year.\n  The question of establishing a statutory framework for classification \nand declassification has long been a matter of debate. Our own \ncommittee held extensive hearings on this subject in 1973 and 1974.\n  The current system is governed by Presidential executive order, and, \nas the Majority Leader noted, this has led over time to inconsistencies \nin policies and procedures. Some have questioned, however, whether \nlegislation is needed. I believe that it is proper for Congress to \nlegislate on this subject, while of course still respecting the \nauthority of the President in this area. This principle of shared \nauthority was recognized in the passage of the Atomic Energy Act, the \nEspionage Act, and the National Security Act. If Congress acts now to \nestablish a statutory classification and declassification system, we \nshould take a similarly balanced approach.\n  Balance is also needed in our approach to considering the legislation \nin the Senate. While S. 712 has been properly referred to our \ncommittee, the Committee on Governmental Affairs, the bill raises \nimportant issues of interest to the Select Committee on Intelligence, \nthe Armed Services Committee, and the Committee on Foreign Relations. I \nam fully committed to working with each of these committees as the bill \nmoves forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/03/senate-section/article/S1249-2", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              SUPPLEMENTARY NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING\n\n  Mr. THURMOND.

KAMIL IDRIS, DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE WORLD INTELLECTUAL \n                         PROPERTY ORGANIZATION\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to welcome to the United \nStates Dr. Kamil Idris, the Director General of the World Intellectual \nProperty Organization (WIPO). As many of my colleagues know, Dr. Idris \nwas elected Director General in November 1997, succeeding Dr. Arpad \nBogsch, who served in that capacity for 25 years. As Director General, \nDr. Idris is responsible for overseeing WIPO's strong efforts in \npromoting intellectual property protection across the globe.\n  Dr. Idris has had a long and distinguished diplomatic career on \nbehalf of his native Sudan. He is particularly well-known in \ninternational intellectual property circles through his 16 years of \neffective service to WIPO, most recently as Deputy Director General. I \nwas pleased to visit with Dr. Idris informally shortly after his \nelection as Director General and once again wish him success in his new \nposition.\n  I would note that Dr. Idris is taking the helm of WIPO at a critical \njuncture in the evolution of international intellectual property \nprotection. Nations throughout the world will look to his leadership in \npromoting a global fabric of intellectual property protection in the \never-explosive digital age. The WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO \nPerformances and Phonograms Treaty, both signed in Geneva in December \n1996, are important components of that fabric. The United States has an \nopportunity to set standards for the world to follow by ratifying and \nimplementing these treaties in a timely fashion. I have joined with my \ncolleagues Senator Leahy, Senator Thompson, and Senator Kohl to \nintroduce legislation to do just that. I look forward to Dr. Idris' \nsupport of similar efforts to implement these treaties in an effective \nmanner in the remainder of the WIPO member countries.\n  Dr. Idris' visit today marks his first official visit to the United \nStates. He will be accompanied by the Commissioner of Patents and \nTrademarks, Bruce Lehman, who will join Dr. Idris in meetings with the \nSecretary of Commerce and other agency officials who play important \nroles in safeguarding and promoting American ingenuity. Dr. Idris will \nalso have the opportunity to meet with many of the leaders of our \ncreative sectors, among them the pharmaceutical, motion picture, \nsoftware, information technology, broadcasting, publishing, and \nrecording industries. Each of these industries depend on the work of \nWIPO to assist them in securing effective protection for their \nintellectual property in the international marketplace.\n  I am pleased that Dr. Idris has made this important visit. I am sure \nI am joined by my colleagues in welcoming him today and in wishing him \nthe best in his activities here. I look forward to\n\n[[Page S1254]]\n\ncontinuing to work with him in a close and cooperative relationship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/03/senate-section/article/S1253-2", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  MR.

The 1998 Strategy \nreaffirms our bipartisan, enduring commitment to reduce drug use and \nits destructive consequences.\n  This year's Strategy builds upon the 1997 Strategy and is designed to \nreduce drug use and availability in America in half over the next 10 \nyears--a historic new low. This plan has been developed under the \nleadership of General Barry McCaffrey, Director of National Drug \nControl Policy, in close consultation with the Congress, the more than \n50 Federal agencies and departments involved in the fight against \ndrugs, the dedicated men and women of law enforcement, and with \nstakeholders--mayors, doctors, clergy, civic leaders, parents, and \nyoung people--drawn from all segments of our society.\n  I am also proud to report that we have made real and substantial \nprogress in carrying out the goals of the 1997 Strategy. Working with \nthe Congress, we have begun the National Anti-Drug Youth Media \nCampaign. Now when our children turn on the television, surf the \n``net,'' or listen to the radio, they can learn the plain truth about \ndrugs: they are wrong, they put your future at risk, and they can kill \nyou. I thank you for your vital support in bringing this important \nmessage to America's young people.\n  Together, we enacted into law the Drug-Free Communities Act of 1997, \nwhich will help build and strengthen 14,000 community anti-drug \ncoalitions and brought together civic groups--ranging from the Elks to \nthe Girl Scouts and representing over 55 million Americans--to form a \nCivic Alliance, targeting youth drug use. By mobilizing people and \nempowering communities, we are defeating drugs through a child-by-\nchild, street-by-street, and neighborhood-by-neighborhood approach.\n  We have also helped make our streets and communities safer by \nstrengthening law enforcement. Through my Administration's Community \nOriented Police (COPs) program, we are helping put 100,000 more police \nofficers in towns and cities across the Nation. We are taking deadly \nassault weapons out of the hands of drug dealers and gangs, making our \nstreets safer for our families. We have taken steps to rid our prisons \nof drugs, as well as to break the vicious cycle of drugs and crime. \nThese efforts are making a difference: violent crime in America has \ndropped dramatically for 5 years in a row.\n  Over the last year, the United States and Mexico reached agreement on \na mutual Threat Assessment that defines the scope of the common threat \nwe face; and, an Alliance that commits our great nations to defeating \nthat threat. Soon, we will sign a bilateral Strategy that commits both \nnations to specific actions and performance benchmarks. Our work to \nenhance cooperation within the hemisphere and worldwide is already \nshowing results. For example, Peruvian coca production has declined by \nroughly 40 percent over the last 2 years. In 1997, Mexican drug \neradication rates reached record levels, and seizures increased nearly \n50 percent over 1996.\n  We are making a difference. Drug use in America has declined by 50 \npercent over the last decade. For the first time in 6 years, studies \nshow that youth drug use is beginning to stabilize, and in some \nrespects is even declining. And indications are that the \nmethamphetamine and crack cocaine epidemics, which in recent years were \nsweeping the Nation, have begun to recede.\n  However, we must not confuse progress with ultimate success. Although \nyouth drug use has started to decline, it remains unacceptably high.\n  More than ever, we must recommit ourselves to give parents the tools \nand support they need to teach children that drugs are dangerous and \nwrong. That is why we must improve the Safe and Drug-Free Schools \nprogram, and other after school initiatives that help keep our kids in \nschool, off drugs, and out of trouble. We must hire 1,000 new border \npatrol agents and close the door on drugs at our borders. We must \nredouble our efforts with other nations to take the profits out of drug \ndealing and trafficking and break the sources of supply. And we must \nenact comprehensive bipartisan tobacco legislation that reduces youth \nsmoking. These and other efforts are central elements of the 1998 \nNational Drug Control Strategy.\n  With the help of the American public, and the ongoing support of the \nCongress, we can achieve these goals. In\n\n[[Page S1255]]\n\nsubmitting this plan to you, I ask for your continued partnership in \ndefeating drugs in America.

A bill to designate the headquarters building of the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development in Washington, District of \nColumbia, as the ``Rovert C. Weaver Federal Building''; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n     the robert c. weaver federal building designation act of 1997\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to name \nthe Housing and Urban Development (HUD) headquarters here in Washington \nafter Dr. Robert C. Weaver, adviser to three Presidents, director of \nthe NAACP, and the first African-American Cabinet Secretary. I am \npleased that Senators Kerry and Moseley-Braun are co-sponsors of my \nbill. I would point out that Senator Kerry was poised to introduce \nsimilar legislation; in fact, he sent out a Dear Colleague on the \nsubject last November. But he graciously deferred to me, and I am most \nappreciative. Bob Weaver was my friend, dating back more than 40 years \nto our service together in the Harriman administration. He passed away \nlast July at his home in New York City after spending his entire life \nbroadening opportunities for minorities in America. I think it is a \nfitting tribute to name the HUD building after this great man.\n  Dr. Weaver began his career in government service as part of \nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt's ``Black Cabinet,'' an informal \nadvisory group promoting educational and job opportunities for blacks. \nThe Washington Post\n\n[[Page S1256]]\n\ncalled this work his greatest legacy, the dismantling of a deeply \nentrenched system of racial segregation in America. Indeed it was.\n  Dr. Weaver was appointed Deputy Commissioner of Housing for New York \nState in 1955, and later became State Rent Administrator with Cabinet \nrank. It was during these years working for New York Governor Averell \nHarriman that I first met Bob; I was Assistant to the Secretary to the \nGovernor and later, Acting Secretary.\n  Our friendship and collaboration continued under the Kennedy and \nJohnson administrations. In 1960, he became the president of the NAACP, \nand shortly thereafter would become a key adviser to President Kennedy \non civil rights. In 1961, Kennedy appointed Dr. Weaver to head the \nHousing and Home Finance Agency, an entity that later became the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development. In 1966, when President \nJohnson elevated the agency to Cabinet rank, Dr. Weaver was, in \nJohnson's phrase, ``the man for the job.'' He thus became its first \nSecretary, and the first African-American to head a Cabinet agency. \nLater, he and I served together on the Pennsylvania Avenue Commission.\n  Following his government service, Dr. Weaver was, among various other \nacademic pursuits, a professor at Hunter College, a member of the \nSchool of Urban and Public Affairs at Carnegie-Mellon, a visiting \nprofessor at Columbia Teacher's College and New York University's \nSchool of Education, and the president of Baruch College in Manhattan. \nWhen I became director of the Joint Center for Urban Studies at MIT and \nHarvard, he generously agreed to be a member of the Board of Directors.\n  Dr. Weaver had earned his undergraduate, master's, and doctoral \ndegrees in economics from Harvard; he wrote four books on urban \naffairs; and he was one of the original directors of the Municipal \nAssistance Corporation, which designed the plan to rescue New York City \nduring its tumultuous financial crisis in the 1970s.\n  Last July, America--and Washington in particular (for he was a native \nWashingtonian)--lost one of its innovators, one of its creators, one of \nits true leaders. For Dr. Robert Weaver led not only with his words but \nwith his deeds. I was privileged to know him as a friend. He will be \nmissed but properly memorialized, I think, if we can pass this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my bill, and a July 21, \n1997 editorial in the Washington Post, and a July 19, 1997 obituary \nfrom the New York Times be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1700\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF ROBERT C. WEAVER FEDERAL BUILDING.\n\n       In honor of the first Secretary of Housing and Urban \n     Development, the headquarters building of the Department of \n     Housing and Urban Development located at 451 Seventh Street, \n     SW., in Washington, District of Columbia, shall be known and \n     designated as the ``Robert C. Weaver Federal Building''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REFERENCES.\n\n       Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, \n     or other record of the United States to the building referred \n     to in section 1 shall be deemed to be a reference to the \n     ``Robert C. Weaver Federal Building''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 21, 1997]\n\n                            Robert C. Weaver\n\n       Native Washingtonian Robert C. Weaver, who died on Thursday \n     in New York City at age 89, had a life of many firsts. Dr. \n     Weaver served as a college president, Cabinet secretary, \n     presidential adviser, chairman of the National Association \n     for the Advancement of Colored People and as a director of \n     the Municipal Assistance Corp., which helped save New York \n     City from financial catastrophe. But his greatest legacy may \n     be the work he did, largely out of public view, to dismantle \n     a deeply entrenched system of racial segregation in America.\n       Before the landmark decade of civil rights advances in the \n     1960s, Dr. Weaver was one of a small group of African \n     American officials in the New Deal era who, as part of the \n     ``Black Cabinet'' pressured President Franklin D. Roosevelt \n     to strike down racial barriers in government employment, \n     housing and education. It was a long way to come for the \n     Dunbar High School graduate who ran into racial \n     discrimination in the 1920s when he tried to join a union \n     fresh out of high school. Embittered by that experience, Bob \n     Weaver went on to Harvard (in the footsteps of his \n     grandfather, the first African American Harvard graduate in \n     dentistry) to earn his bachelor's, master's and doctorate in \n     economics. At another time in America, his university degrees \n     might have led to another career path. For Bob Weaver in \n     1932, however, those credentials--and his earlier job as a \n     college professor--made him an ``associate advisor on Negro \n     affairs'' in the U.S. Department of the Interior.\n       Subsequent work as an educator, economist and national \n     housing expert--and behind-the-scenes recruitment of scores \n     of African Americans for public service--led to his \n     appointment as New York State rent administrator, making him \n     the first African American with state cabinet rank. President \n     John F. Kennedy appointed him to the highest federal post \n     ever occupied by an African American--the Housing and Home \n     Finance Agency. Despite the president's support, however, the \n     HHFA never made it to Cabinet status, because Dr. Weaver was \n     its administrator and southern legislators rebelled at the \n     thought of a black secretary. Years later President Lyndon \n     Johnson pushed through the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development and named Robert Weaver to the presidential \n     Cabinet.\n       For the nation, and Robert Weaver, the appointment was \n     another important first. For many other African Americans who \n     found lower barriers and increased opportunity in the last \n     third of the 20th century, Robert Weaver's legacy is lasting.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 19, 1997]\n\n         Robert C. Weaver, 89, First Black Cabinet Member, Dies\n\n                           (By James Barron)\n\n       Dr. Robert C. Weaver, the first Secretary of Housing and \n     Urban Development and the first black person appointed to the \n     Cabinet, died on Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was \n     89.\n       Dr. Weaver was also one of the original directors of the \n     Municipal Assistance Corporation, which was formed to rescue \n     New York City from financial crisis in the 1970's.\n       ``He was a catalyst with the Kennedys and then with \n     Johnson, forging new initiatives in housing and education,'' \n     said Walter E. Washington, the first elected Mayor of the \n     nation's capital.\n       A portly, pedagogical man who wrote four books on urban \n     affairs, Dr. Weaver had made a name for himself in the 1930's \n     and 1940's as an expert behind-the-scenes strategist in the \n     civil rights movement. ``Fight hard and legally,'' he said, \n     ``and don't blow your top.''\n       As a part of the ``Black Cabinet'' in the administration of \n     President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dr. Weaver was one of a \n     group of blacks who specialized in housing, education and \n     employment. After being hired as race relations advisers in \n     various Federal agencies, they pressured and persuaded the \n     White House to provide more jobs, better educational \n     opportunities and equal rights.\n       Dr. Weaver began in 1933 as an aide to Interior Secretary \n     Harold L. Ickes. He later served as a special assistant in \n     the housing division of the Works Progress Administration, \n     the National Defense Advisory Commission, the War Production \n     Board and the War Manpower Commission.\n       Shortly before the 1940 election, he devised a strategy \n     that defused anger among blacks about Stephen T. Early, \n     President Roosevelt's press secretary. Arriving at \n     Pennsylvania Station in New York, Early lost his temper when \n     a line of police officers blocked his way. Early knocked one \n     of the officers, who happened to be black, to the ground. As \n     word of the incident spread, a White House adviser put \n     through a telephone call to Dr. Weaver in Washington.\n       The aide, worried that the incident would cost Roosevelt \n     the black vote, told Dr. Weaver to find the other black \n     advisers and prepare a speech that would appeal to blacks for \n     the President to deliver the following week.\n       Dr. Weaver said he doubted that he could find anyone in the \n     middle of the night, even though most of the others in the \n     ``Black Cabinet'' had been playing poker in his basement when \n     the phone rang. ``And anyway,'' he said, ``I don't think a \n     mere speech will do it. What we need right now is something \n     so dramatic that it will make the Negro voters forget all \n     about Steve Early and the Negro cop too.''\n       Within 48 hours, Benjamin O. Davis Sr. was the first black \n     general in the Army; William H. Hastie was the first black \n     civilian aide to the Secretary of War, and Campbell C. \n     Johnson was the first high-ranking black aide to the head of \n     the Selective Service.\n       Robert Clifton Weaver was born on Dec. 29, 1907, in \n     Washington. His father was a postal worker and his mother--\n     who he said influenced his intellectual development--was the \n     daughter of the first black person to graduate from Harvard \n     with a degree in dentistry. When Dr. Weaver joined the \n     Kennedy Administration, whose Harvard connections extended to \n     the occupant of the Oval Office, he held more Harvard \n     degrees--three, including a doctorate in economics--than \n     anyone else in the administration's upper ranks.\n       In 1960, after serving as the New York State Rent \n     Commissioner, Dr. Weaver became the national chairman of the \n     National\n\n[[Page S1257]]\n\n     Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and \n     President Kennedy sought Dr. Weaver's advice on civil rights. \n     The following year, the President appointed him administrator \n     of the Housing and Home Finance Agency, a loose combination \n     of agencies that included the bureaucratic components of what \n     would eventually become H.U.D., including the Federal Housing \n     Administration to spur construction, the Urban Renewal \n     Administration to oversee slum clearance and the Federal \n     National Mortgage Association to line up money for new \n     housing.\n       President Kennedy tried to have the agency raised to \n     Cabinet rank, but Congress balked. Southerners led an attack \n     against the appointment of a black to the Cabinet, and there \n     were charges that Dr. Weaver was an extremist. Kennedy \n     abandoned the idea of creating an urban affairs department.\n       Five years later, when President Johnson revived the idea \n     and pushed it through Congress, Senators who had voted \n     against Dr. Weaver the first time around voted for him.\n       Past Federal housing programs had largely dealt with \n     bricks-and-mortar policies. Dr. Weaver said Washington needed \n     to take a more philosophical approach. ``Creative federalism \n     stresses local initiative, local solutions to local \n     problems,'' he said.\n       But, he added, ``where the obvious needs for action to meet \n     an urban problem are not being fulfilled, the Federal \n     Government has a responsibility at least to generate a \n     thorough awareness of the problem.''\n       Dr. Weaver, who said that ``you cannot have physical \n     renewal without human renewal,'' pushed for better-looking \n     public housing by offering awards for design. He also \n     increased the amount of money for small businesses displaced \n     by urban renewal and revived the long-dormant idea of Federal \n     rent subsidies for the elderly.\n       Later in his life, he was a professor of urban affairs at \n     Hunter College, was a member of the Visiting Committee at the \n     School of Urban and Public Affairs at Carnegie-Mellon \n     University and held visiting professorships at Columbia \n     Teachers' College and the New York University School of \n     Education. He also served as a consultant to the Ford \n     Foundation and was the president of Baruch College in \n     Manhattan in 1969.\n       His wife, Ella, died in 1991. Their son, Robert Jr., died \n     in 1962.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I join Senator Moynihan in supporting his \nlegislation to designate the headquarters building of the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development in Washington, D.C. as the ``Robert C. \nWeaver Federal Building.''\n  Robert Weaver was a stalwart leader in the fight to build a society \nfree from racial prejudice and discrimination. He spent his life in a \npursuit of equality and a campaign to end all forms of discrimination \nbased on race.\n  Dr. Weaver was a member of ``the black cabinet'' which sought to \nensure that the new government projects of the New Deal applied to and \nbenefitted minority groups during the Roosevelt Administration. His \npersonal crusade led for civil rights led to the selection of the first \nAfrican-American to be a general in the Army, the naming of the first \nAfrican-American to be a civilian aide to the Secretary of War, and the \nappointment of the first African-American to be a high-ranking aide to \nthe head of the Selective Service.\n  In 1955, Dr. Weaver began a long career in housing when he was \nappointed Deputy Commissioner of Housing for the State of New York. \nLater that year, he became the state rent administrator. In 1960, Dr. \nWeaver was selected to be the vice-chairman of the New York City \nHousing Redevelopment Board, a three-member body responsible for \nadministering the city's urban renewal and moderate-income housing \nprograms.\n  Dr. Weaver's reputation as a skilled housing policy and program \npractitioner soon extended well beyond New York. President John K. \nKennedy named Dr. Weaver as Administrator of the Federal Housing and \nHome Finance Agency, and President Lyndon Johnson nominated him to be \nthe first Secretary of Housing and Urban Development when the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development was formed in 1966.\n  Dr. Weaver's leadership and vision set the course for the future of \nthe housing and urban redevelopment industries. Past Federal housing \nprograms had focused largely on ``bricks-and-mortar'' policies, but Dr. \nWeaver believed that ``you cannot have physical renewal without human \nrenewal.'' His principal concern was to raise the standard of urban \nhousing and to move away from the bleak high rise projects that scarred \nthe urban landscape and were the origins of many inner city social \nproblems that were just beginning to be recognized. He used all of his \nvarious positions and considerable experience to advocate effective \npublic programs to house all Americans and to revitalize communities.\n  He was a true visionary who fought to expand the possibilities of all \nAmericans. I can think of no better person to name the first building \nto house the Department of Housing and Urban Development than Dr. \nRobert Clifton Weaver, the first African-American Cabinet member in New \nYork State, the first African-American member of a President's cabinet, \nand the federal government's first Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment. This tribute is even more fitting because Robert Weaver, \nalong with then Vice-President Hubert H. Humphrey and others, laid the \ncornerstone of this building during his tenure as Secretary.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n\n  S. 1702. A bill to amend the Harmonized Tariff Schedule for the \nUnited States to change the special rate of duty on purified \nterephtalic acid imported from Mexico; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 harmonized tariff schedule legislation\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce this bill \nto amend Chapter 29 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United \nStates to effect the immediate elimination of the special duty rate on \nPurified Terephthalic Acid (PTA) imports from Mexico in order that the \nUnited States polyester industry can remain competitive in the U.S. \ndomestic market.\n  We're faced with an ironic situation where a single American supplier \nis the source of substantial harm to the American polyester production \nindustry and American workers. This is a highly unusual situation in \nwhich the American supplier has been able to remain a monopolistic \nproducer of PTA, thus controlling the supply of the product and the \nprice U.S. consumers must pay. By eliminating the tariff on PTA from \nMexico, this legislation will place the U.S. PTA market on a level \nplaying field with adequate supply and market dictated prices.\n  PTA is the principal feedstock in producing polyethylene \nterephthalate (PET), a polyester resin produced in West Virginia by \nShell Chemical. This feedstock, PTA, comprises nearly two thirds the \ncost of polyester production. PTA is produced for the U.S. merchant \nmarket by one sole supplier, who can control both the price and supply \nof PTA in the U.S. market. Because the NAFTA tariff makes PTA imports \nunaffordable, U.S. PET producers, like Shell, are limited domestically \nto only one source to meet their PTA needs. This domestic source is not \nproviding PET buyers with sufficient quantities of PTA, nor at a \ncompetitive price. Subsequently, the combination of the NAFTA tariff on \nPTA and a single domestic merchant producer of PTA, the U.S. price for \nPTA is kept the highest in the world. As a result, U.S. polyester \nproducers, like the one in West Virginia, operate in a closed, non-\ncompetitive environment.\n  Consequently, a tariff inversion is created which significantly harms \nU.S. PET production because PET imports made with cheaper, foreign PTA \nare subject to relatively low tariffs or none at all in the case of GSP \ncountries. This tariff inversion exposes West Virginia's PET production \nand all U.S. polyester production to unfair competition from foreign \ncompetitors. Further, it prohibits any possibility for expansion and \nnew job creation.\n  I understand that the Office of the United States Trade \nRepresentative is currently negotiating with their Mexican counterparts \nvarious tariff eliminations under the Second Round of Accelerated \nTariff Elimination under the North American Free Trade Agreement. The \nPTA tariff is under consideration. The elimination of the duty for PTA \nis supported by the majority of the U.S. PTA industry and Mexico.\n  Shell's future economic viability in West Virginia is linked to the \nelimination of this tariff. If the tariff is not eliminated, the \ncutback in Shell polyester production could cost as many as 250 full-\ntime jobs that pay on average, $70,000 a year, including direct wages, \nbenefits and retirement. Already 160 jobs have been lost since 1995 as \na direct result of the economic disadvantage caused by this inequity. I \nwould add that these jobs provide some of the highest paying salaries \nin my State.\n  This lack of competitive domestic PTA pricing does not just cause \nharm\n\n[[Page S1258]]\n\nto my State of West Virginia--also at risk are nearly 3,500 workers \nemployed by several U.S. polyester producers buying PTA across the \ncountry.\n  I urge the Senate to act on this PTA tariff elimination bill so that \nWest Virginians and other domestic workers and producers can fairly \ncompete in this highly competitive global marketplace and to have the \nopportunity to expand U.S. operations when market conditions permit.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1702\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the conveyance of certain property \nfrom the United States to Stanislaus County, California; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n       the stanislaus county federal land conveyance act of 1998\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nproviding for the conveyance of federal land to Stanislaus County, \nCalifornia. This bill is nearly identical to legislation passed by the \nHouse of Representatives last November.\n  The land in question is known as the NASA Ames Research Center, Crows \nLanding Naval Air Facility. During World War II, Crows Landing was a \nflight training center encompassing 1,500 acres and containing two \nairstrips. Following the war, jurisdiction was transferred to NASA, \nwhich now no longer has any use for this facility. Right now, these \nairstrips are going to waste.\n  Giving this land back to the county will promote economic growth and \nbe an important asset to local development. While passage of this bill \nwould greatly serve Stanislaus County, it would also permit NASA to \nretain the right to use the facility for aviation purposes. It creates \na win-win situation for all involved.\n  Crows Landing has greatly served this nation--first in the interest \nof national defense and then to the benefit of the space program. But \nnow, it lies abandoned. We should follow the House and give this land \nback to the people of Stanislaus County.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1703\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 42. A joint resolution to disapprove the certification of \nthe President under section 490(b) of the Foreign Assistance Act of \n1961 regarding foreign assistance for Mexico during fiscal year 1998; \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  S.J. Res. 43. A joint resolution to disapprove the certification of \nthe President under section 490(b) of the Foreign Assistance Act of \n1961 regarding assistance for Mexico during fiscal year 1997, and to \nprovide for the termination of the withholding of and opposition to \nassistance that results from the disapproval; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n\n\n              mexico certification disapproval legislation\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, for the next few minutes I will make \nlimited remarks prior to the introduction of two separate joint \nresolutions that deal with the administration's recent certification of \nMexico dealing with the losing drug war, and that deal, in my judgment, \nwas a more appropriate approach to this situation.\n  Mr. President, I consider myself as a person somewhat surprised by \nthe New York Times editorial of Saturday, February 28, 1998; the \nheadline of the editorial, ``Certifiably Wrong On Mexico.''\n  The Clinton administration does no favor to Mexico or its own \ncredibility by certifying that Mexico is ``fully cooperating'' in the \nfight against drug trafficking. Compounding the damage, the White House \nDrug Policy Director, Barry McCaffrey, fatuously claims that Mexican \ncooperation is ``absolutely superlative.''\n  According to this editorial,\n\n       A more truthful assessment can be found in the Drug \n     Enforcement Administration's confidential evaluation, \n     described by Tim Golden in yesterday's Times. The DEA \n     concludes that ``the Government of Mexico has not \n     accomplished its counter-narcotic goals or succeeded in \n     cooperation with the U.S. Government.'' Mexican trafficking \n     has increased, the DEA notes, and the corruption of its \n     enforcement agencies ``continues unabated.''\n       Though Washington finds it diplomatically inconvenient to \n     acknowledge, Mexico has a chronic problem with drug \n     traffickers who always seem to be able to secure the \n     political influence they need to avoid arrest and \n     prosecution. This drug corruption greases the flow of \n     narcotics into the United States. Mexico's drug networks span \n     the border, supplying cocaine, heroin, and marijuana to \n     American users.\n\n  Mr. President, in a hearing last week, I indicated, along with \nSenator Feinstein of California, that we would be introducing \nresolutions, the purpose of which would be to change this course \nbetween the United States and Mexico on this matter. It would be our \ngoal that the process would decertify Mexico on this matter with a \nPresidential waiver in the national interest in which I believe we both \nconcur. This would be an honest appraisal of our circumstances.\n  The problem with certifying is that it sends a message to the vast \npopulations of the United States and of Mexico that this war is being \nwon, that we have turned a corner, that things\n\n[[Page S1259]]\n\nare working out. That simply is not the case. I think it does a \ndisservice to the entire population of both countries for us to send a \nmessage of victory when, indeed, the message is one of gravity and \nloss.\n  This situation has grave consequences for the people of the United \nStates. I have to say that the United States shares enormous \nresponsibility in this struggle. My remarks are not intended to \ncastigate or single out Mexico; quite to the contrary; I view them as a \ngreat ally. They are a great trading partner. We share this hemisphere. \nWe have mutual goals--democratic goals. But neither country seems to \nwant to face the fact that it is losing a precious struggle.\n  In 1991, the drug interdiction budget for the United States was $2.03 \nbillion; today it is $1.44 billion. That is a dramatic reduction in our \ncommitment. In 1992, the United States stopped, seized 440 kilograms of \ncocaine and marijuana a day; in 1995, it had been cut in half; we only \nstopped 205 kilograms of cocaine and marijuana per day.\n  What does this all mean? In shorthand, it means that about 3 million \nteenagers aged 12-16 are using drugs today that weren't in 1991. To \ngive an example, in 1991, 400,000 eighth-graders had used an illicit \ndrug in the last year. In 1996 and 1997, that number rose to 920,000. \nIn 10th grade, 600,000 had used a drug in 1991; in 1996 and 1997, it \nhad doubled to 1.2 million children. In 12th grade, 600,000 in 1991; \n1.1 million, almost doubled again, in 1996 and 1997.\n  So by not confronting this directly and honesty, we are all \ncontributing to the accelerated rate of children using drugs and we are \ngoing to pay a price for this the likes of which we have never seen.\n  I will yield to the Senator from California in just a moment, but \nfirst I quote a story of a top administrative official on this. It ran \nin the Phoenix papers.\n\n       ``Our current interdiction efforts almost completely fail \n     to achieve our purpose of reducing the flow of cocaine, \n     heroin, and methamphetamines across the (Southwest) [the \n     Mexican] border,'' said Francis X. Kinney, director of \n     strategic planning for the Office of National Drug Control \n     Policy. . . .\n       Kinney said the United States will continue to be overrun \n     by drug traffic at the U.S.-Mexican border unless it \n     emphasizes improved intelligence and high-tech screening \n     equipment. . .\n\n  The last thing he said addresses the Senator from California:\n\n       ``They [the Congress] want us to call it like it is, not to \n     be an apologist,'' alluding to the U.S. Congress.\n\n  I think this gentleman is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. President, I send a joint resolution to the desk and ask for its \nappropriate referral.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The joint resolution will be received and \nappropriately referred.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I send another joint resolution to the \ndesk and ask for its appropriate referral.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The joint resolution will be received and \nappropriately referred.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, in concluding and yielding to the \nSenator from California, I just want to make it clear that the purpose \nof these two joint resolutions is to alter the course of our engagement \nin the drug war, principally as it relates to Mexico. Instead of \ncertifying and saying, ``Here is a message of victory to the two \npeoples of the two Nations,'' it decertifies with a national security \nwaiver and calls it like it is and refocuses our Governments and our \npeople in a combined effort to win this battle and not lose it--to win \nit for the millions of children that are suffering, because we are \nlosing it.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia, and I rise to join him in submitting these resolutions for \ndisapproval of the President's decision to certify Mexico as fully \ncooperating with the United States in the fight against drug \ntrafficking.\n  Mr. President, as we all know, when the President made the same \ndecision last year, it sparked an intense debate between the \nadministration and what was in all probability a majority of Congress \nwho did not believe that Mexico had earned certification. I have looked \nlong and hard at the evidence that is available. I have received \nextensive briefings from law enforcement and intelligence officials. \nAnyone, I believe, who has received these same briefings would come to \nthe conclusion I have reached, that once again the decision to certify \nMexico is incorrect and not grounded in the facts.\n  While Mexico has made some limited progress, there remain gaping \nholes in its counternarcotics effort. Whether due to inability or lack \nof political will, these failures badly undermine the urgent effort to \nkeep the scourge of drugs off our streets. Regardless of America's \ndemand problem, when the supply of drugs reaches the point where it \ncomes in at literally tons each day, any demand program is \nextraordinarily difficult to sustain.\n  Has Mexico cooperated in some areas? Of course. There are one or two \nnew police units which seem to have trusting relationships with the \nDEA. New vetting procedures are beginning to be implemented in the \nhiring of new police officers. Mexico and the United States have agreed \non a bilateral drug strategy, although it is a vaguely worded document \nthat will take years to evaluate whether it has been successful and \nwhether actions on the streets will follow this roundtable document.\n  It can also be argued that pressure brought to bear on drug lord \nAmado Carrillo-Fuentes was responsible for driving him to seek refuge \nin another country--Chile--and very likely for his attempt to conceal \nhis identity through plastic surgery. The surgery, of course, resulted \nin his death and the torture-murder of the entire surgical team. His \norganization, however, continues to operate, and a reign of violence \nhas been unleashed as his would-be successors battle for control of his \norganization.\n  But last year, Senator Coverdell and I laid out a number of key areas \nthat we would use to judge whether or not Mexico has reached the \nstandard of full cooperation. Sadly, our top law enforcement agencies \nindicate that none of these changes has produced significant results. \nThere has been no demonstrable action on any--and I repeat ``any''--of \nthe benchmarks outlined by Congress last year as key measurements of \ncooperation by Mexico: dismantlement of drug cartels, the arrest and \nprosecution of cartel leaders, the extradition of Mexican nationals on \ndrug charges to the United States for prosecution, effective \nprosecution of corrupt officials, law enforcement cooperation, \neffective money laundering laws implemented, security of U.S. drug \nagents working in bilateral efforts in Mexico.\n  Let me touch on each of these. The cartels in Mexico today are either \nas strong or stronger than they were a year ago. And despite much talk \nof cooperation, there has been no substantial progress by the \nGovernment of Mexico in developing prosecutable cases against the \nleaders of the major drug trafficking groups, even when these \nindividuals have been identified by U.S. investigations and are made \nthe subject of U.S. indictments.\n  The scope of Mexican drug trafficking has increased significantly, \nalong with the attendant violence, even against United States and \nMexican law enforcement officials and informants. During 1997, DEA \nrecorded in excess of 50 incidents of threats along the Southwest \nborder. According to the information I have received, the Mexican \nGovernment has arrested and prosecuted few individuals in connection \nwith these acts. None of the major cartels has been dismantled nor have \ntheir leaders been arrested.\n  Take the Amado Carrillo-Fuentes organization. After the death of \nAmado Carrillo-Fuentes, there were numerous enforcement actions taken \nagainst his organization, but the intelligence was unproductive, \nleading to insignificant asset seizures and new arrests.\n  On July 30, 1997, Mexican authorities detained a close associate of \nCarrillo-Fuentes, Manuel Bitar-Tafich, leading to seizure of $50 \nmillion in the United States. However, because the Mexicans have not \nprovided the needed documents to support the seizure in the United \nStates, much of the money had to be returned. Bitar himself remains in \ncustody, but there has been no movement on his case. While the Mexicans \nhave reported seizing $52 million in Mexico, no documentation \nsupporting this seizure has been provided to the U.S. Government.\n  The Mexican Government arrested Noe Brito, a member of Carrillo-\n\n[[Page S1260]]\n\nFuentes' security apparatus. He was released, however, before the DEA \nwas even allowed to interview him.\n  The Arellano-Felix operation--the notorious cartel located just south \nof California in the Tijuana area--continues to operate with impunity. \nThere have been several enforcement actions in 1997, but few resulted \nin significant results against the cartel's trafficking operations.\n  On November 8, 1997, the Mexican Attorney General's Office arrested \nArturo Everardo Paez-Martinez, a known cartel assassin. Paez is \nincarcerated in Mexico on the basis of a provisional U.S. arrest \nwarrant but has not been extradited.\n\n  On September 20, Mexico's counternarcotics unit reporting to the \nAttorney General arrested two men on weapons charges, who are known \nmembers of the ``Juniors,'' a group of young assassins recruited by the \nArellano-Felix cartel. The Government of Mexico offered to extradite \none of the men, but the United States had to turn down the offer due to \nlack of outstanding charges and evidence against him. This is an \nexample of what results from a lack of cooperative law enforcement \nefforts.\n  The Sonora Cartel. Miguel Angel Caro-Quintero heads his family's \norganization operating out of Sonora, Mexico. There are four \noutstanding warrants for him on smuggling, RICO statute, and conspiracy \ncharges. He has been operating freely in Mexico since 1992. There are \nalso provisional arrest warrants issued for both Miguel and Rafael \nCaro-Quintero.\n  The Amezcua-Contreras brothers. The Amezcua-Contreras brothers' \norganization is believed to be the world's largest clandestine producer \nof methamphetamine. The organization procures huge quantities of the \nephedrine in Thailand and India, which is supplied to laboratories in \nMexico and California. The Amezcuas' methamphetamine is distributed in \nlarge cities across the United States. A U.S. law enforcement \ninvestigation, Operation META, concluded in December of 1997 with the \narrest of 101 defendants, seizure of 133 pounds of methamphetamine, and \nthe precursors to manufacture up to 540 pounds more, along with 1,100 \nkilos of cocaine and over $2.25 million in assets.\n  Mexican efforts against this organization have not met with great \nsuccess:\n  On November 10, 1997, the Mexican military's special vetted unit \narrested Adan Amezcua at his ranch in Colima on gun charges, not on \ndrug charges. He is the only Amezcua not under indictment in either the \nUnited States or Mexico. He remains in custody pending further \ninvestigations. The Government of Mexico has failed to indict or arrest \nany of the principal members of the Amezcua organization in Mexico.\n  The DEA International Chemical Control Unit has supported elements of \nthe Government of Mexico financially and logistically for numerous \ninvestigations of the Amezcuas, with little or no results. None of the \ninvestigations resulted in arrests or produced information that could \nbe used in U.S. courts.\n  Though Jesus and Luis Amezcua are currently under Federal indictment \nin the United States on a variety of charges, there are no provisional \narrest warrants for them and they remain at large in Mexico.\n  Extradition was a key benchmark and a test of cooperation. There have \nbeen no extraditions from Mexico to the United States of any Mexican \nnationals on drug charges--none.\n  The identities of the leaders of the major criminal groups based in \nMexico who control the flow of heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine to \nthe United States have been known for several years. In fact, U.S. law \nenforcement agencies have built cases on and indicted in the United \nStates virtually all of these cartel leaders. The Department of Justice \nhas filed provisional arrest warrants for the most significant drug \ntraffickers in Mexico. While several have been arrested, many others \nremain at large and none has been extradited to the United States.\n  In the war against drugs, extradition of cartel leaders for trial and \nimprisonment in the United States is a key and indisputable beachhead \nin the war against drug trafficking. It is also a major benchmark of \ncooperation.\n  In my view--and I know the view held by law enforcement in the United \nStates--the drug lords operating in Mexico only fear extradition to the \nUnited States, where they know they will stand trial and face \npunishment commensurate with their crimes. The Mexican law enforcement \ninstitutions and legal system present no deterrent to their operations.\n  That is why this Senate, many of my colleagues, and law enforcement \nofficials have repeatedly said that the most meaningful measurement of \nreal progress in drug cooperation with Mexico is if the major \ntraffickers are apprehended and extradited to the United States.\n\n  Provisional arrest warrants have been filed by the Department of \nJustice for the following major traffickers: Agustin Vasquez-Mendoza, \nRamon Arellano-Felix, Rafael Caro-Quintero, Miguel Caro-Quintero, \nVicente Carrillo-Fuentes, Eduardo Gonzalez-Quirarte, Oscar Malherbe, \nArturo Paez-Martinez, Jaime Ladino-Avila, Jose Gerardo-Castro/Gonzalez-\nGutierez, William Brian Martin, Miguel Angel Martinez-Martinez, Antonio \nHernandez-Acosta, and Miguel Felix Gallardo.\n\n  These are all key lieutenants in either the Amezcua, Carrillo-\nFuentes, Caro-Quintero, or Arellano-Felix organizations. The Justice \nDepartment requested extradition of four of the above within the past \nyear. The first two requests have been stalled or completely thwarted \nby Mexican courts.\n  Last November, the United States and Mexico Attorneys General signed \na protocol to the United States-Mexican Extradition Treaty that \nauthorized temporary surrender of a convicted party to the other \ncountry to face drug charges. This is certainly a positive signal, but \nit has yet to be tested in practice.\n  The bottom line is that, to date, there has not been a single \nextradition of a Mexican national to the United States on drug \ncharges--not one.\n  Corruption. Drug-related corruption is probably the single greatest \nobstacle that the United States faces in its global battle against \ninternational drug trafficking. Unfortunately, drug corruption in \nMexico is so deeply rooted that it persists despite attempts to \neradicate it.\n  The level of drug corruption in Mexico continues unabated. According \nto the briefings I have received, virtually every investigation our law \nenforcement agencies conduct against major traffickers in Mexico \nuncovers significant corruption of law enforcement officials.\n  Our own law enforcement agencies indicate that endemic corruption \namong Mexican law enforcement officials continually frustrates our \neffort to build cases against and to apprehend the most significant \ndrug traffickers in Mexico, and it is the primary reason there has been \nno meaningful progress in drug law enforcement in Mexico.\n  In the wake of the devastating disclosure that Mexico's own ``drug \nczar'' was on the payroll of Amado Carrillo-Fuentes, the Mexican \nGovernment dismantled the INCD, the Mexican counterpart to the DEA, and \nfired the majority of its employees.\n  Unfortunately, many of those fired were ordered reinstated by Mexican \ncourts.\n  Additionally, of the 40 military officers arrested as part of the \nGutierrez-Rebollo investigation, none has been brought to trial or \nconvicted to date.\n  The following cases indicate how deeply drug corruption has \npenetrated into Mexican institutions:\n  Colonel Jose Luis Rubalcava, who had been Director of the Federal \nJudicial Anti-Drug Police under the INCD, was arrested on or about \nApril 14, 1997 on charges in connection with 2.5 tons of cocaine seized \nin Sombrete, Mexico in 1995. This is the director for the Judicial \nAnti-Drug Police--2\\1/2\\ tons of cocaine.\n  U.S. law enforcement officials speculate that bribery and corruption \nmay have been behind the withdrawal of Baja state police protection \nfrom a Tijuana news editor prior to his November 27, 1997 attempted \nassassination. The editor had been putting public pressure on the issue \nof drug corruption.\n  According to a December 1997 statement by Mexican Attorney General \nMadrazo, out of some 870 Federal agents dismissed on corruption charges \nin 1996, 700 have been rehired in either the PGR--the Mexican Attorney \nGeneral's office--or at the state and local\n\n[[Page S1261]]\n\nlevel. The rehiring was done at the direction of the courts.\n  If you cannot fire corrupt law enforcement officials, how can you \nfight drugs?\n  The issue of prosecuting corrupt officials is important, because \nwithout fear of prosecution, there is little deterrence. Too often in \nMexico, officials are fired, but never prosecuted.\n  In 1997, there were only 3 corruption cases being prosecuted, \nincluding General Gutierrez. Another case involves the theft of 476 \nkilograms of cocaine by 17 PGR officials, including an Army General in \nSonora. The third involved a Judicial Police Comandante. The Mexican \ngovernment has reportedly begun additional prosecutions, but many more \ncases need to be brought to trial in order to have any deterrent \neffect.\n\n\n                      law enforcement cooperation\n\n  This is where the rubber hits the road in counternarcotics \ncooperation, not in agreements reached at the political level. \nUnfortunately, law enforcement cooperation from Mexico has been \nseverely lacking.\n  It is encouraging to hear from DEA that there are now some Mexican \nofficials with whom they believe they can build a trusting \nrelationship.\n  A key aspect of this institution-building process is vetting, leading \nto the development and professionalization of the new drug enforcement \nunit, the Special Prosecutor's Office for Crimes Against Health.\n  This vetting process could go a long way toward providing U.S. law \nenforcement officials with the level of trust in their counterparts \nnecessary for an effective bi-lateral effort, but it is still in its \ninfancy, and even some officials who have been ``vetted'' have \nsubsequently been arrested in connection with traffickers. So while \nthis effort is critically important, it is not evidence of full \ncooperation by a long shot.\n  More telling however, is the state of affairs with the much-vaunted \nBilateral Border Task Forces located in Tijuana, Ciudad Juarez and \nMatamoros. Each Task Forces was supposed to include Mexican agents, and \ntwo agents each from DEA, FBI, and the U.S. Customs Service. But, \nregretfully, the Task Forces are not operational because some Mexican \nagents, and even comandantes, have been under suspicion of, or arrested \nfor, ties to criminal organizations.\n  The old Task Forces were dismantled after the arrest of General \nGutierrez-Rebollo and have been rebuilt since then. But the Mexican \ngovernment for a long time did not provide the promised funding, \nleaving DEA to carry the full cost, which they did until September of \nlast year.\n  Additionally, the issue of personal security for U.S. agents working \nwith the Bilateral Task Forces in Mexico has not been resolved and, as \na result, the task forces are not operational and will not be until the \nsecurity issue is resolved.\n  The bottom line is that the task forces cannot function properly \nwithout DEA and other federal law enforcement agents working side by \nside with their Mexican counterparts, as is the case with similar units \nin Colombia and Peru. This critical joint working relationship is made \nimpossible by Mexican policies that do not allow for adequate \nimmunities or physical security for U.S. Special Agents while working \nin Mexico.\n  A related problem for the Task Forces is the low quality of \nintelligence provided by Mexico. To my knowledge there have been no \nmeaningful intelligence leads from Mexican agents to their American \ncounterparts leading to a single significant seizure of drugs coming \ninto this country.\n  Intelligence sharing simply does not flow north.\n  U.S. law enforcement officials indicate that Mexico's drug \nintelligence facilities located near the Task Forces are manned by non-\nvetted, non-law enforcement civilians and military staff and have only \nproduced leads from telephone intercepts on low-level traffickers. To \ndate, none of the electronic intercepts conducted by the Task Forces \nhave produced a prosecutable drug case in Mexican courts against any \nmajor Mexican criminal organization.\n  To its credit, the Organized Crime Unit does have several major on-\ngoing investigations underway. But only 140 of the planned 280 \nprosecutors, investigators and support personnel have been hired, and \nonly 25 have been ``super-vented.'' Again, this unit is promising, but \nit is still too early to tell whether it will maintain the integrity, \nor have the staffing, training and resources to be effective partners \nin the war against drugs.\n\n\n                              enforcement\n\n  Mexico's seizures of cocaine have increased from 23.6 metric tons in \n1996 to 34.9 metric tons in 1997--although that is still far below the \naverage of 45 metric tons in 1991-1993. Marijuana seizures did reach an \nall-time high.\n  Unfortunately, seizures of heroin, methamphetamine, and ephedrine are \nall down sharply. Heroin seizures fell from 363 kilograms to 115 \nkilograms. Methamphetamine seizures fell from 172 kilograms to only 39 \nkilograms. Ephedrine seizures fell dramatically from 6,697 kilograms to \nonly 608 kilograms.\n  Drug related arrests declined from an already low 11,283 to 10,622, \nbarely a third of the number arrested in 1992. Less than half as many \nweapons were seized in 1997 (1,892) as in 1996 (4,335).\n  In another crucial enforcement area, Mexico's new money-laundering \nstatutes have yet to be fully enforced, and have not resulted in any \nsuccessful prosecutions yet. Mexico has decided to make violations of \nnew banking regulations non-criminal violations, which severely \nundercuts the deterrent factor.\n  Mexico's Organized Crime Statute has yet to be fully implemented. The \nGovernment of Mexico has advised that the lack of judicial support and \nknown judicial corruption have frustrated implementation of the wire \nintercept aspects of the law.\n  But let us be honest with ourselves. The statute asks the President \nto certify that a country has ``cooperated fully'' with the United \nStates. If Mexico has cooperated in three or four areas, and not \ncooperated in ten or twelve others, can we really call that full \ncooperation. Of course not. At best, we should say that Mexico has \ncooperated partially with the United States in counternarcotics \nefforts. But full cooperation? It's not even close.\n  We must make an honest assessment. To those who dislike the \ncertification statute, I quote again from the New York Times editorial \n``* * * as long as certification remains on the books, the \nAdministration has a duty to report truthfully to Congress and the \nAmerican people. It has failed to do so in the case of Mexico.''\n  So in the wake of the President's decision to certify Mexico, I \nbelieve we in Congress have no choice but to try to pass a resolution \nof disapproval. If possible, we will pass one with a waiver of \nsanctions. But if not, we will have to vote on the straight resolution \nof disapproval. We have until March 28 to decide.\n  Mr. President, we must make an honest assessment of full cooperation, \nand there is only one way to assess full cooperation, and it is on the \nstreets. It is with extradition. It is with arrest of cartel leaders. \nIt is with letting our DEA agents who work the Mexican side of the \nborder have their security--meaning beyond. You cannot send them across \nthe border without a mechanism to protect them. None of this is \nhappening today.\n  The big, highly touted drug agreement, which I read, talks about the \nsize and shape of the table. There are no specifics.\n  In view of this, I urge decertification with a waiver.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a Senate \nresolution regarding smaller classes in our public schools.\n  This resolution expresses the Senate's strong sense that experiments \nin reducing class size in the earliest grades demonstrate a proven \neducational benefit. Accordingly, the Senate should assist States in \ntheir efforts to reduce class size and assess the benefits of such \nreductions.\n  Mr. President, yesterday I visited the Parkview Elementary School in \nCudahy, a community near Milwaukee, where I had the chance to read Dr. \nSeuss' classic children's story, ``Green Eggs and Ham,'' to a group of \n15 first-grade students. It was exciting to watch their faces come \nalive with curiosity as they listened.\n  Parkview Elementary is a special school because it is one of 30 \nWisconsin schools in 21 school districts that are participating in the \nStudent Achievement Guarantee in Education program, or the SAGE \nprogram. It is a very popular pilot program and, according to an \nindependent evaluation being conducted by the University of Wisconsin-\nMilwaukee's, Center for Urban Initiatives and Research, it's been very \neffective at reducing the size of elementary school classes. SAGE is a \nvery appropriate acronym, for a sage is a teacher who imparts knowledge \nand wisdom through direct interaction with his or her students, and the \nSAGE program in Wisconsin is trying to give students and teachers more \nopportunities to interact directly, which improves learning.\n  SAGE is a pilot program created by the Wisconsin legislature in 1995. \nThe specific objective of the program is to improve student achievement \nthrough four reform strategies: (1) reducing student/teacher ratios to \na maximum of 15-to-1, which was the size of the first-grade class I \nvisited yesterday; (2) increasing cooperation between schools and their \nsurrounding communities; (3) implementing a rigorous academic \ncurriculum stressing achievement; and, finally, (4) improving staff \ndevelopment and evaluation. A modest amount of state aid is available \nto schools who adopt the SAGE program, which currently covers \nkindergarten through the second grade, and which is scheduled to be \nexpanded to cover third grade in the near future.\n  SAGE has proven to be very popular with parents, teachers, school \nadministrators and students. Reports from Wisconsin educators indicate \nimprovements in classroom environment and academic performance in \nschools participating in this program. A December 1997 study found that \nfirst-graders participating in SAGE scored higher on standardized tests \nthan other students in comparison schools. The SAGE program has \ndemonstrated again what we know instinctively: students in smaller \nclasses benefit from more attention from teachers, and teachers with \nfewer pupils will have more time and energy to devote to their jobs. \nClass size has been proven to be one of the crucial factors in the \nquality of a child's education, along with teacher quality and parental \ninvolvement.\n  The SAGE program and this resolution will reinforce what should be \ngood, common sense. If you have smaller classes, children get more \nattention from teachers, and it stands to reason that more attention \nwill translate into more learning.\n  Mr. President, I think the Wisconsin experience with this kind of \ncommon-sense educational reform is instructive.\n  That is why, last fall, I included an amendment to the Labor and \nHealth and Human Services Departments' 1998 appropriation bill \nrequiring the Department of Education to study the costs and benefits \nof reducing class size in the earliest grades. My amendment also \nrequired the Department to prepare cost estimates of growing \nenrollments and to follow-up with policy recommendations. In addition, \nI wrote earlier this year to President Clinton in January requesting \nthat he make reducing class size a priority in his FY 99 education \nbudget. I was pleased that the President's FY 99 budget includes an \ninitiative to help schools provide small classes with qualified \nteachers in the early grades. Mr. President, in an effort to spread the \nmessage of the successful SAGE pilot program, I recently invited \nEducation Secretary Richard Riley to come to Wisconsin for a tour of \nseveral SAGE schools.\n  And, finally, most recently, I have written to the chairman and \nranking member of the Labor and Human Resources Committee requesting \nthat the committee hold a hearing to examine the options available to \nschools as they plan for smaller class size with higher anticipated \nstudent enrollment looming.\n  A recent Department of Education report states that this year's \nelementary and secondary student enrollment will soon be at record \nlevels. School districts are going to need to adapt to these increases \nwhile many of them rightly will be investing as much as they can in the \ncreation of smaller classes for early elementary students.\n  Addressing the problem of increasing enrollment and the desire to \nreduce class size presents a great challenge to our communities, our \nStates and our Nation. As I say that, I want to be very\n\n[[Page S1264]]\n\nclear that I believe that the American public school system is rooted \nin the vision of Thomas Jefferson. He saw a future where every child in \nthe Nation could look forward to a thorough public education, \ncomparable in quality but under local control. I want it to be clear \nthat when I speak about small class size as a national goal, it is in \nthe context of local control. So I do not support a national mandate \nfor smaller class size.\n  I believe that any distribution formula for the funds should give \ncredit to and not penalize those States, such as Wisconsin, which have \ngotten ahead of this and have invested some resources.\n  I also believe very firmly that any national funding in this area has \nto be paid for. It cannot be done on the basis of deficit spending or, \nin effect, borrowing from Social Security.\n  But with those qualifications, I reiterate that there is a great \nnational purpose in trying to reduce class sizes for children. \nTherefore, the Federal Government has a limited but important role in \nensuring that the Nation makes the proper investments in students today \nso that it can meet the challenges of the 21st century.\n  Mr. President, we should take the necessary steps now to help school \ndistricts reduce class size as part of an overall effort to improve \neducation and ensure that our children have the best chance to excel \nand reach their full potential.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Feingold, \nfor his remarks about smaller class size and the importance of \neducation. His remarks are very important, and I associate myself with \nand support his resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/03/senate-section/article/S1263-2", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1264-S1283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      THE INTERMODAL SURFACE TRANSPORTATION EFFICIENCY ACT OF 1998\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      WELLSTONE AMENDMENT NO. 1679\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE proposed an amendment to amendment No. 1676 proposed by \nMr. Chafee to the bill (S. 1173) to authorize funds for construction of \nhighways, for highway safety programs, and for mass transit programs, \nand for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 309, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 18__.

(a) The Congress finds that--\n       (1) There is a lack of air quality monitoring data for fine \n     particle levels, measured as PM2.5, in the United \n     States and the States should receive full funding for the \n     monitoring efforts;\n       (2) Such data would provide a basis for designating areas \n     as attainment or nonattainment for any PM2.5 \n     national ambient air quality standards pursuant to the \n     standards promulgated in July 1997;\n       (3) The President of the United States directed the \n     Administrator in a memorandum dated July 16, 1997, to \n     complete the next periodic review of the particulate matter \n     national ambient air quality standards by July 2002 in order \n     to determine ``whether to revise or maintain the standards;''\n       (4) The Administrator has stated that three years of air \n     quality monitoring data for fine particle levels, measured as \n     PM2.5 and performed in accordance with any \n     applicable federal reference methods, is appropriate for \n     designating areas as attainment or nonattainment pursuant to \n     the July 1997 promulgated standards; and\n\n[[Page S1283]]\n\n       (5) The Administrator has acknowledged that in drawing \n     boundaries for attainment and nonattainment areas for the \n     July 1997 ozone national air quality standards, Governors \n     would benefit from considering implementation guidance from \n     EPA on drawing area boundaries;\n       (b) The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) To ensure that three years of air quality monitoring \n     data regarding fine particle levels are gathered for use in \n     the determination of area attainment or nonattainment \n     designations respecting any PM2.5 national ambient \n     air quality standards;\n       (2) To ensure that the Governors have adequate time to \n     consider implementation guidance from EPA on drawing area \n     boundaries prior to submitting area designations respecting \n     the July 1997 ozone national ambient air quality standards;\n       (3) To ensure that implementation of the July 1997 \n     revisions of the ambient air quality standards are consistent \n     with the purposes of the President's Implementation \n     Memorandum dated July 16, 1997.\n\n\n                 particulate matter monitoring program\n\n       Sec. 2. (a) Through grants under section 103 of the Clean \n     Air Act the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency shall use appropriated funds no later than fiscal 2000 \n     to fund one hundred percent of the cost of the establishment, \n     purchase, operation and maintenance of a PM2.5 \n     monitoring network necessary to implement the national \n     ambient air quality standards for PM2.5 under \n     section 109 of the Clean Air Act. This implementation shall \n     not result in a diversion or reprogramming of funds from \n     other Federal, State or local Clean Air Act activities. Any \n     funds previously diverted or reprogrammed from section 105 \n     Clean Air Act grants for PM2.5 monitors must be \n     restored to State or local air programs in fiscal year 1999.\n       (b) EPA and the States shall ensure that the national \n     network (designated in section 2(a)) which consists of the \n     PM2.5 monitors necessary to implement the national \n     ambient air quality standards is established by December 31, \n     1999.\n       (c) The Governors shall be required to submit designations \n     for each area following promulgation of the July 1997 \n     PM2.5 national ambient air quality standard within \n     one year after receipt of three years of air quality \n     monitoring data performed in accordance with any applicable \n     federal reference methods for the relavent areas. Only data \n     from the monitoring network designated in section 2(a) and \n     other federal reference method monitors shall be considered \n     for such designations. In reviewing the State Implemental \n     Plans the Administrator shall take into account all relevant \n     monitoring data regarding transport of PM2.5.\n       (d) The Administrator shall promulgate designations of \n     nonattainment areas no later than one year after the initial \n     designations required under paragraph 2(c) are required to be \n     submitted.\n       (e) The Administrator shall conduct a field study of the \n     ability of the PM2.5 Federal Reference Method to \n     differentiate those particles that are larger than 2.5 \n     micrograms in diameter. This study shall be completed and \n     provided to Congress no later than two years from the date of \n     enactment of this legislation.\n\n\n                     ozone designation requirements\n\n       Sec. 3. (a) The Governors shall be required to submit \n     designations of nonattainment areas within two years \n     following the July 1997 promulgation of the revised ozone \n     national ambient air quality standards.\n       (b) The Administrator shall promulgate final designations \n     no later than one year after the designation required under \n     paragraph 3(a) are required to be submitted.\n\n\n                         additional provisions\n\n       Sec. 4. Nothing in sections 1-3 above shall be construed by \n     the Administrator of Environmental Protection Agency or any \n     court, State, or person to affect any pending litigation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/03/senate-section/article/S1264-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n           committee on agriculture, nutrition, and forestry\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

Mr. President, in this morning's New York Times, \nThomas L. Friedman has written a powerful critique of what he calls \n``fumbling on NATO expansion.'' In it he refers to a letter in the \nspring issue of The National Interest from George F. Kennan who warns \nthat NATO expansion is an historic blunder. Ambassador Kennan's letter \ncame in response to an article by Owen Harries, editor of The National \nInterest, on ``The Dangers of Expansive Realism'' in the current, \nwinter issue of The National Interest.\n\n[[Page S1284]]\n\n  It is surely a rare moment when three respected commentators on \nforeign affairs, and in Ambassador Kennan's case, a participant of \nhistoric standing, each of quite distinctive points of view, come \ntogether in such strong agreement. In an article in The New York Times \nof February 5th, 1997, Ambassador Kennan stated that ``expanding NATO \nwould be the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-\ncold-war era.''\n  I ask that the column by Thomas L. Friedman, the letter by George F. \nKennan, the article by Owen Harries, and the article by Ambassador \nKennan in The New York Times be printed in the Record.\n\n                [From the New York Times, March 3, 1998]\n\n                             Ohio State II\n\n                        (By Thomas L. Friedman)\n\n       Last week the Senate Foreign Relations Committee put on a \n     shameful performance. Senators Jesse Helms, Joe Biden & Co. \n     rolled over like puppies having their bellies rubbed when \n     Clinton officials explained their plans for NATO expansion by \n     dodging all the hard questions. It's too bad CNN couldn't \n     entice the Clinton team to go out to Ohio State again and \n     hold a town meeting on NATO expansion. If they had, it would \n     sound like this:\n       Student: ``I've got a question for Secretary of Defense \n     Cohen. When you were here before, you had a hard time \n     defining what the endgame would be if we bombed Iraq. What's \n     the endgame of NATO expansion? I mean, if we just admit \n     Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, all we will be doing \n     is redividing Europe slightly to the east. And if we actually \n     do what you advocate, expand NATO to the Baltic States, up to \n     Russia's border, we will be redividing NATO, since the \n     British, French and Germans are not ready to go that far \n     because they know it would be treated by Russia as a \n     strategic threat.''\n       Secretary Cohen: ``Son, we've got our endgame on NATO \n     figured out just like we do on Iraq. It's called kick the can \n     down the road and hope it all works out in the end.''\n       Student: ``National security adviser Berger, you now say \n     NATO expansion will only cost $1.5 billion over 10 years, \n     when just last year the Pentagon said it would be $27 billion \n     over 13 years, and the Congressional Budget Office said it \n     could be $125 billion over 15 years. How come NATO expansion \n     gets cheaper every day it gets closer to a Senate vote? And \n     how does it get cheaper when France says it won't pay a dime \n     and the Czech Republic doesn't own a single advanced fighter \n     jet, so it will need to buy a whole new air force?''\n       Mr. Berger: ``Our NATO numbers were prepared by the same \n     accountants who said the U.S. budget was balanced. I rest my \n     case.''\n       Student: ``Secretary Albright, you say we have to bomb \n     Iraq, because Saddam has all these weapons of mass \n     destruction. But the Russians have 7,500 long-range nuclear \n     missiles, loose warheads falling off trucks and a bunch of \n     Dr. Strangelove scientists looking for work. And we have a \n     Start 2 nuclear reduction treaty that the Russians have \n     signed but not implemented because of resistance in the \n     Russian Parliament to NATO expansion. How could you put a \n     higher priority on bringing Hungary into NATO than working \n     with Russia on proliferation?''\n       Albright: ``Oh, please. You want to blame everything on \n     NATO expansion, like it's El Nino.''\n       Student: ``I'm sorry, Madame Secretary, but that's not an \n     answer. You keep dodging this question. You can say that the \n     Russians can't stop NATO expansion. And you can say that it's \n     worth risking a new cold war to bring these three countries \n     into NATO. But you can't deny that NATO expansion has \n     contributed to Russia's refusal to ratify the Start 2 treaty, \n     which is an enormous loss to U.S. national security.''\n       War veteran: ``Secretary Cohen, I thought we fought the \n     cold war to change Russia, not to expand NATO. But now that \n     we've changed Russia and should be consolidating that, you \n     want to expand NATO?''\n       Secretary Cohen: ``NATO expansion is not directed against \n     Russia. It's meant to secure the new democracies in East \n     Europe.''\n       Heckler: ``If it's meant to secure democracy in new \n     democracies, isn't the most important new democracy Russia? \n     And why is your P.R. campaign for NATO expansion being funded \n     by U.S. arms sellers, who see NATO expansion as market \n     expansion for their new weapons?''\n       Student: ``I just got the spring issue of The National \n     Interest magazine. It contains a letter from George Kennan, \n     the architect of America's cold-war containment of the Soviet \n     Union and one of our nation's greatest statesmen. Kennan says \n     NATO expansion is a historic blunder. What do you all know \n     that he doesn't?''\n       Mr. Berger: ``I have the greatest respect for Mr. Kennan, \n     but our team has its own Russia expert, Strobe Talbott, who \n     speaks Russian, has written books about Russia, and some of \n     his best friends are Russians. He couldn't possible be anti-\n     Russian, and he's for NATO expansion.''\n       Student: ``Excuse me, but didn't Talbott write the first \n     memo to Secretary of State Christopher opposing NATO \n     expansion, because. . . .''\n       Bernard Shaw: ``Sorry to interrupt. We've got to close.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the National Interest--Spring 1998]\n\n                    The Dangers of Expansive Realism\n\n       I read your article [Owen Harries, ``The Dangers of \n     Expansive Realism'', Winter 1997/98] with strong approval. It \n     was in some respects a surprise because certain of your major \n     arguments were ones I myself had made, or had wanted to make, \n     but had not expected to see them so well expressed by the pen \n     of anyone else. I can perhaps make this clear by commenting \n     specifically on certain of your points.\n       First, your reference to the implicit understanding that \n     the West would not take advantage of the Russian strategic \n     and political withdrawal from Eastern Europe is not only \n     warranted, but could have been strengthened. It is my \n     understanding that Gorbachev on more than one occasion was \n     given to understand, in informal talks with senior American \n     and other Western personalities, that if the USSR would \n     accept a united Germany remaining in NATO, the jurisdiction \n     of that alliance would not be moved further eastward. We did \n     not, I am sure, intend to trick the Russians; but the actual \n     determinants of our later behavior--lack of coordination of \n     political with military policy, and the amateurism of later \n     White House diplomacy--would scarcely have been more \n     creditable on our part than a real intention to deceive.\n       Secondly, I could not associate myself more strongly with \n     what you write about the realist case that sees Russia as an \n     inherently and incorrigibly expansionist country, and suggest \n     that this tendency marks the present Russian regime no less \n     than it did the Russian regimes of the past. We have seen \n     this view reflected time and again, occasionally in even more \n     violent forms, in efforts to justify the recent expansion of \n     NATO's boundaries and further possible expansions of that \n     name. So numerous and extensive have the distortions and \n     misunderstandings on which this view is based been that it \n     would be hard even to list them in a letter of this sort. It \n     grossly oversimplifies and misconstrues must of the history \n     of Russian diplomacy of the czarist period. It ignores the \n     whole great complexity of Russia's part in World War II. It \n     allows and encourages one to forget that the Soviet military \n     advances into Western Europe during the last war took place \n     with our enthusiastic approval, and the political ones of the \n     ensuing period at least wit hour initial consent and support. \n     It usually avoids mention of the Communist period, and \n     attributes to ``the Russians'' generally all the excesses of \n     the Soviet domination of Eastern Europe in the Cold War \n     period.\n       Worst of all, it tends to equate, at least by implication, \n     the Russian-Communist dictatorship of recent memory with the \n     present Russian republic--a republic, the product of an \n     amazingly bloodless revolution, which has, for all its many \n     faults, succeeded in carrying on for several years with an \n     elected government, a largely free press and media, without \n     concentration camps or executions, and with a minimum of \n     police brutality. This curious present Russia, we are asked \n     to believe, is obsessed by the same dreams of conquest and \n     oppression of others as were the worst examples, real or \n     imaginative, of its predecessors.\n       You, I think, were among the first, if not indeed the \n     first, to bring some of the above to the attention of your \n     readers; and this, in my opinion, was an important and \n     valuable service.\n                                                 George F. Kennan,\n                                            Princeton, New Jersey.\n\n              [From the National Interest--Winter 1997/98]\n\n                    The Dangers of Expansive Realism\n\n                           (By Owen Harries)\n\n     . . . it is sometimes necessary to repeat what all know. All \n     mapmakers should place the Mississippi in the same location \n     and avoid originality. It may be boring, but one has to know \n     where it is. We cannot have the Mississippi flowing toward \n     the Rockies, just for a change.\n                               --Saul Bellow, Mr. Sammler's Planet\n       In many ways NATO is a boring organization. It is a thing \n     of acronyms, jargon, organizational charts, arcane strategic \n     doctrines, and tried rhetoric. But there is no gainsaying \n     that it has a Mississippi-like centrality and importance in \n     American foreign policy. When, then, proposals are made to \n     change it radically--to give it new (and very different) \n     members, new purposes, new ways of conducting business, new \n     non-totalitarian enemies (or, conversely, to dispense \n     altogether with the concept of enemies as a rationale)--it is \n     sensible to pay close attention and to scrutinize carefully \n     and repeatedly the arguments that bolster those proposals. \n     Even at the risk of making NATO boring in new ways, it is \n     important to get things rights.\n       Before getting down to particular arguments, the proposed \n     expansion of NATO into Central and Eastern Europe should be \n     placed in the wider context that made it an issue. For nearly \n     half a century the United States and its allies fought the \n     Cold War, not, it was always insisted, against Russia and the \n     Russian people, but against the Soviet regime and the \n     ideology it represented. An implicit Western objective in the \n     Cold War was the conversion of Russia from totalitarianism to \n     a more or less normal state, and, if possible, to democracy.\n       Between 1989 and 1991, a political miracle occurred. The \n     Soviet regime, steeped in blood and obsessed with total \n     control as it had been throughout most of its history, \n     voluntarily gave up its Warsaw Pact empire,\n\n[[Page S1285]]\n\n     collapsed the Soviet system upon itself, and then acquiesced \n     in its own demise--all with virtually no violence. This \n     extraordinary sequence of events was by no means inevitable. \n     Had it so chosen, the regime could have resisted the force of \n     change as it had on previous occasions, thus either extending \n     its life, perhaps for decades more, or going down in a welter \n     of blood and destruction. That, indeed, would have been more \n     normal behavior, for as the English scholar Martin Wight once \n     observed, ``Great power status is lost, as it is won, by \n     violence. A Great Power does not die in its bed.'' What \n     occurred in the case of the Soviet Union was very much the \n     exception.\n       A necessary condition for its being so was an \n     understanding--explicit according to some, but in any case \n     certainly implicit--that the West would not take strategic \n     and political advantage of what the Soviet Union was allowing \n     to happen to its empire and to itself. Whatever it said now, \n     such a bargain was assumed by both sides, for it was evident \n     to all involved that in its absence--if, that is, it had \n     become apparent that the West was intent on exploiting any \n     retreat by Moscow--events would not be allowed to proceed \n     along the liberalizing course that they actually took. \n     Further, there seemed to be basis for the United States \n     objecting to such a bargain. For after all, its avowed \n     objective was not the eastward extension of its own power and \n     influence in Europe, but the restoration of the independence \n     of the countries of the region. In effect, the bargain gave \n     the United States everything it wanted (more, in fact, for \n     the breakup of the Soviet Union had never been a Cold War \n     objective), and in return required it only to refrain from \n     doing what it had never expressed any intention of doing.\n       Now, and very much at the initiative of the United States, \n     the West is in the process of reneging on that implicit \n     bargain by extending NATO into countries recently vacated by \n     Moscow. It is an ominous step, Whatever is said, however \n     ingenious and vigorous the attempts to obscure the facts or \n     change the subject, NATO is a military alliance, the most \n     powerful in the history of the world, and the United States \n     is the dominant force in that alliance. And whatever is \n     claimed about spreading democracy, making Europe ``whole'', \n     promoting stability, peacekeeping, and righting past \n     injustices--all formulations that serve, either consciously \n     or inadvertently, to divert attention from the political and \n     strategic reality of what is now occurring--cannot succeed in \n     obscuring the truth that the eastward extension of NATO will \n     represent an unprecedented projection of American power into \n     a sensitive region hitherto beyond its reach. It will \n     constitute a veritable geopolitical revolution. It is not \n     necessary to accept in its entirety the resonant but \n     overwrought dictum of Sir Halford Mackinder (``Who rules East \n     Europe commands the Heartland; Who rules the Heartland \n     commands the World Island; Who rules the World Island \n     commands the World'') to recognize the profound strategic \n     implications of what the U.S. Senate is being asked to \n     endorse.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ When I wrote this, I thought that I was drawing attention \n     to something that was implicit but unacknowledged in the \n     policy of NATO expansion. But in his latest book, Zbigniew \n     Brzezinski directly and honestly links American primacy to \n     ``preponderance on the Eurasian continent.'' In the same \n     chapter he quotes Mackinder's dictum. See The Grand \n     Chessboard (New York: Basic Books, 1997), chapter 2.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Why is the Clinton administration acting in this way? And--\n     a different question--does it serve American interests that \n     it is doing so, and that its expressed intention is to \n     proceed much further along the same path?\n       Immediately after the end of the Cold War there was no \n     great enthusiasm either in America or Western Europe for \n     enlarging NATO. In the early days of the Clinton \n     administration, Secretary of State Warren Christopher, \n     Secretary of Defense Les Aspin, and Ambassador-at-Large \n     Strobe Talbott were all opposed to it.\n       How, then, did it come about that by the beginning of 1994 \n     President Clinton was declaring that ``the question is no \n     longer whether NATO will take on new members, but when and \n     how''? It was certainly not by a process of ratiocination, \n     vigorous debate, and the creation of an intellectual \n     consensus concerning interests, purposes, and means. To this \n     day there is no such consensus, and no coherent case for NATO \n     expansion on which all of its principal supporters agree.\n\n\n                        how enlargement happened\n\n       The Clinton administration's conversion from indifference, \n     or even skepticism, to insistence on NATO expansion was the \n     result of a combination of disparate events and pressures:\n       The strength of the Polish-American vote, as well as that \n     of other Americans of Central and East European origin.\n       The enormous vested interests--careers, contracts, \n     consultancies, accumulated expertise--represented by the NATO \n     establishment, which now needed a new reason and purpose to \n     justify the organization's continued existence.\n       The ``moral'' pressure exerted by East European leaders, \n     for whom NATO membership is principally important as a symbol \n     that they are fully European, and as a means of back door \n     entry into the European Union.\n       Conversely, the growing eagerness of some West European \n     governments to grant these states membership of NATO as an \n     acceptable price for keeping them out of, or at least \n     delaying their entry into, the European Union.\n       The concern and self-distrust felt by some Germans, and not \n     least by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, at the prospect of their \n     country's being left on the eastern frontier of NATO, \n     adjacent to an area of political weakness and potential \n     instability.\n       Growing doubts about democracy's prospect of success in \n     Russia, and fear of the reemergence of an assertive \n     nationalism there.\n       The need of some American conservative intellectuals for a \n     bold foreign policy stroke to ``remoralize'' their own ranks \n     after some dispiriting domestic defeats, the enthusiasm of \n     others for ``a democratic crusade'' in Central and Eastern \n     Europe, and the difficulty of yet others to break a \n     lifetime's habit of regarding Moscow as the enemy.\n       Formidable as this combination of pressures was, it is \n     doubtful that it would have been capable of converting the \n     Clinton administration on NATO expansion were it not for the \n     addition of one other crucial factor: Bosnia. The war in \n     Bosnia focused American attention on post-Cold War Central \n     Europe, and it did so in a most emotional way. Bosnia also \n     raised in acute form the question of the future of NATO, as \n     the alliance's feeble response to the crisis cast doubt on \n     its continued viability, and it raised the question \n     specifically in the context of instability in Central and \n     Eastern Europe. The domino theory, forgotten for two decades, \n     was quickly resurrected and applied. ``Bosnia'' was \n     increasingly understood not as referring to a discrete event \n     but as a metaphor for the chronic, historically ordained \n     instability of a whole region.\n\n\n                       russia is russia is russia\n\n       Taken together, these pressures were politically \n     formidable, especially for an administration as sensitive to \n     pressure as was Clinton's. But they had very little to do \n     with America's national interests, and the administration's \n     subsequent attempts to make a case for NATO's eastward \n     expansion in terms of those interests have been perfunctory \n     and shallow. A much more serious attempt has been made \n     outside the administration, mainly by commentators of a \n     realist persuasion. The case they have made, however, is \n     badly flawed.\n       The realist case is based largely on the conviction that \n     Russia is inherently and incorrigibly expansionist, \n     regardless of how and by whom it is governed. Kissinger has \n     warned of ``the fateful rhythm of Russian history.'' Zbigniew \n     Brzezinski emphasizes the centrality in Russia's history of \n     ``the imperial impulse'' and claims that in post-communist \n     Russia that impulse ``remains strong and even appears to be \n     strengthening.'' Thus Brzezinski sees an ``unfortunate \n     continuity'' between the Soviet era and today in defining \n     national interests and formulating foreign policy. Another \n     realist, Peter Rodman, speaks in the same vein, explaining \n     the ``lengthening shadow of Russian strength'' by asserting \n     that ``Russia is a force of nature.''\n       In arguing in this way, these commentators are being very \n     true to their realist position. But they are also drawing \n     attention to what is one of the most serious intellectual \n     weaknesses of that position--namely, that in its stress on \n     the structure of the international system and on how states \n     are placed within that system, realism attaches little or no \n     importance to what is going on inside particular states: what \n     kind of regimes are in power, what kind of ideologies \n     prevail, what kind of leadership is provided. For these \n     realists, Russia is Russia is Russia, regardless of whether \n     it is under czarist, communist, or nascent democratic rule.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n\n                             ends and means\n\n       Another of the central tenets of realism is that if the end \n     is willed, so should be the means. The two should be kept in \n     balance, preferably, as Walter Lippmann urged, ``with a \n     comfortable surplus of power in reserve.'' In the case of \n     NATO expansion, this tenet is being ignored. The NATO members \n     are moving to assume very large additional commitments at a \n     time when they have all made substantial cuts to their \n     defense budgets, and when more such cuts are virtually \n     certain. (The French Cabinet, for example, announced in \n     August that the military draft, which dates back two \n     centuries, is to be phased out and that defense procurement \n     expenditure is to be cut by 11 percent.) The irresponsibility \n     of such a course of action raises the question of the \n     seriousness of the new commitments being undertaken. After \n     all, such pledges have been made in the past, only to be \n     broken: Munich, 1938, was the last occasion on which Western \n     powers guaranteed the security of what is today the Czech \n     Republic.\n       It is not only in terms of power that realists should be \n     concerned with the balancing of ends and means. They should \n     also consider the suitability of the instruments involved--\n     particularly the human instruments--for the tasks at hand. \n     Not to do so is likely to result in the sort of unpleasant \n     surprise that some realist supporters of NATO expansion got \n     as a result of the March 1997 Helsinki summit. At that \n     meeting, so many concessions were made to Moscow by the \n     Clinton administration that we now have an almost lunatic \n     state of affairs: in order to make acceptable the expanding \n     of NATO to contain a potentially dangerous Russia, we are \n     coming close to making Russia an honorary member of NATO, \n     with something approximating veto power.\n       Some of the initially most ardent supporters of expansion \n     are now deeply dismayed by\n\n[[Page S1286]]\n\n     these developments. But surely the likelihood of such an \n     outcome was foreseeable. After all, they knew from the start \n     that the policy they were pushing would be negotiated not by \n     a Talleyrand or a Metternich--or an Acheson or a Kissinger--\n     but by Bill Clinton, the man who feels everyone's pain. \n     Kissinger has been clear-eyed enough to label what happened \n     at Helsinki a fiasco.\n       This image of a Europe ``made whole'' again after the \n     division of the Cold War is one that the advocates of NATO \n     expansion appeal to frequently. But it is not a convincing \n     appeal. For one thing, coming from some mouths it tends to \n     bring to mind Bismarck's comment: ``I have always found the \n     word Europe on the lips of those politicians who wanted \n     something from other Powers which they dared not demand in \n     their own name.'' For another, it invites the question of \n     when exactly was the last time that Europe was ``whole.'' In \n     the 1930s, when the dictators were on the rampage? In the \n     1920s, when Germany and Russia were virtual non-actors? In \n     1910, when Europe was an armed camp and a furious arms race \n     was in progress? In the 1860s, when Prussia was creating an \n     empire with ``blood and iron''? When exactly? And then there \n     is the simple and undeniable fact that at every step of the \n     way--and regardless of how many tranches of new members are \n     taken in--the line dividing Europe will not be eliminated but \n     simply moved to a different place. Only if Russia itself were \n     to be included would Europe be ``whole.'' Anyone who doubts \n     this should consult an atlas.\n       One final note: During the last few months advocates of \n     expansion have been resorting more and more to an argument of \n     last resort--one of process, not of substance. It is that the \n     United States is now so far committed that it is too late to \n     turn back. That argument is not without some merit, for \n     prestige does count, and undoubtedly prestige would be lost \n     by a reversal at this stage. But that granted, prestige is \n     not everything. When the alternative is to persist in serious \n     error it may be necessary to sacrifice some prestige early, \n     rather than much more later. To proceed resolutely down a \n     wrong road--especially one that has a slippery slope--is not \n     statesmanship. After all, the last time the argument that is \n     too late to turn back prevailed was exactly thirty years ago, \n     as, without clear purpose, we were advancing deeper and \n     deeper into Vietnam.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the New York Times, February 5, 1997]\n\n A Fateful Error--Expanding NATO Would Be a Rebuff to Russian Democracy\n\n                         (By George F. Kennan)\n\n       In late 1996, the impression was allowed, or caused, to \n     become prevalent that it had been somehow and somewhere \n     decided to expand NATO up to Russia's borders. This despite \n     the fact that no formal decision can be made before the \n     alliance's next summit meeting in June.\n       The timing of this revelation--coinciding with the \n     Presidential election and the pursuant changes in responsible \n     personalities in Washington--did not make it easy for the \n     outsider to know how or where to insert a modest word of \n     comment. Nor did the assurance given to the public that the \n     decision, however preliminary, was irrevocable encourage \n     outside opinion.\n       But something of the highest importance is at stake here. \n     And perhaps it is not too late to advance a view that, I \n     believe, is not only mine alone but is shared by a number of \n     others with extensive and in most instances more recent \n     experience in Russian matters. The view, bluntly stated, is \n     that expanding NATO would be the most fateful error of \n     American policy in the entire post-cold-war era.\n       Such a decision may be expected to inflame the \n     nationalistic, anti-Western and militaristic tendencies in \n     Russian opinion; to have an adverse effect on the development \n     of Russian democracy; to restore the atmosphere of the cold \n     war to East-West relations, and to impel Russian foreign \n     policy in directions decidedly not to our liking. And, last \n     but not least, it might make it much more difficult, if not \n     impossible, to secure the Russian Duma's ratification of the \n     Start II agreement and to achieve further reductions of \n     nuclear weaponry.\n       It is, of course, unfortunate that Russia should be \n     confronted with such a challenge at a time when its executive \n     power is in a state of high uncertainty and near-paralysis. \n     And it is doubly unfortunate considering the total lack of \n     any necessity for this move. Why, with all the hopeful \n     possibilities engendered by the end of the cold war, should \n     East-West relations become centered on the question of who \n     would be allied with whom and, by implication, against whom \n     in some fanciful, totally unforeseeable and most improbable \n     future military conflict?\n       I am aware, of course, that NATO is conducting talks with \n     the Russian authorities in hopes of making the idea of \n     expansion tolerable and palatable to Russia. One can, in the \n     existing circumstances, only wish these efforts success. But \n     anyone who gives serious attention to the Russian press \n     cannot fail to note that neither the public nor the \n     Government is waiting for the proposed expansion to occur \n     before reacting to it.\n       Russians are little impressed with American assurances that \n     it reflects no hostile intentions. They would see their \n     prestige (always uppermost in the Russian mind) and their \n     security interests as adversely affected. They would, of \n     course, have no choice but to accept expansion as a military \n     fait accompli. But they would continue to regard it as a \n     rebuff by the West and would likely look elsewhere for \n     guarantees of a secure and hopeful future for themselves.\n       It will obviously not be easy to change a decision already \n     made or tacitly accepted by the alliance's 16 member \n     countries. But there are a few intervening months before the \n     decision is to be made final; perhaps this period can be used \n     to alter the proposed expansion in ways that would mitigate \n     the unhappy effects it is already having on Russian opinion \n     and policy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/03/senate-section/article/S1283-3", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            PEACE CORPS DAY\n\n Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge \nMarch 3 as Peace Corps Day, celebrating the 37th anniversary this past \nSunday of President Kennedy signing the legislation that created the \nPeace Corps on March 1, 1961. As a former Director of the Peace Corps I \nwant to pay tribute to that organization as an example of Americans at \ntheir best.\n  Since 1961, more than 150,000 Americans from all across the nation \nhave served in the Peace Corps in over 132 countries. Today nearly \n6,500 volunteers currently serve in the 84 countries, addressing \ncritical development needs on a person-to-person level, helping \ncommunities gain access to clean water; grow more food; prevent the \nspread of AIDS; teach English, math, and science; help entrepreneurs \nstart new businesses; and work to protect the environment.\n  Peace Corps volunteers have improved the lives of many people abroad \nduring their terms of service. They have rightly earned great respect \nand admiration for the American people and for American values. But \nthey have also brought the benefits of their experience home and \ncontinued to contribute to their own communities and to our nation as \nvolunteers and in leadership positions. Returned Peace Corps volunteers \nfind their experience, their knowledge of other cultures, and the self-\nassurance they gain stand them in good stead in their own careers. But \nthey also share the benefits of their time in the Peace Corps with many \nothers. We call this the ``Domestic Dividend.''\n  To commemorate Peace Corps Day, more than 5,000 current and returned \nvolunteers will go back to school today to speak with students about \ntheir overseas experiences, some via satellite or phone, but most in \nperson. This is part of the agency's global education program ``World \nWise Schools.'' Today more than 350,000 students in all 50 states will \nlearn about life in communities of the developing world by talking the \nvolunteers who have lived there. For example, Peace Corps Volunteer Amy \nMedley will get to talk to her pen pals from Walden Middle School in \nAtlanta, Georgia for the first time. She will be calling from Africa, \nwhere she is currently serving as a science teacher in Eritrea.\n  As we celebrate today, interest in the Peace Corps is growing. In \n1997 more than 150,000 individuals contacted the Peace Corps to request \ninformation on serving as a volunteer, an increase of more than 40 \npercent since 1994. In view of this interest and the tremendous success \nand record of the Peace Corps, President Clinton has called for an \nexpansion of the Peace Corps in his 1999 budget, putting the agency on \na path to fielding 10,000 volunteers in the year 2000. This is a \nrequest and a goal I strongly support.\n  Mr. President, for 37 years, the Peace Corps has extended a helping \nhand to the world and Peace Corps volunteers have demonstrated in \ncountless ways the generosity and dedication to service that is so much \na part of the American character. So I will take this opportunity to \nsalute all of our Peace Corps volunteers, past and present, and to \nthank them for their service. We appreciate all they have done and \ncontinue to do and I look forward to seeing the Peace Corps continue \nits outstanding record of service into the 21st Century. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/03/senate-section/article/S1286-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1286-S1287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                COMMEMORATION OF CHIEF A. MARVIN GIBBONS\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I had the honor of joining with \nMrs. Mary Anne Gibbons, a number of firefighters from the State of \nMaryland, the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation, the United \nStates Fire Administration, and others in dedicating the National \nFallen Firefighters Memorial Chapel in commemoration of Chief A. Marvin \nGibbons.\n\n[[Page S1287]]\n\n  As I mentioned in Emmitsburg, Mrs. Gibbons is doing a terrific job in \nher position as a member of the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation \nboard--carrying on the good work for which we honored her husband--and \nwe are extremely grateful for her continued contributions in this area.\n  I also made mention during the ceremony of the many accomplishments \nof the ``Big Chief,'' as Chief Gibbons was affectionately known by his \nmany friends and associates. I wanted to make his legacy a part of the \nCongressional Record because throughout his life, I think he embodied \nthe qualities which make our firefighters heroes, leaders, and role \nmodels.\n  Ever since I grew up, two blocks from the fire house in Salisbury, I \nhave always held a deep and abiding respect for the men and women of \nthe fire service. This is not simply because of the willingness of fire \nfighters to put their lives on the line every day, but also because \nthey tend to do their jobs with kindness and an infallible commitment \nto serving the citizens of their communities. Indeed, there are few \npersons more deserving of our respect and admiration than those who \nserve as fire fighters and first responders.\n  I have long felt that Americans do not pause often enough to consider \nthe critical importance of the work that firefighters do--to appreciate \ntheir sacrifice and the contribution which they make to our nation. \nThroughout his life, Chief Gibbons not only personified the best of \nwhat it means to be a firefighter and a public servant, but he also \nshowed a strong commitment to ensuring that firefighters receive the \nrecognition they richly deserve.\n  This past weekend's dedication ceremony was indeed a fitting tribute \nto Chief Gibbons' 42 years of lasting contributions to the fire \nservice. I want to again touch on one of the contributions he made on a \nnational level which is of particular interest to me. As most who are \ninvolved in the fire service know, it was Marvin Gibbons who helped \nensure that the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial was located in \nEmmitsburg, Maryland on the beautiful campus of the National Fire \nAcademy. And it was his vision which led to the unveiling of this \nmonument and the first annual National Memorial Service held at \nEmmitsburg in 1982.\n  I was proud to introduce and push to enact the legislation that made \nthe Emmitsburg site the official National Memorial to all firefighters. \nAnd in 1990, I spoke at the dedication marking the official recognition \nof the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial where I recall quoting an \neditorial from the Carroll County Times entitled ``Firefighters \nMemorial: An Important Reminder.'' I want to again just quote briefly \nfrom it, because I think this editorial reflects what Chief Gibbons was \nstriving to accomplish in establishing the memorial and an annual \nceremony in honor of our nation's fallen firefighters:\n\n       We take many aspects of life for granted. Not thinking \n     about a service until we need it is an easy way to think . . \n     . But how often do we consider that at a moment's notice, our \n     fire fighters will risk their lives for us? Until the tragedy \n     of fire or some other emergency strikes, we hardly consider \n     it at all.\n\n  Mr. President, behind each name engraved in Emmitsburg is a story--a \nstory of courage, dedication and service to others--and I should \nmention that we are working to expand the National Memorial site there \nto ensure that it continues to serve as a lasting tribute to our \nfirefighters.\n  The National Fallen Firefighters Foundation is responsible for the \nNational Memorial Service each year so that as a nation we will never \nforget the sacrifice that these brave men and women make in protecting \nus every day. With the dedication of the National Fallen Firefighters \nMemorial Chapel in his memory, we hope to ensure that the legacy of A. \nMarvin Gibbons and his commitment to the fire service will also never \nbe forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/03/senate-section/article/S1286-2", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    COMMENDING PAT SUMMITT ON MAKING THE COVER OF SPORTS ILLUSTRATED\n\n Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, today I wish to take note of a \nwoman of character and accomplishment who has recently been recognized \nin a unique and public way for her outstanding talent and tireless \nwork. University of Tennessee Lady Vols Basketball Coach Pat Summitt is \non the cover of the March 2, 1998 issue of Sports Illustrated, and I \ncan't think of a better choice. On the caption of the cover, it asks \nwhat Coach Summitt's place in basketball history might be, and suggests \nthat she is perhaps the greatest college basketball coach of all time. \nMr. President, I think that's a pretty accurate assessment.\n  As I have pointed out with more than a little pride before to the \nSenate, the Lady Vols have taken home the national championship trophy \nthe last two years in a row, and five years out of the last eleven. \nEvery one of those victories was both hard-fought and well-deserved, \nand Coach Summitt was always at the helm. In Tennessee, we're all very \nproud of what she's done, and fans everywhere have come to appreciate \njust how much of the success of women's basketball is owed to her \nefforts. She has helped to make women's basketball a major interest of \nsports fans, and she has helped create a great deal of opportunity for \nyoung scholar-athletes.\n  Coach Summitt has never let ``no'' stand in the way of getting what \nshe wanted. As the Sports Illustrated article tells it, Pat grew up on \na farm where she learned to work hard and stick to a job until it was \ndone--and done right. Later, after a potentially career-ending knee \ninjury, she defied the odds and the predictions of her doctors not only \nto play again but to join the 1976 Women's Olympic Basketball team as \nthe oldest player, and come home with a Silver Medal.\n  Her rise is impressive. She was made head coach at age 22 at the \nUniversity of Tennessee while she was finishing a graduate degree. And \nshe rose to the task, doing more than she had to do in all her jobs. \nAnybody else might have settled for second best under the workload. Not \nPat. She wanted to succeed. Pat didn't just show up for practice and \nblow the whistle while the players ran laps. She built the women's \nprogram from nearly the ground up. She drove the team to and from \ngames, she made sure everyone had uniforms and towels, she swept the \nfloor and she looked after her players' injuries. And she finished her \ndegree. Pat did it all, and her dedication has paid off.\n  Pat has spoiled us in Tennessee. We're more accustomed than most to \nwinning the big games. But as long as Pat's in charge, and as long as \nshe keeps bringing in the best young players out there and bringing out \ntheir potential, I think we can look forward to a long run of great \nteams, first-rate competition and championship seasons. So I am pleased \nthat Sports Illustrated has acknowledged what so many of us already \nknow. She's on the cover--for anyone involved in athletics, this is one \nof those moments that you never forget.\n  Mr. President, we are proud of Coach Pat Summitt in Tennessee. We're \nhonored to see her on the cover of Sports Illustrated. She deserves \nthis recognition and I send along my best wishes to her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/03/senate-section/article/S1287-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1287-S1288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  COMMENDING PRIDE ANTI-DRUG GROUP FOR REPRESENTING U.S. AT UN MEETING\n\n Mr. COVERDELL.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nMayor Ernest Thompson who has announced his retirement after 26 years \nas Mayor of Artesia, New Mexico. I am proud to honor this great New \nMexican, who personifies leadership and commitment to public service \nand to his community.\n  Mr. Thompson was first elected Mayor of Artesia in 1972 and has \nserved continually for seven terms since then. A lot has changed in \nArtesia since Mayor Thompson was first elected. He remembers that when \nhe first started, the city had no money for some of the most basic \nmunicipal necessities. For example, he remembers that the garbage \ntrucks didn't even have doors.\n  Mayor Thompson has helped to turn the city around. Under him, the \ncity's equipment has been improved, new construction has been started, \nand Artesia's economy has flourished. During his tenure, Mayor Thompson \nhas been pivotal in bringing the Federal Law Enforcement Training \nCenter to Artesia, in improving the conditions of the streets and parks \nand in the creation of Artesia's industrial park, police and fire \nstations, a retard dam, and many other projects important to the \ncommunity of Artesia.\n  Mayor Thompson has not only been an active mayor for Artesia; he has \nalso served in many other leadership roles. He has been a member of the \nNational League of Cities, Southeastern New Mexico Economic Development \nDistrict, and the New Mexico Municipal League, for which he has served \nas President, and as well as First and Second Vice President\n  He is also a tireless contributor to community organizations. He has \nserved as president of the Artesia Rotary Club, the New Mexico Gideons, \nthe Artesia Quarterback Club, and the Parents and Boosters Clubs. He is \nthe Finance Chairman for the First Methodist Church of Artesia and has \na 46 year association with the Boy Scouts of America, for which he has \nserved as everything from Cub Master to District Chairman. He is also \nthe recipient of the Boy Scouts' Silver Beaver Award.\n  Mayor Thompson has been involved in so much as Mayor that we are \nthankful for, but he would probably say his greatest accomplishment is \nhis marriage of over 55 years to his wife, Grace. Together, they have \none son and two grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to personally \nthank Earnest Thompson for his years of dedication. New Mexico will \nmiss his tireless service and we all wish him and his family the best \nin the coming years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/03/senate-section/article/S1288-5", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1288-S1289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RETIRING ARTESIA MAYOR ERNEST THOMPSON\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a man \nwho is an accomplished public servant and friend--Ernest Thompson, \nmayor for the City of Artesia, New Mexico. On March 3, Mayor Thompson \nretires after guiding this southeastern New Mexico community for the \npast 26 years.\n  Without any hesitation, it can be said that Artesia, the self-\nproclaimed ``City of Champions,'' is a better place to live because of \nErnest Thompson.\n  I want to personally thank Mayor Thompson for being a friend and \ncompatriot over the years. He ascended to the mayorship of Artesia in \n1972, the same year I was elected to the U.S. Senate. Since then, we \nhave developed a very good personal and working relationship that I \nbelieve has been as rewarding to the people of Artesia as it has been \nto us personally.\n  Having once been in a mayoral position myself, I recognize Mayor \nThompson's 26 years of public service as an example for anyone who \nwants to be in politics at the local level. His tenure represents a \nshining example of dedication, persistence, hard work, honesty and \nintegrity.\n  Like the artesian wells that were once common in the area, Artesians\n\n[[Page S1289]]\n\nhave a certain pride in their community that bubbles to the surface \nwhen they look at their past and to the future of their city. They are \nproud of the steady growth of their quaint town, its schools, and its \nbedrock values. In many cases, Ernest Thompson has helped foster that \npride through his tenacious leadership.\n  When he leaves office this spring, he will leave to his successor a \ncity with greater economic growth and job opportunities, better roads \nand infrastructure, and increased services for children and seniors. \nThrough booms and busts over the past quarter century, Ernest Thompson \nhas been a staunch promoter and champion of Artesia, and a stalwart \ndefender for the rights and needs of small towns throughout the \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, let me take a moment to recount some background on my \nadmirable friend, Ernest Thompson.\n  A native of central Texas, Ernest Thompson moved to Artesia in 1939 \nto work in the oil and gas industry, which is a major component of the \neconomy in this region. After decades of work and dedication to his \nfamily, he retired from his job as a purchasing agent with Navajo \nRefining Company in Artesia.\n  Without previous political experience, Thompson was elected mayor of \nArtesia in 1972, and has maintained a dynamic presence in the community \nas a member of the Artesia Rotary Club, New Mexico Gideons, Artesia \nQuarterback Club, and the Parents and Boosters Club. For almost 50 \nyears, he has been actively involved in promoting the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica in southeast New Mexico.\n  But I believe his most notable contributions to the public have been \nas mayor. As Artesia has grown, Ernest Thompson has helped to improve \nthe city as a whole. Since 1972, the city has gained extensive \ninfrastructure improvements including a new wastewater treatment plant, \nwater lines, flood protection structures, and street improvements. \nUnder his administration, the city built a new law enforcement center, \nan airport terminal, a community center, as well as new fire stations. \nArtesia's public library and senior center have been expanded and \nremodeled.\n  Through it all, Ernest Thompson has worked effectively at state and \nfederal levels to win support for his city. As a member of the \nSoutheast New Mexico Economic Development District, he has toiled to \nbuild the area as a whole. A member of the National League of Cities \nsince 1973, Mayor Thompson rallied for towns with fewer than 50,000 \nresidents as president of the Small Cities Advisory Council. He is a \nmember of the League's Finance, Administration, and Intergovernmental \nRelations Committee.\n  It is through this work to improve the City of Champions that Mayor \nThompson and I have become friends.\n  I take pride in having played a role in winning for Artesia the \nFederal Law Enforcement Training Center. I greatly admire city leaders \nwho are innovative in creating opportunities to bring good jobs to \ntheir community. Mayor Thompson, with the support of the city \ncounselors, county commission and citizens of Artesia, exhibited such \ninnovation in attracting FLETC to the city in 1989. He greatly helped \nin my efforts to convince the Treasury Department that Artesia would \nmake an attractive host city for the training facility.\n  Almost 10 years after we landed FLETC, I am still impressed with the \ninnovation displayed by Mayor Thompson and the community to bring \nopportunity to the area. Buying the abandoned Artesia Christian College \ncampus and actively working to find a suitable tenant--in this case a \nFLETC satellite facility--added a new and welcome facet to the area \neconomy.\n  Taken as a whole, FLETC and other accomplishments will stand as a \nmonument to the 26 years of leadership provided by Mayor Thompson. I \nwill always admire him and his qualities as a leader. I do not say \ngoodbye, but congratulations and thank you. I still look forward to his \nsage advice and discussions about Artesia, Eddy County, New Mexico and \nour nation.\n  Finally, I think it is appropriate to note that while Ernest Thompson \nwas working as Artesia's mayor, he was at the same time a dedicated \nhusband and father. I know his dear wife, Grace, is thankful for his \nlove, dedication and care during personally trying times. Together they \nare a marvelous couple.\n  Mr. President, I invite the entire Senate to take note of this \ntribute to an outstanding local leader as he retires from public \noffice. I ask them to join me and the people of Artesia in expressing \ngratitude to Mayor Ernest Thompson for all he has done on behalf of \nothers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/03/senate-section/article/S1288-6", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1289-S1290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      MARKET POWER AND STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would like to comment on the hearing held \nearlier today by the Senate Judiciary Committee on ``Market Power and \nStructural Change in the Software Industry.''\n  First, I would like to commend Chairman Hatch for holding this \nimportant hearing and for his leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. President, today's creative and innovative software products \nenable us to bank, conduct research, shop and even trade securities \nonline. And this is just the beginning. It is important therefore, that \nsuch a vast and essential resource be allowed to grow and expand in a \nfair and competitive environment. But recent events had threatened to \ncase clouds over this most fundamental premise. Let me explain.\n  On October 20, 1997 Attorney General Reno announced that the \nDepartment of Justice would ask a federal judge to order the Microsoft \nCorporation to cease its practice of forcing manufacturers to sell its \ninternet browser, Internet Explorer, with its widely used operating \nsystem, Windows 95. The U.S. District Court here in Washington, D.C. \nagreed, and on December 11, 1997 ruled that, pending further \nproceedings, Microsoft could not require purchasers of its operating \nsystem software to install its browser software.\n  In response to the Court's December 1997 ruling, Microsoft offered \ncomputer makers three options: (1) a version of Windows which Microsoft \nbelieved did not function; (2) a version of Windows which was more than \ntwo years out of date and no longer commercially viable; or, (3) \nWindows 95 bundled with Internet Explorer.\n  Thanks to the Department of Justice's continuing efforts, however, \nthe storm clouds which had threatened an open and competitive market \nfor internet browser software, now appear to be fading. On January 22, \n1998, the Department of Justice and Microsoft reached an agreement in \nwhich Microsoft agreed to offer computer manufacturers a version of \nWindows 95 that contained a fully up-to-date operating system without \nits Internet Explorer internet browser.\n  But why should we care about this?\n  We should care about this because the biggest losers, perhaps, of any \nanti-competitive action in the internet browser industry will be the \nmillions of everyday people who rely on the Internet. If one company \ngains such a huge and unfair advantage, other companies will not be \nable to compete; there will be no choices and innovation will be \nstifled.\n  This brings up the issue of ``open standards.'' Open standards on the \nInternet will allow all access to the Internet without having to rely \nupon any one company or any one operating platform. Open standards work \nagainst monopolies, and ultimately benefit the Internet by increasing \ncompetition among software products, resulting in lower prices and a \nwider selection.\n  As a Californian, I am concerned about this issue for yet another \nreason. Cutting-edge software manufacturers from my home state provide \ntens of thousands of people with high-paying jobs, making software \nmanufacturing one of California's most valued industries. Industry \ncompetition is thus vitally important to my state's interest.\n  I appreciate the integral role the Microsoft Corporation has played \nand continues to play in the information age--its contributions have \nbeen most significant and important. It has made computers and computer \napplications more accessible to millions of people around the world, \nand for that, it deserves appropriate recognition and credit. Microsoft \nhas been, and continues to be, the leader in the computer industry. But \nother, smaller, companies must also be given a chance to compete in the \nbest and oldest of American traditions.\n\n[[Page S1290]]\n\n  As we move further and further into the information age, the national \ngovernment must ensure that competition is not eliminated. The \nDepartment of Justice should therefore be commended for acting to \nprotect consumers and businesses alike. Similarly, Microsoft deserves \ncredit for agreeing to settle the issue of bundling its operating \nsystem software with its internet browser software in what the \nDepartment of Justice believed to be a fair and equitable manner. Both \nmade the right call.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/03/senate-section/article/S1289-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SANCTITY OF THE BALLOT\n\n Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, yesterday's Wall Street Journal \nlead editorial entitled ``Sanctity of the Ballot'' should be a wakeup \ncall for America's citizens. Sadly, we can no longer assume public \nofficials tasked with protecting your vote are able to do so. The fact \nis, passage of the Motor Voter Act has led to growing incidences of \nelection fraud in communities large and small, and the problem is \ngetting worse all the time.\n  The editorial highlights an important new national organization, the \nVoting Integrity Project (VIP), which was formed in 1996 in response to \nthe growing abuses highlighted by the Journal. VIP is a non-profit, \nnon-partisan coalition of citizens and civic groups. It organizes and \ntrains citizens to protect the integrity of the vote in their own \ncommunity. It also investigates and litigates important election fraud \ncases, including constitutional issues. It is the only independent, \nnational organization performing this important work.\n  Mr. President, VIP has learned that it is nearly impossible to \noverturn elections once they have been certified and places its \nemphasis accordingly, in pro-active programs run by the citizens \nthemselves. Indeed, American voters need to wake up to the harsh \nreality of today's election process and begin to equip themselves, \nthrough organizations such as VIP, to guard the sanctity of their \ncommunities' elections and their vote.\n  I ask that the text of the editorial be printed in the Record.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 2, 1998]\n\n                         Sanctity of the Ballot\n\n       In a rush to make it as easy as possible for citizens to \n     exercise their right to vote, the country has created lax \n     registration and voting procedures that could call into \n     question a close election any number of states. The 1983 \n     federal Motor Voter law requires states to allow people to \n     register to vote when they get a driver's license, even \n     though 47 states don't require proof of legal US residence \n     much less citizenship for such a license. ``We have the \n     modern world's sloppiest electoral system,'' warns political \n     scientist Walter Dean Burnham.\n       Media and political elites pooh-pooh such concerns, but \n     they are genuine and growing. The House of Representatives \n     has just dismissed an election challenge by former Rep. Bob \n     Dornan of California. But buried in the news that Rep. \n     Loretta Sanchez would keep her seat was the conclusion of a \n     House task force that 748 illegal votes had been cast in an \n     election decided by only 979 votes.\n       The year long investigation established 624 ``documented'' \n     cases of non-citizens voting. Another 124 voters cast \n     improper absentee ballots. An additional 196 votes may well \n     have been illegal, but only circumstantial evidence existed. \n     ``In the end of the day,'' says GOP task force member Rep. \n     Robert Ney, ``Bob Dornan was right--there were illegal \n     voters.'' In the Sanchez race they represented close to 1% of \n     all votes cast. The danger is that if this is tolerated, it \n     will only get worse.\n       In the wake of the Sanchez-Dornan dispute, Rep. Steve Horn, \n     a California Republican, called for a vote on a pilot program \n     to combat fraud in five large states. Local and state \n     officials would be allowed, but not required, to check \n     citizenship records with Social Security and the Immigration \n     and Naturalization Service. If they couldn't verify \n     citizenship, the voter would have to prove his or her status \n     or risk being dropped from the rolls. The program included \n     privacy protections and a requirement that it be ``uniform, \n     nondiscriminatory, and in compliance with the Voting Rights \n     Act of 1965.''\n       This sensible and sensitive proposal doesn't unduly trample \n     on immigrant rights. Almost half the states already ask for \n     all or part of the Social Security number to register to \n     vote. But Democrats, fresh from Ms. Sanchez's triumph, \n     practically accused Rep. Horn of reinventing the poll tax and \n     literacy tests of the Jim Crow era. ``It is a shame, it is a \n     disgrace,'' said Rep. John Lewis, a veteran of the civil \n     rights movement.\n       In the end, the bill won a 210-200 majority, but it failed \n     because it was brought to the floor under a rule requiring a \n     two-thirds majority, Rep. Horn hopes to have a vote under \n     normal rules within a month. He points to a growing body of \n     evidence that the potential for vote fraud is growing, noting \n     some in the shadow of the U.S. Capitol itself.\n       In Washington, D.C. an astonishing one of every six \n     registered voters can't be reached at their address of \n     record. The city has lost 100,000 people since 1980, but \n     registration has shot up to 86% of eligible voters from only \n     58%. Nationally, the average registration rate is only 66%. \n     Felons, dead people, non-residents and fictitious \n     registrations clog the rolls in Washington, where anyone can \n     walk up and vote without showing I.D.\n       Across the Potomac River in Virginia, Robert Beers, the \n     voter registrar of prosperous Fairfax County, says the Motor \n     Voter law has increased the number of registered voters, but \n     turnout has actually fallen in recent elections. ``There is \n     no question in my mind that we have registered people who \n     aren't U.S. citizens,'' Mr. Beers told the Washington Times. \n     ``Nobody worries about the rolls until you get to the \n     election that's decided by three votes. I wish they would pay \n     attention to it before it gets to that point.'' He is backing \n     a state bill to require voters to show some type of photo \n     I.D.\n       Last month Mississippi's legislature passed a motor voter \n     law, but Governor Kirk Fordice issued a veto because it \n     lacked a voter I.D. provision. ``Vote fraud is an equal \n     opportunity election stealer,'' he says. His concerns about \n     improper registrations are echoed elsewhere. The Miami Herald \n     has found that 105 ballots in last year's disputed mayoral \n     election were cast by felons. Last month a local grand jury \n     concluded that ``absentee ballot fraud clearly played an \n     important part in the recent City of Miami elections.'' This \n     ``called into question the legitimacy of the results.''\n       In San Francisco, the Voting Integrity Project has filed \n     suit to overturn a referendum that approved a new stadium. \n     They cite evidence of actions by city and stadium officials \n     to tilt the results toward a pro-stadium vote. The scandal \n     has already been marked by the registrations of the city's \n     election supervisor and Edward DeBartolo, chairman of the San \n     Francisco 49ers.\n       Everyone supports the right to vote, but an equally \n     important right is the guarantee of elections that are fair \n     and free of fraud. Right now a growing number of states can't \n     guarantee the integrity of their results, and that inevitably \n     will lead to an increasing cynicism and disenchantment with \n     the democratic process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/03/senate-section/article/S1290-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1290-S1291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATO EXPANSION AND THE EU\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee has reported the Resolution of Ratification to NATO \nenlargement. It is appropriate at this time to inform my colleagues of \nmy intention to offer a condition to the Resolution of Ratification \nwhen it comes to the Senate for debate linking NATO expansion with \neconomic expansion. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by the \nsenior Senator from Virginia, Senator Warner.\n  The former Majority Leader, Howard Baker, Jr., our colleague Sam \nNunn, Brent Scowcroft, and Alton Frye recently wrote an article for The \nNew York Times in which they assert that ``Linking NATO expansion to \nthe expansion of the European Union would underscore the connection \nbetween Europe's security and its economy--and offer certification that \nentrants to NATO could afford to meet its defense obligations.''\n  It is our contention that Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic \nface no security threats, so strengthening their economies and \ndemocratic institutions should be their first priority.\n  All three of the candidates are eager to join the European Union \n(EU), which has now decided to begin accession negotiations with them. \nNATO's decision at Madrid to invite these countries to negotiate for \nmembership preceded the EU offer to negotiate accession. The EU's offer \naffords the Senate an opportunity to lend support to these countries' \nbid for EU membership, without accepting any presumption that entry \ninto the EU guarantees admission to NATO.\n  A provision to link admission to NATO with admission to the EU will \nencourage expeditious negotiations by the EU, and will allow the three \ncountries to concentrate their full resources on economic \nmodernization, rather than diverting precious resources to military \nexpenditures.\n  I ask that the text of the condition be printed in the Record.\n  The text of the condition follows:\n       At the end of section    of the resolution (relating to \n     conditions), add the following:\n       (  ) Deferral of ratification of nato enlargement until \n     admission of poland, hungary, and czech republic to the \n     european union.--\n       (A) Prohibition.--The President shall not deposit the \n     United States instrument of ratification prior to the latest \n     date by which Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have\n\n[[Page S1291]]\n\n     acceded to membership in the European Union and have each \n     engaged in initial voting participation in an official action \n     of the European Union.\n       (B) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this paragraph may be \n     construed as an expression by the Senate of an intent to \n     accept as a new NATO member any country other than Poland, \n     Hungary, or the Czech Republic if that country becomes a \n     member of the European Union after the date of adoption of \n     this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/03/senate-section/article/S1290-2", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CONGRATULATIONS TO COMMUNITY HOSPITAL AND NURSING HOME OF ANACONDA\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to congratulate \nCommunity Hospital and Nursing Home of Anaconda, Montana, for being \nlisted among the top 100 hospitals in the nation in 1997. The entire \nstaff of Community Hospital, from CEO Sam Allen on down, should be very \nproud of their hard work and success in caring for the Anaconda \ncommunity.\n  This distinction is based on an annual performance measurement \nincluding patient care, operations, and financial management conducted \nby HCIA and William M. Mercer, Inc. The study, 100 Top Hospitals--\nBenchmarks for Success, looked at 1,300 hospitals with fewer than 99 \nacute-care beds, and Community was one of 20 that made the Top 100 from \nthat size category.\n  The performance measures of the Benchmarks for Success are \nobjective--such as risk-adjusted mortality index and expense per \nadjusted discharge (case mix and wage adjusted)--which means that \nCommunity Hospital's success is documented by experts in the field. I \nknow that Community's patients and staff knew this without the \nperformance study, but I point this out because this isn't a typical \naward. Community has built itself into a national model, and for that I \ncongratulate them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/03/senate-section/article/S1291-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1291-S1293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ABRAHAM SPEECH ON BUDGET SURPLUS\n\n Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise to share with my \ncolleagues a speech which I believe provides a number of important \nideas and policy positions we should be discussing as we enter the era \nof budget surpluses.\n  Because of strong economic growth, the Office of Management and \nBudget reports that we will begin running a surplus in 2001, and that \nsurplus will total $447 billion by 2005.\n  In a speech before the Detroit Economic Club on February 17, Senator \nAbraham sought to start a dialogue on how best we as a nation could \napproach the upcoming and unaccustomed circumstance of budget \nsurpluses. In my view he offered excellent suggestions on how to save \nSocial Security, provide comprehensive tax reform and invest in \ninfrastructure and human capital, all within the confines of a limited \nbudget surplus.\n  His specific proposals, limited private investment accounts within \nthe Social Security system, an alternative flat tax and scholarships \nfor low income students entering hi-tech fields, all deserve our \nattention. It is my hope that they will help spur fruitful debate \nconcerning how we can best approach the new century with continued \neconomic growth, expanding opportunity and confidence in our fellow \ncitizens.\n  I ask that Senator Abraham's speech be printed in the Record \nimmediately following my remarks.\n  The speech follows.\n\n               Surplus Politics: What Congress Should Do\n\n                       By Senator Spencer Abraham\n\n       Before I begin today, I would like to say a few words about \n     the situation in Iraq. When I last spoke here a year ago, it \n     was under very different circumstances. Today we face an \n     imminent crisis in the Middle East. As you know, it is \n     entirely possible that our troops, including a member of my \n     own staff, may soon find themselves in a combat situation. I \n     know I speak for everyone in this room when I say how proud \n     we are of the young people defending our country, and how \n     much we appreciate all that they have sacrificed already. I \n     also know that I speak for everyone here when I say that I \n     hope and pray that we can settle this crisis through \n     diplomatic means, without putting our troops in harm's way. \n     But if we can't, I know we will all support them in every way \n     possible.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n       But I came here to talk about a more pleasant subject: our \n     economy. And I think this is a pleasant subject for the \n     simple reason that the news continues to be good. Gross \n     Domestic Product is up 3.7 percent over last year, in real \n     terms, that's up 16.3 percent since 1994. Inflation is down \n     to 1.7 percent, down 27 percent since 1994. Unemployment last \n     year averaged just 4.9 percent, down from 6.1 percent in \n     1994. Interest Rates are at 30 year lows, and down 20 percent \n     from 1994. Industrial production is up 5.9 percent over last \n     year and 14 percent since 1994. And we finally have managed \n     to pass a balanced budget--one that includes tax cuts for \n     working Americans.\n       The issue we face today, in my view, is ``how can we keep \n     this economic growth going strong into the next century?'' \n     And I think we can see the outlines of a workable program \n     right here in Michigan. If we look back to 1990, we can see \n     the progress we have made here in Michigan, as well as how we \n     have made it.\n       In 1990, Michigan had the highest unemployment rate of any \n     industrial state and a $1.8 billion deficit, on a budget of \n     only $8 billion. Now our state is a thriving, fiscally \n     responsible beacon for free enterprise. Since 1990 Michigan \n     has created well over half a million new jobs, brought \n     unemployment down to well under 4 percent, and produced \n     balanced budgets and even a budget surplus.\n       How did we get here from there? John Engler became \n     governor, and he cut taxes over 20 times, instituted a \n     program of regulatory reforms lessening the burden of a state \n     government on our job creators, brought spending under \n     control and balanced the state budget.\n       But Governor Engler knows that you can never simply rest on \n     your laurels, particularly when the goal is continued \n     prosperity. That is why, if the Governor gets his way, we'll \n     cut taxes and regulations further and expand our pro-growth \n     policies into the next century.\n       On the national level we can't rest on our laurels either. \n     The question is, how can we best build on our recent \n     progress? Because of strong economic growth, for the first \n     time in recent memory we face the prospect of budget \n     surpluses. According to the Office of Management and Budget, \n     we will begin running a surplus in 2001, and that surplus \n     will total $447 billion by 2005.\n\n\n                            surplus options\n\n       Assuming we can maintain the budgetary discipline and \n     economic growth necessary to fully realize it, the question \n     is, what are we going to do with this surplus? Now, just \n     about everyone in Washington, DC has their own answer to this \n     question. They fall into four camps. Some say that we should \n     use it to cut taxes. Others respond that we should use it to \n     pay down the national debt. Still others have called on us to \n     use it to ``save Social Security.'' Finally, a number of \n     people have said that we should use the surplus to invest in \n     social programs, human capital and infrastructure.\n       Of course, all of these answers sound good--but how we \n     handle the specifics is very crucial.\n       First let's look at those who say simply ``cut taxes.'' \n     That sounds good. I for one believe that one of the reasons \n     Republicans were put on this Earth was to cut taxes. But how? \n     Do we just continue the recent approach of more targeted tax \n     cuts, as the President suggests? Cut a tax here, create a \n     deduction there?\n       Last year's tax cut was needed and welcome. But the \n     legislation putting it into effect added or amended over 800 \n     sections in an already complicated tax code. I question \n     whether we should just continue down that path.\n       Paying down the national debt sounds appealing too. But \n     what does it really mean? Remember, even if we use the entire \n     projected surplus, we would only pay down less than 10 \n     percent of the debt. And don't forget, a significant portion \n     of the debt is held by foreign investors. Does it really make \n     sense to use American taxpayers' dollars to make early debt \n     payments, to foreign investors like the central banks of \n     China, Japan and Germany?\n       Saving Social Security as the President suggests is a good \n     idea too. But how we might employ a short range surplus to do \n     it is the issue. For example, if we simply dump the budget \n     surplus into the Social Security Trust Fund, it would only \n     extend the life of Social Security for less than 2 years.\n       Which brings us to the fourth and final option: investing \n     the surplus in social human capital and infrastructure. \n     Again, the question is, what does this mean? Based on the \n     President's speech and the comments of other such advocates \n     in Washington, it means rebuilding the Great Society, \n     restoring many of the welfare programs we reformed and \n     launching new programs which will be impossible to end or \n     reduce at a later date.\n       As my colleague Chuck Grassley says, it appears that ``the \n     era of saying that the era of big government is over, is \n     over.''\n       As I have said, in Washington the debate over these choices \n     has begun. And for the most part the attitude is that they \n     are mutually exclusive. Moreover, because too much of the \n     early thinking takes a ``business as usual'' approach as \n     described above, rather than a creative and innovative one, \n     we aren't likely to make much progress on any front. To have \n     impact we must think in terms of new ideas and approaches. \n     And, a set of strong pro-growth policies must underlie any \n     strategy for using the surplus.\n       If we are creative in this sense, I believe it is possible \n     for us to attack the burdensome tax code, the looming Social \n     Security crisis, the human capital and infrastructure \n     challenges we confront, and our gargantuan debt, and make \n     great progress on all fronts.\n\n[[Page S1292]]\n\n                         an integrated program\n\n       I see the doubt on your faces. You're thinking we can't do \n     it all. And I confess to having a few doubts of my own. But, \n     for just a moment, suspend your judgment and consider several \n     possible prescriptions. Today I want to share with you some \n     ideas both as to surplus priorities and as to specific policy \n     concepts, with the hope of starting a dialogue on how we \n     should approach the upcoming era of surpluses, in the best \n     interests of Michigan and the nation.\n       Let's begin with Social Security. Ladies and gentlemen, if \n     we properly use up to two-thirds of the surplus, we can \n     simultaneously save Social Security and dramatically reduce \n     the federal debt. We do this, not by perpetuating the current \n     system with its paltry 1 to 2 percent return on investment, \n     but by employing the surplus to subsidize the transition to a \n     system that would allow anyone in Social Security who so \n     chooses, to invest up to 2 or 3 percent of their earnings--or \n     \\1/3\\ to \\1/2\\ of the employee share of their payroll taxes, \n     in a private investment account.\n       As you know, the Social Security system clearly needs \n     saving. As of now the Congressional Budget Office estimates \n     that it goes broke in 2030. If we do not take action, the \n     taxes needed to finance currently projected Social Security \n     benefits in 2030 would be equal to about 8 percent of Gross \n     Domestic Product--equivalent to doubling all personal income \n     tax rates on working Americans. Moreover, as I've said, \n     simply deploying the surplus to the trust fund would only \n     extend this between one and two years.\n       How can we prevent such a catastrophe? One way is by using \n     part of the surplus to fund a system of Personal Retirement \n     Accounts modeled on the successful and widely used 401(k) \n     plans. People would have the option of investing \\1/3\\ to \\1/\n     2\\ of their payroll tax contributions to a Private Retirement \n     Account, rather than to Social Security. The employee would \n     be able to invest the money in stocks, bonds and mutual \n     funds. Even with rules guarding the safety of the \n     investments, the return would be far higher than the current \n     system's 1 to 2 percent. Funds would accumulate tax free \n     until retirement, when the employee could withdraw the \n     balance. These dollars would then be used to partially offset \n     the trust funds' obligations to participating individuals, by \n     a fraction of the private investment account payout.\n       Meanwhile, as we give people a payroll tax cut to finance \n     their private investment accounts, we would use an equal \n     amount of surplus dollars to keep the trust fund whole. In \n     this way we would lower the financial pressure on the system \n     over the long term, saving it from insolvency and \n     dramatically reduce if not eliminate the need to raise \n     payroll taxes.\n       The economy also would benefit. Where Social Security \n     monies now exist only in theory or in government debt \n     instruments, they now would add to the pool of money \n     available for investment and expansion, thus lowering \n     interest rates and spurring growth. And higher growth would \n     further strengthen the Social Security system. What is more, \n     we could keep our eyes on our money.\n       For those at or nearing retirement, including baby boomers, \n     this strategy would ensure that everyone receives their \n     social security. But for American young people in particular, \n     this would produce a substantial tax cut and greater security \n     for their old age. That security is particularly important \n     since one recent pool shows that more people under 30 believe \n     that they will personally see a flying saucer in their \n     lifetimes than believe they will see a Social Security check.\n       Under this plan, a married couple with a combined income of \n     $60,000 would get a $1,200 annual tax reduction. By the time \n     this couple retired, after 35 years of consistent investment, \n     even at a relatively low 5.5 percent rate of return, they \n     would have $120,000 in supplemental retirement income.\n       Well that's a plan for Social Security. Now remember, we \n     have used at most two thirds of the surplus. The next 25 \n     percent we should consider devoting to taxes. But let's not \n     get into another battle over competing tax cuts. Instead, if \n     we are going to employ any of the surplus on taxes, I believe \n     it should be used to finance an overhaul of our antiquated \n     tax system.\n       As you know, the President has said in his State of the \n     Union address and since, that whatever we do ``we shouldn't \n     use any of the surplus for tax cuts.'' But I find it hard to \n     take him very seriously when in the same speeches, he himself \n     called for major tax cuts and, more importantly, the \n     launching of $125 billion of new, impossible to restrain, \n     spending programs.\n       So in response to the President I would say this: if the \n     taxpayers are sending over $400 billion more to Washington \n     then even the DC politicians asked for or expected, don't \n     they deserve to have a tax system that's right for the 21st \n     century, instead of the broken, intrusive, complicated one we \n     have today?\n       Ladies and Gentlemen, we need a tax system that is fairer, \n     simpler, and flatter and an IRS that is under control.\n       We need this to restore public confidence in the tax \n     system. A recent USA Today poll found that 60 percent of \n     Americans believe the IRS ``frequently abuses its powers.'' \n     Fully 95 percent believe the tax code itself isn't working \n     and must be changed.\n       If we had an Economic Protection Agency to watch over the \n     economy the way the Environmental Protection Agency watches \n     over the environment, the IRS code would be labeled toxic. \n     IRS forms would come with a warning label: The Economist \n     General of the United States has determined that the Internal \n     Revenue Code is hazardous to America's economic health and \n     could cause financial devastation to your family.\n       The problem is that we do not have majority support for any \n     one, particular alternative. According to surveys, the most \n     popular alternative is a flat tax, but even that lacks a \n     clear majority. This is true for a number of reasons but, \n     primarily, because many fear that a flat tax might cost them \n     money, due to a loss of deductions and because of concerns \n     about some of the flat tax proposals floating around out \n     there, which would essentially allow many of the most \n     affluent Americans to pay no tax at all.\n       So, what do we do? Stick with the current broken system? \n     Impose a flat tax or a sales tax on all Americans whether \n     they like it or not?\n       Well, here's a proposition. Why force a new system on the \n     taxpayers, or force them to live under the old one? Why not \n     give taxpayers a choice? Let's strive to achieve some \n     consensus. Why not give taxpayers the option of sticking with \n     the old system or of choosing something new.\n       To that end, with a strong plurality of Americans \n     preferring a flat tax, I've been exploring the concept of an \n     Alternative Flat Tax, and I'd like to outline it here today \n     for your consideration.\n       Rather than simply impose a new tax structure, we would \n     allow people to opt out of the current system and choose a \n     25% flat tax instead. Applicable to income above a generous--\n     family--based exclusion.\n       No one would pay more tax under the Alternative Flat Tax \n     than they do under the current system, for the simple reason \n     that no one would be forced to choose the new system.\n       In addition to the optional feature, the plan would also, \n     of course, possess the usual appeal of a flat tax:\n       It's simple--it could be computed on a post card, and it \n     would not entail the development of the kind of complicated \n     transitional tax rules that would be required if we mandated \n     that everyone change to a whole new system.\n       And it's pro growth--driving down the top marginal tax rate \n     on individuals and businesses to 25 percent would give a \n     tremendous boost to incentives to work, save and invest.\n       Now, let me talk about how we might invest the rest of the \n     surplus. The final ingredients we need to enjoy growth and \n     prosperity in the 21st century are an upgraded infrastructure \n     combined with a well-trained workforce. And the remainder of \n     the surplus is sufficient to achieve just that.\n       I don't think I have to tell anyone here about the problems \n     we have with our infrastructure. Over half our roads and \n     bridges are in poor shape. That means that we must spend more \n     on transportation. It also means we must stop spending the \n     road dollars of Michigan and 20 other states to subsidize \n     other people's freeways. An investment of about $5 billion of \n     the surplus per year; money that is already in the highway \n     transportation trust fund, will make that happen.\n       In addition to our transportation infrastructure, we need \n     to look to our human capital. No input is more important to a \n     business than properly skilled workers. And we as a nation \n     are not producing enough highly skilled workers.\n       A study conducted for the Information Technology \n     Association of America estimates that there are more than \n     346,000 unfilled positions for highly skilled workers in \n     American companies.\n       Bureau of Labor Statistics figures project that our economy \n     will produce 100,000 information technology jobs in each of \n     the next 10 years. Meanwhile, our universities will produce \n     less than a quarter that number of information technology \n     graduates.\n       This is serious, for Michigan and for the nation. Here in \n     Michigan, 24 of every 1,000 private sector workers are \n     employed by high-tech firms. For the nation, the Hudson \n     Institute estimates that the unaddressed shortage of skilled \n     workers throughout our economy will result in a 5 percent \n     drop in the growth rate of GDP. That translates into about \n     $200 billion in lost output, nearly $1,000 for every \n     American.\n       This problem calls for both a short term and a long term \n     solution.\n       For the short term, the only immediate source of talent to \n     fill the gap is immigration. But, by this summer American \n     businesses will reach the limit on the small number of highly \n     skilled temporary workers they can currently bring in from \n     abroad. Last year our employers reached this 65,000 cap for \n     the first time in history, and we did it by the end of \n     August. If no action is taken this year, the cap will be \n     reached by February of 1999 and even earlier the following \n     year. This would be disastrous. If American companies cannot \n     find home grown talent, and if they cannot bring talent to \n     this country, some of them will move their operations \n     overseas, taking American jobs with them.\n       And that is why I am going to use my position as Chairman \n     of the Senate Immigration Subcommittee to propose that we \n     increase the number of higher skilled temporary workers we \n     allow into the United States. This will keep American \n     companies in this country, saving American jobs and \n     contributing to the growth of the economy. It would also give \n     us time to formulate a long-term solution.\n       In my view, we can produce the talent here in America to \n     meet our skilled labor needs. And that's where the surplus \n     could come in. Through wise investments in human capital we \n     can give kids in this city, and in every\n\n[[Page S1293]]\n\n     other city in America, including kids whose opportunities \n     seem severely limited, the chance to be part of the new high-\n     tech economy.\n       Our young people have what it takes to be valuable \n     employees in our high-tech age. But our educational system is \n     not giving them the skills they need to succeed. The National \n     Research Council estimates that three quarters of American \n     high school graduates would fail a college freshman math or \n     engineering course. Most don't even try. Only 12 percent of \n     1994 college graduates earned degrees in technical fields.\n       This is not acceptable. In a highly advanced economy like \n     ours we cannot continue to function without highly skilled \n     workers. And our workers cannot continue to prosper unless \n     our educational system gives them the skills they need to \n     succeed.\n       To begin, I propose we invest $1 billion per year, the \n     balance of the surplus, to annually provide at least 100,000 \n     more Americans with scholarships for study in scientific and \n     technical areas. Let's start training unemployed Americans in \n     skills needed in the information technology industry. \n     Combined with approaches to increase parental choice in \n     determining their children's schooling and to move resources \n     out off Washington and back to the school districts, local \n     school boards and parents, I believe that this investment can \n     increase the skill levels of our workers, to everyone's \n     benefit.\n\n\n                          A Golden Opportunity\n\n       Well, these are some of the ideas I am considering, one \n     possible blueprint for our entry into the age of surplus.\n       In closing let me say I believe we have a golden \n     opportunity. As we stand on the edge of a new century, \n     possibilities are opening up for all Americans. We remain the \n     world's richest nation, and we are richer than we have ever \n     been. Now, after decades of overtaxing and overspending, \n     Washington finally has managed to balance the budget and, \n     provided we institute policies that make sense, soon will \n     produce a surplus.\n       But this opportunity will not be with us forever. If we do \n     not plan out how we should use the impending surplus it will \n     disappear into more ``Washington-knows-best'' programs that \n     will simply trap more Americans into lives of dependency and \n     desperation.\n       But if we are creative we can forge a new path. We can move \n     forward, with optimism, secure in the knowledge that our \n     people want opportunity, not handouts, that our economy can \n     continue to produce prosperity, if only we will let it, and \n     that the entrepreneurial spirit remains alive in America.\n       We can move toward growth and prosperity for the next \n     century if we are willing to use the surplus as a tool to \n     increase savings and investment, to get the Social Security \n     system back on a sound footing through individual choice, to \n     overhaul our tax system, giving greater control over their \n     money back to our taxpayers, and to rebuild the \n     infrastructure and human capital so crucial to our economy.\n       Responsible, limited government, combined with the spirit \n     of the American people, can lead us into a new century of \n     unprecedented growth and opportunity, in which the American \n     dream can become a reality for everyone fortunate enough to \n     be an American.\n       I would welcome your input, here and now or in the future, \n     whether regarding these principles or regarding the reforms I \n     have talked about today. I hope that we will have a chance to \n     discuss these issues, which will be so much a part of public \n     debate in Washington in the coming months, and I thank you \n     for having me speak today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/03/senate-section/article/S1291-2", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONFIRMATION OF RICHARD YOUNG\n\n Mr. COATS. Mr. President, yesterday the senate voted to \nconfirm Judge Richard Young to be U.S. district judge for the southern \ndistrict of Indiana. I rise today to express my strong support for the \nsenate's actions. Judge Young has distinguished himself both \nprofessionally and in community service, and it is my honor to commend \nhim to the senate as an excellent choice for the federal bench.\n  Judge Young has earned an outstanding reputation through his eight \nyears as Vanderburgh circuit court judge, and as a trial attorney for \n10 years before that. He has broad legal background, both in his job as \njudge, and in professional organizations. Currently a member of the \nboard of directors of the Indiana judicial conference, Judge Young also \nis the former president of the Evansville Bar Association. In addition, \nit is significant to note that Judge Young has worked in the Department \nof Justice, and has served as a public defender in Vanderburgh county.\n  During his time as judge, Judge Young has shown himself to be a \ndiligent worker, handling in a recent year 79 jury trials.\n  However, it is not only Judge Young's extensive experience and \nexcellent work ethic that make me confident he will bring sound, solid \nhoosier values to the federal bench. Judge Young also has a proven \nrecord of dedication to community service. Before he took the bench, \nJudge Young served on the board of trustees of the museum of arts and \nscience of the community foundation, and the community corrections \nadvisory board. Judge young has also served in the Easter Seals Society \nand has had a role in supporting the Evansville rehabilitation center.\n  Clearly, Judge Young is a dedicated practitioner of jurisprudence and \ndedicated servant of his community. I am confident he will be an \nexcellent judge and a credit to the state of Indiana, and it is for \nthis reason I offer my support of his nomination to the federal \nbench.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/03/senate-section/article/S1293-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1293-S1294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE READING EXCELLENCE ACT\n\n Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, over the weekend, President \nClinton used his radio address to call for Senate action on the Reading \nExcellence Act which seeks to address our Nation's literacy crisis. \nUnder the leadership of House Education and Workforce chairman, Bill \nGoodling, this bill passed the other body unanimously in November 1997. \nI have introduced similar legislation in the Senate as S. 1596. The \nReading Excellence Act is also a key component of the Senate Republican \nleadership's education package, the Better Opportunities for Our Kids \nand Schools Act, or ``BOOKS''. While I am pleased that the President \nhas urged passage of our legislation, it should be clear to everyone \nthat our approach represents a clear contrast to the literacy \ninitiative the President had initially proposed. Having said that, we \nwelcome President Clinton to real education reform--you've come a long \nway.\n  We clearly have a literacy crisis in this Nation when four out of 10 \nof our third-graders can't read. Without basic reading skills, many of \nthese children will be shut out of the workforce of the 21st century. \nAccording to the 1993 National Audit Literacy Survey, more than 40 \nmillion Americans cannot read a phone book, menu or the directions on a \nmedicine bottle. Those who can't learn to read are not only less likely \nto get a good job, they are disproportionately represented in the ranks \nof the unemployed and the homeless. Consider the fact that 75 percent \nof unemployed adults, 33 percent of mothers on welfare, 85 percent of \njuveniles appearing in court and 60 percent of prison inmates are \nilliterate.\n  Although over $8 billion is spent by the Federal Government each year \nto promote literacy, little progress has been made. Last year, \nPresident Clinton recognized this problem, but his ``America Reads'' \nproposal offered more of the same. Under the President's plan, the \ngovernment would recruit one million volunteers to teach reading, under \nthe direction of AmeriCorps. Rather than relying on a million untrained \nvolunteers to teach reading to our young children, we offered a better \napproach which the President has now endorsed: Let's help our reading \nteachers do a better job. Our legislation, the Reading Excellence Act, \nwould accomplish the following:\n  First, our bill would focus on training teachers to teach reading--\nless than 10 percent of our teachers have received formal instruction \non how to teach reading. Moreover, we would ensure that teachers are \ntaught in methods proven by sound scientific research to be effective, \nsuch as phonics.\n  Second, the Reading Excellence Act authorizes grants for extra \ntutorial assistance for at-risk kids. Parents with children \nexperiencing reading difficulties could apply for funds to purchase \nextra help from a list of providers supplied by their school.\n  Third, our bill provides literacy assistance for parents so they can \nbe their children's first and most important teacher. It also ensures \nthat 95% of the literacy funds are driven to the classroom where they \nwill help kids the most.\n  In last year's appropriations process, $210 million was appropriated \nfor a literacy program, contingent on passage of an authorization bill \nby July 1, 1998. As I stated, the House has already unanimously passed \nthis bill. It is now up to the Senate to act on similar legislation \nbefore the schools let out for summer. The Reading Excellence Act will \nprovide today's children the tools to be successful in tomorrow's \nworkforce. Helping to ensure every child can\n\n[[Page S1294]]\n\nread is one of the best jobs skills, welfare initiatives or crime bills \nwe can pass this Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/03/senate-section/article/S1293-2", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  APPOINTMENTS BY THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
