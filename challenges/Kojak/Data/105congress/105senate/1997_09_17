Mr. President, at the end of October President Clinton \nwill sit down with Chinese President Jiang Zemin to try to put the \nUnited States-China relationship on a sounder footing. After 8 years of \ntension in the relationship, it should go without saying that there is \nplenty of work to be done by both Presidents.\n  With over a billion people and a burgeoning economy undergoing a \ndramatic transformation from doctrinaire communism to market-driven \ncapitalism, China undeniably is an emerging great power. How we deal \nwith China will be one of the great foreign policy challenges of the \nnext century.\n  The forthcoming meeting with President Jiang Zemin is one of a series \nof important opportunities to advance our relations that will occur \nover the next several months.\n  Today I want to outline some of the objectives that I think the \nUnited States should pursue during Jiang's visit, particularly in \nregard to one of the central issues in our relationship.\n\n[[Page S9438]]\n\n  The issues on the agenda are familiar. We have deep concerns about \nChina's human rights record, its trade practices, and most important, \nfrom the perspective of international security, its lackluster record \nof adherence to nonproliferation agreements.\n  It is unrealistic to assume that we will resolve all our differences \nnext month, next year, or even over the next several years.\n  I am convinced, however, that it is possible to build a mutually \nbeneficial relationship with China. A rising China need not threaten \nUnited States interests. In fact, China cannot achieve the economic \ngrowth, international respect, and regional stability it seeks without \na workable relationship with the United States and close, constructive, \nintegration with global economic, political, and security regimes.\n\n\n                The Containment-versus-Engagement Debate\n\n  Just as China is engaged in a great internal debate about its future \ndirection, the United States is undertaking a great debate about the \nfuture direction of its policy toward China. The choice is often \nframed, simplistically, as one between two mutually exclusive paths: \ncontainment or engagement.\n  But the relationship between these two great nations is far more \ncomplicated than that. It demands a more sophisticated strategy.\n  Containment--the central organizing principle of the West during the \ncold war--is not a realistic policy option for China. Economically, \nChina is already a powerhouse, the third largest market in the world \nand our fastest growing export market. Unlike the former Soviet Union, \nChina has a vibrant economy, enjoys normal relations with all of its \nneighbors, and is attracting vast amounts of foreign investment.\n  If we try to smother China by denying it access to our markets, the \neffect on China would be less severe than commonly expected. Exports to \nthe United States represent only about 2 to 3 percent of China's gross \ndomestic product, and the injury would be borne not only by China, but \nalso by our many allies in the region. This is because 70 to 80 percent \nof the value of China's exports to the United States represent products \noriginally imported by China from the United States and other countries \nand then processed for export.\n  Militarily, a containment strategy for China would be a terrible act \nof folly worthy of a Barbara Tuchman history volume. For the last 25 \nyears our alliances with Japan, South Korea, Australia, Thailand, and \nthe Philippines have helped to foster peace and stability in the \nPacific--all without vilifying China. While it is essential that we \nadapt our regional alliances to post-cold war realities, we should not \ncast China as an adversary.\n  Our allies support the integration of China into the region's \neconomic and political structure, including the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations regional forum. None would support a policy of \ncontainment premised, as it would have to be, on the notion of an \nexpansionist China bent on regional hegemony.\n  If containment fails to advance our interests, what about engagement? \nEngagement, a term frequently used to describe the Clinton \nadministration's policy, is, by itself, virtually without substance. \n``Engagement'' could run the gamut from normal diplomatic relations, to \na zealous mercantilist approach that runs the risk of placing profits \nover principle. Or to paraphrase George Will in another context from \nyears ago, he said, ``Some of my friends love capitalism more than they \nhate communism.''\n  Engagement is not a policy. It is a means to an end. It is the \ncontent of the engagement that matters.\n  We should not be passive in our relationship with China. We can \ninfluence what kind of great power China becomes.\n  Encouraging China's transition from a poor, isolated Communist state \nto a more prosperous, open, and democratic partner, however, will take \nmore than a bland policy of engagement. It requires patience and \npurpose in the pursuit of clearly articulated U.S. interests.\n\n\n                             U.S. Interests\n\n  American interests in China are clear. We seek a free, prosperous, \nand secure China, at peace with its neighbors. We want China to respect \ninternational norms--particularly, nonproliferation, human rights, \ntrade, and the environment.\n\n\n                    The Summit's Measure of Success\n\n  Next month, Chinese President Jiang Zemin will visit Washington, the \nfirst such visit since the Tiananmen Square massacre. I am prepared to \nsupport this diplomatic step, provided that it yields meaningful \nprogress on issues of concern to us.\n  Early reports about China's priorities at this summit call into \nquestion whether such progress can be achieved. According to press \nreports, China is obsessed with ensuring that President Jiang receives \nthe red carpet treatment, similar to the celebrated visit of Deng Xiao-\nPing in 1979.\n  Let me state it plainly: this visit must be about more than ceremony.\n  In the area of international security, we should not hesitate to \ncriticize China for conduct which calls into question Beijing's \ncommitment to nonproliferation and invites U.S. sanctions.\n  However, we should also be prepared to lay out plainly the benefits \nthat might accrue to China if it takes decisive steps to join with the \nUnited States to halt the spread of weapons of mass destruction.\n\n\n                       Nonproliferation Concerns\n\n  As my colleagues know, I have for several years been critical, along \nwith Senator Helms, of China's behavior in the area of \nnonproliferation. Their consistent flouting of international norms \nwarrant skepticism that China is willing to engage us honestly on our \nproliferation concerns.\n  Nonetheless, I agree with this objective: we must strive to transform \nnonproliferation from an issue that has become emblematic of the \ndifficulties in Sino-United States relations to an example of \ncooperation and trust.\n  Toward that end, China deserves some credit for development of its \nofficial policy on nonproliferation. For example, since 1992, Beijing \nhas promised to abide by the Missile Technology Control Regime, acceded \nto the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT], signed and ratified the \nChemical Weapons Convention, developed regulations governing exports \nlimited by the Chemical Weapons Convention, and issued its first public \ndefense white paper, which focused on arms control and disarmament.\n  On May 11, 1996, following what the Chinese maintain was an \nunauthorized sale of ring magnets used in uranium enrichment to \nPakistan in violation of China's Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] \ncommitments and United States law, China pledged not to provide \nassistance to any nuclear facilities not under International Atomic \nEnergy Agency safeguards.\n  Last year, China began a moratorium on nuclear testing and signed the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Finally, just last month China \npromulgated a list of controlled nuclear technologies which are \nprohibited from export.\n  Perhaps even more significantly, in recent months we have observed \nfor the first time a Chinese willingness to forego exports of nuclear \ntechnology to Iran in response to United States concerns.\n  Hopefully, this is the dawning on the part of the Chinese of not only \na recognition of the commitments they made, but what their self-\ninterest is. It is not in their self-interest, in my humble opinion--\nalthough I never tell another man or woman their politics or lecture \nanother country about what is their interest--but on the surface it \nclearly is not in their interest to continue to engage in the \nactivities they have engaged in during the decades of the 1980's and \nthe 1990's. So I am not making any prophecy about what this portends, I \nam just stating a fact, that there has been a change--not sufficient \nchange, but a change. Again, hopefully, it is a recognition of their \nself-interest in addition to their international obligations.\n  The China Nuclear Energy Industry Corporation reportedly has canceled \nan agreement to sell Iran a facility to convert uranium ore into \nuranium hexaflouride gas, which could be enriched to weapons-grade \nmaterial. I hope that is correct. China has also suspended an agreement \nto sell nuclear reactors to Iran. Again, if true, if they keep on that \npath, that is a very positive change.\n  I hope that these developments are evidence that Chinese leaders now \nfully\n\n[[Page S9439]]\n\naccept that China's own national security would be threatened by the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver \nthem. I also hope that China understands that great powers go beyond \ntheir minimum treaty obligations in the interest of peace and security. \nIf they wish to be a great power, they will be required to do the same.\n  China wants to be accepted as a great power. I welcome that desire \nand understand it. A great power bears an obligation not to sell dual-\nuse equipment to a country that is known to have a program to develop \nlong-range missiles. A great power bears an obligation not to sell \nchemical weapons precursors or technology to firms or institutes that \nare fronts for military programs. A great power agrees to work with \nother countries to ensure that the burdens of nonproliferation are \nshared equitably. China must step up to that obligation.\n\n\n                           China's Next Steps\n\n  There are several steps China could take to shoulder their share of \nthe nonproliferation burden and to increase the world's confidence in \ntheir stance on nuclear nonproliferation. Specifically, in my humble \nopinion, China should do the following: Expand its pledge not to assist \nunsafeguarded facilities to include unsafeguarded programs; clarify its \nrecent commitment not to assist Iran's nuclear program and put it in \nwriting; make its nuclear export control list available to Chinese and \nforeign firms and expand controls to include dual-use nuclear \ntechnology; establish a comprehensive export controls enforcement \nmechanism, and demonstrate its effectiveness through the arrest and \nprosecution of violators within China; stop all contact between Chinese \nnuclear engineers and those Pakistani experts with ties to Pakistan's \nnuclear weapons program; and last, I believe China should agree to join \nmultilateral bodies committed to nuclear nonproliferation, including \nthe Zanger Committee.\n  If China took these steps, we would be well on our way to \ntransforming nuclear nonproliferation from a sore point in Sino-United \nStates relations to a genuine success story.\n\n\n              Activating the Nuclear Cooperation Agreement\n\n  United States concerns about Chinese proliferation are not restricted \nto nuclear technology. China's export of chemicals and equipment \ndestined for Iran's chemical weapons factories and its sale of cruise \nand ballistic missile technology to Iran, Pakistan, and other countries \nremain of serious concern to the United States and must be addressed.\n  But progress in the area of nuclear nonproliferation could serve as \nan example for these other areas of our bilateral relationships. \nMoreover, there are benefits that could flow to both the United States \nand China once we became convinced by China's actions of the sincerity \nof its commitment to halt the spread of weapons of mass destruction.\n  For example, if recent progress in the area of nuclear \nnonproliferation continues, the President could choose to implement the \n1985 Peaceful Nuclear Cooperation Agreement with China. That early \nagreement permits the export of United States nuclear energy technology \nto China. We have suspended it because of our doubts about China's \nintentions. If China continued on the path that they have begun of \nlate, the President, or the next President, could in fact reengage that \nagreement.\n  The Peaceful Nuclear Cooperation Agreement was suspended in 1986 in \nresponse to Congressional concerns about Chinese assistance to \nPakistan's nuclear weapons program. I was one of those expressing \nconcern at that time. I think we made the right decision.\n\n  For the past decade, China's nonproliferation track record has \neffectively, in my view, precluded resumption of nuclear cooperation \nwith the United States. I have been one of the people on this floor \ncalling for the rare secret sessions that we occasionally have here to \ndiscuss China's activities over the last decade in this area.\n  During the intervening years, China has pursued a ``Noah's Ark'' \napproach to nuclear energy, purchasing two Russian reactors, two French \nreactors, and two Canadian reactors. Now they are close to reaching a \ndecision on a standard configuration for their nuclear industry, and \nthey would like to purchase two American reactors. The Chinese rightly \nbelieve that United States reactors are the safest, most efficient, and \nreliable on the planet--which they are.\n  For the United States, reactivation of the nuclear cooperation \nagreement could mean billions of dollars' worth of exports to help \nbalance our trade with China, additional high-paying jobs for \nAmericans, and a beneficial change in the relationship. There would \nalso be an environmental benefit: reducing China's consumption of high-\nsulfur coal, which fouls the air over China's cities and contributes to \nglobal warming.\n  So, there could be a great benefit. But China must first, must first \ndemonstrate to us that their recent adumbrations with regard to nuclear \nnonproliferation, are real, and that is why I was presumptuous enough \nto suggest the things that I think China could and should do, and \nshould be discussed in the impending visit.\n  The world system has never been adept at accommodating the \naspirations of rising powers.\n  As a student of history, and although it has been 100 years since I \nwas in undergraduate school, my love and my avocation still, as a \nstudent of history--I know, and you know and all our colleagues know, \nthat the world has never been adept at accommodating the aspirations of \nrising powers. To deny that China is a rising power is to deny reality. \nChina's rise is not likely to be an exception in the way in which the \nworld responds.\n  Increasingly, China not only wants a seat at the table, it expects \nits interests to be taken seriously and balks at being held accountable \nto rules it had no role in shaping when the great powers shaped them, \nbefore they had a seat at the table.\n  China is an ancient country with a rich history and a proud list of \ncultural and technological accomplishments which will forever \ndistinguish it from our western, Judeo-Christian traditions. In light \nof this, one can understand why they might feel that it could be \nunreasonable for us to try to mold them in our image. But we do China \nno favors by failing to communicate our concerns, or by jettisoning our \nprinciples or our strategic interests in pursuit of an ill-defined \npolicy of engagement. To suggest that international norms that all the \nworld are willing to accept, or should be willing to accept, are an \nimposition of our system on China, is in fact, I think, an incorrect \nway of looking at it.\n  We are not trying to make China in our own image. But there are \ncertain basic international norms to which they must conform.\n  We are not being unreasonable when we expect China to accept \ninternational norms of behavior in the area of nonproliferation, human \nrights, and trade. We are not being unreasonable when we expect China \nto adhere to the terms of its international agreements--period.\n  Since the introduction of Deng Xiaoping's reforms 20 years ago, China \nhas opened to the world, seeking even greater integration into global \ntrade and security regimes. And during that process, as an observer, it \nseems to me, like all change, like all transitions, they have begun to \nlearn. They have begun to learn where their interests lie. My hope is \ntheir learning curve continues.\n  Some China watchers discount this trend as mere tactics. I believe \nthat these China watchers are mistaken. Only in a Chinese historical \ncontext of dynasties and centuries could the consistent policy of two \ndecades be dismissed as tactics. China's opening is the single greatest \nforce for economic modernization and political reform that the Middle \nKingdom has ever known. We should reinforce this strategic opening.\n  How ironic and tragic it would be if we attempted to contain China \njust at the moment in history when China becomes convinced that it no \nlonger needed a great wall to protect it from the barbarian hordes and \nforeign influences.\n  Rather than throwing up the ramparts, we should be seeking to expand \nthe areas of cooperation. China must do its part by adhering to \ninternational norms of behavior and following through on its \ncommitments, and we must do our part standing ready to\n\n[[Page S9440]]\n\nwelcome China as it strives to become a truly great power. Our \ninterests with China are too vital--the consequences of failing to \nbuild a constructive relationship with China too profound--to do \notherwise.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have left in my request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes 4 seconds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/17/senate-section/article/S9437-6", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BOSNIAN ELECTIONS\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would like now to speak very briefly, 8 \nminutes, to the issue of Bosnia. Last weekend, the people of Bosnia-\nHerzegovina went to the polls to elect their various municipal \ngovernments. I know the President has recently been to Bosnia, as I \nhave. These local elections had been postponed from last year because \nof tampering with registration, chiefly by the Bosnian Serbs.\n  But I am happy to report, and we have all observed, that this year's \nmunicipal elections were a success. Despite dire threats of violence \nagainst refugees and displaced persons who wanted to cross over to \ntheir former homes to vote, over 2 days, not one single incident of \nviolence occurred in the entire country.\n  Why? For a simple reason, I believe, Mr. President. Because of the \npresence of SFOR, the NATO-sponsored troops on the ground led by \nrecently reinforced American troops. SFOR made clear to all parties \nthat violence would not be tolerated and force would be met with force.\n  Every single time over the past several years when the West has been \nforceful in its behavior, the ultranationalists in Bosnia, primarily \nthe Serbs but all ultranationalists, have backed down--every single \ntime.\n  The elections were carried out by the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe, the so-called OSCE, in which the United States \nis an active member, but only one of many. The OSCE observers deserve a \ngreat deal of credit for their successful labors.\n  The results of the election will not be known for another couple of \ndays. Already, however, some encouraging signs are emerging. In Tuzla, \na place I have visited on more than one occasion, the Muslim Party for \nDemocratic Action, the SDA, conceded defeat by Mayor Selim Beslagic, \nwho represented not just the Muslim party but the multiethnic joint \ngroup that was running.\n  I met the mayor last month. I met with him last month in Bosnia in \nSarajevo. When I met with him, he indicated that he represents not just \nMuslims, but he represents this multiethnic slate and he represents \njust the kind, in my view, of democratic, tolerant, pragmatic \npolitician that is going to be needed to rebuild Bosnia. But the point \nis, the controlling party in the area lost. The election was free.\n  Until now, three ethnically based parties that profess to represent \nthe interests of the Muslims, Serbs, and Croats have been dominating \nthe airwaves and the patronage system. Tuzla, and perhaps other cities \nin both the federation and the Republika Srpska, show that if SFOR and \nthe international community guarantee equal access, the monopoly of \nthese parties on power can be broken.\n  Moreover, Mr. President, I would argue it represents what I believe \nto be the majority view of Bosnian Serbs, Bosnian Croats and Bosnian \nMuslims, who, I might add, lived together in peace for decades and \ndecades prior to this and the majority of whom wish to do that again. \nBut it shows that the monopoly of the parties that are representing \npurely the xenophobic notions of their particular interests are not \nnecessarily the views of the people of Bosnia.\n  Moreover, it is likely that, thanks to the absentee voting and the \nprotection offered by SFOR for returning refugees, the election may \nreverse the vile ethnic cleansing of the war. For example, in the town \nof Drvar in western Herzegovina, it was 97 percent Serb until the \ntown's inhabitants were driven out in the fall of 1995 by Croats. Last \nweekend, the Croats who displaced the Serbs did their best to harass \nreturning Serb voters. International election officials from the OSCE, \nhowever, insisted the Serbs be allowed to vote, and it looks like there \nmay be a turnaround in that community as well.\n\n  Several other towns, like Jajce and Srebrenica, site of the largest \ncivilian massacre in Europe since World War II, may see their former \ninhabitants, in these two cases Muslims, forming the governments in \nthose two cities.\n  The international community is now faced with the next--and this is \nan incremental thing, Mr. President--they are faced with the next stark \nquestion of whether now we will enforce the election results, whether \nwe will now be part of that.\n  I realize that is a dicey deal, but I continue to argue that when we \ndemonstrated force, and given the power of the people in those \ncommunities, we, the Western community, have prevailed.\n  So now the question is, will we enforce the results of the election \nby guaranteeing that the newly elected councils not remain governments \nin exile? Enforcing the election results, of course, means that the \nright of refugees and displaced persons to return must be honored, \nwhich Dayton calls for. In most cases, that would be able to be \naccomplished only by the international community being present and the \npresence of SFOR.\n  Mr. President, I believe we have no choice in this matter. Both for \nmoral and practical reasons, it seems to me we must move rapidly to \nenforce the resettlement of refugees as the results of the election \nwill dictate. This will be a difficult task, and the time is short \nbefore the onset of the Balkan winter. Most likely we will have to \nbegin with highly visible demonstration returns in one or two selected \ntowns. But, Mr. President, we must keep the democratic momentum going.\n  Rebuilding shattered Bosnia is an immense undertaking, and now, for \nthe first time in years, there has been a string of successes. The \nUnited States has been the prime mover in these, although not the prime \nplayer in terms of numbers. We must continue to exert our leadership on \nthe European Community, and we must continue the valuable and honorable \nwork we have undertaken, for, Mr. President, to do otherwise, I will \npredict, the result will be disastrous for Europe, disastrous for our \ninterests.\n  I will end with a rhetorical question. How can we expect stability in \nEurope if the ethnic cleansing is able to be justified, and \npartitioning takes place? How do we then explain that to the other \nparts of the former Soviet Union who have equally deep divisions that \nexist? Mr. President, there are 5 million ethnic Russians in the \nUkraine. There are 5 million of them. There are millions of people who \nhave ethnic differences living throughout that area. How do we deal \nwith Rumania and Hungary? If we say that this vile ethnic cleansing \nwill be rewarded by us backing out and letting it return to the status \nquo, you know European leadership will not step up to the ball. Again, \nI want to make it clear, we play the smallest part relative to the rest \nof the world in this, in the sense that we are only a small portion of \nthe overall effort, but the overall effort is occurring because of our \nleadership.\n  So, Mr. President, I acknowledge that this is a dicey deal. I \nacknowledge that it is going to be difficult, but I would suggest that \nthose who have a different view from me acknowledge that there have \nbeen recent successes that at least lend hope to the possibility that \nwe can continue down this path.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/17/senate-section/article/S9440-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9440-S9443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  1998\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The distinguished Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Senator from Delaware has used this \ntime very much to good effect with thoughtful analyses of two \nquestions, and he certainly did not interfere with debate on the \nInterior appropriations bill, as no one was here to present an \namendment on the subject. I do have a unanimous consent request that \nhas been agreed to by both sides, Mr. President, and I will present it \nnow.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 1:30 p.m. \ntoday, the Senate resume consideration of the Ashcroft amendment No. \n1188, and that the time be divided in the following fashion: 70 minutes \nunder the control of Senator Byrd, or his designee; 70 minutes under \nthe control of Senator Ashcroft, or his designee; 5 minutes under my \ncontrol.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the conclusion or \nyielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote on, or in relation \nto, the Ashcroft amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I also express my strong hope and \npreference, and that of the majority leader, that after disposition of \nthe Ashcroft amendment, unless it is adopted, that we proceed promptly \nto the consideration of the other amendments relating to the National \nEndowment for the Arts. They are: an amendment by Senator Abraham; an \namendment by Senator Sessions and Senator Hutchinson of Arkansas; and \nan amendment by Senator Hutchison of Texas. Each of them has been \ndebated thoroughly. While no unanimous-consent request has been made \nwith respect to any of them, I hope that we will be able to get \nrelatively short debate periods and thereby finish dealing with the \nmost controversial aspect of this bill.\n  There are also other outstanding amendments, some of which may \nrequire rollcall votes. I know of one relating to forest roads that \nwill be proposed by Senator Bryan of Nevada. I hope we will, within the \nhour at least, be able to arrange a time for its debate.\n  I believe that there are a couple of others. I am also delighted to \nreport that Senator Bumpers and Senator Reid have apparently reached an \nagreement on an element in this bill which divided the two of them. I \nbelieve that, again, within the hour or hour and a half, we may be able \nto adopt an agreed amendment on that subject.\n  I know the majority leader still would like to finish this bill \ntonight. That may be a vain hope, but I certainly hope we will get a \nlong way toward that end. With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n             supporting the national endowment for the arts\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, here we go again. Every year since 1989, \nCongress has held a highly charged debate about the future of the \nNational Endowment for the Arts. This year is no different. Ironically, \nextremists opposing NEA have recently been claiming that there has been \ninadequate oversight of the agency. Dollar for dollar, it is likely \nthat no agency has been more heavily scrutinized than the Arts \nEndowment.\n  The arts and humanities have, and deserve to have, a central role in \nthe life of America. The Arts Endowment has contributed immensely to \nthat role. It has encouraged the growth and development of the arts in \ncommunities across the Nation, giving new emphasis and vitality to \nAmerican creativity and scholarship, and to the cultural achievement \nthat are among America's greatest strengths.\n  Americans have a great deal to celebrate and learn about our \nextraordinary cultural traditions. The arts are an important part of \nour complex and modern society, and will play a key role in fulfilling \nour country's many possibilities for the future.\n  Critics used to claim that the Endowment spent money unwisely--\nawarding grants to unqualified artists or to artists that clearly did \nnot merit Federal aid. But the critics quickly ran out of examples. \nOver the period of its entire 32-year history, a grand total of about \n25 of the tens of thousands of grants awarded by the Endowment have \nraised genuine concerns. Yet, the budget for the Arts Endowment has \nbeen cut to penalize the agency for these so-called inappropriate \ngrants. Other restrictions have also been imposed--on content, on \nseasonal support grants, on grants to individuals, and on subgrants.\n  Nothing will ever satisfy the critics, because their real intent is \nto eliminate any Federal role in the arts. Their goal is to abolish the \nagency--either directly by denying it any funds at all, or, indirectly \nby block-granting all the funds to the States.\n  In fact, the Arts Endowment has an extraordinary record of successful \nachievement. As a result of the its leadership over the past three \ndecades, there are now double the number of orchestras in America, 11 \ntimes the number of dance companies, and 50 times the number of local \narts agencies. The NEA reaches out to thousands of America's \ncommunities and neighborhoods. It is functioning as it should, \nencouraging the arts in all parts of the country, providing the seed \nmoney that enables local arts to grow and thrive.\n  Let us be honest. In recent years, since the rightwing's misguided \nideological assault on the agency first began, Congress has gone the \nextra mile. We have taken every reasonable action to ensure that the \nArts Endowment only supports grants and programs that are responsible, \nthat fulfill the agency's widely accepted mission, and that reach the \nwidest possible audience. Every year the agency has to run the \nappropriations gauntlet and every year it convinces a majority of \nCongress that it deserves support. This year should be no different, \nbecause there is no new evidence to justify the critics' shameful \nattack.\n  The Labor and Human Resources Committee recently approved a 5-year \nreauthorization of the Arts Endowment. The bill includes appropriate \nrestrictions and set-asides, so that the arts will reach as many \ncommunities across the country as possible. The bill also establishes \narts education as a primary focus of the agency. The bill was approved \nby a solid bipartisan committee vote of 14 to 4.\n  I commend Senator Jeffords of the Labor Committee for his excellent \njob in guiding that authorization through the committee. He is a strong \nsupporter of the arts and has been thorough and conscientious in his \noversight of the Endowment.\n  The Appropriations Committee has also demonstrated its support for \nthe Endowment, by recommending just over $100 million for the Arts \nEndowment in this bill. I commend the committee for its support.\n  The agency has made a significant contribution to the quality of life \nin thousands of communities in our country. The arts have broad appeal, \nand the Endowment's mission is to encourage artists and institutions \nacross the country to create, produce, and present programs to tap and \nencourage that appeal. In 1996, for example, the NEA supported \nsignificant programs such as the Delaware Theater Co., the Atlanta \nBallet, the Tulsa Philharmonic Society, the University of Southern \nMississippi's Folk and Traditional Arts Program, and the International \nAssociation of Jazz Educators.\n  Countless other examples can be cited. Federal support for the arts \nhas clearly made a large difference in communities across the country. \nThe current Federal role is significant, and it has overwhelming \nsupport in every State. Families want their children to visit \nsymphonies and museums. They want to enjoy theater and dance. The arts \nare more than a diversion or entertainment. They are educational and \nenriching, and their central place in the Nation's life and experiences \nshould be supported and increased.\n  The Conference of Mayors has strongly endorsed the Arts Endowment. \nThese local officials, who know their communities best, clearly \nunderstand the positive role of the arts. They know that the arts \ncontribute to the vitality of their locality, and increase its economic \nbase as well.\n  In Massachusetts, the arts community is thriving and dynamic. A \nwealth\n\n[[Page S9442]]\n\nof cultural and educational activities is available to every citizen. \nThese activities also attract tourists to our State. Recently, the \nMuseum of Science presented its hugely successful Leonardo da Vinci \nexhibition. A major retrospective on Picasso's early years is about to \nopen at the Museum of Fine Arts. Many of my colleagues, I am sure, had \nthe opportunity to see this extraordinary exhibition at the National \nGallery of Art in Washington. The Endowment's support helped to make \nthis dramatic exhibition possible.\n  People in every State treasure their own arts institutions and arts \nprograms in the same way. Whatever the size of the State or community, \nthe impact of the arts is significant and indisputable, from the \nyoungest child to the oldest senior citizen.\n  Leaders in State and local institutions across the country are \nconvinced that support by the Arts Endowment has been a significant \npart of their success. Federal aid is seed money. It has never been \nintended to replace State or local or private support for the arts. But \nit has often been a critical component in the overall development and \nsuccess of countless local institutions.\n  In many communities, the Federal role has been indispensable, \nespecially in disseminating innovative programs to institutions that \nmight not have the resources to develop and produce their own programs.\n  Arts education is an excellent example of this impact. Music is an \nespecially effective tool in developing the discipline and the learning \npotential of students. Recent studies by the college board show that \nstudents who have studied 4 years of music or more do significantly \nbetter in both their math and verbal scores on standard SAT tests.\n  Let me just repeat that. The studies by the college board show that \nstudents who have studied 4 years of music or more do significantly \nbetter in both their math and verbal scores on standard SAT tests--up \nto about 50 points more.\n  You would find it extremely difficult to point to any single \nparticular educational program that results in that kind of a bump in \nterms of educational achievement and accomplishment. But there it is. \nThere are the statistics. And it should not be any mystery.\n  We know, for example, for 300 years the Greeks had the greatest \nmathematicians in the world. It is interesting to note that the reason \nthat they had the greatest mathematicians in the world is that they \ntaught their youngest children mathematics through the arts and through \nmusic--for 300 years.\n  I have 10 schools in my own city of Boston where the Conservatory of \nMusic is working with those schools to try and provide the same kinds \nof initiative in terms of the music and the math that was used many \nhundreds of years ago with phenomenal success.\n  I remember being in the Trotter School in Boston with Larry Lesser, \nwho is probably one of the world's great cellists, and the time he was \nworking in an inner-city school and working with those inner-city \nchildren in terms of enhancing their academic achievement and \naccomplishment. You would, as I say, rarely find a particular \neducational program that would have that kind of result.\n  We are all looking to what is going to be magical in terms of \neducation, that is going to enhance academic achievement. We have the \nresults in with regard to those students who study music for 4 or more \nyears and how that has enhanced children who have that 4 or 5 years of \nstudy in their academic achievement. And it is out there for all of us \nto see.\n  So it is not only an issue that we are talking about in terms of the \nvalue of the arts, in terms of the culture, and the values which we \nvalue in our society, but it is very, very tangible and a very \nimportant component in terms of education.\n  We have some important alterations and changes in the authorization \nto try and enhance and build on that in the reauthorization which \nSenator Jeffords and I have been strongly supportive of.\n  We should be doing more, not less, for the arts. The heavy-handed \nattempt by the House Republican leadership to eliminate the Arts \nEndowment should be categorically rejected, and it is gratifying that \nPresident Clinton has pledged to veto any bill that reaches his desk \nthat attempts to do so. In fact, many of the agency's strongest and \nmost effective supporters are on the Republican side of the aisle.\n  Congress should start listening to the people and stop bashing this \nsmall agency. When we listen to the exaggerated protests of the \ncritics, it is hard to remember that we are talking about a program \nthat costs each taxpayer 37 cents a year.\n  We have already taken a full range of steps to see that the agency \noperates as effectively and responsibly as possible. It is time to \nsupport fair funding for this important agency, and give it the solid \nvote of confidence it deserves.\n  Mr. President, I remember last year--maybe others do--when we had the \nVermeer exhibition at the National Gallery. It was in the wintertime. I \nremember over a weekend going down to try and visit that exhibit on a \ncold and blustery day and getting there on a Sunday morning at 8 or 9 \no'clock in the morning, and seeing the lines there four blocks long, \npeople outside waiting 4 hours.\n  Finally, when I was able to get in there a number of people came up \nand spoke to me just quietly saying to me, ``Senator, we hope you will \ntell Members in the Congress and the Senate that we value the arts. We \nare prepared to wait for the 3 or 4 hours outside to see this \nextraordinary exhibit of the arts.''\n  Whether the National Endowment supported that particular exhibit or \nnot, it is doing otherwise, primarily in exhibits that might not have \nas high a visibility as the Vermeer exhibit but certainly still \nbringing the value of those programs to the American people.\n  Mr. President, in his 1960 campaign for President, President Kennedy \ndiscussed the close historical relationship between great achievement \nin public life and great achievement in the arts. He said, ``There is a \nconnection, hard to explain logically but easy to feel, between \nachievement in public life and progress in the arts. The age of \nPericles was also the age of Phidias. The age of Lorenzo de Medici was \nalso the age of Leonardo da Vinci. The age of Elizabeth also the age of \nShakespeare. And the New Frontier for which I campaign in public life, \ncan also be a new frontier for American arts.''\n  Three years later, as President, in a major address at Amherst \nCollege in October 1963, he said this:\n\n       I look forward to an America which will reward achievement \n     in the arts as we reward achievement in business or \n     statecraft. I look forward to an America which will steadily \n     raise the standard of artistic accomplishment and which will \n     steadily enlarge cultural opportunities for all our citizens. \n     And I look forward to an America which commands respect \n     throughout the world not only for its strength but for its \n     civilization as well.\n\n  Those are timeless goals. They apply to our own day and generation as \nwell. I urge the Senate to heed them, to give the arts in America the \nstrong support they so eminently deserve.\n  Mr. President, I have one further observation. Yesterday one of the \ncritics of the Endowment raised the issue of elitism and cited a grant \nto my State as an example of the elitist focus of the National \nEndowment for the Arts.\n  Well, I agree. This grant--to the Phillips Academy--is a perfect \nexample. It is an example of a worthwhile program--and an example of \nthe distortion that critics of the agency rely on to make their \nspecious arguments.\n  The Addison Gallery of American Art, which is affiliated with \nPhillips, applied for a NEA grant as the lead members of a consortium. \nThe grant seeks support for a project entitled ``To Conserve a Legacy: \nAmerican Art From Historically Black Colleges.'' The other consortia \norganizations are Clark Atlanta University, Fisk University, Hampton \nUniversity, Howard University, North Carolina Central University, the \nStudio Museum of Harlem, and the Williamstown Art Conservation Center.\n  Art work from each of the five participating black colleges and \nuniversities will be selected for conservation and inclusion in the \nexhibit which will travel to Clark, Hampton, Howard, and the Studio \nMuseum of Harlem, in addition to the Addison.\n  The works in the exhibition will represent artists such as Romare \nBeardon, Sam Gilliam, Jacob Lawrence, and others. And one component of \nthe project\n\n[[Page S9443]]\n\nis a year-long training program in which minority students will be \nselected by the participating universities to work on-site for one \nschool year during the selection and conservation of the art work.\n  This is one of those grants that is going to Massachusetts--yes, it \nis, but its scope and audience and impact is national. And the funds \nwere matched on a 3-to-1 basis.\n  I believe that this grant is not only defensive but also commendable. \nAnd I think those that have criticized this grant as an elitist grant \nwill take a second look.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/17/senate-section/article/S9440-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9443-S9448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 10:45 \nhaving arrived, the Senate will now proceed to consideration of the \nconference report that accompanies H.R. 2016, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2016) having met, after full and free conference, have agreed \n     to recommend and do recommend to their respective Houses this \n     report, signed by all of the conferees.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of September 9, 1997.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 5 \nminutes' debate each for the Senator from Montana, the Senator from \nWashington, and the Senator from Arizona.\n  The distinguished Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. I am pleased to bring before the Senate the military \nconstruction conference report for fiscal year 1998.\n  Mr. President, this conference report was passed by the House of \nRepresentatives yesterday by a vote of 413 to 12 and sent to the Senate \nlast night. Now it awaits final passage here.\n  Mr. President, we worked very hard with our House colleagues to bring \nthis military construction conference to a successful conclusion. Both \nsides did take a little bit different perspective on the allocation of \nmilitary construction funding for the Department of Defense, but in the \nfinal conference report we met our goals of promoting the quality of \nlife, other initiatives, and enhancing the mission for readiness.\n  Mr. President, this bill has some points I want to highlight. It \nprovides a total of $9.2 billion for military construction. Even though \nthis is an increase of $800 million over the President's budget for \nfiscal year 1998, it is still a reduction of $600 million from what was \nappropriated just a year ago. That is an overall reduction of 6 \npercent.\n  Some 42 percent of this bill is allocated to family housing, for a \ntotal of $3.9 billion, so this includes new construction, improvement \nin existing housing, and funding for operation and maintenance of \nhousing.\n  The base realignment and closure part of the bill accounts for 23 \npercent of our total funding, about $2.1 billion. Yes, there is talk of \nanother round of BRAC, and I want to tell my colleagues that base \nclosure does take up a lot of funds. This encompasses funding for \nenvironmental cleanup of the closing of those bases and for the \nconstruction of new BRAC-related facilities.\n  Mr. President, I continue to be concerned about the growing cost of \nthe environmental cleanup of our BRAC installations. These costs \nfrequently continue long after the base is closed. In some way or \nanother we have to get a handle on that cost. But right now it seems \nlike it is almost impossible to do.\n  We strongly protect the quality-of-life initiatives. We provide $724 \nmillion for barracks, $32 million for child development centers, $163 \nmillion for hospital and medical facilities.\n  We provide a total of $640 million for guard and reserve components, \na reduction of $100 million from the Senate-passed bill. Overall, this \nrepresents an increase of $290 million from the President's budget \nrequest. Many of those projects will enhance our readiness and mission \ncapabilities of our reserve and guard forces. I have to say, they are \nvital in the overall national defense scheme. It seems like every year \nwhen the budget comes down from the administration, those two parts of \nour military complex are forgotten about.\n  I thank my ranking member, Senator Murray of Washington State, for \nher assistance and support through this process. She and her staff have \nbeen extremely cooperative. I also want to commend our colleagues in \nthe House, because we went through the conference, and I think it is a \ngood lesson on get your work done before you go and it makes it a lot \neasier when coming to an understanding and bringing all the minds \ntogether.\n  I commend this product to the Senate. I recommend that it be signed \nby the President without modification.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to strongly support and \nrecommend to the Senate this military construction appropriations \nconference report. The final amount, $9.18 billion, is slightly below \nthe Senate-passed amount, and is about $800 million above the budget \nrequest. Nevertheless, it is a frugal bill, some $600 million, or 6 \npercent below last year's appropriated amount.\n  We have added $800 million to the bill to correct what the \nsubcommittee perceived to be serious shortfalls in quality-of-life \ninitiatives particularly housing and also including child care centers \nand medical facilities, as well as what has been the annual \nshortchanging of our guard and reserve forces. In particular, the \nbudget request was for approximately $172 million for our guard and \nreserve forces, and the conference result was about $460 million, some \n$290 million over the request. I would point out that the Senate \nconferees reduced the Senate-passed figure for our guard and reserve \nforces by over $100 million in order to reach an acceptable compromise \nwith the House.\n  In the housing area, the conferees added some $210 million over the \nrequested amount, for a total of $3.9 billion, or 42 percent of the \ntotal bill. Even so, the committee ended up approximately $250 million \nbelow last year's appropriated amount.\n  Furthermore, the committee worked to satisfy the request of Senators \non both sides of the aisle for worthy projects that were not included \nin the request, and I believe we ended up with a very balanced \nrecommendation.\n  I do hope that the President will support the bill as passed, and not \ndisturb the balance that we carefully constructed to satisfy the needs \nof our Nation from coast to coast.\n  Mr. President, I would point out to my colleagues that the conference \nreport protected all the design, minor construction, and reporting \ninitiatives that we included in the Senate report, so my colleagues may \nbe assured that those initiatives which were included in the Senate \nreport have been preserved.\n  Fully 23 percent of the bill is for the base realignment and closure \naccounts, and we have included $153 million for NATO initiatives. I \nwould point out, however, that the Senate report includes a requirement \nfor a report on future costs of NATO expansion, as well as a burden-\nsharing report regarding our initiatives in Southwest Asia. The \ncommittee expects these requirements to be taken seriously and to have \na full report from the Department of Defense on these matters.\n  I am particularly pleased that the conference was able to retain the \nfunding that we included in the Senate-passed bill for new quality-of-\nlife initiatives in Washington, in particular a new library/education \ncenter at Fairchild Air Force Base, a barracks replacement at Fort \nLewis, health clinics at Fort Lewis and Everett Naval Station, an \nexpansion of an important dining facility and a new child development \ncenter at Bremerton Naval Shipyard, and housing at Whidbey Island Naval \nAir Station.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Montana, Senator Burns, for \nthe excellent cooperation that he has extended to me throughout this \nprocess. I want to thank him for all of his courtesies and for the \ncongenial and cooperative way that his staff, particularly Ms. \nAshworth, has extended to all of us. We have enjoyed working with them \nand all their staff. And I thank Dick D'Amato, from my staff, and Ben \nMcMakin for a job well done.\n\n[[Page S9444]]\n\n  I commend this product to the Senate and to the President. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has 1 minute 9 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. BURNS. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Senator McCain wanted to make a statement on this bill, and I \nunderstand he is on his way. As a courtesy to him, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Ron \nMoranville, a fellow working on my staff, be granted privileges during \nthe debate of H.R. 2016.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. For 5 straight years, President Clinton has submitted a \ndefense budget to Congress that reflects the low priority given by this \nadministration to our men and women serving in the Armed Forces. For \nthe past 3 years the Republican Congress has added over $20 billion to \nthe administration's requests in order to provide the resources \nnecessary to ensure the readiness of our forces to protect our Nation's \nsecurity.\n  I fully supported the congressional add-ons for national defense \nbecause I have seen the dangerous effects of declining defense budgets \non military modernization and readiness.\n  However, I simply cannot support the diversion of nearly $1 billion \nof the $2.6 billion added this year for unrequested, low-priority \nmilitary construction projects.\n  This conference agreement on fiscal year 1998 military construction \nspending earmarks funding for 129 building projects totaling $941 \nmillion. This figure includes a plus-up of $268 million for National \nGuard and Reserve projects, including 12 Reserve centers.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that list printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              FISCAL YEAR 1998 CONFERENCE REPORT, APPROPRIATIONS FOR MILITARY CONSTRUCTION ADD-ONS              \n                                          [Dollar amounts in millions]                                          \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                             Budget                             \n         State and installation                   Project title             request       Change    Appropriated\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlabama:                                                                                                        \n    Maxwell AFB........................

Mr. President, pork barrel spending in the defense \nbudgets is not only unwise but potentially dangerous to our national \nsecurity.\n  Wasting scarce defense dollars on unnecessary construction projects \ntakes away from the Pentagon's ability to fund the high-priority \nmodernization and operational requirements identified by the military \nServices.\n  I cannot disagree with those of my colleagues who believe that the \nactive military has failed to allocate the resources necessary to \nensure the readiness of the reserve forces. However, by diverting more \nthan one-third of the congressional add to construction projects for \nthe Reserves, Congress is ignoring the most urgent unfunded \nrequirements that the Reserve components themselves have identified.\n  Certainly, the Pentagon has not been responsive to congressional \ndirection to redress the underfunding of the Reserve components. But I \nthink this bill clearly demonstrates that Congress is over-zealous in \nadding money for the Guard.\n  For example, last year, the Appropriations Committee directed the \nArmy to budget $75 million for Army National Guard military \nconstruction in fiscal year 1998. Unfortunately, the Army failed to \nfollow the committee's direction and budgeted only $45.1 million in the \nbudget request for Army Guard construction projects. But I fail to see \nhow that gap of $30 million should become an add of over $70 million. \nThis conference report provides $118.3 million for Guard construction--\n$43 million more than the Congress said last year should be provided.\n  Another example--The budget request for Air National Guard projects \nwas $60.2 million. This conference report more than tripled that \nnumber, providing $190.4 million in fiscal year 1998 alone for Air \nGuard construction.\n  Mr. President, I am sure there are many programs on the list of add-\nons in this bill. These programs may well be high priorities for \nindividual unit commanders of adjutants general. Undoubtedly, these \nprojects are high priorities for the Members of Congress who requested \nthat they be added to this bill.\n  But, Mr. President, the simple fact is that military training \nexercises continue to be cut back, backlogs in aircraft and ship \nmaintenance continue to grow, there is a shortage of funds for flying \nhours, military health care is underfunded by $600 million, and 11,787 \nservicemembers and their families are reportedly on food stamps.\n  It is unconscionable for the Congress to ignore these urgent \npriorities that directly correlate to military readiness and personnel \nquality of life. I might add, we are now experiencing a hemorrhage of \nqualified pilots out of the Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps.\n  It is wrong to divert much-needed funds from truly high-priority \nneeds to instead fund these building projects.\n  Mr. President, last year, Congress provided the executive branch with \nan important tool to prevent wasteful spending--the line-item veto. \nToday, I am sending a letter to President Clinton urging him, in the \ninterest of national security and fiscal responsibility, to exercise \nhis line-item veto authority and eliminate the $941 million set aside \nfor the 129 unrequested military construction projects contained in \nthis bill.\n  I intend to vote against the bill, and I urge my colleagues to \nconsider very carefully whether they wish to vote in favor of wasting \nnearly $1 billion on these low-priority construction projects.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my letter to the \nPresident be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                               September 17, 1997.\n     Hon. Bill Clinton,\n     The President,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Today, the Congress completed action on \n     the first regular appropriations measure for Fiscal Year \n     1998, the Military Construction Appropriations Act. I am \n     writing to urge you in the strongest possible terms to \n     exercise your line item veto authority to eliminate $941 \n     million in unnecessary spending contained in this bill.\n       This bill contains earmarks for 129 projects which were not \n     included in the Department of Defense budget request because \n     they are lower priority projects than those that were \n     requested by the military Services. As I promised in my \n     August 6, 1997, letter, I am providing a list of the \n     unrequested projects in this bill.\n       As the Commander-in-Chief of our Armed Forces, you bear the \n     primary responsibility for ensuring that our troops are \n     trained, equipped, and ready to protect the security of our \n     nation. Because of the continuing push toward a balanced \n     budget and taxpayer relief, the resources available for vital \n     defense priorities are limited, as are resources for almost \n     every other government priority. Wasting these scarce defense \n     dollars on unnecessary construction projects takes away from \n     the Pentagon's ability to fund its high-priority \n     modernization and operational requirements. This spending \n     habit is not only unwise, but potentially dangerous to our \n     national security.\n       While your exercise of the line item veto to eliminate \n     wasteful earmarks in this bill would not unfortunately make \n     these funds available for other pressing defense needs, it \n     would certainly send a pointed message to Congress from the \n     Commander-in-Chief that this wasteful spending of defense \n     dollars must stop.\n       I recall that, several years ago, you proposed to rescind \n     funding for Congressional add-ons in the military \n     construction accounts. That proposal was defeated by \n     Congressional inaction, but you now have an important tool \n     that increases the prospects for successfully eliminating the \n     add-ons in this military construction bill. Therefore, I urge \n     you again to take advantage of this opportunity to line item \n     veto the $941 million earmarked by Congress for unrequested, \n     low-priority military construction projects.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John McCain,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, we take note of the Senator from Arizona. I \njust made a comment here that the complete emphasis on military \nconstruction has probably doubled toward the quality of life, just \nsince I have been on this committee. We can make those moves as long as \nwe are allowed to make those moves and to continue to fund those things \nthat we think are important in the overall makeup of our military \nreadiness.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support \nfor this bill. I am pleased that the conferees included several \nprojects important to the quality of life and safety at New Jersey's \nmilitary installations, and I thank the conferees for their efforts to \nensure that New Jersey's defense infrastructure needs received adequate \nfunding.\n  I appreciate the willingness of the conferees to provide funding for \nthree important projects at McGuire Air Force Base. The bill includes \n$9.954 million for an Air Mobility Operations Group Warehouse, which \nwill increase the efficiency of the base's mobility operations. \nAdditionally, it includes $35.217 million for an ambulatory health care \ncenter replacement. This new facility will house a full-service \noutpatient operation and provide adequate space for clinics, ambulatory \nsurgery, ancillary services, storage, offices, and administration. It \nwill improve the quality of care provided to our military personnel.\n  I am also pleased the conferees included $8.8 million for a new fire \nstation at McGuire. McGuire's current fire station is inadequate to \nprovide the fire protection and response to aircraft casualties that \nits mission requires. This facility has inadequate communication and \nalarm equipment, insufficient vehicle storage areas, deficient living \nquarters, and inadequate space for training and administrative duties. \nDue to these conditions, in certain situations, I am told that the base \ncannot respond simultaneously to a fire emergency and a 911 call. The \nfunding provided for a new fire station will improve the base's ability \nto respond more adequately and will allow firefighters to execute \nemergency response operations in a more efficient and timely manner.\n\n[[Page S9447]]\n\n  For Fort Monmouth, another important military installation in New \nJersey, I am pleased the conferees included $2.05 million for a new \nfire station. The fort's fire station is currently housed in a World \nWar II vintage structure. This station is charged with protecting the \nbase's numerous research and development facilities, as well as its \nover 1,000 military family housing units. The funding provided for a \nnew fire station will ensure that facilities on the base are adequately \nprotected, and that the Fort Monmouth community has access to the \ntimely response and fire protection services it deserves. This project \nis vital to the safety of the entire Fort Monmouth community, and I am \npleased the conferees agreed to provide funding for this important \nproject.\n  I also appreciate the willingness of the conferees to include funding \nfor two important projects at Picatinny Arsenal. I am pleased they \nprovided $7.3 million to build 35 units of family housing on the base. \nThe existing units have deteriorated since they were constructed in \n1940. Most of these units are undersized and lack basic conveniences \nsuch as air-conditioning. Their electrical, plumbing, and heating \nsystems are poorly configured and inefficient. The funding provided by \nthe conferees will improve the existing living conditions and the \nquality of life for the enlisted and their families. It will produce \nunits of family housing that meet current standards of quality of life, \nenergy conservation, size, and safety.\n  I am also pleased the conferees agreed to provide $1.3 million in \ndesign funding for a new software engineering facility at Picatinny. \nThis funding will allow Picatinny to consolidate the design, \ndevelopment, testing, configuration control, field release and \nmaintenance of weapon systems, simulators, and trainers. It will result \nin reduced cost for the Army and will improve efficiency in the \nsoftware engineering process.\n  These projects are vital to the safety and quality of life of New \nJersey's defense infrastructure. Again, I thank the conferees for their \nsupport of these important projects in the fiscal year 1998 military \nconstruction bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the pending military construction \nappropriations conference agreement provides $9.183 billion in new \nbudget authority and $3.024 billion in new outlays for military \nconstruction and family housing programs for the Department of Defense \nfor fiscal year 1998.\n  When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed \nactions are taken into account, the outlays for the 1998 program total \n$9.862 billion.\n  This legislation provides for construction by the Department of \nDefense for U.S. military facilities throughout the world, and it \nprovides for family housing for the Active Forces of each of the U.S. \nmilitary services. Accordingly, it provides for important readiness and \nquality of life programs for our service men and women.\n  The conference report falls within the current section 602(b) \nallocation for the Military Construction Appropriations Subcommittee. I \ncommend the distinguished subcommittee chairman, the Senator from \nMontana, for bringing this bill to the floor within the subcommittee's \nrevised allocation.\n  The bill provides important increases over the President's request \nfor 1998, and I urge the adoption of the conference report.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of the conference report be placed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n            H.R. 2016, MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS, 1998--SPENDING TOTALS--CONFERENCE REPORT           \n                                   [Fiscal year 1998, in millions of dollars]                                   \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                            Category                              Defense  Nondefense   Crime  Mandatory   Total\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConference report:                                                                                              \n  Budget authority..............................................    9,183        --        --        --    9,183\n  Outlays.......................................................    9,862        --        --        --    9,862\nSenate 302(b) allocation:                                                                                       \n  Budget authority..............................................    9,183        --        --        --    9,183\n  Outlays.......................................................    9,920        --        --        --    9,920\nPresident's request:                                                                                            \n  Budget authority..............................................    8,384        --        --        --    8,384\n  Outlays.......................................................    9,839        --        --        --    9,839\nHouse-passed bill:                                                                                              \n  Budget authority..............................................    9,183        --        --        --    9,183\n  Outlays.......................................................    9,909        --        --        --    9,909\nSenate-passed bill:                                                                                             \n  Budget authority..............................................    9,187        --        --        --    9,187\n  Outlays.......................................................    9,902        --        --        --    9,902\n                                                                                                                \nCONFERENCE REPORT COMPARED TO:                                                                                  \n                                                                                                                \nSenate 302(b) allocation:                                                                                       \n  Budget authority..............................................       --        --        --        --       --\n  Outlays.......................................................      -58        --        --        --      -58\nPresident's request:                                                                                            \n  Budget authority..............................................      799        --        --        --      799\n  Outlays.......................................................       23        --        --        --       23\nHouse-passed bill:                                                                                              \n  Budget authority..............................................       --        --        --        --       --\n  Outlays.......................................................      -47        --        --        --      -47\nSenate-passed bill:                                                                                             \n  Budget authority..............................................       -4        --        --        --       -4\n  Outlays.......................................................      -40        --        --        --      -40\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have now passed our first conference \nreport of the year, and I am hoping that within the next 10 days we \nwill pass at least a half dozen more. I know the chairman is working \nwith Members on both sides of the aisle and with our colleagues on the \nother side of the Capitol to do that. I appreciate the cooperation we \nhave received on appropriations bills, although we seem to be a little \nstalled out here on the Interior appropriations bill. I am not sure the \nMembers are back from the August State work period; we seem to have \ndifficulty in getting Senators to come forward and offer amendments \nthat they say are important.\n  Now, we were on this some last week. We were on the bill yesterday. \nWe have been on it today. We did not have a vote on an amendment all \nday Monday, and I am being told now that, well, we have several very \nimportant amendments. I want to say this is not just directed to our \ncolleagues on the Democratic side. We have four amendments cooking on \nthe National Endowment for the Arts. My answer is, great, let's have a \ndebate and let's vote. And let's do it in the daylight or we will have \nto do it tonight.\n  Now, I have tried very hard for us to do our work during normal \nworking hours like normal people. I know that's very difficult, but \nthat would be helpful. It keeps you from being cranky. It allows us to \nlive somewhat normal lives with our families. But if we refuse to come \nforward with our amendments and agree to reasonable time agreements--\nhow many of you think you are going to change anybody's mind by giving \na 90-minute speech? How many of you think you are going to change\n\n[[Page S9448]]\n\nsomebody's mind on NEA by giving a 30-minute speech on NEA?\n  Come forward, my colleagues, offer your amendments, agree to a \nreasonable time, and let's vote. If we are not going to do it now, we \nwill have to do it tonight because we need to get this appropriations \nbill done.\n  We have made good progress. We have worked together. We have had good \ncooperation. Let's not bog down. If we have a mining amendment, \ngrazing, NEA, let's get them up, let's have reasonable debate with \nhopefully not more than an hour on anything, and let's vote. I believe \nwe can complete this tonight and go on to the FDA reform package that I \nbelieve at least 94 Senators want to do. The Democratic leader has \nagreed to work with me to try to get that done this week, so I urge my \ncolleagues, let's get going here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for helping in \ngetting this debate going. We already have a unanimous-consent \nagreement for a debate on the Ashcroft amendment on the National \nEndowment for the Arts of a maximum of 145 minutes beginning at 1:30. \nSo there will be a vote on or in relation to the Ashcroft amendment \nbefore 4 o'clock. Personally, I hope it is much before 4 o'clock if not \nall of that time is used. There are 2 hours between now and the time at \nwhich that amendment starts.\n  My friend, Senator Bryan, from Nevada, seems perhaps, I hope, ready \nfor a 1\\1/2\\ hour debate on his amendment on forest roads. I am \nattempting to clear that on this side of the aisle and hope I can have \nit done so that we can complete that amendment and have the vote before \nthe NEA debate begins. I do know there are several other National \nEndowment for the Arts amendments that will succeed the Ashcroft \namendment, and maybe one or two others that require votes. Senator \nBumpers may have one on mining.\n  The majority leader is correct; we have been on this bill off and on, \nmostly on, since last Friday. We have yet to have our first rollcall \nvote on the bill or on any amendment to the bill. It is time to get \ngoing, and I believe my colleagues are about ready to do just that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/17/senate-section/article/S9443-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9448-S9449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  1998\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1204.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title I, insert the following:\n       ``Sec. 1   . (a) In this section--\n       (1) the term ``Huron Cemetery'' means the lands that form \n     the cemetery that is popularly known as the Huron Cemetery, \n     located in Kansas City, Kansas as described in subsection \n     b(3);\n       (2) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the \n     Interior;\n       (b)(1) The Secretary shall take such action as may be \n     necessary to ensure that the lands comprising the Huron \n     Cemetery (as described in paragraph (3)) are used only in \n     accordance with this subsection.\n       (2) The lands of the Huron Cemetery shall be used only--\n       (A) for religious and cultural uses that are compatible \n     with the use of the lands as a cemetery; and\n       (B) as a burial ground.\n       (3) The description of the lands of the Huron Cemetery is \n     as follows:\n       The tract of land in the NW 1/4 of sec. 10, T. 11 S., R. 25 \n     E., of the sixth principal meridian, in Wyandotte County, \n     Kansas (as surveyed and marked on the ground on August 15, \n     1888, by William Millor, Civil Engineer and Surveyor), \n     described as follows:\n       ``Commencing on the Northwest corner of the Northwest \n     Quarter of the Northwest Quarter of said Section 10;\n       ``Thence South 28 poles to the `true point of beginning';\n       ``Thence South 71 degrees East 10 poles and 18 links;\n       ``Thence South 18 degrees and 30 minutes West 28 poles;\n       ``Thence West 11 and one-half poles;\n       ``Thence North 19 degrees 15 minutes East 31 poles and 15 \n     feet to the `true point of beginning', containing 2 acres or \n     more.''.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I will not take too much of the \nMembers' time to discuss this amendment, but I think it is a clear, \nnarrow piece of legislation that is an important one, and what it \ninvolves is a particular tract of land in Kansas City that is currently \nbeing used by the Kansas Wyandot Indians, which is an informally \nrecognized tribe, as a burial ground. This tribe has used this tract \nfor a number of years as a burial ground. There is a branch of the \nWyandot Indians in Oklahoma that is an officially recognized tribe that \nseeks to acquire this particular tract of land and have a casino on it.\n  Now, setting aside the dispute about which tribe controls this \nparticular tract of land, I just think it is not an appropriate thing \nfor us to approve, or to allow a tribe, this one in Oklahoma, to \nacquire this land and put a casino on what has been a tribal ancestral \nburial ground. I think it is sacrilegious for that to occur.\n  It is not that we are saying there are not enough casinos in Kansas \nCity; we have a number of them. That is a side issue as well. What we \nseek by this amendment is very narrow, and that is that this tract will \nremain a burial ground and that it will not be used for a casino.\n  We do not seek to mediate the issue of who does the land belong to. \nWe do not seek to establish the Kansas Wyandot tribe as an official \ntribe. That is not a part of it. We don't seek to recognize the Wyandot \nOklahoma Indians' claim to this land. We set all of that aside. This \namendment simply says this land should remain an Indian burial ground \nas it has been for generations and it should not be transferred, it \nshould not be land acquired on which to place a casino.\n  I ask that the Members look at this particular amendment. I am going \nto call it back up for a vote later on if we do not have consent from \nall the Members. This land should not be allowed to be used for a \ncasino. It is hallowed ground and it should be allowed as that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I commend my good friend from Kansas. I \nask the Senator from Kansas to temporarily set this amendment aside \nbecause the chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee is presently \npresiding at a very important hearing, and I believe he would want to \nbe heard. It is not the intention of the committee to stall this but to \naccommodate Senator Campbell. So as soon as he is completed, we will \ntry to resolve this matter.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I concur with my friend from Hawaii. I \nbelieve that this amendment is going to be cleared, but it is \nappropriate that both the chairman and the vice chairman of the \ncommittee be able to speak at least briefly to it. As soon as we have \nheard from the Senator from Colorado, we may be able to pass this \namendment. Personally, I think it is a good amendment, and I commend \nthe Senator from Kansas for bringing it to our attention.\n  Mr. President, unless someone else seeks recognition, I am going to \nsuggest the absence of a quorum. I am desperately attempting to get a \ntime agreement on the Bryan amendment before 12 o'clock so that we can \nfinish that before we begin the debate on the National Endowment for \nthe Arts. In\n\n[[Page S9449]]\n\nthe meantime, if there is anyone else within sound or sight who wishes \nto propose an amendment, we invite their presence.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislate clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts).

He is Governor of the \nBelgorod region of the Russian Federation.

Coming from the \nState of South Dakota, I can assure my colleagues that the NEA and the \nfunding that has gone to my home State of South Dakota has been \nabsolutely critical as seed money for the promotion and the development \nof artistic efforts that have benefited virtually every school \ndistrict, virtually every county, and community across my very large \nand rural State.\n  We have, as so many States do, a great deal of artistic talent, \ncommitment to the arts, but we don't have a lot of corporate sponsors, \nwe don't have a lot of philanthropists, we don't have a lot of sources \nfor funding that can create the seed money that we need for the arts to \nblossom, to bloom in places like South Dakota.\n  The function of this funding has been absolutely critical in our \nState. It has gone to our school and communities, our touring artists, \nartisan school programs. It has gone for our Arts Corps Program for \nSouth Dakota's juvenile correctional facilities in partnership with our \nDepartment of Corrections and the South Dakota Arts Council. It has \ngone for the Indian services to sponsor the Northern Plains tribal art \nshow and market, which has created a whole new environment, a whole new \nseries of opportunities for Northern Plains Native Americans to develop \ntheir artistic skills and to market those skills. It has gone for our \nYouth at Risk Program. It has gone for our Arts in the Classroom \nTeachers' Conference, and it has created a whole new environment for \nthe arts in our State.\n  When I look back at what existed prior to 1965 when the NEA was \ncreated, we had people with great artistic talent in the State then, \ntoo, but we didn't have the structure to really promote the arts. Now, \nthanks to the seed money of the NEA over the years, we have in place \nthe South Dakota Arts Council, we have in place the South Dakota Museum \nAssociation, the Rural Arts Presenting Program, Dakota Prairie \nPlayhouse, the Black Hills Chamber Music Society for Big Sioux Arts \nCouncil. We have literally pages of arts organizations that now exist \nin every county, in virtually every community of our State that did not \nexist prior to the creation of the NEA.\n  So, Mr. President, I can't emphasize too much the importance of this \norganization to enhance the quality of life for those who would \notherwise not have great opportunities to experience performance art or \nart of any kind without this. I think we need to keep in mind that the \nissue here is really a philosophic one and not so much a budget issue.\n  There is $100 million involved here for the Nation's entire artistic \neffort, less, I might add, relative to the budget and that of any other \nWestern industrialized nation on Earth, but that portion of money has \ngone a long, long ways in our country. And, in fact, to keep this in \nsome sort of perspective, we are going to be debating later on this \nmonth a defense appropriations bill where there are those in conference \nwho would like us to purchase nine more B-2 bombers at a cost of $1 \nbillion apiece. Our entire arts program, that goes to every school, \nevery county and every city in our Nation costs one-tenth of one \nbomber. It costs less than it would cost to maintain this fleet of \naircraft that the Pentagon does not even want.\n  So this is, relative to the entire budget, a modest effort, less than \nwhat other countries devote, but yet crucially, crucially important, \nnot just for large urban areas and large artistic organizations, but \nfor those of us in rural America who find this an absolute lifeline.\n  It is certainly my hope that by the time we conclude the debate on \nthe Interior appropriations bill today that we will find our way to \ninsist that there continues to be a strong Federal-local, public-\nprivate partnership in the arts that has gone on now for over 30 years \nand which has been responsible, I think, for an enormous amount of very \nconstructive, positive effort for our children, for the quality of life \nin our communities, big and small.\n  I know that there are several amendments pending. I won't go into \ndetail about each of them, other than to say, again, I certainly ask my \ncolleagues to very carefully review these amendments. It is critical \nthat when the day is done that we continue to have modest but \nresponsible funding for the arts in the United States.

Mr. President, I want to take just a few minutes of the \nSenate's time to comment upon the passage of Senate bill 1061, the \nLabor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act.\n  During the 104th Congress, the bill from this subcommittee was the \ncenter of political controversy between the Congress and the White \nHouse, and within the Senate itself. We did not succeed in passing a \nbill as a separate measure for these functions in the 104th Congress.\n  Thursday's vote of 91 to 8 sent a clear signal of the Senate's \nsupport for the leadership shown by Senators Specter and Harkin. They \ncrafted a bill that emerged from our Appropriations Committee \nunanimously.\n  The statement of administration policy raised a few differences, but \nit indicated strong bipartisan support for this bill. The most \ncontentious votes we have faced this year on appropriations bills were \non the Labor, Health and Human Services bill.\n  Despite the strong feelings generated by those issues, the debate was \nfair. The entire Senate came together to pass the bill, and sent the \nunambiguous message that I referred to--we want to see this bill \nenacted this year.\n  Supporting the work of the subcommittee has been an extremely \nexperienced and effective staff. Craig Higgins serves as clerk of the \nsubcommittee. He is joined by Marsha Simon, who assists Senator Harkin \nas the minority clerk. Bettilou Taylor, Dale Cabaniss, Lula Edwards, \nand Carole Geagley round out the subcommittee staff.\n  I commend not only the chairman and ranking member but all of the \nstaff for the hard work and the effort they put into preparing the bill \nin a fashion that received such strong, strong support in the \ncommittee, and from the Senate.\n  We eagerly now await the passage of that bill by the House, so we can \nhave the conference commence and get the bill to the President prior to \nSeptember 30, I hope.\n  I also report to the Senate that the Agriculture and legislative \nconferences are proceeding. We should have those bills from conference \ntoday.\n  We have just passed a military construction bill.\n  We have in conference the Department of Defense conference which had \nits first meeting yesterday.\n  The VA-HUD bill, the Energy bill, the foreign ops bill, and \nTransportation--we expect, Mr. President, all of those will be out of \nconference early next week.\n  That will leave us five bills to still finish.\n  The District of Columbia bill has not passed the Senate yet, nor the \nHouse.\n  We have before us now, under the guidance of the Senator from \nWashington [Mr. Gorton], the Interior bill. We expect it to be finished \nhere this week and go to conference and, hopefully, come back to the \nSenate next week.\n  As I have said, the Labor, Health and Human Services bill, the House \nneeds to pass that. We hope it will get to it soon. That will leave us \nthe Commerce, State, Justice bill, and the Treasury bill--all of which, \nMr. President, it is still our goal to try and get them to the \nPresident by the 30th of September.\n  Mr. President, it will mean perhaps, though, we will have to have \nstill a continuing resolution to give the President the time that he \nneeds to review all of these bills. I am hopeful that the House will \nsend us a continuing resolution--a clean continuing resolution--\nsometime early next week.\n  I commend the Senator from Washington on this bill. I am hopeful the \nSenate will work with us to make sure that this bill is finished here \ntoday, if it is at all possible.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am always pleased, when I have the \nopportunity, as I do this afternoon, to support, and in this instance \nactually propose, legislation that benefits both the American taxpayer \nand the environment.\n  The amendment I am offering today eliminates a subsidy used primarily \nby large timber companies that not only has negative consequences for \nthe taxpayers but also a detrimental effect on the environment.\n  Each year, American taxpayers spend millions of dollars to subsidize \nthe construction of roads needed for logging on national forest lands.\n\n[[Page S9451]]\n\n  The appropriations bill before us today contains a $47.4 million \nappropriation for the Forest Service to assist in the construction and \nreconstruction of timber roads in our national forests. In addition, \nthe bill, and accompanying report, provide affirmative direction to the \nForest Service instructing them to continue the purchaser credit \nprogram without limitation.\n  The purchaser credit program allows the Forest Service to subsidize \nthe road construction costs of timber companies by granting credits to \nthem equal to the estimated cost of the roads that they need in order \nto access their timber. The timber purchasers can then use the credits \nto pay for the timber being harvested. Last year these purchaser \ncredits were valued at nearly $50 million.\n  In the House-passed version of the Interior appropriations bill a \nlimit of $25 billion was placed on the value of purchaser credits that \nmay be offered by the Forest Service in fiscal year 1998. The bill \nbefore the Senate today eliminates this cap completely, and the report \naccompanying the bill makes it clear that ``The committee has not \nspecified a ceiling for the amount of purchaser credits which can be \noffered'' to timber companies. The result of this language is an open-\nended subsidy for the timber industry.\n  My amendment stands for a very simple proposition. If a timber \npurchaser needs to build a road to harvest timber, the timber purchaser \nshould have to pay for it. The amendment which I am offering eliminates \nthe purchaser credit program and cuts $10 million from the Forest \nService timber road construction and reconstruction account.\n  In addition, my amendment provides that road construction costs \nincurred by timber purchasers are to be treated as timber revenues for \nthe purpose of payment to States for use on roads and schools in the \ncounties where national forests are located. The result of this latter \nprovision is that counties will be held harmless as a result of the \nelimination of the purchaser credit program.\n  For those of my colleagues who are not familiar with this program, \nlet me give a brief description of how the purchaser credit program \noperates. When the Forest Service wants to use purchaser credits to \nbuild the road to a planned timber sale, and parenthetically that is \nabout 90 percent of the time, it must estimate the cost to build the \nroad, the value of the timber in the sale area, and the road right-of-\nway. Prospective purchasers go through a similar process of estimating \ntheir roadbuilding costs and their estimated value of the timber they \nmust pay for to the Forest Service.\n  Considering all of these factors, the prospective purchasers submit \ntheir bids accordingly. When a purchaser is awarded the contract for \nthe timber sale the Forest Service establishes the dollar value of the \npurchaser road credit attached to that sale and credits the account in \nthat amount to the timber contract holder as the road is constructed. \nThe contractor, therefore, has immediate access to the credits to be \nused in place of cash deposits and the agency, the purchaser, is also \ngiven discretion to use the credit on any timber sale contract that it \nholds in the forest. The Forest Service allows the transfer of \npurchaser credits between timber sales located within the same national \nforest.\n  Now the ability to transfer credits aids a purchaser's ability to \nmanage its timber sale portfolio cash flow. Since road construction \noften delays timber harvest, purchasers who can rapidly transfer road \ncredits to another sale from their portfolio can attain lower portfolio \nmanagement costs. The result is analogous to an interest-free loan for \ntimber purchasers.\n  The opponents of this amendment contend eliminating the purchaser \nroad credit will devastate the timber industry. Their claim could not \nbe further from the truth. The Bureau of Land Management in several \nStates is successful at selling timber and getting the necessary roads \nconstructed without the use of the purchaser road credit that is \nexclusive to the Forest Service. The effects on the Forest Service \ntimber sale program of eliminating the purchaser credit program and \nrequiring that roads be constructed pursuant to specified standards as \nthe BLM and the States require would be environmentally and \neconomically beneficial.\n  Eliminating road credits will force purchasers to internalize the \ncost of road construction into their bid price for the timber. The \nresult is a more balanced system that provides equal treatment for all \npurchasers of publicly owned timber, BLM and Forest Service lands. \nWithout the purchaser credit program it is likely that fewer roads \nwould be built and less habitat would be fragmented. Purchasers are \nless likely to want to build extensive road networks if they have to \npay cash for them.\n  Consequently, timber sales with high road building costs will be less \nattractive to purchasers than timber sales with low or no road building \ncosts.\n  Another important aspect of eliminating the purchaser credit program \nis that it will shift responsibility for estimating road costs from the \nForest Service to purchasers. If markets are competitive, such a shift \nshould provide a more accurate and an efficient road cost accounting \nsystem.\n  An independent study of timber sales in the Pacific Northwest found \nthat the Forest Service estimates for road construction costs can be as \nmuch as 30 percent higher than actual costs for the industry to build \nthose roads. A recent report from the General Accounting Office \ndiscovered that Forest Service estimates of road costs include a profit \nmargin for purchasers. It also found that the Forest Service lacked \naccountability for the accuracy of their road cost estimates because \npurchasers are not required to report actual costs of construction and \nreconstruction. So if actual road costs are overestimated, the extra \npurchaser credits awarded and subsequently traded for timber represent \na windfall profit for the purchaser, a profit that comes at the \npublic's expense. This inefficient situation would be eliminated if \npurchaser credits were abolished.\n\n  Contrary to what you will hear from my opponents of this proposal, my \namendment will not end logging in the national forests. Requiring \ntimber purchasers to pay for road construction costs will likely reduce \ntimber sales in roadless areas where the environmental and economic \ncosts of logging are the greatest. I believe this is sound public \npolicy. Roadless areas are not good places to produce commercial timber \nbecause they tend to be a high elevation, steep, and inaccessible. The \ntimber sales in these areas are the ones that cause by far the most \nenvironmental problems and the ones which are the biggest money losers \nbecause of the high cost of road building.\n  Let me invite my colleagues' attention to an excellent article \nentitled ``Quiet Roads Bring in Thundering Protests,'' an article that \nran earlier this year in the New York Times that illustrated the \nenvironmental damage caused by road construction. A biologist with the \nIdaho Fish and Game Department, Chip Corsi, notes in the article that \nresearchers have found that as little as 1.7 miles of road per square \nmile forest have the effect of reducing the complement of fish species \nin an area. Mr. Corsi added that in Idaho, in Coeur d'Alene National \nForest we have from 4 to 10 to 15, up to 20 miles of road per square \nmile, so it is extreme. That is his direct quote.\n  Many scientists have found that road building threatens wildlife \nbecause it causes erosions of soils, fragments intact forest \necosystems, encourages the spread of noxious weeds and invasive species \nand reduces habitat for many animals needing a refuge from man.\n  It has been found that when the roads wash out they dump rocks and \nsoil on lower slopes into stream beds and even when they remain intact, \nroads act as channels for water and contribute further to the erosion \nof lands and streams.\n  Let me invite my colleagues' attention to one example of that. This \nis the Clearwater National Forest in Idaho. At the top of the picture \none can see a road cut through the forest. This is the erosion that has \noccurred as a result of a road having been logged and the runoff \nsedimentation that has occurred as a consequence of that. That is a \nmajor contributing problem to the environmental degradation that is \noccurring in our national forests.\n  Scientists say the overall effect is that the streams and rivers fill \nwith silt, and the shallower waters mean degraded fish habitat and more \nflooding. Many of my colleagues are aware that\n\n[[Page S9452]]\n\nthe declining water quality of lakes, rivers, and streams in our \nnational forests is a serious problem.\n  The USDA Undersecretary Jim Lyons has stated that our No. 1 water \nquality problem in the national forest system is roads. According to \nthe Forest Service, 922 communities get their drinking waters from \nnational forest streams that are frequently adversely affected by \nbuilding logging roads. In Idaho, over 960 streams are rated as water-\nquality limited by the EPA because of contamination. Over half of these \nstreams are degraded by logging and roadbuilding. In addition, after \nthe winter storms of 1995 and 1996 in the Pacific Northwest, the Forest \nService found that in Idaho 70 percent of the 422 landslides were \nassociated with logging.\n  In my home State of Nevada, the road network through Lake Tahoe has \nbeen identified as a major contributor to the degradation of water \nquality and decline in the clarity of the lake. Mr. President, I know \nthis firsthand, having spent a decade of my life as a resident of \nnorthern Nevada and having over the last 50 years visited the Lake \nTahoe basin frequently.\n  During the President and Vice President's recent visit to Lake Tahoe \nthe President announced that the Forest Service would decommission or \nobliterate roughly 290 miles of old logging roads in the basin over the \nnext 10 years.\n  At Lake Tahoe, Mr. President, we have seen a rapid and radical \ndecline in water clarity. One of the most pristine lakes in North \nAmerica and the entire world, marveled at by Mark Twain and all of the \nearly pioneers at one time, a little more than a decade ago, you could \nsee 100 feet into the bottom of parts of that lake. In less than 30 \nyears there has been an environmental degradation of more than a third. \nSo today you can actually see, in terms of clarity of the water, less \nthan 70 feet. A primary cause is the logging of that basin, initially \nduring the Comstock Lode and the mining discoveries of the mid-to-late \n19th century.\n  I observed firsthand, not as a scientist but as a layman, looking at \nthe roads and seeing the runoff that occurs. The siltation that occurs, \nthat goes into the lake, has been a serious environmental problem. It \nhas been estimated that it will require several hundred millions of \ndollars in order for this clarity and the environmental degradation \nthat is occurring on an ongoing basis to be reversed. There are no \nguarantees, even at that.\n\n  My point, Mr. President, is we may have been ignorant in the past as \nto what caused the problems. Those of our forebears a century ago were \nless knowledgeable than we are of the environmental consequences. But \nit certainly cannot be an excuse for our generation because we know \nwhat the costs are, and the costs are not just in the new road \nconstruction itself. The costs lasts for generations thereafter as we \npay as American taxpayers to try to abate or minimize or mitigate the \ndamage that will occur.\n  Now, opponents of this amendment will claim that forest roads need \nmoney to be maintained and that the cuts contained in my amendment will \nallow roads to deteriorate, causing further environmental damage. I \nwant to speak to this point. The amendment which I offer does not \naffect the Forest Service road maintenance budget. I want to repeat \nthat: The amendment which is offered this afternoon does not affect the \nForest Service road maintenance budget. This amendment only eliminates \nthe subsidy of new timber roads. These are entirely separately funded \naccounts within the Forest System.\n  As a matter of public policy, I would argue it makes more sense to \nmaintain roads that we already have than spending a great deal of money \nbuilding new roads. Forest Service Chief Michael Dombeck has stated \nthat there is a $440 million backlog of maintenance needed on 232,000 \nmiles of national forest roads. Addressing this need would have \nconsiderable environmental benefits such as reducing erosion from roads \nand stormproofing existing culverts. It is important to remember that \nthe timber industry's responsibility for maintaining logging roads ends \nwith the sale of timber and its subsequent harvest, leaving all future \nmaintenance costs to the American taxpayer.\n  I want to emphasize once again, as I did a moment ago, the \ndistinction between road reconstruction and road maintenance. Opponents \nof this amendment will seek to measure the distinction but road \nconstruction means starting with an abandoned road which may have trees \ngrowing in it and may be partly contoured and rebuilding it for the \npurpose of entering an area to conduct logging activities.\n  Reconstruction is only undertaken for access to timber sales. \nMaintenance is keeping any forest road, timber, recreation, or general \npurpose, in good repair. The average cost of maintaining a mile of road \nis about $543. The average cost of reconstructing a mile of road is \nmore than $12,000 a mile. Consequently, cutting funds for \nreconstruction will not hurt road maintenance.\n  Now, another erroneous claim I want to address involves whether \nlogging roads are needed for recreational activities in the national \nforest. The answer, Mr. President, is no. According to the Forest \nService, logging roads are built at a lower standard and cost less than \nrecreation and general purpose roads. Logging roads are usually unpaved \ndirt and are often usable only by high-clearance vehicles, while \nrecreation and general purpose roads generally are either paved or \ngravel and are usable by all passenger cars.\n  On average, purchaser credit logging roads cost $15,000 per mile in \n1996, while recreation roads cost $63,000, and general purpose roads \ncost $65,000 per mile. The Forest Service plans to construct over 130 \nmiles of recreation and general purpose roads in fiscal year 1998. My \namendment would not reduce funding for either of these two accounts.\n  Mr. President, let me be perfectly clear on what my amendment does \nnot do. It does not--I repeat, it does not--prohibit logging or road \nconstruction in roadless areas. There is no provision in this amendment \nthat even references roadless areas. Many interest groups opposed to \nthis amendment have circulated erroneous information claiming that road \nconstruction would be prohibited in roadless areas. I can assure my \ncolleagues that is not the case. In any event, roadless areas are only \na small portion of the timber base in our national forests, and the \nnational forests provide only 4 percent of the Nation's overall wood \nfor paper products.\n  Let me illustrate that point, if I may, Mr. President. One can see \nwhat has occurred in terms of the timber harvest in the country and on \nthe national forests. This chart begins in 1950 and continues through \n1995. We can see that the overall U.S. timber harvest, both national \nforests and otherwise, has by and large increased over the last 45 \nyears. It would appear to be in the area of about 18 billion cubic feet \na year. You can also see what happened with respect to the national \nforests. The amount that is harvested there has been declining in \nrecent years, and I believe that is because there is a recognition that \nthere are other important values that the National Forest Service \nprovides to the American people: recreational opportunities, esthetic \nvalues, habitat protection, all of which seem to be reflected in this \ntrend line.\n  So my point is that the National Forest Service timber harvest \nrepresents about 4 percent of the Nation's overall harvest and, in my \nview, will not have an economic consequence that will, in any way, make \nit impossible for the United States to meet its harvest requirements.\n  Now, my amendment does not eliminate all funding for timber road \nconstruction either. A similar amendment was offered in the House by \nCongressman Porter and Congressman Kennedy, which would have eliminated \nvirtually all funding for timber road construction. That amendment, \nincidentally, was very, very narrowly defeated on a vote of 211 to 209. \nLet me make the point again. The Porter-Kennedy amendment would have \neliminated virtually all funding for new timber road construction.\n  My amendment would reduce the amount of the current appropriation, as \nproposed, by $10 million, reducing it from a $47.4 million budget. \nOpponents of this amendment are somewhat disingenuous when they claim \nthat it will decimate the timber road construction program.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to make my colleagues aware that this\n\n[[Page S9453]]\n\namendment has the strong support of the Clinton administration. I want \nto introduce into the Record a copy of the letter from the Secretary of \nthe Department of Agriculture, Mr. Dan Glickman.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n     Hon. Richard H. Bryan,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Dick: As we discussed on the phone last night, the \n     Administration strongly supports the amendment you plan to \n     offer to the fiscal year (FY) 1998 Interior appropriations \n     bill to eliminate the Forest Service's purchaser road credit \n     program and reduce funding for road construction in the \n     national forests.\n       There are nearly 380,000 miles of roads on the national \n     forests. Roads represent one of the greatest environmental \n     problems on the forests because of the extensive damage they \n     cause to soils, water quality, and fish and wildlife habitat. \n     A recent Forest Service study indicated that forest roads \n     increase the likelihood of landslides, thus creating a public \n     safety problem in urbanizing areas in the West. For these \n     reasons, rather than building new roads, the Administration \n     is refocusing its efforts on repairing damage from the \n     existing road network, eliminating thousands of miles of \n     unneeded roads, and proposing the policies reflected in your \n     amendment.\n       The President's FY 1998 budget proposed elimination of the \n     purchaser credit program because it reflects an outdated \n     policy that permits timber purchasers to exchange national \n     forest timber for road construction costs, providing them an \n     unwarranted subsidy, thus facilitating entry into roadless \n     areas and causing the environmental problems noted above.\n       Consistent with the Administration's policy, we support the \n     provisions in your amendment to protect payments to counties \n     and small businesses. Purchaser road credits are now included \n     in the calculation of payments to counties associated with \n     timber sales. Your amendment ensures that there is no net \n     loss of payments to counties despite elimination of purchaser \n     credits. In addition, through protection of the purchaser \n     elect program, your amendment ensures that small businesses \n     which may not have the capital to pay for road construction \n     can continue to compete with larger companies for Forest \n     Service timber sales.\n       Although the $10 million reduction in road construction \n     funding proposed in your amendment is below the \n     Administration's budget request, through efficiencies and the \n     expanded use of existing road infrastructure the Forest \n     Service can still achieve the fundamental objectives of its \n     management plans. Recent Administration budgets have \n     reflected this trend in reducing road construction funding, \n     and your amendment is consistent with this trend.\n       Thank you for your leadership in seeking to reduce \n     unnecessary road building on the national forests and your \n     support for eliminating the purchaser credit program. I look \n     forward to working with you to achieve passage of the \n     amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Dan Glickman,\n                                                        Secretary.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, Secretary Glickman's letter is in strong \nsupport of the amendment that I am offering this afternoon. I also add, \nMr. President, that the amendment is also strongly supported by a broad \ncoalition of environmental and taxpayer organizations, including the \nWilderness Society, Sierra Club, Friends of Earth, U.S. PERG, Taxpayers \nfor Common Sense, and Citizens Against Government Waste. In addition, \nmore than 60 newspapers across the country have editorialized in \nsupport of the amendment.\n  I simply close by making this observation, and I ask my colleagues to \nconsider this one important point. If the purchaser credit program is \nnot a subsidy for the timber purchasers, as the opponents of this \namendment claim, then why are they fighting so hard to preserve it?\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues can join with those advocates of \nthe environment, those advocates of responsible governmental fiscal \npractices and support this amendment, because it is a win for the \nenvironment and a win for the American taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of the time. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada states that it is \nnot the purpose of this amendment to terminate harvesting in our \nnational forests. He also states that it is the intent of the amendment \nto reduce harvesting in our national forests. He recognizes that the \nimpact of the amendment will be to lower the gross income of the Forest \nService from timber sales because, obviously, bids will reflect the \ncost of constructing roads. He says that the amendment will not \nterminate the construction of roads in roadless areas, but that the \nconstruction of roads in roadless areas is wrong.\n  Now, I guess the question that one must ask of the Senator from \nNevada, and the outside organizations that back his amendment, is, what \nis their view toward the harvesting of forest products in our national \nforests? The Senator from Nevada has graced us with a set of graphs and \na chart that indicates increasing harvests on private lands and rapidly \ndecreasing harvests on public lands. In the 1980's, nearly 12 billion \nboard feet a year were harvested from Forest Service lands--a harvest \nsmaller in board feet than the regeneration of those lands. Today, that \nlevel is below 4 million board feet. In other words, harvests on those \nlands have been reduced by more than two-thirds. How much more \nreduction does the Senator from Nevada propose?\n  The organizations that he proudly announced are supporting his \namendment, by and large, have as their articulated policy that there \nshould be no harvest on public lands anywhere, at any time, under any \ncircumstances. And while this amendment, standing alone, will not have \nthat effect, it is clearly designed as a part of a campaign to end all \nsuch harvests.\n  At the present time, again, as indicated by the chart that the \nSenator from Nevada has there, only about 5 percent of the Nation's \nsoftwood comes from Forest Service lands, but 50 percent of the volume \nis located on those lands. Since the policies that have resulted in \nthat dramatic decrease have taken place, the average price of an 1,800-\nsquare-foot new home has gone up about $2,000. Almost $3 billion from \nthe pockets of American home purchasers is the result of those efforts \nto save the spotted owl and to meet other of the priorities so \neloquently set out by the Senator from Nevada.\n  Interestingly enough, when an outside organization--Price \nWaterhouse--filed a report entitled ``Financing Roads on the National \nForests,'' it reached this conclusion:\n\n       The forest roads program does not contain a subsidy for \n     timber purchasers. It provides an efficient and effective \n     mechanism for financing road construction and reconstruction.\n\n  Interestingly enough, the administration, at least as recently as \nJanuary and February, agreed totally with that position, and it \nindicates no savings associated with the elimination of the forest \nroads program.\n  Moreover, the appropriation for forest roads that we are defending \nhere today is the administration's own proposal. This is not a budget \nthat increases that appropriation; it is a budget that reflects that \nappropriation. Is the Senator from Nevada seriously presenting to us \nthe proposition that this Clinton administration is engaged in \nirresponsible forest harvest contracting, that it is ignoring \nenvironmental and fiscal concerns and causing our forests to be \nharvested at an unsustainable or environmentally harmful rate? He must \nbe making that proposition. He wants the two-thirds reduction that has \ntaken place over the course of the last decade to be a more-than-two-\nthirds reduction. He wants this administration to stop what he \nconsiders irresponsible contracting for forest harvesting in our \nnational forests.\n  Mr. President, no one who is concerned with any kind of balance in \nthe management of our national forests can possibly reach the \nconclusion that the Clinton administration's Forest Service management \nand supervision is recklessly and irresponsibly harvesting our national \nforests. Almost all of the criticism is on the other side, except for \nthe organizations that are backing this amendment, whose position is \nthat the only good harvest is no harvest at all.\n  Now, if the Senator from Nevada believes that, I think it would be \nmore forthright simply to propose that and see whether or not the \nMembers of the Senate agree. But this forest roads program, the way in \nwhich it was set up, is designed to see to it that the roads are built \nefficiently and well, according to Forest Service standards, and \nappropriately paid for. Simply to take money out of one pocket and put \nit into another will not, in any way, enhance the Federal Treasury. \nBids will\n\n[[Page S9454]]\n\nbe lower--probably considerably lower--as the risk of costs have \nshifted from one side to another and the quality of roads will be \nlower. But let's look at the entire program that we are talking about \nhere.\n  In fact, of this entire appropriation for 1996, only a very modest \namount is for the construction of roads; the great bulk is for \nreconstruction. From the credit system, from the appropriation, \npractically none is for construction, and a modest amount is for \nreconstruction. But three-quarters of the amount is for the \nobliteration of roads, about which the Senator from Nevada spoke so \neloquently. Eighty percent of all of the reconstruction that is so \nimportant is paid for by purchaser credit, not by appropriations on the \npart of this body. In fact, Mr. President, the net result of passing \nthis amendment will not only be a further reduction in harvest, it will \nbe a dramatic reduction in the availability of our forests from a wide \nrange of recreational activity. It will be the de facto creation of \nmore tens of billions of acres that cannot effectively be enjoyed by \nthe vast majority of the people of the United States.\n\n  I want to emphasize that in this case we are defending the \nrecommendations in the budget of the President and of the Forest \nService--a Forest Service that has designed the reduction and harvest \nas far as it has gone. And I believe that the most appropriate points \nfor the proponents of this amendment to make are having reduced our \nForest Service harvest by two-thirds, having shifted almost 95 percent \nof all of the harvesting of forest products onto private lands that \ncontain 50 percent of the resource. How much further do they wish to \ngo? Their supporters say no harvest at all. This amendment is one \ndramatic step toward that goal.\n  Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator from Idaho may wish \nto take.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me thank my chairman for yielding. Let \nme also congratulate him for the clarity with which he spoke to this \nissue.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition today to the amendment of the \nSenator from Nevada. I hope that in the course of what I have to say, \nMr. President, that my opposition is clear. This comes to the issue the \nchairman and the Senator from Washington put so clearly.\n  The Sierra Club some months ago, the Inland Empire Public Lands \nCouncil from the inner Pacific Northwest some weeks ago, and other \norganizations have come out with a policy for zero cut of timber on \npublic lands. This is a national position that is well articulated by \nsome of the more extreme environmental groups.\n  I think the Senator from Washington is absolutely correct. I believe \nthis is step 1 in a 5- or 6-year plan. This amendment cuts about one-\nfifth of the resource for road building. If this is accomplished, then \nnext year they will try for a little more, and the next year even more, \nand the incremental game that has been played over the last several \ndecades that has significantly changed the character of public land use \nis accomplished--in this instance, the elimination of timber harvest on \npublic lands.\n  The Senator from Nevada spoke of subsidies. Let me say as loudly and \nas clearly as I can that there are no subsidies. He is wrong. He talks \nabout saving the taxpayers' money. He is wrong. The Price Waterhouse \nstudy that I have in my hand says so. Many others who have analyzed the \nprogram of purchaser credit also agree. The rhetoric of purchaser \ncredits being subsidies may sound good when you suggest larger timber \ncompanies get money--taxpayer money. If this were the case, then that \nis subsidy, and that is wrong. It has no intent, and it doesn't improve \nin this instance the environment, or the ability of our forested lands \nto be ongoing and productive in their production of fiber for the \ncitizens of our country.\n  So let me say very clearly that Senator Bryan's amendment does not \nspeak to subsidy because it does not exist. And it does not speak to \nsaving money because it would not happen.\n  In addition, the amendment would eliminate beyond an actual cut of 20 \npercent of the $47 million that is in this budget for proposed new \ntimber roads. It would cut, of course, the purchaser credit. And that \nis where the argument on subsidies rests. This program was crafted by a \nDemocrat Congress in 1964. It doesn't mean they were right. It doesn't \nmean they were wrong. At the time using the best analysis they could \nand an appropriate decision as it relates to how stumpage fees could \nbest be utilized for the benefit of the taxpayer, they came up with \nthis method. It was thoughtful legislating at that time, and I think it \nremains so today. It is a good policy. Let me try to explain why it is \ngood policy and not a subsidy. Let me also explain why I challenge the \nSenator from Nevada on his arguments, because if I make a challenge I \nought to be able to prove it. It is only fair and right that I do so.\n\n  The purchaser road credit system has been utilized for more than 20 \nyears. It allows purchasers to earn credits equal to the estimated cost \nof constructing roads specified in a timber sale contract. The \npurchaser can then use the credit to pay for the timber harvest. As \nwith the regular forest road program which utilizes appropriated funds, \nthe purchaser road credit program primarily supports the reconstruction \nof existing roads. The Senator from Washington has already very clearly \nspoken to that diagram effectively in the chart that he has before us. \nOf the total number of miles of timber sales roads built nationwide in \nfiscal 1995, about 90 percent were done with purchaser road credits. \nApproximately 80 percent of the purchaser road credits were used for \nthe purpose of reconstructing.\n  I thought it was important to mention this because the Senator from \nNevada spoke passionately about the Tahoe Basin, an area which I am \nvery familiar with the way it has been harvested or rather not \nharvested. This lack of harvest has attributed to the fuel buildup that \ngoes on in that region, affected the wellness of the trees, and most \nimportantly created a potential catastrophic environment that could \nexist in a drought situation causing massive fire. He speaks of roads, \nroad conditions, and road maintenance. Purchaser credits have gone \ntoward maintaining and improving, through reconstruction, more roads \nthan hard dollars do. Every one of those roads is built to \nenvironmental standards which actually improves the environmental \nsituation.\n  In my State of Idaho last year--an exceptionally wet year--we had \nroad blowouts; land and hillside blowouts in our national forests where \nman had never been. But the biggest problem occurred in areas where \nroads had not been reconstructed or effectively maintained.\n  So, if the Senator from Nevada wants to talk about maintaining roads \nand improving road environments that create less sedimentation and a \nbetter water quality in Lake Tahoe, then he ought to be coming with \nmore money. Because money does not exist in the budget, money does not \nexist to improve road conditions. Therefore, environmental conditions \nis the very thing that he is trying to eliminate.\n  But back to the issue of subsidy. I brought this chart along to \ndemonstrate the point. The point is really quite simple. If you are \ngoing to log the trees off the land, you have to get to the trees. \nThere are Federal trees on Federal land. Who ought to build the road? \nThe Senator and I come from large ranching States. You have cattle out \nin the corral in the back of the ranch, and you want to sell them to a \ncattle buyer. He has to get the trucks to the corral. You say, ``Build \nthe roads to the corral, cattle buyer, and you can have the cattle.''\n  He will say, ``OK. And I will bid you $5 less a head because I have \nto spend money to build the road.''\n  Or, you can say, ``No. I will get the road built. I will pay for the \nroad. Therefore, bid me the market price on my cattle.''\n  That is the same scenario that goes on with public timberlands \nbecause, as the Senator from Nevada said, the timber company leaves and \nthe road is still there. Yes, it is. It is a Federal road paid for by \nFederal money, owned by the Forest Service, utilized by the citizens \nonce it is used for logging.\n  Here is a good example. If the market value of the timber on a timber \nsale is $100, and you use the purchaser credit, it costs you $40 to \nbuild the road. You have a purchaser credit of $40. So you bid the \nmarket price for the timber. You bid $100. The net receipts are $60 \nbecause the purchaser road credit was\n\n[[Page S9455]]\n\nconstructed. If you do not have purchaser road credits it is still \ngoing to cost $40 to build the road. The logging contractor bid to the \nForest Service less money because he is going to sell the trees to pay \nfor the road he will build. So the purchaser credit is zero. He bids \n$60. He doesn't bid $100. He bids $60, and the net receipt is $60.\n\n  Is that a subsidy, or is that a method of building roads that in 1964 \nthis Congress and this Senate decided was appropriate? Call it a \nsubsidy? I don't think you can. Try it, if you might. Price Waterhouse \nsays no. Economists say no. The reason they say no is because of this \nexact chart.\n  The Senator from Nevada says, ``Well, BLM does it differently. They \njust sell the timber, and the logger builds the road.'' Yes. They do. \nPrice Waterhouse would analyze that, and every economist would analyze \nthat and say on the ONC--Oregon and California--lands in Oregon, where \nthe BLM has the bulk of the timber from all of their landholding across \nthe country, they do as the Senator from Nevada suggests. But the \neconomists would say the quality of that timber value is depressed in \nstumpage because the logger takes the price of the road out of the \nsale.\n  Why is that important for Idaho, then? Why am I standing here \nconcerned? Well, the Senator knows why. The Senator knows that in \ncurrent law a share of the stumpage value is returned to local counties \nfor schools and for roads. In his State of Nevada, down on the Toiyabe, \nit looks like they get a few dollars. They do not get anywhere the \namount of money that Idaho, Oregon, Washington, or northern California \ngets. Why? If you are from Nevada, you know why. It isn't a timbered \nState, in large part. It is a high desert State--not a lot of trees, \nexcept in very few areas; primarily in the north, where the Senator is \nfrom, and down on the tip in the south.\n  The bottom line is when you bid a timber sale you and bid $60 rather \nthan $100 because you are taking $40 out for the road. The Federal \nTreasury receives the same amount of money but payments to counties \ndecrease.\n  What the Senator knows is that by this action, he is dramatically \ncutting the money that flows to counties for schools and for road \nconstruction--their own road construction, not this road construction, \nnot Federal road construction. Why have we payed the counties over the \nyears? I tell you why we have done it--because my State is 63 percent \nfederally owned, and those are landlocked communities. They have no tax \nbase from which to fund their schools and their local roads.\n  The Senator from Nevada knows from which I speak. His State is much \nmore owned by the Federal Government than is my State. Nevada is 84 \npercent.\n  It is interesting that the Senator from Nevada hasn't mentioned a \nthing about the annual net proceeds tax that his State gets from \nFederal mineral resources. Last year, the State of Nevada got $613 \nmillion in severance tax from Federal mineral resources.\n  I say to the Senator from Nevada. Why does he work so intently to \ndestroy the money that my schools, the schools in Montana, Washington, \nand Oregon get, and speaks nothing about that intent in his State, \nmasked in the name of the environment? Let me suggest to you that it is \nnot so masked. It is open. It is direct, and the impact would be \ndramatic. In many of my counties, school funding is 60 to 70 percent \nfunded by this base, and he would take, in many instances, 25 or 30 \npercent of it away immediately. If the plan of national environmental \nradical groups, the kind that advocate zero logging on timber forested \nlands, had their way the remaining funds would soon be wiped out \naltogether.\n  I guess another thing that clearly is worth discussing, and it is \nterribly frustrating to me, the Senator mentioned that he had letters \nfrom Secretary Glickman as it relates to the position of this \nadministration when it comes to their support of his amendment. The \nSecretary before the House of Representatives said, interestingly \nenough, not very long ago that the elimination of purchaser road \ncredits would hurt mostly small timber purchasers who have less access \nto credit.\n  Now, the Senator from Nevada talked about sticking it to the big \nboys. I think in reverse, if he studied it with some intent, he would \nfind that this is not quite the case.\n  I have another chart here that speaks to what Secretary Glickman was \ntalking about--purchaser credit use: ``Who buys the Federal timber?'' \nThe dark blue represents small business, the red represents large \nbusiness by definition. As we can see by the chart itself, in almost \nevery instance, they are buying better than 50 to 60 percent of the \ntimber.\n  Small business timber purchasers would be adversely affected because \nthe potential financing problem they would encounter if they had to \noperate by doing exactly what the Senator said, going out up front and \ngetting the money to construct the roads before they could harvest the \ntrees, take them to market and get their return. The alternative is the \npurchaser-elect program which does not protect the small business that \nare have the most threat. According to Price Waterhouse, a small \nbusiness still has to pay cash for the full amount of the timber. This \nwould explain why the purchaser-elect program has been rarely used by \nsmall business timber purchasers. Of course, that is what the Senator \nis advocating.\n  Mr. President, I recently noticed that the administration is having a \nbit of difficulty with what they tell us here in the Congress, and that \nis why I wonder about the letter the Senator has that he put in the \nRecord. I have a copy of that letter. I say that because last year I \nasked about potential legal and financial liabilities associated with \ncanceled timber sale contracts. The Forest Service provided a response, \nand the Department rescinded that response within just a few days. \nEarlier this year the Department properly rejected a position for a new \npolicy on qualifications for timber purchasers, and 2 days later the \nUnder Secretary claimed that an unauthorized individual had used an \nautosigning machine and the letter should never have been sent.\n  Well, it seems as if the Secretary had tried to place himself \nsquarely on both sides of this issue. I suggest that he put greater \ncontrol on his autosigning pen. Maybe we would more clearly understand \nwhat the Department of Agriculture is all about here--whiplashed by an \nenvironmental interest that does not serve this program well, does not \nserve the rural forested communities of our States well and, most \nimportantly, does not address this issue in a fair and balanced way.\n  During the summer of 1966, there were several incidents where \nimpassable roads resulting from washouts and wind-thrown trees hampered \nfirefighters' ability to respond to fire emergencies, requiring fire \ncrews to turn around and find other access to fires.\n  Why do I just instantly bring fires into this argument? Because the \naffected responsive maintenance of roads that is done through this \nprogram is what allows the Forest Service to manage our forests and \nfight fires. There are also roads that are used by off-road-vehicle \npeople of the Senator from Nevada and the Senator from Idaho. There are \nour hunters, our fishermen, our berry pickers, our recreationists, our \ntourists. Those are the roads that were initially built to harvest \ntimber. I would suggest to the chief of the Forest Service that if he \nhas $440 million worth of road maintenance and backlog, he is achieving \nmost of it today through the program that the Senator from Nevada is \ntrying to eliminate.\n  So I hope that my colleagues this afternoon, recognizing the \nimportance of this program, the way it is used effectively--it is not a \nsubsidy. It benefits the taxpayer. It certainly benefits the small \ncommunity that is the recipient of stumpage fees that fund schools and \nroads. It is a program well balanced and considered by the Congress \nover these years, and I hope they will reject the amendment of the \nSenator from Nevada. I do believe it is not well thought out. It \ncertainly does not meet the arguments that he himself made as it \nresults to the need for effective road maintenance to provide \nenvironmental quality, water quality and the kinds of things that we \nappreciate from our public land.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased once again to join my \ndistinguished colleague from Nevada, Senator Bryan, in identifying \nanother egregious expenditure which is a perennial waste of the \ntaxpayer's money: the\n\n[[Page S9456]]\n\ntimber road subsidy. Several years ago, my able friend and I joined \nforces to eliminate the wool and mohair subsidies. And in the last \nCongress, together we jettisoned the subsidies for the mink industry in \nthe market access program. In fact, Mr. President, I think our \nopposition to the entire market access program has become quite well \nknown in this body.\n  Mr. President, the amendment we introduce today calls for the most \nmodest reduction of a flagrantly wasteful subsidy which is helping \ndenude our national forests and providing an outrageous taxpayer-funded \ngive-away to the private sector. The Senator from Nevada and I are \nasking for the Senate to reduce this timber subsidy by $10 million. \nThis money would come from the $47 million budget of the U.S. Forest \nService's logging and construction program. Our amendment also prevents \nthe Forest Service from using ``purchaser road credits'' to trade \nvaluable Federal forest resources for environmentally destructive and \ncostly timber roads. In essence, Mr. President, this amendment will put \nan end to the practice of awarding free trees in exchange for the \nindustry paying its own road construction costs. This amendment also \nholds harmless counties that receive Federal payments from the sale \nvalue of federally owned timber, so it contains a mechanism to maintain \na neutral fiscal impact on those counties. There is clearly much to \ncomplain about when it comes to timber sales--which routinely cost the \nTreasury and the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollar each year--\nbut the issue before us is much narrower.\n  Under current U.S. Forest Service management, logging access roads \nare built in national forests using either taxpayer funds or assets to \nsubsidize logging companies harvesting timber. The taxpayer subsidizes \nthe construction and reconstruction of logging access roads by the \nGovernment either paying directly for the building of the roads or by \ntrading trees when the timber company builds the road. The system known \nas the Purchaser Credit Program essentially gives timber purchasers \n``free trees'' and, according to the GAO, includes a profit margin for \npurchasers. In both instances, timber companies receive subsidies at \nthe expense of taxpayers for activities that should be incorporated as \na cost of doing business.\n  Mr. President, this amendment does not reduce funding for road \nmaintenance and it does not affect the construction or maintenance of \nrecreation and general purpose roads. This amendment does not alter the \ninfrastructure management budget or the reconstruction and construction \nbudget of the Forest Service. This amendment contains no rider or any \nother language dealing with roadless areas of our national forests. \nThis amendment does not prohibit timber companies from building their \nown roads in the national forests where that is permissible under \nexisting laws and regulations, nor does it deter timber sales and \nharvesting. It merely eliminates taxpayer-funded logging road \nconstruction which should be the responsibility of the timber \ncompanies. It is a specific, concise amendment which will not only \nallow us to reduce our deficit but also prevent pollution of municipal \nwater supplies and save fish and wildlife habitats.\n  Originally, Mr. President, road building was subsidized by the U.S. \nForest Service to encourage economic and community development. There \nwas a time, especially after World War II, when the nation was rapidly \nexpanding, that the government help for the Northwest timber industry \nmade sense. But those days are over. We have learned that once areas \nare logged and logging companies move to new areas, communities cannot \nsurvive. Indeed they become ghost towns. There are no long term \neconomic and community benefits to the public--only to private \nindustry. If economic development is still the justification for this \nprogram, it flies in the face of some basic economic data. Mr. \nPresident, between 1950 and 1994, timber harvests increased by 64 \npercent, while employment in the wood and paper industry fell 4 \npercent. Other factors are at play in this subsidy. The fact is, Mr. \nPresident, the road-building subsidy--like the mink subsidy and the \nwool and mohair subsidy--is an anachronism.\n  The degradation of forests over the last few decades has led to a \nwide variety of environmental and health problems, including dramatic \nincreases in species extinctions, global warming--due in part to \ndeforestation in both tropical and temperate zones--and the \ndeterioration of water quality. Jim Lyons, Undersecretary of \nAgriculture, admits as much. He has told us, Mr. President, ``Our \nnumber one water-quality problem in the National Forest System is \nroads.'' In northern California, road building creates silt which clogs \nour State reservoirs and lessens water quality. Logging roads in \nnational forests increase environmental degradation by contributing to \nthe destruction and fragmentation of species, habitat, water pollution \nand landslides. In addition, Mr. President, since the 1940's, studies \nby the Forest Service and other fire scientists have found that more \nthan 90 percent of all wildfires in the United States are human-caused, \nand 75 percent of these start within 265 feet of a road.\n  We have a tremendous backlog of unmaintained forest logging roads \nthat are now unsafe. Maintenance of these roads is expensive--if there \nis no money to maintain existing roads, how will we take care of new \nroads? The Forest Service reported in March 1997 that there is a $440 \nmillion backlog of road maintenance needs for its existing roads. Where \nis the fiscal sense in constructing new roads?\n  Mr. President, there are currently 378,000 miles of roads throughout \nthe national forest system, which is eight times the mileage of the \nU.S. interstate highway system. That's enough to circle the earth \nnearly 15 times. In some parts of our Pacific Northwest, one square \nmile is laced with up to 20 miles of road. Supporters say these roads \nopen the forest to recreation. But, Mr. President, I can assure you \nmany of these roads are not passable--I have seen studies on this issue \nwhich show that these roads are built for truck use with little concern \nfor passenger vehicles or travel comfort. These are not recreation \nroads. In any case, Mr. President, the General Accounting Office has \nfound that 70 percent of the Nation's subsidized logging roads are used \nalmost exclusively by private timber companies and their contractors.\n  Mr. President, while the environment suffers and the timber industry \nenriches itself, the taxpayer picks up the tab. In fact, the taxpayer \npays toward the costs of each road three times: first to build the \nroad, second to maintain it, and third to fix the environmental damage \ncaused by road-induced fires and flood.\n  This proposal to reduce the account by $10 million and eliminate the \npurchaser road credit is modest, rational common sense by any measure. \nI urge our colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \nBryan amendment. I rise because this program has proven very successful \nover the years that it has been in existence. This is a positive \nprogram that promotes cooperation between public and private \nenterprises, which are the types of agreements we should be supporting \non the Senate floor and not opposing.\n  In addition, this program has been found that it costs the government \nno money. Price-Waterhouse did an economic analysis and determined that \n``the Forest Roads program does not contain a subsidy for timber \npurchasers.'' This program is an efficient and effective mechanism for \nfinancing forest road construction. And, since net payments to the \nTreasury will remain the same, Price-Waterhouse concluded there is no \nsubsidy to the timber purchaser.\n  Finally, I want to stress a point that I feel is of utmost \nimportance. Many do not realize that 25 percent of the proceeds from \ntimber sales go directly to the counties to be used for roads and \nschools. In Arkansas, where the per capita expenditures on students \nrank 46 out of 51 states and the District of Columbia, our children \ncannot afford to lose this vital source of funding.\n  Mr. President, I want to reiterate my strong opposition to this \namendment to strike funding for the Forest Roads Program.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will oppose the Bryan amendment to reduce \nfunding for Forest Service road construction, reconstruction and \nobliteration, and to eliminate the purchaser\n\n[[Page S9457]]\n\ncredit program, because the amendment will make two activities more \ndifficult to accomplish in the pursuit of the goal of ending new road \nconstruction in inappropriate areas. These two activities are \nobliteration of improperly placed, environmentally damaging or unused \nroads and reconstruction of those roads that serve regenerated stands. \nThe administration has indicated that this amendment would cause the \nForest Service to construct fewer new roads, yet the administration \nalready has the power to construct fewer new roads without this \namendment.\n  Eliminating the purchaser credit program may make sense. Certainly, \nthe public lands management agencies of the Federal Government should \nhave consistent policies on appropriately allocating the costs of \nbuilding roads for timber access and other uses. But, the program's \nelimination will not necessarily save taxpayers' money. There are many \npolicy and budget issues that should be sorted out at a Committee \nhearing on the matter before Congress acts on this.\n  Mr. President, I could support an amendment written to limit the \nnumber of miles of new roads in environmentally sensitive areas, \nhowever, the flaws in the Bryan amendment make its impact on this \nobjection uncertain.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to address my \nviews on the Bryan amendment regarding timber road construction in our \nNational Forests. I am very concerned about environmental protection \nand safeguarding our Nation's forests, providing there is an \nappropriate balance for economic development and job opportunities.\n  On Senate floor votes in 1986 and 1989, I supported reductions in the \ndirect Federal spending no road construction by the Forest Service. If \nthis amendment had been limited to road construction, I would have \nvoted for it.\n  However, I am concerned about the impact of the elimination of all \nfunding for the purchaser road credit program. From what I have seen \nand heard, during my August visits to the Allegheny National Forest in \nElk, Forest, McKean and Warren counties, elimination of the purchaser \nroad credits would constitute a significant hardship.\n  Accordingly, that provision of the amendment causes me to vote \nagainst it.\n  I do so on the assurances which I have received that the \nadministration is currently reviewing the timber road construction \nprogram and may make substantial revisions which would provide for \nappropriate environmental safeguards.\n  This vote, for me, is a close call. If there is not adequate \nenvironmental protection from changes in the purchaser road credit \nprogram in the administrations continuing review, I would be prepared \nto reconsider my vote on this issue on next year's Interior \nappropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate resume the debate on the Ashcroft amendment following the \nexpiration of the debate on the pending amendment offered by Senator \nBryan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. I make that request because we are going to go over the \ntime when we are supposed to be back on that amendment.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak against the amendment from the \njunior senator from Nevada. I urge my colleagues to oppose a \ndrastically reduced forest road budget, an end of purchaser road \ncredits, and a change in the county payments formula. This amendment is \nunworkable and unnecessary in the face of a road construction budget \nthat is already declining.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Bryan would reduce the proposed \nbudget for new timber road construction by $10 million. This amendment \ndoes nothing more than carry out the extreme agenda of certain radical \nenvironmental groups. As they have acknowledged, their objective is to \nshut down the Forest Service Timber Program.\n  Mr. President, Forest Service timber sales are sold using an open, \ncompetitive auction system process. All sales are sold at fair market \nvalue, with costs associated with the timber sales, including road \nwork, apportioned and built into a minimum bid price, which sets the \nfloor. There is no subsidy associated with timber sales or road \nconstruction.\n  According to a recent economic analysis released by the Price \nWaterhouse accounting firm, ``the forest roads program does not contain \na subsidy for timber purchasers--it provides an efficient and effective \nmechanism for financing road construction and reconstruction.''\n  Owners of private lands often provide access to their lands to \npurchasers of their timber. They can either construct the roads \nthemselves and then charge more for the timber, or they can require the \ntimber purchaser to construct roads and thereby receive less money for \ntheir timber. Landowners who require the timber purchaser to construct \nroads have developed many systems to compensate the purchaser for road \nconstruction activities.\n  Purchaser road credits are a fairly common method for building roads. \nMany private landowners, as well as the State forestry agencies of \nIdaho and Oregon, have similar systems to build roads on their lands. \nNo matter which system is chosen, the value of the timber sold will be \nreduced by the cost incurred by the purchasing party.\n  The Bryan amendment, however, calls for the elimination of the Forest \nService purchaser road credits program. Eliminating purchaser road \ncredits would have serious implications.\n  Under the purchaser credit program, timber sale contracts require the \npurchaser to reconstruct or construct roads and bridges. Purchaser \ncredit is an off-budget means for the Forest Service to rebuild and \nrepair existing roads and occasionally to build new roads at a \nsignificant savings to the taxpayer when compared with appropriated \nfunds.\n\n  There are many costs associated with the purchase and harvest of a \ntimber sale, including bonding, road construction, road maintenance, \nlogging, and trucking. When a company analyzes what it can bid for a \nparticular timber sale, it considers all the costs and values \nassociated with manufacturing forest products from the trees to be \npurchased. If the company is given credits for the road work, the bids \nwill be higher because it is not a cost.\n  As with the regular forest road program which uses appropriated \nfunds, the purchaser road credit program primarily supports the \nreconstruction of existing roads. Of the total number of miles of the \ntimber sales roads built or rebuilt nationwide in fiscal year 1995, \nabout 90 percent were done with purchaser road credits.\n  As funds for road construction have been reduced in recent years, \npurchaser credit has become a vital tool to accomplish road work in all \nregions of the country, especially reconstruction. About 80 percent of \nthe program used each year for reconstruction on roads, especially for \nsafety and environmental improvements. Congress and the administration \nmust reject all efforts to eliminate or reduce purchaser road credits.\n  Mr. President, Federal timber sales have declined precipitously, \nprimarily from limitations placed on the Forest Service by \nenvironmental considerations and species protection efforts for spotted \nowls, marbled murrelets, and various species of salmon. In 1987, the \ntimber sales program provided nearly 12 billion board feet of timber. \nTen years later, less than 4 billion board feet were sold.\n  It does not take rocket science to understand the dangerous \nconsequences the Bryan amendment has for local communities. Small \nbusinesses account for two-thirds of all timber harvested in national \nforests. Those small operations are located in the rural areas, \nproviding jobs and stability to their communities.\n  The Bryan amendment would dramatically limit the forest road program, \nputting additional pressures on the timber sale program. Most \nsupporters of the Bryan amendment are unaware that the Forest Service \nwill spend many times more on reconstruction and repair of existing \nroads as they will on the construction of new forest roads.\n  Most of the roads in the national forests are single-lane, dirt roads \nwhich\n\n[[Page S9458]]\n\nare open to all forest users. Each year these roads allow millions of \nAmericans to visit the national forests. Access is provided to wild and \nscenic rivers, national scenic byways, wilderness areas, \nand recreational facilities, including campgrounds, boat ramps, and \npicnic areas. These roads provide access for cutting firewood and \nChristmas trees, berry picking, hunting, fishing, and camping.\n\n  The primary use of the national forest road system is recreation. All \ntold, about 97 percent of the road system in any given national forest \nis open to recreational use. Ten years ago, recreation use on the \nnational forests was less than 250 million visits. Today, recreation \nuse is approaching 350 million visits, an increase of 40 percent.\n  The Bryan amendment would also reduce the construction of roads in \nroadless areas. Road construction in roadless areas of the national \nforests is for the most part limited to emergency situations. Indeed, \nfew if any miles of roads have been built in roadless areas of the \nnational forests in recent years. However, building some roads in \nroadless areas is necessary on occasion to allow access to treat insect \nand disease outbreaks, to monitor forest health, or for wildfire \nmanagement.\n  Mr. President, the Bryan amendment would have a debilitating effect \non the management of the national forest. I urge my colleagues to \ndefeat this effort to further limit logging in roadless areas, to \nterminate the purchaser credit program, and to cut an already reduced \nforest road budget. This amendment is simply bad forest policy.\n  The environmental groups who have drafted this amendment have only \none purpose. It is to shut down the Forest Service Timber Program. I \nurge my colleagues to defeat the amendment.\n  Before I yield to my friend from Oregon--we are running down on time \nhere--I just want to put my little plug in here.\n  Mr. President, we have set records on recycling in this Senate. This \nold debate has been recycled every year since I have been here. We tend \nto forget in this country that we are dealing with a renewable \nresource. It is just like corn flakes on your table or the shirt on \nyour back. All of these come from renewable resources.\n  There has been one group of persons who have been left out of this \ndebate, and it is the consumers of America. Has anybody priced any \nlumber lately, what it costs to build a house? Does anybody deal with \nthe homeless in their States on how do we find housing and what it \ncosts for affordable housing?\n  There are people in this country who are in charge of producing not \nonly food and fiber but also the shelter for America. That is what we \nare talking about here. You can mask it any way you want, but the way \nthat we make a sale is pretty much time tested. It has worked, and it \nworks every day, not only for the harvesting or the growing of a \nrenewable resource. We see that great miracle of renewal every spring \nand every year.\n  However, we also see the economic backbone of the economy of rural \nAmerica being eroded by people who have forgotten what it takes to \nproduce food, fiber and shelter. I tell you, you can go out there and \nlook at that mountain all you want and, if it is a religious experience \nand you do not want it touched, that is fine and dandy. But at the end \nof the day you are going to go get a hamburger because you are hungry. \nIt is the basic of life in this country. That is the first thing, or \nthe second thing, we do every day when we get up.\n  So I ask my colleagues just one question. In promoting what some \nthink of as a ``green world,'' is that going to feed us and sustain us? \nProbably for a lot of us around here it fed us a little too good. Maybe \nwe are caring a little too much. But I ask those who are not hands-on \nnatural resource providers to just pay heed to what you are doing here, \nbecause everything we enjoy --our standard of living, our quality of \nlife--starts with a little seed in the ground. That is where it starts. \nEvery one of us goes about our way every day in feeding and in \nclothing--every one of us without exception. Yet we want to make that \ntougher because we do not think it is important. So after housing and \nshelter, I think we are talking about a bona fide serious problem here, \nand it is not fair to change the rules. It is not even right to those \nwho grow and those who are in charge of the harvest. It is not fair to \nthose who have to take a raw product and add value to it so that it \nserves all of us in this great country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  The Chair advises the Senator from Montana that there remains 10 \nminutes on his time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I thank the Chair.\n  I thank my colleague from Montana and my colleagues from Washington \nand Idaho who have joined me in resisting the Bryan amendment. The \nSenator from Nevada is my friend, but I believe on this issue he is \nvery wrong. If he were to prevail, this would force great injury on my \nState.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take just a couple of minutes to speak \nagainst the amendment from the junior Senator from Nevada. This \namendment calls for a $10 million reduction in funds for new road \nbuilding, the elimination of the purchaser credit program, and a \nfurther reduction on logging in roadless areas. I strongly oppose these \nprovisions.\n  Timber sales are vital to the long-term viability of local \ncommunities throughout the West. Under existing law, 25 percent of the \ngross receipts from Federal timber sales go to local communities. These \nfunds are used for local schools and roads programs. Without a viable \nforest road maintenance, repair, and construction program, the timber \nsale program would be significantly limited. The big losers will be \nlocal communities.\n  Shared receipts are an integral part of local government revenues in \nthe West. There is no practical way to separate these payments from the \nother payment programs without having dramatic negative consequences on \nlocal communities. The necessary dollars to offset the loss of revenue \ncaused from the reduction in timber sales would not be forthcoming.\n  Mr. President, Federal timber sales have declined precipitously, \nprimarily from limitations placed on the Forest Service by \nenvironmental considerations and species protection efforts for spotted \nowls, marbled murrelets, and various species of salmon. In 1987, the \ntimber sale program provided more than 12 billion board feet of timber; \n10 years later, less than 4 billion board feet were sold.\n  It does not take an accountant to determine the serious implications \nthis has had for the budgets of rural communities. Two-thirds of all \ntimber harvested in national forests come from small businesses. Those \nsmall operations are generally headquartered in the rural areas, \nproviding jobs and stability to their communities, not to mention \nneeded revenues to sustain local programs and services.\n  The Bryan amendment would dramatically limit forest \nroad construction, putting additional pressures on the timber sale \nprogram. Since 1991, total new road construction built by the Forest \nService or by timber purchasers has declined by two-thirds. Spending on \nboth new road construction and reconstruction has been cut in half over \nthis same period.\n\n  Most supporters of the Bryan amendment are unaware that the Forest \nService will spend many times more on reconstruction and repair of \nexisting roads than they will on the construction of new forest roads. \nIndeed, most of the funding appropriated by Congress each year goes \ntoward the reconstruction of existing roads. In 1996, more than 2,800 \nmiles of roads were reconstructed, while only about 450 miles of new \nroads were constructed.\n  Reconstruction activities protect watersheds through improved road \ndesign, road placement, and sediment control. Road construction funds \nare being used for watershed protection as part of the President's \nforest plan for the Pacific Northwest. According to the Forest Service, \nforest roads allow critical access needed for the suppression of up to \n10,000 wildfires per year and reforestation of the burned-over lands.\n  The Bryan amendment will quite simply prevent the President from \nkeeping the environmental and economic commitments made in the \nNorthwest forest plan.\n  The Forest Service has invested significantly in technology transfer \napplications for road building. Examples\n\n[[Page S9459]]\n\ncited in this year's Forest Service budget proposal are: wetland \ndevelopment and riparian restoration through modification of culverts \nand other drainage structures, retaining soil through innovative design \nof gravity walls, and lower water crossings for roads to minimize \ndisturbance, provide fish passage, and avoid damming and channeling \nduring peak flows.\n  Mr. President, the Forest Service is continuing its efforts to reduce \nthe number of roads. In recent years, the Forest Service has annually \nreduced more than three times as much road mileage as compared to new \nconstruction. In 1996, the Forest Service reduced 1,400 miles of roads. \nFor the past 6 years combined, the Forest Service has reduced over \n18,000 miles of roads.\n\n  The Bryan amendment also calls for the elimination of purchaser road \ncredits program. Eliminating purchaser road credits would have serious \nimplications for local communities.\n  Under the purchaser credit program, timber sale contracts require the \npurchaser to reconstruct or construct roads and bridges. Purchaser \ncredit is an off-budget means for the Forest Service to rebuild and \nrepair existing roads and occasionally to build new roads at a \nsignificant savings to the taxpayer when compared appropriated funds.\n  Timber companies receive credits equal to the value of the road work \nrequired under a timber contract. The credit can be applied against the \nprice paid to the Government for the timber harvested. These companies \nreflect the cost of building roads in their submitted bids.\n  As funds for road construction have been reduced in recent years, \npurchaser credit has become a vital tool to accomplish road work in all \nregions of the country, especially reconstruction. About 80 percent of \nthe program is used each year for reconstruction on roads, especially \nfor safety and environmental improvements.\n  Proponents of this amendment project positive Federal budget effects \nfrom the elimination of purchaser road credits. Elementary economics \ntells us that purchasers will simply bid less for the timber than they \nwould of the credit were in place in order to offset their increased \ncosts, while the Federal Government will net virtually the same amount.\n  The Bryan amendment would further restrict the construction of roads \nin roadless areas. Road construction in roadless areas of the national \nforests are, for the most part, limited to emergency situations. \nIndeed, few if any miles of roads have been built in roadless areas of \nthe national forests in recent years. However, building some roads in \nroadless areas is necessary on occasion to allow access to treat insect \nand disease outbreaks, to monitor forest health, or for wildfire \nmanagement.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, there is no subsidy associated with timber \nsales or road construction. For new road construction and \nreconstruction associated with timber sales, costs are fairly \napportioned. These costs are fully offset by timber revenues, resulting \nin net profits averaging more than $400 million per year over the last \n6 years.\n  According to a recent economic analysis released by the Price \nWaterhouse accounting firm, ``the forest roads program does not contain \na subsidy for timber purchasers--it provides an efficient and effective \nmechanism for financing road construction and reconstruction.''\n  Forest Service timber sales are sold using an open, competitive \nauction system process. All sales are sold at fair market value, with \ncosts associated with the timber sales, including road work, \napportioned and built into a minimum bid price, which sets the floor on \nthe value of the timber sale.\n  Mr. President, I would like to close by quoting from a September 9 \neditorial in Oregonian which addresses the merit of Senator Byran's \namendment.\n\n       We think timber sales should be based on good plans and \n     sound scientific analysis of their effects. This amendment, \n     however, more closely fits the agenda of those \n     environmentalists opposing all commercial timber sales in the \n     national forests than it does the interest of good planning.\n\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against the Byran \namendment.\n  In the interest of time, I will summarize so we will leave to Senator \nKempthorne some time. I am reminded of the statement I heard from one \nSenator--everything that can be said has been said but not everyone has \nsaid it. So I guess it is my turn. I would like to let Senator \nKempthorne have a chance to be on record also.\n  I could focus on the many points Senator Craig laid out very well as \nto why this is not a subsidy, why this all nets out in the end for the \nadvantage of the forest, for the advantage of the taxpayer and for the \nadvantage of local communities in the rural Northwest. I suggest to you \nthat President Clinton came to my State, held a big timber conference, \nmade some promises as to the level of historic timber harvest that \nwould occur, along with a whole lot of environmental protection.\n  Part of that promise was that inclusion of these purchaser road \ncredits would continue, that roads would be maintained so that there \nare not big blowouts, that there would be the ability to suppress \nfires, that there would be the ability to continue to harvest where it \nis economically and environmentally responsible to do so.\n  I was very heartened the other day to find two of my State's leading \nnewspapers--these are not conservative newspapers; these are liberal \nvoices in my State, the Oregonian and the Register-Guard out of \nEugene--said the Senate should maintain the funds on these roads.\n  Well, let me quote from the Oregonian. They said Forest Service road \nfunding, ``which consists of road resurfacing, culvert replacement and \nother environmentally vital drainage improvements, these \nenvironmentally responsible activities are badly underfunded. It would \nbe perverse to cut these budgets in the name of stopping new roads.''\n  I agree. If you just focus on the economics, this washes out to the \ntaxpayer. If you focus on the environment, we are not talking about \nmuch new road building. We are talking about maintenance of roads for \npeople to use, for forest health to be provided, for the environment to \nbe protected against washouts of these roads. We are talking about \npeople who want to hunt in our national forests. All of these things \nare critical to this debate.\n  But, in the end I want to emphasize what the Senator from Montana \nsaid. There is a human element here, for crying out loud. There are \npeople who breathe air and have blood in their veins and have children \nand have dreams and who want a future, who love to live in the country, \nwho understand what it means to be stewards of the land and who also \nunderstand that this is a chain saw at their way of life. This is a \nchain saw aimed at the heart of Northwestern rural communities. It has \nto be stopped.\n  I care about protecting the environment. I just happen to believe \nthat people like wood products, too. I happen to believe there can be a \nbalance between the environment and our economy; between providing for \nanimal and human needs. This goes at the heart of stopping that kind of \nbalance.\n  I plead with my colleagues. You have interests in your States where I \nneed to learn. I want to know what it is that helps your people, your \nhuman element. But if you want to know what affects mine, this does.\n  Even the leading liberal papers of my State agree with me. The New \nYork Times doesn't understand the issue. They are on the other side. \nToday I stand with the people of Oregon, who understand the balance of \nthe environment and our economy.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from New Jersey 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized to \nspeak for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Bryan for yielding \nthis time. I rise in support of the amendment of the Senator from \nNevada.\n  There is not a Member of the Senate who has not shared with our \ncolleagues, or their constituents, the extraordinary need to end both \nwaste in this Government and corporate welfare in particular. This is \nthe moment for those Members to give meaning to all those speeches, all \nthose comments, and all those interviews, because the Bryan amendment \nis to corporate welfare what welfare reform in the last Congress was to \nsocial welfare. This is the moment.\n\n[[Page S9460]]\n\n  The scale of corporate welfare in the Federal budget is \nextraordinary. The Cato Institute estimates some $86 billion in \nexpenditures. The Progressive Policy Institute estimates the number at \n$265 billion. This new age of fiscal discipline in which we live, when \nthe Federal budget is being balanced, requires some sacrifice from \neverybody. In the last Congress it was people and families on welfare. \nIn this Congress, at long last, it is time to have corporate welfare \nmake its own contribution.\n  The Bryan amendment deals with one specific part of this network of \ncorporate welfare, the construction of timber roads. The Green Scissors \nCoalition estimates that, over a 5-year period, the Federal Government \nwill spend $36 billion, not only on these expensive and potentially \nwasteful construction projects, but projects which at the same time \nhave an extraordinary cost in environmental terms. The simple truth is, \neven if we could afford this construction, which we cannot, the \nenvironmental costs are enormous.\n  These roads through our Nation's forests remove ground cover, create \na channel for water to flow through--a cause of major soil erosion. \nHillsides are weakened, streams are fouled, destroying the foundation \nof our recreational fishing industry--extraordinary--and some of the \nmost important vistas and recreational properties in our Nation. It is \nbelieved that many of the channels created by these roads and the \nrunoff are a major nonpoint source of pollution. According to the \nNational Forest Service, 922 different communities in our country rely \nfor their drinking water directly on streams that are impacted by the \nrunoff of these roads in our national forests.\n\n  The Bryan amendment is a chance to end this corporate welfare, \npreserve the quality of the water, and end the damage to these forests. \nIt is a subsidy that may be $100 million to individual corporations, \nbut that underestimates the true scale of the problem. Over the last 15 \nyears, direct Government expenditures for construction and \nreconstruction of forest roads may total $3.2 billion. It is estimated \nthat for the national forest road system alone, over the years, this \nhas resulted in the construction of 380,000 miles in forest roads. For \nany citizens of America who have marveled at our Interstate Highway \nSystem, they can only understand the scale of this construction by \nrecognizing there is enough mileage through our national forests to \ncircle the globe 15 times. Indeed, we have built 8 miles of road \nthrough pristine national forests for every 1 mile that has been \nconstructed in the National Interstate Highway System.\n  The result of all these years of construction is that now we face \n$440 million worth of backlog of road maintenance. So we are continuing \nin the construction of millions of dollars' worth of new highways \nthrough new forests while the old highways are not maintained. They \nfall into disrepair with further erosion, damaging more streams, more \ndrinking water--erosion of more forest.\n  For those who are serious about the deficit, corporate welfare, and \nenvironmental protection, in a single vote for the Bryan amendment you \nare given a chance to make a statement about each. This is not a \nquestion of ending the foresting of trees. It is not a question of not \nmaking our resources available. It is a question about industry, like \nevery other American, paying their own way. If these roads make sense, \nthen they make sense for corporations to pay for them themselves. If \nthey are to be built, then they should be built properly and maintained \nby the companies who want access to the resources. If companies want \naccess to the resources, and it makes economic sense, then it should be \nreflected in the product, not by the taxpayers. It is that simple. The \nlogic and the economics is no different than when we face individual \nspending programs for citizens, students, or senior citizens. At some \npoint these programs need to be evaluated on their own merits, on their \nown economics. That is what Senator Bryan challenges us to do today.\n  I enthusiastically support his amendment on budgetary grounds, \nbecause of the economic logic of his argument and, finally, and in my \nown judgment most compellingly, on environmental grounds. We preserve \nthese lands for a reason. We should open them up, provide access to \nthem for their destruction, judiciously and carefully. We failed to do \nso in the past. Senator Bryan gives us a last chance to make a proper \njudgment once again.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Bryan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BURNS. I yield 5 minutes to my friend from Idaho, Senator \nKempthorne.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognize for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, has it become politically incorrect to \ncut a tree, or even to walk in the woods? I don't think we want to go \ndown that path. But then, if this amendment passes, we may not have a \npath to go down at all. My State of Idaho is 63 percent Federal land, \nand the majority of that is Forest Service. Not surprisingly, timber is \na major industry in the State, and outdoor recreation is growing. Both \ndepend on access to these Federal lands.\n  Mr. President, 97 percent of the roads on Federal forest land are \nopen for recreational use. That includes camping, hiking, hunting, \nfishing--activities which a recent study by the administration found \nmake up three-fourths of all the use of Federal land. Take away the \nroads and you take away the public's ability to access their Federal \nlands, and the economic diversity that recreation provides to rural \nwestern communities.\n  Besides recreation, those roads provide access for environmental \nmanagement--to, among other things, monitor wildlife, and bring \nwildlife under control. Without the budget to construct or reconstruct \nthese roads, managers will lose vital access. There is also the danger \nthat these roads will become unstable, and pose an environmental threat \nto watersheds.\n  Do we have too many roads on Federal land? That is a good question--\nhow many is too many? Compared to other road systems, the Forest \nService does not even come close, with a mile and a half of road per \nsquare mile, compared to 8 miles per square mile on private timber \nland.\n  This is the crux of the point: there are many demands placed on \nFederal forest land, only one of which is to provide the solitude that \ntrue wilderness offers. No one will dispute the importance of \nwilderness, and that is why so many States have passed wilderness \nbills.\n  We have designated wilderness for a reason--so that some areas meet \nthe public's expectation of a solitude experience, and allow the rest \nof Federal timber land to serve the public's other needs: to provide \ntimber to build our homes, and to allow for other types of recreation \nthat include access on some type of vehicle.\n  My State of Idaho is already home to the largest continuous \nwilderness area in the continental U.S.--the Frank Church-River of No \nReturn Wilderness.\n  The administration's own study of the Interior Columbia Basin found \nthat the majority of Americans using Federal land in the Pacific \nNorthwest like to be able to access it using a car or some other type \nof vehicle. My colleagues, we need a safe, accessible road system.\n  This amendment would undermine that goal. And because it would also \nincrease the cost of timber activities, and decrease revenue to rural \ncounties, the amendment would pull the rug out from struggling, \nresource dependent communities. These rural communities are the base \nfor the values that we hold dear--where the work ethic is taught as a \npart of daily life to kids who learn to respect the world around them. \nWe can't afford to force these communities into oblivion, because we \nwill lose what is best about ourselves.\n  These cuts will hurt the very people we are working for back here. I \nam talking about the small business owner, the laborer and even the \nfirefighter. Groups such as the International Association of Fire \nFighters, the Pulp & Paper Workers Resource Council, the United Paper \nWorkers International Union, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters & \nJoiners of America, and many others have all come out against this \namendment.\n  The Forest Service designed the purchaser credit program to be an \noff-\n\n[[Page S9461]]\n\nbudget means to provide the access Americans expect. It does so at a \nsignificant savings to the taxpayer when compared to how much it would \ncost to use appropriated funds. In return for providing a public \nservice, the bidder on timber contracts receives a credit applied to \nthat or another sale.\n  Seventy-five percent of these bidders are small businesses. I fail to \nsee a subsidy for big business--what I see is the Forest Service \nfinding a way to do its job and save taxpayer dollars, an advantage for \nsmall companies, and jobs in small communities. Is this what we want to \neliminate?\n  I urge colleagues to vote against this amendment. It is not about \nwise management of our Federal lands--it is about making those lands \navailable for only one use, and that is unacceptable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BURNS. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, if I could be \ngranted 5 more minutes in order to accommodate the chairman of the \nEnergy and Natural Resource Committee.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I do not object to that, I suggest to the distinguished \nacting floor manager, if I can get an additional 5 minutes as well?\n  Mr. BURNS. That's perfectly all right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. I yield Senator Murkowski from Alaska 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized to speak for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I think there has been a little \nmisunderstanding on the concept of road purchaser credits and the \nallegation that somehow this is corporate welfare. Logic will dictate \nthat if we don't have purchaser credits for the construction of roads, \nthose who are going to log in the forests, the Federal forests of this \ncountry, are simply going to bid less for the timber because they have \nto offset the costs of getting the timber out. They basically have to \nbuild the roads themselves.\n  When the Government in this case builds the roads, as it has through \nthe purchaser credit program, the Government has been benefiting by \ngetting higher bids for its timber. Take this away and the Government \nwill simply get less. That is the reality. That is the economics. It is \nnot a matter of corporate welfare. It's a matter that the Federal \nGovernment owns the forest and has traditionally dictated the terms and \nconditions that the roads will be built on, so they are built to their \nstandards. And the benefit of those roads to the States, for \nrecreational purposes, is obvious.\n  I rise to speak against the amendment of the junior Senator from \nNevada. Not only does the amendment eliminate the purchaser road credit \nprogram, but it transfers $10 million out of road construction. I must \nstrongly oppose the provisions. I think the amendment is bad policy. It \nwould have a catastrophic impact on the management of the national \nforests. I urge my colleagues to defeat it.\n  The Forest Service in my State has finally completed a land \nmanagement plan for the Tongass. It took 10 years and $13 million to do \nit. I am, frankly, less than enthusiastic about the plan, and most of \nmy colleagues are aware of my distress.\n  It reduces timber sales by half. The two largest manufacturing \nemployers in the pulp business in my State have closed their doors in \nthe last 2 years. They have gone out of business. We have closed their \ndoors. We have lost thousands of jobs in the last 2 years, and these \nhave had a dramatic effect on our small communities in the southeast. \nNevertheless, I have decided to set my lack of enthusiasm aside and \nfocus my oversight responsibilities on implementation.\n  At the September 10 hearing, I asked the Forest Service if it could \nachieve even the severely reduced allowable timber sale quantity in the \nTongass if the Bryan plan were adopted. The answer was:\n\n       If we don't have the money to support the roads program, we \n     will not be able to deliver the economic sale program.\n\n  They further stated that the Tongass depends heavily on the \nconstruction of new roads to deliver timber to the communities in \nsoutheastern Alaska. One might say, ``Why don't you go to the private \nsector?'' We don't have private timber. The Federal Government and the \nForest Service own southeastern Alaska. There are cities and people \nthere: Ketchikan, Wrangell, Petersburg, Juneau, Skagway, on and on and \non.\n  The theory was, through multiple use, those interests would be \nprotected with a balanced timber industry. Therefore, according to the \nForest Service, the Bryan amendment would render null and void the \ngoals of the Tongass plan.\n  It is kind of interesting, in a letter sent to the Senate only one \nday before the testimony, Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman \nsupported the Bryan amendment because roads pose the ``greatest \nenvironmental problems on the forests.'' You can't have it two ways. \nThe roads provide recreation in the forest, they provide environmental \nbenefits by providing access to stop fires, and I could go on and on \nand on. It is fairly inconsistent with the administration support for \nimplementation of the Forest Service's final Tongass land management \nplan, but I have grown accustomed to the flip-flops of the \nadministration on these issues. But Secretary Glickman isn't holding a \nposition long enough to make it warm.\n  Finally, the Bryan amendment is nothing more than an attempt to \neliminate sales on the national forests. At least we have seen some of \nthe groups like the Sierra Club come out in opposition to any \nharvesting of the national forest. That is basically what this \nadministration is attempting to do, and this is how they are attempting \nto do it.\n  The amendment isn't about subsidies, the amendment isn't about saving \nmoney, the amendment does nothing more than carry out the agenda of the \nextremists.\n  I will conclude by pointing to this chart, Mr. President, which \nsimply shows where the money has gone and the decline in road miles. In \n1985, we had 8,000; in 1998, 2,652. It shows reconstruction taking up \nthe major portions. We maintain the roads that we have previously \nbuilt. There is very little for new construction, roughly 18 percent.\n  So there is the picture, Mr. President. It says it better than I \ncould relative to what is happening with this program with the \nnecessity of maintaining it and maintaining the forest products \nindustry as we know it today and the appropriate role of the national \nforest in providing a renewable resource in the timber that grows so \nprofusely, particularly in the Pacific Northwest.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank the floor managers. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator from Washington \nthat there is 1 minute 46 seconds time remaining on this watch.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Bryan \namendment for a lot of reasons. But the one I want to focus on is what \nI believe is the fiscally irresponsible nature of this amendment.\n  This is being put out as a budget-cutting measure. But the fact of \nthe matter is, by having a fund that says we are going to hold the \ncounties harmless--and I appreciate being held harmless. We have a \nnational forest in Pennsylvania and our counties rely upon that money. \nThat is going to cost money in the sense that by reducing the amount of \nroads built, you are going to reduce the revenues in the fund. That \nmoney is no longer going to be there to fund those counties in the \nmoney that they traditionally have received, and the Federal Government \nis going to have to come up with that money in exchange to fund the \ncounties.\n  That is, in a sense, almost a welfare payment from the Federal \nGovernment because we have eliminated the funding source of timber \nharvesting from those counties and those communities. So not only have \nwe hurt them economically, hurt their counties economically, but we are \nnow creating welfare for those counties by giving Federal dollars to \nthem in place of the\n\n[[Page S9462]]\n\njobs they have. This is not only bad, I think, from a policy \nperspective, but also bad from a fiscal perspective.\n  Despite the assertions of the amendment's sponsors, the timber sales \nprogram and the purchaser credit program are not subsidies. Since 1964, \nroads needed for timber harvest have been built by timber purchasers \nand the U.S. Forest Service has permitted the use of purchaser credit \nfor road building. In fact, this program is entirely off-budget and \nthis appropriations bill contains no funding for it. In President \nClinton's budget request to Congress, elimination of the program \nresults is no savings to the Federal government. Rather, the costs of \nthe credits are explicitly absorbed by timber purchasers in the \ncontracting and bidding process. According to a report by Price \nWaterhouse, ``Economic analysis shows that the forest roads program \ndoes not contain a subsidy for timber purchasers; it provides an \nefficient and effective mechanism for financing road construction and \nreconstruction.''\n  Second, eliminating the Purchaser Credit Program would harm local \ncommunities near national forests--including Warren, Forest, McKean, \nand Elk Counties in Pennsylvania. Counties containing forest lands \nreceive 25 percent of gross Forest Service receipts. In 1996, these \ncounties received a total of $6.2 million, three quarters of which went \ndirectly to local school districts.\n  Finally, the amendment would effectively cripple efforts to meet the \nstewardship needs of our national forest land by cutting the funding by \nwhich we maintain its infrastructure. Eliminating this program would \nnot only cut funding for road construction, it would cut funding for \nroad reconstruction and maintenance to fix environmental and safety \nproblems remaining from an era when construction standards were far \nless rigorous. A well-developed road system is indispensable to forest \nplan implementation, fire suppression and forest health.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the General Accounting Office has just \nreleased a report which identifies questionable policies and practices \nthat nearly caused the Forest Service to default on revenue sharing \npayments to rural counties in fiscal year 1996. The report raises \nfundamental accountability issues for both Congress and the Forest \nService, and I believe that these issues will be exacerbated by the \nBryan amendment.\n  Specifically, the GAO found that reductions in Federal timber sale \nreceipts, coupled with increased obligations to spotted owl counties, \nand an apparent lack of sound financial controls over the National \nForest Fund resulted in a shortfall in revenue-sharing funds available \nto rural counties.\n  Receipts from the resource sales are deposited in the National Forest \nFund, which is a receipts-holding account from which the Forest Service \nobligations are distributed. After normal county payments were paid, \nthe Forest Service used the National Forest Fund in fiscal years 1994 \nand 1995 to make additional spotted owl guarantee payments in certain \ncounties in California, Oregon, and Washington. This caused two \nproblems. First, there were insufficient moneys in the fund to pay \ncounties because of the dramatic drop in timber sales receipts. Then, \nthe Forest Service was forced to borrow from other funds and the \nTreasury to pay the obligations to the counties in a fashion that GAO \nfound ``was an unauthorized use of the funds.''\n\n  It is my understanding that Congressman Bob Smith, chairman of the \nHouse Agriculture Committee, has written Secretary of Agriculture Dan \nGlickman requesting a full accounting of the specific steps he will \ntake to ensure that the Forest Service advises Congress when such \nshortfalls occur and properly manages these funds in the future.\n  Mr. President, the amendment before us will only make this dire \nfinancial situation worse for the Forest Service. Senator Bryan's \namendment will again modify the formula for sharing Forest Service \nreceipts with the counties. I understand that it is the sponsors' \nintent to protect counties from fiscal harm as the result of this \namendment. Included in the amendment is a provision to make up for the \ninevitable shortfall in payments to counties that will occur as the \ndirect result of a $10 million reduction in spending for new forest \nroad construction and the elimination of the purchaser road credits. \nSince Pennsylvania has four counties that benefit from timber sale \nreceipts, I commend Senator Bryan for his concern about the effects of \nhis amendment. But I must point out, Mr. President, that the concern of \nthe Senator from Nevada betrays the folly of this amendment. You see, \nshould this amendment be enacted into law, timber sale receipts will go \ndown sharply at the same time that our payments to counties will be \nheld constant or even increase. This is the very same tortured \naccounting formula that helped to lead the Forest Service to brink of \ndefault recently over the spotted owl payments.\n  In fact, let me point out for the benefit of my colleagues that the \nGAO found the Forest Service had shifted money originally intended for \ntrust funds for reforestation and forest health in order to cover the \ndeficit in the National Forest Fund. While I hope the Forest Service \nwill be successful in addressing the serious accounting shortcoming \nthat led to the crisis, I must caution my colleagues that passage of \nthe Bryan amendment makes it more likely that the National Forest Fund \ncheck will bounce again during fiscal year 1998.\n  The amendment directs the Forest Service to compute the costs \nassociated with road construction by timber purchasers and give the \ncounties an equivalent of 25 percent of these costs from the National \nForest Fund. This is ludicrously impractical. First, we do not have \nenough money in the National Forest Fund to meet our current \nobligations to the counties. Second, the task of calculating private \nsector costs is a complex accounting task for an agency. Further, the \namendment directs the Forest Service to collect private sector costs, \nthat in many cases, are proprietary.\n  In view of the GAO's very critical report, this is not the time to \nadd to our obligations to the counties. Nor is it appropriate to burden \nthe Forest Service with additional financial responsibilities. I urge \nmy colleagues to defeat this fiscally irresponsible amendment. It is \nimperative that we maintain funding for Forest Service road \nconstruction and maintenance and the Forest Service's Purchaser Credit \nProgram. It remains the most efficient and cost-effective method we \nhave to help maintain our national forests and serve the needs of the \nsurrounding populations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time that I might have. \nI was somewhat astounded by the debate because those who oppose the \namendment try to frame an issue that is not part of our discussion or \nour amendment today. I think in so doing they are trying to obfuscate \nthe issues we are dealing with. This amendment is not about eliminating \nall timber harvests on the national forests. That may be an appropriate \nsubject for a debate on another day. But there is not one word in this \namendment that would have that effect or seeks to accomplish that \npurpose.\n  The other argument that has been made to obfuscate the issues is \nsomehow a suggestion that there is an attempt here to eliminate all new \nroad construction in the national forests. That is not true as well.\n  Let me just respond to the comments that the distinguished Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania just made. We have crafted this amendment to protect \nand to hold the counties who receive revenue from this program to hold \nthem harmless. We do so by saying, look, in the bid that is offered by \nthe prospective timber harvest bidder, that we factor a separate amount \nthat would be attributable to the construction component and use that, \nas well as the bid price, in the calculation to determine what moneys \nwill go to the individual counties that will be affected. So we were \nsensitive to the needs of the individual counties that would be \naffected and this amendment holds them harmless.\n  Let me talk about what the thrust of this amendment is. The thrust of \nthis amendment is to eliminate a subsidy. It is to eliminate corporate \nwelfare. It is to eliminate food stamps for the timber industry. That \nis not just an assertion the Senator from Nevada makes.\n\n[[Page S9463]]\n\n That is why groups such as Citizens Against Government Waste, which \nhave identified this as a costly subsidy to the American taxpayer, \nsupport the Bryan amendment. That is why Taxpayers for Common Sense, \nalso a taxpayer watchdog group, has supported the Bryan amendment, \nbecause they recognize that this is a subsidy. That is why 60 leading \nnewspapers across America from coast to coast--the only two notable \nexceptions that I am familiar with are the two that were referenced by \nthe Senator from Oregon in his comments--all recognize this to be a \nsubsidy and have urged its elimination.\n  Why is it a subsidy? It is a subsidy because individuals who have \nanalyzed it and see how the Purchaser Credit Program worked finds that \na windfall tax break occurs in terms of the profits that are permitted \nunder this. Let me describe that in more detail, if I may.\n  The Forest Service makes a determination as to what they estimate the \nroad costs are to be when a bidder bids on a tract of timber that \nrequires road construction, and that is made available immediately to \nthe successful bidder--immediately. That is a credit that is made \navailable.\n  Those who have looked at the way the Forest Service calculates that \nhave indicated, No. 1, the Forest Service is calculating a profit into \nthat estimate and, No. 2, those who have focused on it independently \nfound that in some instances, the purchaser road credit exceeds by 30 \npercent the actual cost that the timber harvester incurs in building \nthe roads. Because, Mr. President, there is no accounting or \naccountability, the amount of money that is saved by the timber \nharvester that would be substantially less cost to him than the \npurchaser credit makes available is retained by the timber bidder, and \nthat becomes a windfall profit. That is what the various groups, the \ntaxpayer groups, as well as the 60 or more editorial writers across the \ncountry, have focused on--that it is a subsidy and a subsidy that ought \nto be eliminated.\n  Third, let me talk for a moment about the environmental consequences. \nWe have 380,000 miles of roads in the National Forest System. That is \nabout eight times the length of the interstate system. We have an \nenormous backlog of maintenance on existing roads. It is clear that new \nroad construction, particularly in those environmentally sensitive \nareas that are steep, that have serious drainage and grading problems, \ncost the American taxpayer not just the initial cost for the road \nconstruction, but in some instances for generations thereafter. We deal \nwith the problems of erosion, sedimentation and siltation into the \nrivers, streams, and lakes in the national forests. That is why the \nAssistant Secretary has commented that the greatest threat to the water \nresource in the national forest system is roads and new construction \nwhich is a major factor in that.\n\n  Finally, let me set at rest the notion that somehow these forest \nroads that will be built for new timber harvests are somehow a great \nbenefit to the outdoor recreationalists. There are different categories \nof roads.\n  Typically, a road that is involved in a construction to access \nharvest timber is a dirt road. It is accessible only by all-terrain \nvehicles. It is not accessible by passenger vehicles. It is unpaved. It \nis ungraded. It doesn't have gravel on it. Whereas, recreational roads \nare roads of a higher quality that are accessible by passenger and \ngeneral recreational vehicles.\n  Let me say that one of the groups that is a watchguard for outdoor \nrecreational users is the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association, \nwhich is part of the Outdoor Products Council. Mr. President, here is \nwhat they have to say about this subsidy and the purchaser road credit \nand the Bryan amendment:\n\n       Our national forests are a recreational attraction because \n     of their wild unspoiled areas. We feel that taxpayer \n     subsidies for logging road construction has led to an \n     extensive logging road network that can actually place at \n     risk the very resources upon which recreational users of our \n     national forests depend.\n\n  The recreational users and their interest groups support the Bryan \namendment because they recognize that the Purchaser Credit Program is, \nin fact, a corporate subsidy, corporate welfare and they recognize the \nenvironmental consequences of senseless and unnecessary new road \nconstruction.\n  Finally, if I may, to clarify the point that in the Forest Service \naccounts there is a separate category for maintenance of existing \nroads. The Bryan amendment, which could reduce by $10 million the \namount of money appropriated for new road construction, does not--does \nnot--in any way affect or reduce those moneys that are set aside for \nthe maintenance accounts. So no one ought to be misled that in some way \nthe reduction that we are talking about would in any way impact those \nongoing activities of erosion control and maintenance of existing \nroads.\n  To conclude, Mr. President, this is a win-win. It is a win for the \nAmerican taxpayers because we eliminate a costly subsidy that simply \ncannot be justified and to provide windfall profits for some of the \nlargest timber harvesters in America. Common sense suggests that, \nindeed, it must be a very powerful and a very substantial subsidy, or \nwhy else would we have the opposition to the Purchaser Road Credit \nProgram if it did not provide such a subsidy? If it has been suggested \nby those who oppose the amendment it is a wash and an offset, I do not \nsee why they would be raising the concerns and objections they have.\n  Second, it is a great win for the environment, because we know one of \nthe leading causes of environmental degradation is the kind of erosion \nand runoff that we have as a result of these roads that have been cut \nthrough our national forests, and we ought to be very, very careful and \nsensitive when we construct new roads.\n  Mr. President, for the American taxpayer, for the American people, \nthis is sound policy. Your vote will be appreciated.\n  May I inquire of the Chair whether or not the amendment reflects the \ncosponsorship of John Kerry, Barbara Boxer, and Senator Bob Torricelli? \nIf it does not, I ask unanimous consent that they be added as \ncosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I commend Senator Bryan for introducing \nthis important amendment. This amendment does three critical things: \nhelps to protect our environment, eliminates an unnecessary Government \nsubsidy, and reduces our Federal deficit.\n  The Bryan amendment will reduce road construction funding by $10 \nmillion, eliminate the Purchaser Credit Program which gives timber \ncompanies trees in payment for road construction costs.\n  The amendment will not affect recreation and general purpose roads, \nand it will not reduce the money for maintenance and road obliteration. \nUnder this amendment, if timber companies want to build logging roads \nwith their own money, they can continue to do so. They simply won't be \npaid by the American taxpayers.\n  Year after year, American taxpayers have spent millions of dollars to \nsubsidize the construction of roads needed for logging in our national \nforests. This is millions of dollars that could have been spent on \ncleaning our air and water.\n  Road building wreaks havoc on our national forests. Currently, there \nare nearly 380,000 miles of roads dissecting our national forests--\nthat's eight times the length of the Interstate Highway System. My \nState of California has 44,000 miles of logging roads in its national \nforests. Each mile of road can have a devastating impact on water \nquality, stream ecosystems, fish habitat, and wildlife. Roads lead to \nsediment loading in streams and destroy habitat for fish and other \naquatic species. Furthermore, the Forest Service has determined that \n922 communities get drinking water from National Forests streams that \nare adversely affected by logging roads.\n  I would like to raise an additional point. Earlier this year, the \nForest Service began the Recreation Fee Demonstration Project. Under \nthis Congressionally mandated pilot project, the Forest Service is now \ncharging recreational visitors a fee to enter national forests. Now I \nask my colleagues, how can we continue to any timber companies to enter \nand harm our national forests, while at the same time we require \nrecreational visitors--who come to hike, picnic and enjoy our national \nforests--how can we require them to pay for their visit? Does that seem \nlike a wise-use of taxpayer money--I think not.\n\n[[Page S9464]]\n\n  Under the Recreation Fee Demonstration Program there is no charge for \nthose individuals and companies who come to harvest timber. Quite the \nopposit--we pay them to do so. In California, there is now a $5-per-day \nfee for recreational use of the Angeles, Cleveland, or Los Padres \nNational Forests. These forests used to be open and free to \nrecreational visitors. The Forest Service estimates that this new Fee \nProgram will raise between $8 to $10 million this year, and somewhere \nbetween $15 to $20 million in future years. This is $10 to $20 million \nfrom the American public to visit their own national forests while the \nFederal Government pays over $47 million for timber companies to \nconstruct roads which are destroying those very locations the public \ncomes to enjoy.\n  As U.S. Senators we have the responsibility of priortizing--making \ndecisions about how best to spend our taxpayer dollars in a way that \nwill maximize benefits to the American people. We all know that there \nare times when that can be a very difficult task--choosing between many \nprojects and activities that all seem equally worthy. This is not one \nof those times.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Senator Bryan's amendment.\n  Mr. BRYAN. If there is time remaining, I yield back the remainder of \nmy time.\n  Mr. GORTON. Would the Senator withhold that?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I withhold.\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from Wyoming has been waiting patiently and \nwanted 2 minutes. I do not have quite 2 minutes. Would the Senator from \nNevada mind yielding his opponent that 2 minutes?\n  Mr. BRYAN. The Senator from Nevada will do so. I think the Record \nwill reflect that I have been generous beyond measure to accord to my \nopponents more time than the time agreement we entered into. But I will \naccord the Senator from Wyoming 2 minutes.\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from Nevada has been indeed generous.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Thank you very much. I appreciate that.\n  The business of timber and timber harvest is very important to my \nState. I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Nevada. I think the amendment is not about subsidies; it is about \nthe elimination of the timber program in our national forests.\n  The timber program is part of a healthy forest. Somehow there has to \nbe some changes made in a forest that either burns or is harvested or \nis eaten by insects. This would terminate that kind of thing.\n  Furthermore, this is a policy issue that I believe ought to be talked \nabout in our committee of jurisdiction, ought to be talked about in the \nforest plan, not one that ought to be talked about here in terms of \ndoing it on an appropriations bill.\n  Let me just say, the Senator has suggested there are winners and \nwinners. There are losers. Those losers happen to be schools, school \ndistricts, counties, small family businesses, and recreationists.\n  This, I think, has been called a subsidy. It is actually not a \nsubsidy. Purchaser credits are an accounting method used by the Forest \nService. If the cost of the road was not in there, the bid, of course, \nfor the timber would be less. If the cost that they have appropriated \nand allocated to it is more than it should be, that ought to be fixed \nby the Forest Service.\n  But, Mr. President, let me just say finally, because I know there is \nnot much time, that this amendment really does not have anything to do \nwith the critical issues facing the Forest Service. It is just the \nopposite, by depleting desperately needed road funding while reducing \nessential money to county road programs and school districts, as well \nas thousands of jobs and recreational opportunities for all Americans.\n  I urge my colleagues not to support this amendment.\n  I thank you very much for your time.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I do have a letter by the National \nAssociation of Counties that I ask unanimous consent to be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         NACo, September 12, 1997.\n       The Bryan Amendment Hurts Timber Counties and their \n     economies!!\n       The National Association of Counties opposes the Bryan \n     Amendment on forest roads to the Interior Appropriations bill \n     (H.R. 2107). Eliminating the purchaser road credit system, \n     and reducing funding for the forest roads program can have \n     only one purpose--weaken the viability of the Forest \n     Service's timber sale program. A viable timber sale program \n     is vital to America's timber counties and the forest road \n     program is an important part of such a program. Reducing the \n     ability to access timber not only hurts counties, but the \n     thousands of families that rely upon the income from their \n     timber jobs. In FY 1995 a total of $257 million was returned \n     to local communities adjacent to national forests throughout \n     the United States. Two-thirds of all timber harvested in \n     national forests come from small businesses--those small \n     operations are generally headquartered in the rural counties, \n     providing jobs and stability to their communities, not to \n     mention needed revenues to sustain county programs and \n     services for the citizens. It does not take an accountant to \n     determine the serious implications this has for the economies \n     of rural timber counties.\n       Proposed provisions to lessen the impact of these cuts on \n     these rural communities and counties do not meet their stated \n     objective. Attempting to hold county governments harmless \n     from these cuts, discounts the other significant economic \n     impacts on the people in the counties' communities. A \n     significantly better way to address the needs of natural \n     resource dependent counties is to support increases to the \n     Payments In Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program. This program in \n     combination with timber revenues, help public land counties \n     provide such vital services as law enforcement, solid waste \n     disposal, search and rescue and fire fighting on public \n     lands. This is considered a major ``underfunded mandate'' and \n     it is extremely important to the 1,789 public land counties \n     in 49 states that rely upon the PILT program to provide some \n     equity for the services they provide.\n       Please oppose efforts to eliminate the purchaser road \n     credit program and reduce the forest roads program by \n     attempting to hold counties harmless. It does not achieve its \n     goal. Instead, support efforts that really help public land \n     counties--support the PILT program.\n       Thank you for your attention.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Randy Johnson,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. May I inquire of the Chair how much time the Senator from \nNevada has?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I assure my colleagues I will not take the full 6 minutes. \nBut let me respond to the concern that the Senator from Wyoming has \nvoiced with respect to the county schooling.\n  We have crafted into the amendment a hold-harmless provision that \nrecognizes that indeed this is an important revenue source for local \ngovernments. I can assure my colleagues that the purpose of this \namendment, or its effect, will in no way affect that program. We \nspecifically incorporated that in there.\n  Let me just again return to the issue of the subsidy because I think \nthat is central to the issue. I mean, if this is not a subsidy, why do \nwe go through all of the incantation of calculating a separate \npurchaser credit, making that available? Why don't we simply just \neliminate that and say, as do BLM harvesters, and in some State forest \nprograms, the individual who is bidding on a tract of timber would \nfactor into his or her, or its or their, costs what their road \nconstruction cost would be. That creates a competitive market, a level \nplaying field. Why go through all of this incantation of developing the \npurchaser road credits?\n  Mr. President, I think the answer is clear. This has conferred an \nenormous benefit to the timber harvester. For one, the GAO has \nindicated that the Forest Service itself, in calculating the purchaser \nroad credit, factors in a profit--factors in a profit. That is not a \nwash. That is not a recovery of costs. That is cost plus a profit.\n  If we are advocates of truth in budgeting, let us just eliminate that \ngimmick and simply say to all who harvest in the national forests, \nsubmit your bids, and included in your bid will be the cost that you \nwill incur in accessing the tract of timber, or for those that involve \nnew road constructions, you will factor that in.\n  Second, with the exception of the Forest Service industry itself, \nvirtually every outside analyst, the taxpayer groups, editorial writers \nacross the country, those who have been commissioned to do independent \nsurveys, have all concluded that, indeed, when one examines the cost of \nthe credit\n\n[[Page S9465]]\n\nthat is provided to the timber harvester and examines the cost incurred \nby the timber harvester, in some instances the timber harvester's costs \nare 30 percent less than the credit that is provided to the timber \nharvester.\n  Those are taxpayer resources. Those are taxpayer assets. That is \nclearly the definition of a subsidy. It goes far beyond what the cost \nincurred by the timber harvester is and provides him or her, it or \nthem, with a costly subsidy at taxpayer expense.\n  That is why from the west coast to the east coast, from north to \nsouth, editorial writers, commenters, and analysts have looked at this \nand said, ``This is a program that we cannot support.'' If we are \ntalking about being fair and honest with the taxpayers' money, how can \nwe support a program that is under a very convoluted, difficult-to-\nexplain and, I am sure, difficult-to-understand purchaser credit \nprogram where in effect what we are doing, however we disguise it, is \nproviding additional profits to a timber harvester?\n  That simply is not right. I believe any responsible budgetary \nanalysis reveals that that is in fact what has occurred. The Forest \nService itself recognizes that practice. That is why they support the \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Bryan amendment. I \nyield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. That concludes debate on the Bryan amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1188\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we now have 145 minutes on the Ashcroft \namendment. I think I can announce, on behalf of the majority leader, \nthat there will be a vote on the Ashcroft amendment at the end of that \n145 minutes or whenever time has been yielded back.\n  We will also plan to have a vote on the Bryan amendment immediately \nafter the Ashcroft amendment, probably with the usual 1 minute per side \nfor summary. But that has not been shopped to all Members to the point \nat which it can be the subject of a unanimous-consent request yet.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, if I might inquire of the floor leader, the \nfloor leader indicated that there would be time since we are going to \nhave an intervening debate?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes. The usual way is 1 minute for each side.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Fine. That will be acceptable.\n  Mr. GORTON. When we clear it, we will ask for it. That will be the \nplan.\n  After that, Mr. President, there are three other amendments that have \nbeen debated on the National Endowment for the Arts--Abraham, Sessions-\nHutchinson of Arkansas, Hutchison of Texas. We are going to attempt to \nget 30 minutes equally divided additional debate on those amendments, \nas Members have been able to speak to them previously, and, of course, \nMembers during this period of time can speak to them. That is not in \nconcrete yet, but from the perspective of planning for the afternoon \nand early evening, this would be the intention of the managers.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after Senator \nAshcroft completes at least the first part of his presentation, that I \nbe immediately recognized to use the time on our side up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection. Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to address an \nimportant issue before the American people.\n  It is an issue about the nature of Government, the purpose for \nGovernment, what we have Government for and alternative uses of \nresources of the taxpayers in this country.\n  Data this year announced, not by Government itself but by independent \nstudies including the best of the business journals, that the American \npeople this year are paying more in taxes than any other year in the \nhistory of this Republic. The gross tax load is gross.\n  As a matter of fact, the Second World War, First World War, the \nKorean war, and the war in Vietnam did not cause us to have to pay the \nkind of elevated tax rates that we pay today, nor did previous wars of \nprevious centuries.\n  The average U.S. citizen now pays the highest tax load, the biggest \nportion of his or her income that we have ever paid.\n  One of the questions that we must face, and which we must answer, is \nthe question of whether or not we should take the hard-earned resources \nof American citizens, people who get up early, work hard all day, go \nhome late seeking to help their families, whether we should take that \nresource to spend it on what the Government identifies as art or calls \nart or wants to encourage as art.\n  There will be some who say that this will be a debate about whether \nor not we support art or do not support art. I think it is important to \nnote that art as an aspect of our culture has flourished since the very \nbeginning of the United States as a nation and prior to that time.\n  Since the time we began our culture, from Plymouth Rock forward, we \nhave had an expression of art in the United States--great literature, \nwe have had great paintings, we have had tremendous capacity on the \npart of the American people to express themselves and to communicate \nnoble ideas and high aspirations through our artistic devices.\n\n  But the debate which we are about to embark upon is a debate about \nwhether the Federal Government should subsidize art and should identify \nin the art community some things for subsidy and some things for \nspecial treatment and some things to be singled out for approval while \nother things have to survive or fall based on their quality in the \nmarketplace.\n  So it is with that in mind that I rise to say, in regard to the \nappropriations bill that is now before the Senate, that we should not \nspend the resources earned by taxpayers to encourage one artist over \nanother artist, to say that some art is good and other art is bad, and \nparticularly given the record of the National Endowment for the Arts. \nFor the National Endowment for the Arts has a questionable record of \nfostering artistic expression which has countered the expression of \nvalues that most Americans cherish and the values which have provided \nthe basis for the greatness and character of these United States of \nAmerica.\n  The first point that I make is that the arts have plenty of money \nwithout the National Endowment for the Arts.\n  Let me just point to a set of statistics reflected in this particular \nchart. This compares NEA spending to private, State, and local arts \nfunding.\n  Here you have private funding, the orange portion of the chart; local \ncontributions, the green portion; the State contributions is the purple \nportion; and the NEA as proposed is the yellow portion.\n  It is pretty clear that that withdrawal of this very small portion of \nfunding, 1 percent of the funding, is not going to cause a collapse in \nthe arts. As a matter of fact, there are many individuals who are part \nof the arts community who feel this is an incentive to the wrong things \nin art.\n  So, first of all, we need to understand that the arts will survive. \nThis is not a death knell for the arts. It is, in some respects, a \ncontaminant to the arts to the extent that we continue to fund artistic \nendeavors of specific kinds, especially those things which are \nconcededly politically correct or drive the agenda of the National \nEndowment. That is where the small yellow wedge comes in.\n  Just take a look again. Private giving to the arts and cultures and \nhumanities is up. We have had some reduction. We have moved in the \nright direction. We used to give more to the arts through the National \nEndowment for the Arts than we do now. As we have had a reduction in \nthe dollars that are spent by Government for art, we have had this \nsubstantial increase, especially recently, in private giving to the \narts so that the private sector is totally capable of sustaining the \narts.\n  I just add at this point that the kind of art that sometimes gets \nfunded here is not the art of the great masses.\n  I tend not to be an individual who has invested a great deal of my \nlife in the opera.\n  Now, the opera gets a subsidy from the National Endowment for the \nArts,\n\n[[Page S9466]]\n\nbut by and large, Willie Nelson and Garth Brooks don't. Those of us \nthat drive our pickups to those concerts don't get a subsidy; but the \npeople who drive their Mercedes to the opera get a subsidy.\n  Now, it seems to me what is clear here is that the folks who \npatronize the opera don't deserve a subsidy any more than those of us \nwho enjoy the Ozark opera instead of the other kind of opera--although \nI don't purport to say I couldn't enjoy both kinds.\n  The first point I am making here is that the arts are not in trouble. \nSecond, the arts funding from the Federal Government is 1 percent or \nso. Third, the private share of contribution to the arts is up \ndramatically. State and local governments dominate giving to the arts. \nThe Federal Government contributes a low portion of that.\n  Employment in the arts in the 1990's is up. So we have a vigorous \narts community and it is an arts community which continues to grow. \nThis has been an upward trend at a time when we had a decline in the \namount of Federal funding for the arts. If people are interested in \nmore people coming into the arts, they could say that as we have \ndecreased the funding, we have had more people going in. We are not \nthreatening the arts.\n  Median household income for artists is up. It exceeds the income for \nthe rest of the labor force. It seems to me we are not threatening the \nart community or questioning whether the United States is going to have \nart.\n  Art attendance is up in every category, from jazz, classical music, \nopera, musicals, plays, ballet, art museums. We had more people \nparticipating in the arts in 1992 than in 1982. I don't believe that is \na trend that will be reversed. These things are a function of the fact \nthat people have leisure time and the people have disposable net income \nand are not dependent on whether or not we have a National Endowment \nfor the Arts. Artists are increasingly college educated as well.\n  Total receipts for performance arts events are up and are approaching \nthe receipts for spectator sports. This gap is narrowing. The arts, \nindeed, are flourishing in the United States. They are getting closer \nand closer to matching the same kind of receipts as for spectator \nsports.\n  The point I make is that the arts have an abundance of funding. They \ndon't need to take the resources from families that the families need \nto spend on themselves. We are now taxed at the highest rate since the \nonset of this Republic, since we have been in existence. We frequently \nhave both parents in the work force, one to pay for Government, the \nother to support the family. We have governmental programming that is \ntaking resources, saying we can spend this money better on your family \nthan you can spend it on yourself. My own view is that is not something \nthat we need to support. The arts do not require it, and I believe \npeople are entitled to additional tax relief.\n  The second point is whether the arts and the NEA need the money. \nAccording to the sponsors, this kind of an appropriation is not an \nissue. The arts do not need the money. They say what is needed here is \nsort of--the Federal Government telling people what is good and what is \nnot good in the arts community. They call this the Good Housekeeping \nSeal of Approval argument. On several occasions individuals have come \nto the floor of the U.S. Senate here and said whenever the NEA comes in \nand puts its so-called stamp of approval on items that it somehow makes \nit possible for those artists to survive because people need the NEA to \ndevelop a way of helping people understand what is good art and what is \nbad art.\n  I don't think the NEA has been very good at developing good art. They \nhave some good art, they have some art that is atrocious. It is clear \nto me that whether it has the NEA stamp of approval on it does not make \na difference.\n\n  I go back to an earlier example. This is an item of art which the NEA \nhas paid for in the past. It is a poem, or so we are told it is a poem. \nIt was part of an anthology. This was an anthology for which money was \npaid, hundreds of dollars paid, to support this ``L-I-G-H-G-H-T'' as a \npoem in the anthology. Now I suppose you might say most people would \nnot recognize this as great art just looking at these letters. I was \nnot extremely well educated. I went to the public schools, and, \nfrankly, I have to confess I did not see that this was great art when I \nfirst saw this. As a matter of fact, I thought it was a misspelling--\nbut it could be great art.\n  The argument is if you put the seal of approval on it by the NEA, \nsomehow it will make it possible for everyone to agree it is great art, \nso if you somehow tack the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval on it--it \nhas Good Housekeeping and here is the National Endowment for the Arts, \na combination of what proponents of this legislation say--the National \nEndowment symbol becomes the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval for \nthis, I suppose folks around the country will now recognize this word \nas great art, that this is great poetry. I hardly think so.\n  The truth of the matter is you do not convert art into great art by \nputting some governmental seal of approval on it. It doesn't change the \ncharacter of it. As a matter of fact, it doesn't help us at all in many \nrespects.\n  One of the individuals that I talked to earlier pointed out to me \nthat in regard to this poem a Congressman called the author of the \nanthology, the one who had developed the book that included this and \nfor which the Government paid, and asked the developer of the anthology \nto explain it. The author of the anthology said, ``You are from the \nMidwest. You are culturally deprived, so you would not understand it, \nanyway,'' no use to explain to you why this misspelled word or \napparently misspelled word is great art.\n  Well, I suppose people could say that we need the NEA so this sort of \nGood Housekeeping Seal of Approval could convert misspellings into \ngreat art and people would know how to invest their money. I hardly \nthink so. I have to make that argument with my tongue in my cheek. I \nwonder how those who made the argument kept their tongue out of their \ncheek in that respect?\n  The mere fact that something has the National Endowment for the Arts \non it--and this particular stamp of approval is there--doesn't make it \ngood art or doesn't make it bad art. The American people are still left \nto make their own judgments. The Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval \ndoesn't really tell us much, although it does tell us something about \nthe theory of Government that people have.\n  Some people think that the American people can't make good judgments \nabout value themselves and they need Government to identify those \nthings which are worthy of their support, and our Government's absence \nof an identifying seal would be something that is not worthy of your \nsupport. I think they have inverted what is important to understand \nabout democracy in that the genius of democracy is not that the \nGovernment would identify the great values of the world and impose them \non the people. That is the idea of the monarchy, where somebody up high \nin some remote place would tell everybody what to think and do. The \ngenius of a democracy is just the opposite of that. It is not that \nsomeone up high in some remote place tells everybody what to do. It is \nthat the people, together, have a set of values, and instead of having \nvalues imposed on them by the Government, the people impose their \nvalues on the system. That is the genius of a democracy. The idea that \nsomehow we need the National Endowment for the Arts to impose values on \nthis culture is a bankrupt idea, in my judgment.\n  Of course part of the argument that says we need the National \nEndowment for the Arts is that it identifies where people should invest \nin the arts. You don't have to tell people what they should like and \nnot like, but this helps artists who are fledgling going around and \nsaying you should invest in me as an artist because I have the seal of \napproval from the National Endowment for the Arts--sort of the idea you \ncould have a central planning agency for the allocation of artistic \nresources.\n\n  Now, central planning for the allocation of resources is not a novel \nidea. As a matter of fact, some countries tried it, not just for art. \nSome countries have tried it for all of their economic endeavors. That \nis really the definition of communism or socialism, that you have some \nhead of planning in the economy that tells you what is good, bad, where \nyou should invest and where you shouldn't invest as a culture. So you \ndecide to grow this many acres of\n\n[[Page S9467]]\n\npotatoes, this many acres of corn, and you make this much steel, and it \nis all planned at the center of things. It is supposed to be a good \nsystem, in theory.\n  It took about 80 years around the world to figure out what the theory \nwas, but it was a theory of collapse. We only have two fully confessed \nCommunist regimes left in the world now, North Korea--and most of the \nrest of the world is trying to send them aid so their children don't \nstarve to death--and Cuba, which is teetering on the edge of its own \ndemise. The truth of the matter is central government planning to \nallocate the resources in the arts community isn't any more effective \nor any more to be desired than central governmental planning and \nallocation of resources in the industrial communities, the \nmanufacturing community or the agricultural communities.\n  The genius of the marketplace is that it rewards those things which \nare valuable in the absence of planning in Government, not that it gets \nsignals from Government or some planning agency or some guru in some \nbureaucracy that says, ``This is my beloved artist in whom I am well \npleased, put all your money here.'' As a matter of fact, some of the \nthings that have been designated as those things to be supported like \nthis poem--this is not the title for the poem, Mr. President, this is \nthe poem. This is it, the whole nine yards. This is it.\n  There is a dispute about whether the actual payment was $1,500 or \n$750. You can do the quick math. It is $107 a letter if it was $750, \nand $214 a letter if it was $1,500. I make this copy as a bargain to \nyou, and just give you the $107 rate if you think your marketplace \nwould sustain it. Of course, I am not sure whether this is the French \nversion of the poem, the English or the German version of the poem, \nbecause I have looked in the dictionaries and I don't find it in the \nEnglish dictionary, the French dictionary or the German dictionary, but \nwho knows. I know one thing, putting the seal of approval on this would \nnot increase its value to me, and I don't think it does for the \nculture.\n  The truth of the matter is there are other reasons why we shouldn't \nbe wanting to subsidize speech. Those reasons include the fact that the \nsubsidization of speech results in the corruption of the arts. Jan \nBreslauer of the Los Angeles Times wrote eloquently that the National \nEndowment for the Arts results in the corrosive effect on the arts, \nthat as a matter of fact that effect on the arts was prompted by the \nfact that National Endowment rewards politically correct art and art \nexpression. She says, ``The Endowment has quietly pursued policies \nrooted in identity politics.'' The National Endowment for the Arts is \nconducting a political effort, ``a kind of separatism that emphasizes \nracial, sexual and cultural differences above all else.''\n  This is art subsidized by Government and specifically designed to \nseparate us one from another based on racial differences, sexual \ndifferences and cultural differences. She says these policies have not \n``excited much controversy, but they have had a profoundly corrosive \neffect on the American arts.'' Here is a clear indication by an art \ncritic that the subsidy of arts, based on political preference, based \non subject matter that is designed to divide the American people based \non sexual, cultural and racial lines, pulls us apart rather than \nunifies us, has a corrosive effect on the arts. Not only a corrosive \neffect on the arts, it has a corrosive effect on the culture.\n  I wonder if we ought to spend our resources on something which \nproduces that kind of an impact on the culture?\n  Mr. President, there are a number of other reasons and things I would \nlike to say about this. We will have debate on both sides. I know the \nSenator from California is eager to speak. I want to give her an \nopportunity. So I sum up by saying there is no crisis in funding for \nthe arts. People of America are taxed at their highest rates in \nhistory.\n  There is no reason to require that there be a Good Housekeeping Seal \nof Approval from the Government to try to dignify art that is not art, \nor to make decent those things which are indecent and unacceptable. \nGood art will be good art whether or not you label it with an NEA seal. \nAn artistic statement, as a matter of fact, that came before the onset \nof the NEA, and will survive long after it, is that ``A rose is nothing \nbut a rose no matter what you call it, and by any other name, it is \nstill a rose.''\n  With that in mind, I think it is time for us to say we have spent \nmore than enough in subsidizing politically correct activities under \nthe guise of promoting the arts.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you so much, Mr. President. Now, I have heard the \nSenator from Ohio very eloquently express his views. I think it is time \nthat we hear from the other side.\n  I am very pleased to be a member of this Subcommittee on Interior \nAppropriations, and I was very pleased that we were able to resolve the \nquestion of the native Americans. I felt very strongly that had we not \ndone that, we were going to do a grave injustice to native Americans \nand turn our backs on history, justice, fairness, and the Constitution. \nSo I was very pleased to support Senators McCain, Campbell, and the \nothers. They convinced the chairman of our subcommittee to put that \nfight off until another time.\n  I thought we were going to be OK on the National Endowment for the \nArts. It comes to the floor of the U.S. Senate funded at about the same \nlevel as last year, and here we are faced with an array of amendments \nto wipe out the National Endowment for the Arts. Now, this is the most \nextreme one. It would totally do away with the National Endowment for \nthe Arts. I think it is a very radical and very serious step for us to \ntake.\n  I want to comment, because I think it is important to correct the \nRecord, or at least straighten it out a little bit, on the poem that \nthe Senator from Ohio continues to hold up in this debate. It is a one-\nword poem. I agree, it doesn't make much sense to me either. And, yes, \nthe NEA has made some mistakes. I'm sorry, I mean the Senator from \nMissouri, not Ohio. What the Senator from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, \ndoes not tell us in his eloquent debate is that the one-word poem he \nholds up was funded 30 years ago; it was funded in 1968. He holds it up \non the floor of the U.S. Senate as if these are the kinds of grants \nthat are being made today.\n  Now, if we are going to have an honest debate, why don't we be honest \nwith each other? I saw that poem and I said, ``That doesn't make much \nsense.'' Then I found out it was funded 30 years ago. Now, there are \nmany reforms that have been put into place in the National Endowment \nfor the Arts. Does it mean there might not be a mistake or two in the \nfuture? No. There may be some out of the thousands and thousands of \ngrants. But to hold up a poem funded 30 years ago, when I was just a \nkid--as a matter of fact, 30 years ago, I became a mother for the first \ntime, and now my kids are having kids. So, yes, there was a mistake \nmade, I agree. You know, there are mistakes made in life, but we don't \njust take a meat ax to the problem. And we didn't; we have made \nreforms.\n  The other point that I think is interesting for the Senator from \nMissouri to imply is that the music funded by the National Endowment \nfor the Arts is all for the elite, the upper crust, and he talked about \nthe opera and how he doesn't go to the opera much, and yet, the opera \nis funded. Well, I tell the Senator from Missouri that many groups \nacross the country are funded by the NEA: The Carter Family Memorial \nMusic Center in Hiltons, VA, supporting a weekly series and annual \nfestival of old-time traditional music, played on acoustic instruments. \nThere is the Western Folklife Center in Nevada, dedicated to the \npreservation and presentation of the cultural traditions of the \nAmerican West. There is the Folk Arts Apprenticeship Program, fostering \nthe growth and evolution of Mississippi's traditional arts by bringing \nmaster traditional artists together with promising apprentices.\n\n  So, again, we have a misleading presentation here that doesn't square \nwith the facts. This is 1997, not 1968. Mistakes were made, but many \nrevisions have taken place and reforms have been implemented to \nstraighten out the problems.\n  In 1993, the NEA initiated a complete overhaul of the agency's grant \nreview\n\n[[Page S9468]]\n\nand monitoring process. All subgrants to private nonapproved groups \nhave been eliminated. Since 1996, all fine arts grants to individual \nartists have been eliminated. Since 1996, all grants to organizations \nmust be for projects specifically described in the application, further \nincreasing accountability of grantees. Since 1994, all grantees must \nfile interim and final project reports. The final one-third of all \ngrant payments are withheld pending the NEA's approval of grantees' \ninterim reports. In addition, grantees must now seek written permission \nin advance to change grant activities proposed in the organization's \napplication. The National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act \nof 1965 requires a rigorous multistep review process of all \napplications. Diverse panels of citizens, representing wide geographic, \nethnic, and cultural points of view, review all applications. Following \npanel consideration, all applications are then reviewed by the National \nCouncil on the Arts, which is a body of 26 private citizens nominated \nby the President and, yes, confirmed by the U.S. Senate to 6-year \nterms. Do we have so little faith in what we have already done to \nstraighten out some of the problems with the NEA that we would, with \none vote, do away with the NEA? I hope not. By the way, applications \nrecommended by the council for support are forwarded to the chairman of \nNEA for a final decision. The chairman may not approve an application \nwith respect to which the council has made a negative evaluation. So we \nhave even put a rein on the chairman.\n  Some of my colleagues have spoken on this floor expressing concerns \nthat projects receiving funding from the NEA are obscene. Anybody who \nsays that should know that Federal law ensures that artistic excellence \nand artistic merit are the criteria used to evaluate applications. The \nlaw expressly prohibits the award of financial assistance to any \nproject or program determined to be obscene. If a mistake is made in \njudgment, yes, we should ensure that it is corrected, just as we must \ndo in any Federal agency or just as we must do in our own lives. If one \npostman is obnoxious as he or she delivers the mail, we don't stop \ndelivering the mail. We get rid of that person. If one military officer \nsexually harasses another, we don't shut down the military; we hold a \nhearing and we hold the perpetrator accountable.\n  We have had an extraordinary number of military planes crashing, and \nnot one person would suggest that we don't build any more military \nplanes. Clearly, we are going to take the problems as they come to us \nand deal with them. And, surely, we are capable of doing that with the \nNational Endowment for the Arts. This body ought to be very pleased \nthat it has made tremendous progress.\n  Now, speaking of the military, we spend more on military bands than \nwe spend on the National Endowment for the Arts. I support spending \nmoney on military bands. I also support spending money on the National \nEndowment for the Arts. We spent $176.2 million on military bands in \n1997, which is almost twice the $99.4 million spent on the NEA. Let me \ntell you something. If a military band played an inappropriate song, or \nsomeone was dressed inappropriately or, in any way, degraded that \ncultural event, we would address the situation. By the way, it is very \nimportant to our country that we keep the culture of the U.S. military \nand that we keep the music of patriotism that fills our souls every \ntime we hear from it. But if there is a mistake made and \nan inappropriate song chosen, or someone is acting in an inappropriate \nway, we don't walk away from funding the military band. Do you know \nwhat we spend per person for the NEA? When this Senate voted $10 \nbillion more for the military than the military asked for, I stood on \nthis floor in disbelief, because I heard all these speeches about how \nmuch money we are spending in taxes. I agree, I don't want to spend \nmoney we don't need to spend. I want to give the military what it \nneeds--not $10 billion more. But now we are going to save the Federal \nbudget because we are going to cut out less than $100 million, 38 cents \nper person in this United States of America?\n\n  I was called to a meeting in San Diego. In terms of politics, I would \nsay you would call it a Republican county. I had people there from the \nbusiness community, I had people there from the arts community, I had \npeople there from nonprofit organizations, and we had elected officials \nthere of both political parties. Do you know what their message to me \nwas? Go and fight this thing, because every time we get a dollar from \nthe NEA, we get matched $12. ``It is important,'' they said to me, \n``for our community.'' As a matter of fact, they said to me, ``Can't \nyou fight so that we can spend 50 cents per person in a year? If we \nspend 50 cents per person a year, we would get that much more leverage, \nthat much more job creation, that much more tourism, and it would help \nus.'' So it is very interesting. In San Diego, CA, I get called to a \nmeeting and I am told to fight for more. Here I find myself fighting \njust to keep what we have.\n  So when we talk about tax load, don't be fooled about that. Don't be \nfooled. In essence, what we have here is a grant program that is far \nlower than it was under George Bush and Ronald Reagan who, by the way, \nsigned all those bills for the NEA--and it costs 38 cents per person.\n  Public funding of the arts is good for the economy. Now, there was a \nrecent study by McKinsey Consultants for New York City and they said in \ntheir study that funding of the arts generates taxes, which brings down \nthe deficit, jobs and economic growth far in excess of the amounts \ninvested.\n  I used to be a stockbroker. When you look at recommending a stock, \nyou look at whether or not it is a good investment. Does it bring back \ndividends? When you put in a dollar, what do you get out? This is \nclear. Republicans in my State, Democrats in my State, Independent \nvoters in my State--this is the place where they cross over party \nlines. They want us to save the NEA. They think it is good. They know \nmistakes will happen, yes, when you give thousands of grants. I think \nthey are willing to forgive a grant made in 1968. An investment of $100 \nmillion in the NEA is relatively small. We are talking about less than \none one-hundredth of 1 percent of the nearly $1.5 trillion Federal \nbudget.\n  Now, I want to share with you some pictures because I think they are \nworth many times a thousand words. Let me talk about Leon Bates, a \nworld-class, highly respected concert pianist, who has appeared with \nmajor orchestras throughout the United States, Europe and Africa. By \nthe way, my colleagues have talked about Communist countries and have \nsomehow linked what we are doing here to communism. You know, if you \nlook at every capitalist country in the world, every democracy and \ncapitalist country in the world, they spend a far greater proportion of \ntheir budgets on the arts than we do. So I don't get how communism, \nsocialism and capitalism comes in here, because in fact every \ncapitalist democracy in the world spends more on the arts than we do. \nSo I don't see how that gets into the debate.\n  Well, here is Leon Bates. He has traveled in Europe, Africa, and the \nUnited States. He was hired by the Long Beach Symphony Orchestra to \nperform a piano concerto in January of 1996.\n  As part of this week-long residency of rehearsals and public \nappearances, Mr. Bates performed for an audience of 250 members of the \nLong Beach Boys and Girls Club.\n  Everyone in here stands up and talks about the children--everyone of \nus. And we should.\n  I wish you could see the faces on these kids at the Boys and Girls \nClubs watching this creative genius perform his work with an NEA grant \nenabling him to go to the Boys and Girls Clubs, be a role model, and \ngive them a love of music. He is the perfect ambassador for classical \nmusic to an audience of children, parents, and counselors who are not \nexposed to the world of performing arts that often. He brought with him \na full-sized concert grand piano, and in between anecdotes from his \nlife as a musician he answered questions and played excerpts from \nseveral classical composers. The event was a spectacular success.\n  He was supported in part by the NEA. Without continued support of the \nNEA, the Long Beach Symphony Orchestra would not be able to bring in \ntop-quality artists like Mr. Bates.\n  I want to show you another photograph which I think is wonderful. The \nSenator from Missouri holds up a poem from 1968. I am talking about \nwhat is\n\n[[Page S9469]]\n\ngoing on now. This is a group called We Tell Stories. It is a \nperformance group based in Los Angeles--a troop of actors which travels \nto museums, parks, schools, and libraries to perform stories for \nchildren. Its goal is to enhance cultural awareness, communication, and \nawaken a taste for theater and children of all cultures.\n  We Tell Stories received an NEA grant to support the creation and \npresentation throughout the United States of work by Carl Sandburg, a \ngreat American.\n  We Tell Stories began in cooperation with the Los Angeles County \nMuseum of Art in 1981. Now in partnership with several organizations \nand agencies, including the Los Angeles Unified School District, and \nthe troupe has performed for over 2 million people. In 1996, the troupe \npresented performances for 270,000 children.\n  I am coming to the conclusion of my remarks, much to the delight of \nseveral of my colleagues who are here to speak. But I want to show you \none last photograph. This is one of the audience members who was \nwatching a recent performance in Westwood, CA, by We Tell Stories. Look \nat her face. It captures the promise of the arts. The great \nexpectations of the arts, the creativity, the imagination.\n  Will there be art without the NEA? Of course. I say to my colleague \nfrom Missouri, there will always be the arts. Why wouldn't there be? \nOne of the things we do in this country is to give a very small \namount--38 cents per person in this country to be matched 12 times by \nthe private sector, the nonprofit communities, the State governments. \nWhy would we do that? To bring these opportunities to the people of our \ncountry--and, yes; to the children of our country--because that is what \nthe NEA has been focusing on recently.\n  I just want to say that I know we have disagreements in this body. I \nrespect those disagreements, and I respect my colleagues who come at it \nfrom a different way. But I think for the sake of this debate the \nAmerican people--and I know the people in my State of every political \npersuasion--again, in my State, there are three issues that unite \npeople along party lines. This is California, and I can't speak for \nMissouri, and I can't speak for any other State, but there are three \nissues that make people cross over party lines.\n  One of them is the environment. People cross over, and they say, \n``You know, I don't care if you are a Democrat or Republican. I want \nclean air. I want clean water. And I want my kid to grow up without \ngetting environmental cancer.''\n  So there are no politics in that issue, in my opinion, in my State.\n  Another issue is a woman's right to choose. It's the same thing--\npeople from both parties come to me, and they say, ``Please. This is a \nprivate personal matter, and it has nothing to do with Government. Stay \nout of our lives.''\n  And the third issue is funding for the arts. I have letters. I have \nphone calls. I have gone to meetings. I have never seen such bipartisan \naudiences as I have with those three issues.\n  On this issue, they all agree that we need to put the facts on the \ntable. This isn't some political issue. This is a really important \nissue for our people. Will we stand up and say, ``For a modest amount \nper person, 38 cents a year, we will work with the States, the local \ngroups, the local symphonies, the local Girl Scouts, the groups that \nbenefit from this to bring the arts to our people, to help them \nleverage that investment?''\n  I can't imagine why anyone would think that it is dangerous for us to \nhave this very modest program that sparks such enthusiasm. Are there \nmistakes? Yes. Are there mistakes in everything we do in life? \nAbsolutely. But that doesn't mean we destroy the idea of the spark.\n  Senator Kennedy and Senator Jeffords across party lines have worked \nout an agreement on this. They would block grant up to 40 percent of \nthe NEA funds and send it back to the States. That is a good \ncompromise. That would be up from 35 percent.\n  I hope we can come together across party lines because we need to do \nthat.\n  I hope we will reject this amendment. I hope that we will support the \nJeffords-Kennedy attempt to resolve this matter. And let's make sure \nthat we fulfill our responsibilities, it seems to me, to have a small, \ndynamic, flexible program that responds to criticism but continues to \ngive a modicum of support--let's use it to support dance and the arts \nin this Nation.\n  Thank you, very much, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I reserve the remainder of our side's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I thank the Senator from California for correcting the fact that I am \nnot from Ohio. I didn't want people from Ohio to be too upset. It \nreminds me of my having been introduced as having been an individual \nfrom Missouri but who was born in Illinois. I say, ``Yes, both States \nclaim me. Missouri claims I am from Illinois, and Illinois claims I am \nfrom Missouri.''\n  The truth of the matter is that I would like to address some of the \nissues which the Senator from California has talked about.\n  She mentions the fact of a poem--for which we paid $214 a letter--\nwhich was paid for earlier in the history of the National Endowment. \nShe is correct. But it is incorrect to suggest that there are not \nabuses now that are even more egregious.\n  This is one of the more decent egregious abuses of National Endowment \nmoney.\n  I have excerpts from a book in my hand which very proudly bears the \nimprint, the so-called good seal of approval, of the National Endowment \nfor the Arts. This book was published in 1996 after all the supposed \nimprovements, after all of these wonderful safeguards to make sure that \nour money is well spent. I think it is instructive to read just what \nthe authors say about their own book. This isn't some attack upon the \nbook. This is the bragging of the authors.\n  I read:\n\n       The blood of the Mugwump clan of Catholic gender-shifting \n     vampires has become infected by decadent words and confused \n     memories.\n\n  It talks about a man trapped inside a body that is always changing \nfrom male to female, and dealing with his polysexual sister.\n  I asked my staff to just take a couple of pages of the book. And this \nbook was written because the National Endowment for the Arts felt that \nthe American people needed to have this capacity to identify good art \nso they could invest in it under the ``Good Housekeeping'' or ``good \nart'' seal. I asked them just to get a couple of pages of the book and \nXerox them. But I said, ``Be sure to mark out the things that would be \nnot suitable to be shown on C-SPAN in the middle of the day.''\n  This is what a typical set of pages looks like. This is what the \nAmerican people are paying for. This isn't something from 30 years ago. \nThis is something from 30 minutes ago. This is something that is \ncurrent. This is something from 1996.\n  No. 1, the so-called reforms have been ineffective. And, if we had an \nabuse which was at least not obscene--our abuses have not gone uphill. \nThey have gone downhill.\n  I have a list of current abusive things funded by the National \nEndowment for the Arts. I could go through them time after time. I will \nnot bother to give them to you. Hundreds of thousands--hundreds and \nhundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars wasted in the current \nselection of grantees. They are not as easy to describe, and they are \nnot as suitable for television as the 30-year-old abuses are. \nUnfortunately, they are not as easy to use on television.\n  The Senator from California pled for honesty and integrity in talking \nabout whether or not we would have any funding--that somehow there is a \nmatching grant program. There is no matching program. We are not \ntalking about matching funds here. We are just talking about other \nmoney spent on the arts--most of it in the private sector. And when \nthey have that kind of an expenditure, sure enough, they could say, \n``For every dollar we have in Federal money we have $12 in private \nmoney.'' That doesn't mean the private money wouldn't have been spent \nanyhow. After all, what happened before 1965 when Lyndon Johnson \nconcluded in the Great Society that we had to have funding for the \narts? For several\n\n[[Page S9470]]\n\nhundred years America had great artists, and we weren't devoid of \nexpenditure. We had great museums. We had tremendous collections. We \nhad artists who thrived. We had novelists, and poets.\n  So it is pretty clear to me that art is not dependent upon some \nmatching fund system.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 40 minutes and 41 \nseconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. President, first of all, the Senator from Missouri has repeatedly \ntalked about the poem ``Lighght.'' He has held up this little piece of \npaper, and he has talked about this poem and castigated it as one of \nthe great spending holes of the U.S. Government, we spent money on the \npoem ``Lighght.''\n  Well, I saw that and I recognized it. Believe it or not, I recognized \nthat poem. And so I thought I would take some time since I have a \nhistory in this to shed a little light on ``Lighght''.\n  Now, again, I am glad that the Senator from California brought this \nup because the Senator from Missouri never did mention this until the \nSenator from California, Mrs Boxer, brought it up. This poem \n``Lighght'' was published in 1969. The Senator from Missouri did not \nsay that. He admitted it after the Senator from California pointed that \nout. But in listening in the last couple of days to the Senator from \nMissouri, one would have assumed that this grant was just made, not in \nfact made in 1969, when it was.\n  Mr. President, the debate on the NEA, National Endowment for the \nArts, has set a new standard for debate in the Senate. First of all, \nsuggesting that we should eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts \nin 1997 because of a grant that was made in 1969 begs incredulity. That \nwould be like saying the State of Missouri, since it had laws on its \nbooks that allowed segregated schools until the 1960's, will not be \neligible for Federal education programs. Or saying that the University \nof Alabama will be prohibited from participating in Federal student aid \nprograms because it was segregated prior to June 1963, or the schools \nin Little Rock, AR.\n  Times change. Conditions change. Well, now, the Senator from Missouri \nsaid, oh, OK, fine. ``Lighght,'' this was 1969, but then he held up a \npiece of paper which he was reading something from--I didn't catch it \nall, but it was from a book called ``Blood of Mugwump,'' which I never \nheard of until today, but I remembered someone had said something to me \nabout it and I looked it up. My staff gave me this. Lo and behold, the \nSenator from Missouri is wrong again. ``Blood of Mugwump'' did not \nreceive any NEA funding. How many of these misrepresentations will we \nhear from the Senator from Missouri in debate on funding of the \nNational Endowment for the Arts?\n  Now, I have here a letter, Mr. President, from People For The \nAmerican Way. It said:\n\n       In a letter to Congressional Members dated June 25, 1997, \n     the Christian Coalition urged Members to ``vote against any \n     amendments to increase NEA funding'' and asserted that the \n     NEA is now ``funding the proliferation of pornography,'' \n     citing specifically two films, ``Sick'' and ``Age 12,'' and \n     one book, ``Blood of Mugwump.''\n       Fact 5: The Christian Coalition is wrong. The NEA did not \n     fund any of the three examples used.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this material from the \nPeople For The American Way be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Claim: In a letter to Congressional members dated June 25, \n     1997, the Christian Coalition urged members to ``vote against \n     any amendments to increase NEA funding'' and asserted that \n     the NEA is now ``funding the proliferation of pornography,'' \n     citing specifically two films, ``Sick'' and ``Age 12'' and \n     one book, ``Blood of Mugwump.''\n       Fact: The Christian Coalition was wrong. The NEA did not \n     fund any of the three examples used.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator from Missouri would like, I am sure that \nwe could sign him up for People For the American Way, and he could get \nthe correct information as to what is going on and not the false \ninformation that he got from the so-called Christian Coalition.\n  And so again the Senator from Missouri has brought up something that \nsimply has no basis in fact. And I have here again, Mr. President, a \nletter dated March 17, 1997, from Karen Christensen, general counsel of \nthe National Endowment for the Arts. It is written to Mr. Curtis White. \nI will not read the whole thing. It just said here:\n\n       The progress report which you filed with this agency \n     erroneously included ``Blood of Mugwump'' as among those \n     volumes partially supported by a grant from the National \n     Endowment for the Arts; this is not the case.\n       In any future publications, including promotional materials \n     and reprints of FC2 volumes, please remove any reference to \n     the National Endowment for the Arts from any publication \n     which is not supported by an NEA grant.\n       I would appreciate prompt attention to this matter.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       The Nancy Hanks Center,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 17, 1997.\n     Re Grant #96-5223-0091.\n\n     Mr. Curtis White,\n     Co-Director, Fiction Collective 2, Unit for Contemporary \n         Literature, Illinois State University, Normal, IL.\n       Dear Mr. White: It has come to my attention that the \n     National Endowment for the Arts has been credited with \n     supporting a number of books published by FC2 that were not \n     funded by a grant from this agency. As you know and as the \n     Endowment's grant letter makes clear, funds are released for \n     the specific project described in the grant letter and \n     specified in the grant application. The Endowment's logo \n     should be used only on those publications for which a grant \n     was received.\n       Grant #96-5223-0091, which will conclude on June 30, 1997, \n     awarded funds for the following books: S, by Jeffrey \n     DeShell; Mexico Trilogy, by D.M. Stuefloten; A Spell for the \n     Fulfillment of Desire, by Don Webb; Memory Wax, by Alan \n     Singer; and Aviary Slag, by Jacques Servin. The progress \n     report which you filed with this agency erroneously included \n     Blood of Mugwump as among those volumes partially supported \n     by a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts; this is \n     not the case.\n       In any future publications, including promotional materials \n     and reprints of FC2 volumes, please remove any reference to \n     the National Endowment for the Arts from any publication \n     which is not supported by an NEA grant.\n       I would appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Karen Christensen,\n                                                  General Counsel.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, Mr. President, if the Senator from Missouri was \nreally serious, I am sure that he could have found out that in March of \nthis year the National Endowment for the Arts wrote a letter to the \ndirector, who put out this book, I guess, under this grant, that it \nwasn't supported by the NEA. And the Senator from Missouri would not \nhave stood in this Chamber today and said that ``Blood of Mugwump'' was \nanother example of bad taxpayer spending by the National Endowment for \nthe Arts.\n  I caution my friend from Missouri that he simply check his facts. \nThat is all. And I am certain that if he just wanted to check his \nfacts, if the Senator from Missouri just simply wanted to check whether \nor not what he was saying was factual, a simple call to the National \nEndowment for the Arts--they are not hard to get hold of. They are \nright down here in Washington, DC. Their phone number is 682-5400. I \nwould suggest to my friend from Missouri that he simply pick up the \nphone and call them, ask them: Is it so that ``Blood of Mugwump'' was \nfunded by an NEA grant? And he would have been told the facts.\n  So I think we have an obligation when we debate here on the Senate \nfloor to be, at least, somewhat careful. I know we make mistakes around \nhere. But, at least, try to check our facts out.\n  In that regard, Mr. President, I would like to talk a little bit more \nabout the poem ``Lighght.'' Now, the reason this came to my attention \nis because this was an issue in my first campaign for public office in \n1974 when then incumbent Congressman Bill Scherle in the House had gone \nafter the National Endowment for the Arts on the same basis, that they \nhad funded this word, one-word poem ``Lighght.''\n\n[[Page S9471]]\n\n  And so I want to set the record straight, and I want to talk a little \nbit about it to get the facts out, the latest facts out. Mr. President, \nhere are the facts. The National Endowment for the Arts sponsored a \nthree-part series entitled ``American Literary Anthology.'' This was \nthe idea of George Plimpton and also Roger Stevens, that they would \nseek out writers, poets around the country who were not well known, who \nmaybe had published in small literary journals that had small \ncirculation, to have a contest to put them together and to pick what \njudges decided were the best of these new writers and to put them in an \nAmerican anthology to give them a wider berth so that more people could \nread them.\n  The purpose again was to support small literary magazines and their \ncontributors. After all, most writers, Mr. President, don't start \nwriting for Esquire or the New Yorker or the big magazines. They start \nwith small literary journals around the country. And so that was the \nidea of George Plimpton and Roger Stevens, to get some of these new \nwriters out there and bring them in and give them a wider circulation.\n  I spoke just the other evening with George Plimpton about this. He \nand Peter Ardery were the directors of the ``American Literary \nAnthology.'' He told me that the NEA grant in 1966 had three goals. \nFirst, to provide wider distribution for literary works which first \nappeared in magazines with limited circulation. Second, to supplement \nthe small stipend the magazines used to provide to the authors.\n  As Mr. Plimpton told me, in many cases these writers got nothing \nexcept four or five copies of the magazine in which they were \npublished.\n  So, it was to supplement it. And here was the supplement: $1,000 for \nprose material, $500 for poems. That was to the contributor, the \nwriter. And, third, to reward the magazines which published the \nliterary works in the first place: $500 for prose, $250 for poems. The \ntotal was $60,000 for the second volume. So the Senator from Missouri \nis wrong again. Again, I ask the Senator from Missouri, please check \nyour facts. The amount of grant for this one-word poem was not $1,500, \nit was $750: $500 to the writer, $250 to the magazine.\n  I am certain the Senator will say that $750 is still too much for \nthis poem, but nonetheless I thought it important to set the record \nstraight, that it is not $1,500, it was $750.\n  I got a copy of the American Literary Anthology, volume II. Actually \nI read some of the poems in it. It is interesting that the Senator from \nMissouri picked out a poem written by Aram Saroyan, the son of William \nSaroyan, by the way. I don't know Aram Saroyan. I have never read his \npoetry before and I have not since. But I looked in volume II of the \nAmerican Literary Anthology to see who else was published: people like \nRobert Penn Warren, John Ashberry, Jim Harrison--I say to the Senator \nfrom Missouri, Jim Harrison, who later wrote ``Legends of the Fall,'' \nwhich has been made into a movie, I guess; W.S. Merwyn, Pulitzer Prize-\nwinning poet who also attended the Writers Workshop at the University \nof Iowa, and I will say more about that in a second; James Tate, one of \nour foremost poets in America; Joyce Carol Oates, also in volume II.\n  That is just a sampling. Why didn't he pick out some of those? No; he \npicked out this one-word poem, just to show people how it appeared in \nthe book. Here it is, volume II, a one-word poem, on one page.\n  This is called calligraphic poetry. Calligraphic poetry is poetry \nwhere it's not just the content of the poem, but it is how it is laid \nout on the page that also sends a message, or conveys a thought or a \nfeeling. I might point out to the Senator from Missouri that \ncalligraphic poetry is not new; it is very old. In fact, some \ncalligraphic poetry goes back to the 18th century, some in religious \npoetry. These religious poetry might be shaped in the form of pulpits, \ncrosses, churches, saints, icons, things like that, to convey a \nreligious image by the way the poem looked as well as the words that \nthe poem contained.\n  I must say, I think the Senator from Missouri, if I might just say--I \nthink the Senator from Missouri picked the wrong poem. There is a poem, \nit starts on page 273 of the second volume of the American Literary \nAnthology. It is ``The Last Will And Testimony of Art Evergreen,'' and \nit goes on for 17 pages. If the Senator had picked that poem, he might \nhave a little more sympathy from this Senator. I say that tongue in \ncheek.\n  But why did the Senator not also pick the poem on page 339 by James \nTate called ``Stray Animals''? No; he picked this one-word poem \nbecause, obviously, he doesn't like it. Frankly, I am not certain I \nlike it either. It doesn't say much to me. But some calligraphic poetry \nI like, in the way the words are shaped and put on a page. That one \ndoesn't say much to me at all. But, nonetheless, it is legitimate \npoetry. And there are a lot of other poems in there.\n  Again, the Senator may not care for this type of poetry, but that is \nno reason to abolish the National Endowment for the Arts. Over its 32-\nyear history, the NEA has made 112,000 grants. To date, about 40 that \nwe have been able to find have caused people some problems--about 40 \nout of 112,000. I think that is a pretty good record. Again, the \nSenator did not mention all of the other people who have gotten grants \nfrom NEA.\n  A little while ago I spoke on the phone with Jorie Graham. She is at \nthe Writers Workshop at the University of Iowa. Last year, 1996, she \nwon the Pulitzer Prize for poetry. I had a long talk with her. Here is \nan individual who received an NEA grant, and she told me without that \nshe would not have been able to take the year off and write poetry \nbecause she had a young child. So that grant enabled her to do that.\n\n  I might also point out with some sense of pride that in 1996, last \nyear, the three nominees for the Pulitzer Prize in poetry, Charles \nWright, Donald Justice and Jorie Graham, were all from the Writers \nWorkshop at the University of Iowa. It is interesting to note that it \nwas the student, Jorie Graham, who won the prize. All three were \nrecipients of NEA grants.\n  Why does the Senator from Missouri not talk about that? Why doesn't \nhe go after the Writers Workshop at the University of Iowa?\n  Here, I will be glad to give it to my friend from Missouri. Here is a \nwhole packet of pages, going clear back to 1970, of writers and poets \nwho have received grants, who were at the Writers Workshop. Who will \nthe Senator find in here? People like Robert Penn Warren, he'll find \npeople like Kurt Vonnegut, he'll find people like Tennessee Williams--\nhe may not like Tennessee Williams.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield? The Senator asked me a \nquestion.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will be glad to yield to the Senator in just a second. \nHe'll find people like John Irving, Kurt Vonnegut, Tennessee Williams, \nFlannery O'Connor, Jane Smiley, who just wrote the wonderful book ``A \nThousand Acres'' and won a Pulitzer Prize for it. It is now being made \ninto a movie. Writers Workshop. NEA recipients.\n  No, he didn't mention those.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Now I will be glad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The Senator has asked why I didn't cite all these \nothers. Is it the Senator's position that none of these people would \nhave been writers absent these grants? That absent the ability to have \nthe Federal subsidies we could not have literature like this in the \nUnited States?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will just answer my friend from Missouri. I just had a \nlong conversation on the phone with Jorie Graham, the poet from the \nUniversity of Iowa Writers Workshop, who won the Pulitzer Prize last \nyear. She told me without that NEA grant--she had a little child--she \nwould not have been able to take the year off to develop her talents as \na poet that enabled her to win the Pulitzer Prize. Yes, she absolutely \nstated that to me.\n  Some of these, maybe not. But I can tell you some people like Kurt \nVonnegut and some people, when they first started out--no. They needed \nthese grants to get up to a level.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Did Kurt Vonnegut start out with an NEA grant?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I don't know. He got an NEA grant at one point, I \nbelieve.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I see. It seems to me, will the Senator concede we had \na lot of great poets and a lot of great artists in America between the \ntime of the\n\n[[Page S9472]]\n\nfounding of this culture and the time in the mid-1960's when we started \nNEA grants.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will respond to my friend this way. That is true. We \nhave had a lot of great poets and writers who received no NEA grants. \nHow many more, though, were out there in the little towns of Missouri, \nin the fields of Iowa, around the coal mines of Kentucky and in the \nhills of Kentucky, who wanted to develop their writing skills and their \ntalents but did not have the support to do so? How many were left lying \nfallow in the ground because we wouldn't even come up with the two \npennies, the two pennies per taxpayer per year, to help them to develop \ntheir talent?\n  I think that is the appropriate question to ask, is how many were out \nthere who didn't get the nourishment who, if they had the nourishment, \ncould have been great writers and poets in our society today?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I can name----\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. In response to that question, I can name at least one \nwho didn't have that kind of grant, who was a poor fellow from a small \ntown in Missouri. His name was Samuel Clemens. He wrote under the name \nof Mark Twain. He seemed to do pretty well. In the name of artists \nwhose works are arrayed in this Capitol, George Caleb Bingham, who is \nconsidered to be the American Rembrandt, who was a Missouri State \ntreasurer, who did not have a public subsidy to do it. We could go \nthrough the list. Obviously you could always say there may have been \nlots more. There may have been some who would have been great artists \nin the last 25 years but, because they didn't get the seal of approval, \nweren't able to market as successfully their artwork, now that the arts \ncommunity has been so oriented to the Federal approval or disapproval.\n  It seems to me, how many would be here or how many would be there is \nnot a question that would be very productive in leading us to good \npolicy.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I only responded because the Senator raised the issue. He \nwas saying, questioning me, that was I saying all these great ones all \nreceived NEA grants. I would say no. But I think the question I asked \nwas how many more were out there that could have risen up?\n  He mentioned Samuel Clemens. That was the last century and of course, \nagain, we had great musicians and we had great artists and poets in the \npast. But again, I challenge my friend from Missouri to think about \nthis. The few that we talk about in the past century were so few in \nnumber. I mean, they were absolutely the pinnacle, absolutely the best. \nHow many more who didn't quite make it up there could have been very \ngood? Maybe they wouldn't have been the top echelon, but they might \nhave been very good writers and purveyors of senses of the esthetics of \ndifferent regions of this country that weren't there.\n  Sure, you can point to Samuel Clemens and a few others. But how many \nmore might have come along, might have been great, might have been \nmaybe not at that pinnacle, but maybe up in that level who died \naborning because they had no support whatsoever?\n  I might also, tongue in cheek, ask my friend from Missouri, who has \ngone after some writings that he claims are not quite appropriate for \nreaders to read--you know, old Samuel Clemens wrote some things that \nwere pretty risque. I wonder if the Senator from Missouri has ever read \n``Letters From Heaven''? If the Senator from Missouri has never read \n``Letters From Heaven'' by Samuel Clemens, I ask him to read it and \nbring it on the floor and read it. I doubt he would want to read \n``Letters From Heaven'' on the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will be glad to.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank you for raising the extent to which I have read \nSamuel Clemens' work, Mark Twain. I find him to be an interesting \nauthor, and I think some of his works are better than others and some \nof them are very helpful and some of them moved society in the right \ndirection--I think move us all and inspire us all.\n  The point is not whether or not a writer has the ability to write \nthings that might be appropriate in one setting or not appropriate in \nanother setting. The point is, what do you do by way of subsidy and \nwhether the Government decides to endow any particular writer with a \nspecial stamp of approval and discriminate in favor of that writer and \nthereby discriminate against every other writer? Had Samuel Clemens \nbeen a writer 100 years ago and had there been the current NEA and had \nthe fellow from down the river in St. Louis gotten the grant and Samuel \nClemens been discriminated against and shunned by the arts community \nbecause the other guy had gotten the grant, we might never have known \nabout Samuel Clemens.\n  The point is, when you start with Government identifying and \nestablishing the value for one artist over another, picking \nand choosing between the levels of free expression, free expression in \nthe free society, pushing people toward politically correct expression, \nthere are risks involved there that might result in stifling other \npeople who are not favored by the Government. So, it seems to me there \nare equally--it's equally possible that there are great writers who are \nbeing stifled by the current system--there are art critics who say \nthere are--just as much as there might have been people in previous \nyears who didn't rise to the level of being able to write because they \nlacked the Federal subsidy.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Missouri, he couldn't be further \nfrom the truth. This is the American Literary Anthology in which the \npoem ``Lighght'' appears. No Government agent or employee decided what \nwent into this book. I can't for the life of me figure out what the \nSenator from Missouri is talking about.\n  For example, who decides whether a writer gets published? It is the \neditor of a magazine, the publisher of the magazine. Who decided what \npoems and what fiction, essays, went into this anthology? Editors and \npublishers of magazines. They all got together and went through all of \ntheir different magazines and decided who they thought ought to be in \nhere. It wasn't Government. No Government agent did this. No Government \nemployee did that.\n  Does the Senator think that writers just sort of spring up and, \nbecause they are so good in the beginning, that right away they appear \nin the New Yorker Magazine? Of course not.\n  They appear in these small literary magazines around the country, and \nit is the editors of those magazines and the publishers who decide what \ngets published. They were the ones who decided what went into this \nanthology. There is no Government agency. I don't know of one \nGovernment agent who decided on an NEA grant. It has all been done in a \npeer review process.\n  That would be like saying, I say to my friend from Missouri, that we \nshould cut out research at the National Institutes of Health because it \nis Government money, and why should the Government pick which research \nto do, whether it is cancer or heart, whether it is diabetes or \nAlzheimer's? The present occupant of the chair knows a lot about this. \nShould the Government be picking the researchers because we put the \nmoney into the NIH? We put a lot of money, as the occupant of the chair \nknows, into NIH. We don't tell them what to pick. They do it through \nthe peer review process, through scientists in the field who decide \nwhat is legitimate, good research to do.\n  The same is done in the National Endowment for the Arts. We don't sit \nthere. No one in the Government sits there and says we pick this and we \npick that. They set up boards, commissions, they set up peer review \nentities that decide what is going to be. You can disagree with them, \nand sometimes I have disagreed with them, too, but that is no reason to \nend the National Endowment for the Arts.\n  So I repeat, Mr. President, I had a lengthy conversation yesterday \nwith Mr. George Plimpton and today, again, with Jorie Graham, who, I \nrepeat to my friend from Missouri, won the 1996 Pulitzer Prize for \npoetry. She was emphatic that she and so many of her colleagues would \nnot have been able to develop their talents were it not for the NEA \ngrants they received, and then go on to win the Pulitzer Prize.\n  She said the NEA took a risk, I say to my friend from Missouri. She \nsaid it was a gamble. They didn't know if she\n\n[[Page S9473]]\n\nwas going to be a good writer, poet or not. But she said the cost to \nthe taxpayers for the creative fellowship was 2 cents, two pennies. \nThat is what we are putting into supporting writers and poets around \nthe country--2 cents per taxpayer.\n  Again, if I may use the analogy of the National Institutes of Health, \nwe don't expect that all $13.5 billion that we have put in every year \nat NIH is going to produce a medical miracle. Not at all. A lot of that \nresearch is dead end and nothing ever happens, but we believe in doing \nthe research.\n  So, again, NIH is not right 100 percent of the time, and we shouldn't \nexpect the National Endowment for the Arts to be right 100 percent of \nthe time and that every writer that is picked through this process is \ngoing to be a Pulitzer Prize winner or another Samuel Clemens or \nanother Jorie Graham. No, some of them won't make it, but at least we \nare getting them out.\n  As Jorie Graham told me, she said, ``You know, there is a market out \nthere. The American people aren't stupid. If they read the poetry and \nthey read the literature, like cream on milk, the best will rise to the \ntop.'' But until you put that milk together and put it in the bottle, \nforget it. That is what we are doing through the NEA grants; we are \nbringing these people together and giving them an outlet for their \ncreative abilities. Some will make it, some won't. Some will write a \none-word poem that is calligraphic. It may mean something to somebody. \nIt doesn't particularly to me. Or some people like the poet I just \npointed out will write a 17-page poem, which also didn't mean much to \nme either.\n  But I can tell you that there are some writers in here that have \nmeant a lot to me and a lot to a lot of other people. People like \nRobert Penn Warren, John Ashberry, Jim Harrison, W. S. Merwyn, who, by \nthe way, was also at the Writers Workshop and received the Pulitzer \nPrize in poetry, and James Tate, Joyce Carol Oates. They were in this \nanthology, too. So I guess that is what we are saying. It is not an \nelitist institution. The creative writer fellowships are made to \nwriters with no other means to support themselves. These grants don't \ngo to the wealthy; they don't even go to the middle class.\n\n  Second, I might point out to my friend from Missouri, these grants \nalso are awarded geographically, not just to a few areas. Since these \ngrants are awarded on a geographical basis, the writings that we get \nreflect the regional and aesthetic values of those regions. How else \ncould we get the flavor of what it means to be born and raised in Iowa \non a farm unless perhaps we read something by Jane Smiley, ``A Thousand \nAcres,'' and what it means today about what is happening to the farmers \nin Iowa. Or what would it mean if we didn't have a flavor of what was \nhappening in the West or in the South with writers who can understand, \nwho feel and are sensitive to the aesthetics of that State or that \nregion or that area? That is why NEA grants go out to regions and \ngeographically so it doesn't just go to one certain area of America.\n  The critics many times focus only on those from the cities, but as I \nhave just pointed out, many, many, many rural writers have also \nreceived awards and many have gone on to do great things.\n  So, the Senator from Missouri can get up all he wants. I just wish he \nwould be straight with the facts. First of all, he or his staff should \nhave checked and let us know--let everyone know--that this poem was \nawarded a grant in 1969.\n  Second, I wish the Senator from Missouri had further checked his \nfacts and found out that the book ``Blood of Mugwump'' received no NEA \ngrant. A letter from NEA March 17, 1997, points out that ``Blood of \nMugwump'' did not receive an NEA grant.\n  As I said to my friend from Missouri, all he has to do, if ever he \nhas a doubt about what NEA is doing, is pick up the phone and call \nthem--they are here in Washington--and ask them and they will be glad \nto set you straight on what they are doing.\n  I will wind up by saying, Mr. President, for 2 cents from every \ntaxpayer in America--just 2 pennies--we can go out and lift up some of \nthese young writers and poets all over America, artists who may be like \nJorie Graham and have a young child but they have innate talent, to be \nable to get across to people, as she did with poetry, what it is like \nin small rural towns or small communities of rural Iowa. She said \nwithout those 2 cents and with a small child, she wouldn't have been \nable to do it.\n  The Senator can get up and say he doesn't like ``Lighght''; that is \nfine. There is a lot of poetry I don't like either. As I said, I am not \npartial to this particular poem, although there is a lot of \ncalligraphic poetry I do like.\n  I will say one other thing. I was looking at some information that \ncame out from Mr. Frank Luntz. I don't know Mr. Frank Luntz, but he has \nbeen in the news a lot lately. He wrote a book on how the GOP can use \nlanguage to manipulate people. His book is called ``The Language of the \n21st Century.'' I guess it was presented to the Republican conference \nbefore the August recess. I was looking at some excerpts from Mr. \nLuntz' book. He is saying how people should talk about things. Oh, \nthere is addressing the gender gap. There is health care. How to talk \nabout Clinton. Education. And then he has here, ``Prolog: Luntz's 12 \nstep program to make Republican language more soothing to voters.''\n  Here is a quote from his book:\n\n       Every time Republicans get into a conflict with the \n     President, you begin to shout, mistakenly believing that if \n     you speak loud enough, your message will get through. But the \n     American people aren't deaf. They simply don't understand \n     what you're saying, nor understand its relevance to their \n     day-to-day lives. Linguistically, you're out of touch with \n     the American people.\n\n  So he has 12 principles. I will not read them all, obviously, but I \nwill read the seventh principle of Mr. Frank Luntz, who is writing this \nfor the GOP: ``Abolish the National Endowment for the Arts.'' That is \nwhat he is saying Republicans should say: ``Abolish the National \nEndowment for the Arts.''\n\n  ``This makes sense,'' Mr. Luntz says, ``for strategic reasons as well \nas on principle.'' I will give him that benefit. ``Napoleon spoke of \nthe importance of feeding your army if you expect the soldiers to go \noff to battle. You must deliver some nourishment to the true believers. \nYou need a symbol that both differentiates the two parties and stirs up \nthe troops.''\n  No. 7 in his book of the 12 principles.\n  If you want to stir up the troops, that is fine. Again, I hope they \nwill be clear on the facts and that we understand what this is about. I \ndon't believe it is really valid, and, again, I happen to like the \nSenator from Missouri, he is a good guy and I like him, but I think he \nhas gotten mixed up on his facts. But then, again, we all do \nperiodically around here. But I just wish that he would be a little bit \nmore careful in looking at what the National Endowment for the Arts \nreally does and how it operates in Missouri and Iowa and the Midwest \nand to think about whether or not we would want to throw out all \nfunding for the National Institutes of Health because some of the money \nwe gave them might have gone for bad research or something we didn't \nlike. I don't think so.\n  We may not like all the things the NEA does, but on the whole, out of \n112,000 grants in its history, this Senator only knows of 40 that has \nbeen raised as issues on the floor of the Senate or the House in the 22 \nyears I have been privileged to serve here.\n  So, again, Mr. President, the National Endowment for the Arts is much \ntoo important to us as a nation, much too important for America, for \nour diversity, for understanding who we are and where we have come from \nand perhaps even where we are going to have maybe one example of one \npoem disliked by one or two or three Senators be the cause of not \nfunding the entire National Endowment for the Arts. It has done an \noutstanding job. We should make sure we continue to fund it, not so \nthat Government can pick winners and losers and all that, but to make \nsure that those who are out there in the field, those budding writers \nand poets will at least have some hope that they, too, can become the \nnext Jorie Graham at the Writers Workshop in Iowa and win a Nobel Prize \nfor her or his poetry. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wish to speak for a few minutes also \nin support of the National Endowment for the Arts and a strong Federal \nrole in\n\n[[Page S9474]]\n\nsupporting the arts. I am honored to follow the eloquent Senator from \nIowa. I think he has made a very strong case for continued Federal \nsupport in this area. I also believe the Senator from Utah, Senator \nBennett, made a very eloquent statement in support of the NEA and \ndemonstrated great common sense in much of what he said there.\n  Over the past few days, several of my colleagues have attacked the \nNEA, and one of the attacks has been that NEA funds are concentrated \ntoo much in big cities--six big cities in particular. I want to make it \nclear at the beginning of my comments that none of those big cities are \nin New Mexico, but still the NEA does support a very wide spectrum of \narts in my State of New Mexico.\n  NEA funds come to my State and support everything from opera to \ncowboy poets. In my hometown of Silver City where I grew up, we have an \nannual event where cowboy poets come from all over the country to \nparticipate. It is my understanding--and I can be corrected on this--\nbut it is my understanding that the first cowboy poetry convention or \nconference that occurred in this country was in Elko, NV, and was \nsponsored by the NEA. And they have continued with that tradition in \nElko, NV, ever since.\n\n  So clearly the funds go to a broad range of arts. There have been \nmore than 20 national competitive grants in my State in 1996.\n  NEA National Heritage awards have gone to individuals in my State. \nNEA has supported the arts in education strongly in my State.\n  This year, the NEA provided the New Mexico State arts agency with a \n$380,000 block grant. So some of the Federal funds that come from the \nNEA do come in block grant form so that the State can make the \njudgment. Those funds are matched on a 2-to-1 basis with State funding. \nThey enable our State agency to make 125 awards, both small awards and \nlarge awards.\n  NEA's goal is to support the arts that enrich the lives of everyone \nin our country. I have seen that in my own State of New Mexico over the \n14, 15 years that I have served here in the Senate, Mr. President. I \nhave seen arts councils established and grow in virtually every \ncommunity in New Mexico.\n  There was a time in my State when the arts were essentially Santa Fe \nand Taos. If you started talking about the arts, whether they were \npaintings or chamber music or the opera or any of a variety of arts, \nyou talked about Santa Fe and Taos. But that is no longer true in my \nhome State of New Mexico.\n  At the present time in New Mexico there is an arts council in \nvirtually every community, every community of any size in the State. \nAnd those arts councils are bringing into those communities artists who \ncontribute a tremendous amount to the lives of the people who live \nthere. I am very proud of the rich tradition of arts that we have in my \nState and in the Southwest in general.\n  New Mexico has a wealth of artists and musicians, museums and arts \ncenters. NEA support over the last several years has strengthened the \narts and strengthened arts education in New Mexico in very important \nways. It has benefited the children in my State.\n  Research has shown that art and music education is extremely \nimportant to the development, the proper development of a child. \nHealthy brain development in very young children is aided by arts \neducation and by exposure to art and to music. Problem-solving skills \nare enhanced. There is improvement even on math tests as a result of \nexposure to music. That has been demonstrated in various tests in \nrecent years.\n  I recently attended a program in Albuquerque which was inspirational. \nIt was called ``Starts with the Arts.'' It was a conference for \nchildren with exceptional needs at the Very Special Arts Center in \nAlbuquerque. Clearly, this is making a great contribution to the lives \nof those children.\n  In 1997, $90,000 from the National Endowment for the Arts came \nthrough our State arts agency to assist with that type of program.\n  This has benefited not only children, young children, but it benefits \nstudents, programs like the Working Classroom in Albuquerque. This is a \nfree year-round art and theater instruction program in the Broadway \nsection of Albuquerque in southeast Albuquerque.\n  Disadvantaged, at-risk children starting in their early teenage years \nparticipate in this. There is reduced dropout rates as a result of this \nwork. There is substantial beautification of some areas of downtown \nAlbuquerque through the painting of murals. That program has been \nsupported by NEA funding as well.\n  In 1997, they received $15,000 from the NEA through a State block \ngrant. So the decision was made by the State to put that money into the \nWorking Classroom Program, but it was funding that came through the \nNational Endowment for the Arts.\n  There have been benefits to many of the communities in our State, as \nI indicated, that not only benefits to the cultural lives of those \ncommunities but also to tourism, to economic development, to job \ncreation.\n  Mr. President, I do not have exact figures to provide to the Senate \ntoday, but I can tell you that the arts are a substantial part of the \nreason why tourists come to my State. Whatever we do to strengthen the \narts also strengthens our economy and helps to strengthen the economy \nof all those communities. It benefits a wide audience.\n\n  We benefit a wide audience by giving recognition to local artists, \nartists such as Ramon Jose Lopez, who is a santero and is a master \nmetalsmith. He won an NEA National Heritage Fellowship last year. He \nwas involved with the Smithsonian Institution in an exhibit that \nattracted national attention. And this type of recognition enriches the \nlives of many of our artists and of visitors that come to our State.\n  I fought very hard in the last Congress to maintain the program of \nheritage grants to outstanding individuals. But despite all these \nbenefits that I have gone through here we have Members of Congress, \nMembers of the Senate, who continue to campaign to eliminate the \nNational Endowment for the Arts. I believe we need to resist that. We \nneed to also resist turning this into a block grant program.\n  On July 23 of this year the Labor Committee marked up and passed the \nNEA's reauthorization. Even though the measure has not come to the \nSenate floor, people here in the Senate need to know the outcome of the \ncommittee's deliberations.\n  Like most of us in the committee, I concluded that the NEA now \nstrikes the right balance, the right balance between national \ninvolvement, State and local involvement.\n  NEA has been criticized as inefficient. But under the leadership of \nits present chairman, the NEA has established numerous accountability \nand streamlining measures that ensure responsible use of Federal \nfunds--consolidating administrative operations of the NEA and the NEH, \nthe National Endowment for the Humanities; reducing administrative \ncosts of both.\n  There are peer review panels that are chosen from all sections of the \ncountry under this language that we adopted in this reauthorization \nbill. We ensured that all sections of the country would be represented. \nWe ensured also that on the peer review panels that no State would be \nunduly represented.\n  Some groups continue to spread what I believe are misrepresentations \nabout NEA support for obscene art projects. Most of those stories turn \nout to be half-stories. Many of those stories involve subgranting of \nNEA dollars for objectionable projects. It is my understanding that the \nchairman, the present chairman of the NEA, has eliminated the practice \nof subgranting NEA awards except to State arts councils.\n  I am convinced that the arts and arts education contribute enormously \nto the cultural life of our country. I strongly believe we should \nmaintain it.\n  I had the good fortune, Mr. President, last night to attend a \nreception and dinner at the Library of Congress and to see there the \nprogram that they have developed and put on the Internet for anyone in \nthis country to dial up who wants to dial up Thomas--``www.Thomas.org'' \nI believe is how. But you can get into Thomas. And when you do, you can \nget access to all of the photographs that were taken in this country \nduring the 1930's under the Federal Writers Project which was part of \nthe Works Progress Administration, the WPA, at that time. That was \nmoney well spent.\n\n[[Page S9475]]\n\n  We are not here through the NEA having the Government choose who to \nsupport and who not to support. That is done by peer review panels. But \nI think it is anomalous to suggest that the Federal Government has no \ninterest in this issue or to suggest that Federal Government should not \nbe able to lend its support to a richer cultural life for this country.\n  So I very much hope that we will resist all efforts to eliminate the \nNEA and to drastically change its structure.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \nAshcroft amendment. This amendment would eliminate the National \nEndowment for the Arts [NEA], an organization which has come under \nunfair attack in the past few years.\n  Funding for the NEA has consistently dropped. Funding last year was \n$99.5 million, a 39-percent decrease in 2 years. Now, many of my \ncolleagues want to abolish the endowment completely. I disagree with \nthis approach.\n  For every Federal dollar invested in the arts, our citizens receive \nan enormous return. My state of Maryland received $1.4 million in arts \nfunding last year. This means that the Baltimore Childrens Theater \nAssociation is able to thrive. It means that the Baltimore Museum of \nArt can bring world renown exhibits to the citizens of my State. And it \nmeans that local communities throughout Maryland have access to \ncommunity festivals, arts centers, and galleries.\n  There is a myth that the arts are for the elite. However, I believe \nthe arts are about three things: Jobs, economic development, and \nfamilies. The arts attract jobs. The arts help create economic \ndevelopment in communities. The arts are family first.\n  The cost of Federal funding for the arts is 35 cents for every \ncitizen. The arts are a sound investment. The rewards are great.\n  Federal funding for the NEA has led to the flourishing of arts \norganizations in small cities and rural areas across the country. In my \nState of Maryland, local arts agencies are able to leverage Federal \ndollars for their fundraising efforts.\n  Without Federal support, Marylanders wouldn't have the Puppet Co. in \nGlen Echo, the Bluebird Blues Festival at Prince George's Community \nCollege, the Writers Center in Bethesda, or the University of Maryland \nmusic programs.\n  I am committed to protecting the Federal role in the arts. We should \nnot become the only civilized country in the world that does not \nsupport the arts.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the Ashcroft amendment.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, for years during consideration of the \nInterior appropriations bill, the Senate has debated the fate of the \nNational Endowment for the Arts. Those debates have had mixed results. \nOn one hand, NEA funding has been severely reduced. On the other hand, \nthe NEA has made changes in its policies and operation to safeguard \nagainst providing Federal dollars to distasteful and, yes, perhaps, \ninappropriate projects. So, some bad and some good has come from our \ndiscussions here.\n  Now, we are in the midst of another such debate. The House voted to \neliminate funding for the NEA. It even rejected a proposal to provide \n$10 million in close down costs. There are Senators who support the \nHouse and have offered amendments to eliminate funding for the NEA \naltogether. Others would eliminate the Endowment by providing all of \nthe appropriated dollars directly to the States in the form of block \ngrants based on State populations. Still others would allow the \nEndowment to continue but would vastly diminish its role by sending the \nlion's share of funding to the States as block grants.\n  Earlier this summer, I introduced legislation with Senators Jeffords \nand Kennedy to reauthorize both the National Endowment for the Arts and \nthe National Endowment for the Humanities for 5 years. The Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee marked up the bill and reported it from the \ncommittee on a bipartisan basis. According to our bill, 40 percent of \nfunds would go to State arts agencies, 40 percent would be used by the \nEndowment to support projects of national significance, 10 percent \nwould be for direct grants, and the remaining 10 percent would go to \narts education in underserved communities. All funds appropriated \nbeyond the current level of $99 million also would go to arts \neducation.\n  My colleagues might wonder: Why this emphasis on arts education? All \nacross the Nation, arts education is being integrated into the core \ncurriculum of schools. This integration is the result of the \nrealization that an arts education can help students to develop better \nskills in analysis, problem solving, and just plain thinking. This is \nin addition to nurturing and developing the child's imagination and \ncreativity.\n  A study by the College Entrance Examination Board found that students \nwho have studied the arts regularly outperform students who do not have \nan arts background on SAT exams. According to the study, students who \nhave studied the arts for 4 years score 53 points higher on the verbal \nSAT exam and 35 points higher in math than do students who lack arts \neducation.\n  Senator Gorton recognizes the importance of continuing to fund the \nNational Endowment for the Arts. The bill he has brought before us even \nprovides a small increase to the NEA, from $99 to $100 million. The NEA \ncosts each American less than 38 cents per year. My colleagues might be \ninterested to know that a recent Lou Harris poll showed overwhelming \nsupport among the American people for arts funding, even if it meant a \ntax increase. For this minute investment of 38 cents per year, the \nAmerican people get orchestras, chamber music ensembles, children's \nfestivals, operas, poetry readings, concerts in the parks, music \nfestivals, Shakespeare festivals, artists visiting schools, museum and \ngallery exhibits, dance troupes, and much more. For this tiny \ninvestment, local communities in rural areas far from our Nation's \ncultural centers are able to experience our rich artistic traditions.\n  According to BusinessWeek magazine, the arts support 1.3 million \njobs. The arts contribute $36.8 billion annually to our economy, and 6 \npercent of the GNP is attributable to nonprofit arts activities.\n  In Rhode Island, we count our artists among our State's natural \nresources, among the resources that are contributing to a wonderful \nrevitalization, particularly evident in Providence. We are very \nfortunate to be home to one of the most prestigious art schools in the \nNation, Rhode Island School of Design. RISD draws young artists to \nRhode Island from around the globe. Perhaps because of our State's \nmarvelous quality of life or perhaps because of the efforts of \ncommunity leaders and State officials to develop an atmosphere in which \nthe arts can flourish, many of these fine art students stay and \ncontribute to our community and to our economy.\n  Let me share a few excerpts from a letter I received earlier this \nsummer from Roger Mandle, President of RISD. Mr Mandle writes:\n\n       Federal support for the arts and humanities is more than a \n     symbolic matter, and helps to leverage strong state and local \n     private sector support for operas, dance companies, \n     symphonies and museums. Students of schools and colleges gain \n     access, some for the first time, as performers or audiences \n     for these cultural activities. Cities and towns benefit from \n     the tourism generated by the institutions and events they \n     sponsor. Federal inspiration to maintain and support \n     America's cultural heritage comes at a small price to every \n     citizen. The existence of these Endowments helps to compare \n     ourselves favorably to other nations whose governmental \n     support for the arts exceeds that of the United States by \n     many times.\n\n  Some critics of the NEA suggest that supporting the arts should be \nleft up to the private sector. They contend that there is no purpose \nfor Federal support and that the arts would do just fine without it. \nMr. President, you may be interested to know that since the creation of \nthe NEA 30 years ago, the number of nonprofit theaters has grown from \n56 to more than 400; the number of orchestras has quadrupled to more \nthan 200; the number of opera companies has grown from 27 to more than \n100; the number of dance companies has increased from 30 to about 250; \nand today there are more than 3,000 public arts agencies in small \ncities and towns throughout the United States. There is no doubt in my \nmind that the NEA, whose budget is seven-tenths of 1 percent of federal \nspending, has had a\n\n[[Page S9476]]\n\nsizable contribution in making the arts accessible to all Americans, \nrather than to an elite few.\n  I was curious about the idea of providing block grants to the States. \nSurely, that would mean more money to the State arts agencies, and they \nwould be all for it. But, of course, that is not the case at all. I \nasked Randall Rosenbaum, executive director of the Rhode Island State \nCouncil on the Arts, what he thought of either providing the entire \nappropriated amount for the NEA directly to the States in the form of \nblock grants, or increasing the size of the State block grants by \nscaling back NEA grants to projects of national significance. Here is \nwhat Mr. Rosenbaum had to say:\n\n       While the Rhode Island State Council on the Arts might, on \n     appearance, benefit from such a move (we would not), the \n     Nation as a whole would suffer immeasurably. The Federal \n     Government's leadership in arts funding has been critical to \n     State and local efforts to raise matching dollars from public \n     and private sources to support the arts. Stacks of research \n     support this point . . .\n       More to the point, if the money is just block granted to \n     the States, we will lose one of the most precious things the \n     NEA has to offer, leadership in development of public policy \n     in support of the arts. A strong federal presence through the \n     arts endowment has changed the nature of an arts field I have \n     worked in since 1976. Through its consensus building, policy \n     making, and yes, financial support, I have seen more emphasis \n     on access for all Americans to the arts. NEA-supported \n     projects in Rhode Island ensure that everyone, from toddlers \n     to seniors, experiences the arts on a personal level.\n\n  The NEA supports the Rhode Island Philharmonic Orchestra, and I have \nheard from many of its musicians writing in strong support of continued \nfunding. It provides funds to the Trinity Repertoire Co., to RISD and \nto Brown University. But it also provides funds to smaller, less well \nknown theater and dance companies, such as ``Lydia Perez and Ensemble'' \nwhom I was privileged to hear at a gathering in Providence in July. Ms. \nPerez specializes in bomba'' music. Grants have gone to the All \nChildren's Theater Ensemble in Providence, to the Blackstone Valley \nTourism Council, to the Capeverdean American Community Development \nCenter in Pawtucket, to the Children's Museum of Rhode Island, to the \nFestival Ballet of Rhode Island, to the Island Arts Center in Newport, \nto the Ocean State Light Opera, and to literally dozens of other \ncommunity arts groups.\n  Mr. President, I wholeheartedly support Senator Gorton's efforts to \ncontinue to fund the National Endowment for the Arts and the National \nEndowment for the Humanities, and I support Senator Jeffords as he \nworks to reauthorize both Endowments for 5 years. I urge my colleagues \nto reject efforts to eliminate the Endowments, either by cutting \nfunding or by creating block grants to the States.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the Senate today is considering the \nAshcroft amendment to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts. I \noppose the amendment. There are also several amendments that seek to \nrestrict, censor, or block grant the NEA.\n  Mr. President, in my view, the arts play an enormously important role \nin shaping our national culture and our local communities. The question \nis what is the best way for the Federal Government to fund the arts, if \nat all.\n\n\n                            nea is a success\n\n  Since the NEA's creation in 1966, there has been an explosion of \ncommunity arts in local communities throughout the country. There are 8 \ntimes more nonprofit theaters, 7 times more dance companies, and 4 \ntimes more orchestras and opera companies. The impact of the National \nEndowment is far reaching. Through sponsorship of the arts, the NEA can \nstimulate expressions of our national character in many localities and \nguide our young people and pump hundreds of millions of dollars into \nlocal economies. Mr. President, if it were not for the strong \nleadership of the NEA, many rural areas and impoverished communities \nwould be denied the opportunity to experience artistic presentations, \nperformances, and education.\n\n\n                           academic benefits\n\n  Exposure to the arts has academic benefits. According to College \nEntrance Examination Board, students with more than four years of \ncourse work in the arts score 59 points higher on the verbal and 44 \npoints higher on the math portions of the SAT. Children with a \nbackground in piano have also scored better in math.\n\n\n                           economic benefits\n\n  The National Endowment for the Arts contributes to our national \neconomy. For every $1 spent by the NEA, $34 are returned to the U.S. \nTreasury. Because of the Endowment's support of the arts, the arts \nindustry has boomed. Every $1 spent by the NEA attracts $12 to the arts \nfrom other sources. The nonprofit are industry now generates $37 \nbillion annually in economic activity. The nonprofit arts industry also \nemploys nearly 1.3 million Americans and represents nearly one percent \nof the entire U.S. work force.\n\n\n                              block grants\n\n  Some of my colleagues believe that all of the NEA's funds should go \nto the states in the form of block grants. Under current law, states \nhave direct control over 35% of NEA funds in the form of block grants \nand state arts agencies believe this is the appropriate federal-state \nbalance.\n\n\n                       losses under block grants\n\n  If further block granting is successful, states will lose hundreds of \nnational grants that benefit all Americans. For example, according to \nthe NEA, under block granting shows on public television like Great \nPerformances, Dance in America, American Playhouse, and American \nMasters will be lost. 98% of American homes have access to public \ntelevision--a great example of one grant having a huge national impact. \nPrograms of this large scale are best run, are most efficiently run, on \na national level. Most states cannot take on a project of this \nmagnitude. Another national program that the NEA says will be \neliminated under block granting is the Mayor's Institute on City \nDesign, in which over 300 of the nation's mayors have had the \nopportunity to meet with planners and architects to discuss urban \ndesign issues. This single grant benefited over 300 American \ncommunities.\n\n\n                          privatization of nea\n\n  Other members of this body would like to privatize the National \nEndowment for the Arts. I believe this would be a grave mistake. \nAccording to Independent Sector's 1996 Giving and Volunteering survey, \nhouseholds giving to the arts, culture, and humanities has decreased by \n29 percent since 1987. ``Giving USA'' found that total donations to the \narts and humanities declined by $270 million between 1992 and 1995 and \nprivate donations to the arts and humanities decreased by 7.7 percent \nin 1992 and to 6.9 in 1995. These statistics do not bode well for arts \nwithout the support of a federal endowment.\n\n\n                        controversial nea grants\n\n  I have heard some Senators criticize the questionable content of past \nNEA grants. I agree there have been mistakes. Yet, throughout the NEA's \n30-year history, ``objectionable'' grants have amounted to only 45 out \nof more than 112,000 grants. This figure translates to approximately \nfour-one-hundredths of 1 percent of all grants. Few other federal \nagencies can claim the same small proportion of error or high rate of \nsuccess.\n\n\n                              new reforms\n\n  NEA grantees must now adhere to strict guidelines to ensure quality \ncontent: all grants to individual artists have been eliminated, all \ngrants to organizations must be for grants specifically described in \nthe application, all grantees must file interim and final project \nreports, and all grantees must seek written permission in advance to \nchange grant activities proposed in the organizational application.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I remind my colleagues that most great \ncivilizations are remembered primarily for their arts. Already, the \nUnited States spends nearly fifty times less on the arts than any of \nits major allies. The National Endowment for the Arts represents a \nnational commitment to our nation's culture, history, and people. If \nthe NEA were to be privatized, block granted, or eliminated, not only \nwould we suffer a great economic loss, but more importantly Americans, \nparticularly those living in rural and low-income areas, would suffer a \ngreat loss. The NEA benefits our young people, our communities, and our \neconomy. We cannot deny our citizens this national treasure.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise before you today to express my \nsupport\n\n[[Page S9477]]\n\nfor the NEA and to articulate the importance of preserving the arts in \nAmerica. I would like to take this opportunity to briefly describe to \nmy colleagues how the NEA, in it's unique capacity, has strengthened \nthe values and cultural education of the people in my state. \nSpecifically, it has played a critical role in enhancing the local \ntalent and in funding community education activities for all Louisiana \nfamilies and children. Mr. President, not only has the NEA provided \naccess to the arts for the less advantaged in all of the 64 parishes, \nreaching a total audience of 7.5 million Louisianians by funding \nprograms like philharmonics, ballets and training for young talented \ninner-city artists, but NEA has also played a vital role in supporting \ncultural tourism. The NEA-funded arts programs have remained a \nconsistent source of economic revenue for Louisiana with our rich \nmusical and cultural history. We have a brilliant history of talented \nlocal artists and renowned musicians that people from all over the \nworld come to Louisiana to experience. Mr. President, as a nation that \nvalues the promotion of individual creative talent and these \ncontributions to our cultural fabric, I encourage and respectfully ask \nmy colleagues not to abandon our national responsibility and to support \nan equitable balance of grant distribution to the NEA. We have all seen \nthe NEA adhere to the valid concerns of my colleagues, Senator Helms \nand Senator Sessions. I give Jane Alexander her due credit for putting \nin place a new organizational structure--including the elimination of \nall sub-grants and grants to individual artists. Yes, there are clear \nexamples in the past where the NEA should have used better judgment, \nbut I ask my colleagues to concur that this is by no means grounds to \ndeny our children the right to access the arts--and not just on the \nstate level in the form of block grants--but with a national \ncommitment. Mr. President, I do not want to debate the past nor do I \nthink I can define what is art and what is not art. However, there are \nclear examples across the nation where NEA funding has supported the \nvery talented and worthy people we all represent. I support my \ncolleagues' efforts to continue to fund the NEA and to establish a \npermanent endowment fund that, matched with private funds, would \ncontinue the successful private/public partnerships the NEA has \ncreated. I look forward to the opportunity to work with my colleagues \nto find an agreeable funding formula that will show the American people \nthat this Congress values and supports American culture, our creative \ntalent and the arts.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains if there is time \nallocated on my side on this issue?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). All the time in opposition to \nthe amendment has expired.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I yield myself so much time as I might \nconsume.\n  I do want to be responsive to some of the comments that were made by \nthose in opposition to this amendment.\n  They have suggested over and over again that difficulties are \nisolated, that they are misrepresented. And I want to bring some sense \nof authentication to the kinds of things in which I have been involved.\n  In talking about the poem ``Lighght,'' if that is what this poem is, \nthe one-word poem, there was a question about the documentation for the \npayment of $1,500 for the poem. The documentation we have is from \nPolicy Analysis, August 8, 1990, No. 137, ``Subsidies to the Arts: \nCultivating Mediocrity,'' by Bill Kauffman. And I quote:\n\n       The NEA has been more patronizing than patron to the towns \n     and villages of Middle America.\n\n  So that is interesting to me, and especially in light of the remarks \nof the Senator from Iowa as if the NEA has been a savior to middle \nAmerica.\n  An example: In 1969, NEA grantee George Plimpton, editor of the \nAmerican Literary Anthology/2, confounded observers by paying $1,500 \nfor a poem by Aram Saroyan consisting of a single misspelled word, \n``lighght.''\n  That is interesting. We have been through this particular poem. This \nis the entirety of the poem for which taxpayers paid. I suppose you can \nsay it is a better poem if you put it on a bigger piece of paper so \nthat you have a sense of the calligraphy involved. I will be willing to \nconcede that, although I think the Senator from Iowa says it did not \nmean much to him anyhow.\n  But it is kind of an interesting thing, when an assistant to an Iowa \nCongressman asked this grantee about the meaning of the poem, here is \nwhat the person to whom we gave the Federal funds for the distribution \namong other authors in the assemblage of this work said. The editor \nreplied, ``You are from the Midwest. You are culturally deprived, so \nyou would not understand it anyway.''\n  When the representative of the agency that is doling out grants \ntreats American people who ask that kind of question, about whether or \nnot this is an effective expenditure of tax dollars, that way, I do not \nthink that is really such an enriching experience for our culture so \nthat we need to continue that kind of subsidy.\n  There has been a persistent stream of suggestions additionally from \nthose in opposition to this amendment that there is no problem in the \nway the grants are awarded, and that as a matter of fact these are done \nby independent groups and they do not have any particular slant. That \nis simply not the way the world looks at it when the world reviews \nthese things.\n  From an article by Jan Breslauer, in a special to the Washington \nPost--and certainly the Washington Post is not some sort of \nconservative journal. Jan Breslauer is from Los Angeles and I believe \nis normally a critic for the Los Angeles Times in their arts \ndepartment. She puts it this way, that the NEA has had a bad impact on \nart. It has--according to her--``. . . quietly pursued policies rooted \nin identity politics--a kind of separatism that emphasizes racial, \nsexual and cultural differences above all else.''\n  So in choosing people to assemble anthologies or in choosing \npublishers to favor or in choosing artists to favor, here is an \nindependent individual who writes for the Los Angeles Times, writing in \nthe Washington Post, and here is what she says about it on March 16, \n1997.\n  Perhaps this poem that I used as an example is a poem from years gone \nby. It happens to be a lot cleaner than any of the other examples which \nare objectionable now. There are a lot of materials that I simply could \nnot bring to the floor in good conscience. I held one up a moment ago \nthat showed what we had to mark out in order to bring it to the floor.\n  But she puts it this way, that what has happened here is that the NEA \n``. . . has quietly pursued policies rooted in identity politics--a \nkind of separatism that emphasizes racial, sexual and cultural \ndifference above all else.''\n  I would expect that to be something that hurts the culture. When the \nGovernment spends $100 million to favor people who will emphasize \nracial, sexual and cultural differences, that is bad for America. My \ncolleague and friend from Iowa can hold up 2 pennies and say this is \nwhat it costs. Well, he can show me the line on the appropriations, if \nhe chooses, that says it costs 2 cents, but the truth of the matter is \nwe are debating $100 million in expenditures here, $100 million in \nexpenditure that, according to this independent observer, says it \nemphasizes our racial divisions. We don't need anyone to emphasize the \ndivisions in this country racially, our divisions sexually, or our \ncultural differences.\n\n  America needs to get beyond our differences. We need to be one nation \nunited. We don't need to be a place where we emphasize these \ndifferences.\n  She says, ``The art world's version of affirmative action, these \npolicies haven't excited much controversy, but they have had a \nprofoundly corrosive effect on the American arts.'' Now, here is the \nreal trigger. She states a condition which would make this very serious \nand adverse to our culture, and then she says, the truth of the matter \nis this hurts the arts. Then she goes on to say how it hurts the arts, \n``pigeonholing artists and pressuring them to produce work that \nsatisfies a politically correct agenda rather than their best creative \ninstincts.''\n  You have a situation where an independent observer says, all of what \nthe\n\n[[Page S9478]]\n\nNEA says aside, she says they emphasize things that divide us in race, \nculture, and sexual matters, and that they pigeonhole artists by \ngetting them to know, if you want a grant from whomever it is that the \nNEA allows to make these designations, you have to satisfy a \npolitically correct agenda.\n  It is interesting to note that there are those who are eager to \nsatisfy a politically correct agenda, and in a list of projects that \nwas favored with funds just this year, $60,000 was given to the \nAmerican Conservatory Theatre Foundation in San Francisco in order to \nput on a play by Tony Kushner. Here is what Tony Kushner said about \nart: Art should be used to ``punish Republicans.'' I suppose you can \nsay that the funding of his plays is not a problem. You might say that \nmore eagerly if you sat on the other side of the aisle than if you sat \nhere, but frankly, I don't think anybody on any side of the aisle \nshould want a Government subsidy that goes to people who say one of the \npurposes of art--and especially a subsidy for their art--is to punish \nany political party.\n  I would be ashamed if I were hearing arguments in favor of a subsidy \nfor some sort of literature which was designed to punish Democrats. I \ndisagree with Democrats, but I don't think they are to be punished \nbecause they don't agree with me. I don't think we need a subsidy for \nartists or authors or poets who would punish them or otherwise speak \nagainst them.\n  I think that is what Jan Breslauer was talking about when she said we \nare driving artists into a politically correct agenda. If you want to \nget the grant, you have to say things like the playwright whose plays \nare being subsidized in San Francisco, that art should be used to \n``punish Republicans.''\n  Incidentally, there is a list of things here of similar sorts of \ngrants, the kinds of things that I don't think any of us would really \nwant to support.\n  I should mention that Jan Breslauer, in her special to the Washington \nPost, of the Los Angeles Times, is not the only art critic who says we \nhave been wasting money on politically correct art. William Craig Rice, \nfrom Harvard University, put it this way: ``The marketplace, with its \npotential for democratic engagement and dissemination, is hardly the \nenemy of the arts. The burgeoning American theater of the 19th century \nowed nothing to Washington. In fact, any system of selective, expert-\ndictated Federal support for the arts would have been anathema to the \nrollicking impresarios of that era.''\n  Here you have a poet who says, ``Wait a minute, we had great art. We \nhad great poetry. We had great drama. And we had a system of selecting \nand supporting on a selective basis art during that era. It would have \nbeen an anathema, an enemy, a corrosive impact on those who were \ninvolved in the art community; creative people expressing, and \naudiences receiving, without the independence or the confidence to pit \ntheir taste against those critics, performers, and artists.''\n  The point I am making, is the U.S. Government has no business \nspending $100 million--you can talk about it being 2 cents if you want; \nI guess you can talk about it being 2 cents. The truth is $100 million \nis $100 million. To me that is significant. Most people in my State \nrealize $100 million is significant.\n  More important is the fact that Government should not be favoring one \nkind of speech or one kind of expression over another kind of speech or \nanother kind of expression. We should not be highlighting someone's \nidea of what is good or what is bad.\n  I move to another individual, Hilton Kramer. This was published in \nthe Indianapolis Star, in 1993. Kramer believes that the NEA has \n``gutted the initiative of private patronage.'' He says that private \ndonors lack the confidence of their own taste. Now they ``wait to \npiggyback on NEA certification before they commit.'' So they wait to \nsee who the Government says ought to be favored and who the Government \nsays shouldn't be favored, and then the private donors pile on. I think \nthat is inverted. We have distorted the marketplace by putting \nGovernment funding into the marketplace.\n  Now, back again, to the first question of the Senator from Iowa about \nthe one-word poem. He says we only paid $107 a letter for this poem. I \nsay we paid $214 a letter for this poem based on the article in the \nPolicy Analysis, but let's just reduce the price. I will give it to you \ncheap, Mr. President, $107 a letter for this poem. Yes, it was 30 years \nago, but have the abuses been corrected? Absolutely not.\n  I talked about a book, ``Blood of Mugwump.'' He says it was disavowed \nby the National Endowment for the Arts. Here is what the National \nEndowment for the Arts says in its letter to the publisher, massively \nsubsidized in publishing this book: ``The progress report which you \nfiled with this agency erroneously included `Blood of Mugwump' as among \nthose volumes partially supported by a grant from the National \nEndowment for the Arts; this is not the case.'' I want to know who \nknows what book was supported when they got the grant. Would the \npublisher know? If you were the businessman running the printing press, \nwould you know how you spent the money? Apparently the people who \npublish the book thought they spent the money that came from the \nGovernment on the ``Blood of Mugwump'' book.\n  That is why on the book itself they put the seal of the National \nEndowment for the Arts. That is what the publisher thinks the money \nwent for. It may be that the National Endowment for the Arts decided \nthey didn't want to claim credit for the book when they saw what they \nhad gotten, although I am puzzled by that, too, because of a letter I \nhave seen from Jane Alexander, the Chairman for the National Endowment \nfor the Arts, to the U.S. House of Representatives some 2 months after \ndisavowing this book. In March they say we don't want to claim credit \nfor ``Blood of Mugwump,'' and we think you have mistakenly or illegally \nor inappropriately--in a letter from the general counsel--we think you \nhave mistakenly, illegally, or inappropriately included the fact that \nyou spent the money.\n  It looks to me like the author or publisher knew where they spent the \nmoney. What do they say about a publisher who does this later on? Here \nis what Ms. Alexander says about that publisher. She says, ``The \n[American Family Association] also criticized the agency for supporting \nFiction Collective 2 (FC-2), a small publisher at the University of \nIllinois, which has introduced some of our newest minority writers of \nquality to the American public. Over the years, FC-2 has sustained a \ncommitment to intellectual challenge, and some of America's greatest \nwriters have supported it.''\n  She goes on to endorse the publisher. We provide the funding for \nwhich the publisher says part of what we got for it was ``Blood of \nMugwump.'' Here is a letter saying you better not say we helped publish \n``Blood of Mugwump,'' and then they endorse the publisher and say what \na fine group they are.\n  You don't have to read too far between the lines to find out what is \ngoing on.\n  Incidentally, the ``Blood of Mugwump'' volume is one which is frankly \nso repugnant to the values of America--it talks about a clan of \nCatholic, gender-shifting vampires who get infections, viruses, by \nreading prayer books. The virus comes in through the eyes. I really \ncannot imagine this is the kind of thing we want to suggest to the \nAmerican people, that the way you get the kind of fatal diseases or the \nway you really get involved in things that are counterproductive is to \nsomehow be involved with religious artifacts or read a prayer book that \nwill get you infected so you start eating your own flesh or the flesh \nof others.\n  I had my staff look at the book and just Xerox a couple pages. I told \nthem I didn't want anything that would offend the conscience of the \nAmerican people if I showed it on television, to mark out that which \nshould not be shown on Senate TV, and that is what came from the book. \nIt carries the so-called Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval of the \nNational Endowment for the Arts.\n  It is kind of interesting, though. Here is another set of individuals \nwho have been careful about their statements, and I think they are \nappropriate. There have been a lot of suggestions here that this is \nimportant or we will not have anybody who is not well to do who can \nappreciate art or participate in art. I think that is nonsense.\n  They talked about Robert Penn Warren having been included in the \nanthology of poetry. The truth of the matter\n\n[[Page S9479]]\n\nis Robert Penn Warren wrote his famous ``All the King's Men'' in 1945, \n20 years before the National Endowment for the Arts came into \nexistence. He was a nationally known, world-renowned author.\n  The truth of the matter is we have had great individuals who have not \nreceived NEA grants. The suggestion that because a few people have \nsucceeded or a number of people have succeeded after they have received \na Federal subsidy and that they somehow could not have succeeded \nwithout a Federal subsidy, I can't really follow that logic.\n  America has been full of good people who have written well and have \nproduced well artistically. I don't think there has been any suggestion \nthey have all been born to rich parents or even predominantly born to \nwealth. I don't think the ability to express one's self correlates to \nwhether or not you have wealthy parents. It certainly doesn't correlate \nto whether or not you have been favored with a Federal grant.\n  One thing that does correlate is the fact that most Federal grants, \nor a large portion of them, go to support institutions that the wealthy \npatronize far more than the poor do.\n  I am quoting again from Policy Analysis in an article by Mr. \nKauffman, No. 137, ``Take art museums, a favorite NEA beneficiary. \nEighty-four percent of art museum visitors have attended college; less \nthan a third of the entire population has.'' So people who are getting \nthat subsidy are people who are very well educated. He said ``Blue-\ncollar workers constitute 47 percent of the workforce but just 7 \npercent of the art museum audience.''\n  So you have basically one-seventh of the art museum audience that is \nblue collar.\n  I am not saying we should not have art museums, but I am saying we \nought to be careful, when we talk about subsidies, that we don't \nsuggest to people we are subsidizing things for people who cannot \nafford them when in fact we are subsidizing programs for people who can \nvery well afford them.\n  Robert J. Samuelson, a well-known, outstanding economist and \ncommentator, put it this way, calling subvention of the arts ``highbrow \npork barrel,'' and ``an income transfer from middle-class taxpayers to \naffluent museum goers.''\n  Now, I think the point is that to suggest that the National Endowment \nfor the Arts is some way that we somehow open a door for everyone who \nis poor to become a great artist is simply to misinterpret what is \nhappening here. All too frequently, the National Endowment for the Arts \nis subsidy for well-to-do individuals to be able to do what they would \ndo anyhow. I believe that our responsibility to tax Americans is not \nrelated to providing subsidies for people to do what they can do on \ntheir own. Maybe Abraham Lincoln said it better than anybody else, when \nhe said that ``The role of Government is to do for people what they \ncannot do well for themselves.'' I think these are things that can be \ndone well.\n  There has been some suggestion on the part of those who would oppose \nthis amendment, also, that the existence of good authors who have \nreceived help shows that we should have been subsidizing the program. I \ndon't think that proves anything at all. You can have a good baseball \nplayer who got some help from the Government; does that mean we should \nhave a program to subsidize baseball? You have to look at what happens \nin the absence of a subsidy and what happens in the presence of a \nsubsidy. I think if you look at the first 200 years of this Nation's \nexistence, basically where we had no subsidy, the quality of art was \nvery good. As a matter of fact, it may have been better than it is \ntoday.\n  In many respects, whenever you provide a subsidy, you pay for \nsomething that the public would not pay for. Now, usually the public \nwon't pay for things that are not as good. In business, for example, if \nyou have a subsidy for something and it won't exist unless you \nsubsidize it, it means that the market doesn't really believe that it \nis worth what people would be asked to pay for it and it simply doesn't \nsurvive. So that subsidies themselves become a way for picking up \nthings, in many respects, at the bottom end of quality. I won't deny \nthat there may be fledgling artists who may be beginning and might want \nto try and find somebody to provide them a stake so that they can get \nstarted. But people who find their way into other professions don't \nhave a means of getting started in their writing, in their music, and \nin their paintings. For my music and for my writing, I have never had \nthat kind of subsidy. I have done it on my own. It is not that I resent \nthose who do. But I think it is important for us to understand that \nwhen the Government chooses one and denies another, it expresses a \nspecial set of values. In my view, that special set of values is \nsomething that we ought to be careful about, especially when that \nspecial set of values is found in books like ``Blood of Mugwump,'' \nwhere you have people who are sexual deviants and vampires, who involve \nthemselves in cannibalism and other things as a result of their \nproblems, which come to them because they were involved in religious \nexperiences. I think that is an affront. I am not a Catholic. I am \ngrateful for my Catholic friends and for the influence of the Catholic \nChurch in this culture. But if I were, as a Catholic, to look at the \nbook ``Blood of Mugwump,'' about a Catholic family group of vampires \nwith all this deviance and were to learn that it suggested in the book \nthat many of their problems come as a result of a virus that infects \nthem because they are involved in prayer, I don't know if I would think \nthat was a very appropriate book. I don't think the Government needs to \nbe in the business of approaching this culture of literature and \nsubsidizing this literature, if it is going to pull the spiritual \nunderpinnings of America from beneath us.\n  I know there is a dispute about whether this publisher was the one \nthat got the assistance, or whether this specific book got the \nassistance. The publisher seems to be representing the fact that he \nused the money to publish this book. The National Endowment for the \nArts, having learned that people are distressed about this, now wants \nto say that the publisher should not have used the money for the book. \nBut then, later on, the Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts \nindicates that this is one fine publisher and it ought to be credited \nfor what it has done to bring on line exciting new authors who would \nhave novel approaches to the world. Some of those novel approaches \nwould certainly be best left without a Federal subsidy, in my judgment.\n\n  I observe the presence in the Chamber of other individuals, such as \nthe senior Senator from North Carolina. I reserve the balance of my \ntime at this moment and suggest the absence----\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator withhold that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I believe the senior Senator from North \nCarolina wishes to speak. I understand that the senior Senator from \nIllinois would like to speak and doesn't have any time left on her \nside. I ask, how long does she wish to speak?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you very much. I was going to ask my \ncolleague if it was possible to have 5 minutes to speak, obviously, in \nopposition to the amendment. I know there is no time for the opponents \nleft. If my colleagues would so indulge me, I would be grateful.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. GORTON. I am certainly not going to have any objection to that \nrequest. I wanted to find out where we are in order to announce what I \ncan announce, and this would not be inconsistent with the request of \nthe Senator from Illinois.\n  It looks like this debate will be concluded at about 4:45. There will \nthen be a vote, I believe, on the amendment. I certainly do not propose \nto table the amendment.\n  I now, with the permission of the minority leader, ask unanimous \nconsent that immediately following the vote on the Ashcroft amendment, \nthere be 2 minutes of debate, equally divided between Senator Bryan and \nmyself, to be followed by a vote on or in relation to the Bryan \namendment No. 1205.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. May I inquire as to the current state of business in \nthe Senate then? What has been done? Has the Senator from Illinois been \ngranted time to speak?\n  Mr. GORTON. I don't think the request has been formally made yet.\n\n[[Page S9480]]\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not \nobject, necessarily. I wanted to know if the Senator from Washington \nwould be prepared to allow me to speak.\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from Washington is not going to object to a \nrequest by the Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Could the unanimous-consent request be amended to \nprovide 5 minutes for the Senator from Illinois before the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. May I \ninquire as to how much time is left for debate on this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 18 minutes 14 seconds for the \nSenator from Missouri and 5 minutes for the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Is it my understanding that the Senator from Washington \nis yielding his 5 minutes to the Senator from Illinois?\n  Mr. GORTON. That understanding would not be correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is not the case.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Then is it my understanding that the Senator from \nIllinois is asking that the proponents of this amendment, who have 18 \nminutes left, yield to the opponents an additional 5 minutes from their \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No. The request, as I understand it, of the \nSenator from Illinois was simply for an extra 5 minutes--to delay the \nvoting time 5 minutes to give her an additional 5 minutes.\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, again, as a matter of deference to \nmy colleagues, if they are prepared to give 5 minutes of debate to the \nopponent, I would be grateful to accept that. Alternatively, if the \nproponents of the amendment would agree to add an additional 5 minutes, \nI would be grateful for that. Really, I am not concerned as to the \nsource of the time. I would like to have some time to speak to this \nbefore a vote takes place.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there objection to the request of the Senator from Illinois?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, is my unanimous-consent agreement on the \nstacked votes agreed to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That has already been agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. One other point, for the convenience of colleagues. When \nthose 2 stacked votes have been completed, we will go to the Abraham \namendment and, after that, on the other two amendments that have \nalready been extensively debated on the National Endowment for the \nArts, I believe there will be 30 minutes equally divided agreed to on \neach of those. Whether or not those votes will be stacked to occur all \nat the same time or not is yet undecided. But there will be more votes \nthis afternoon. There will be more debate on the National Endowment for \nthe Arts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Chair. I am going to try to be brief. \nI have a lot to say and I will try to summarize. Some friends of mine \nwere having a conversation over dinner, and their 5-year-old was \nsitting at the table. They were talking about this issue, the funding \nfor the National Endowment for the Arts. And midconversation, the baby \nlooked up and said, ``Mommy, do Republicans hate Big Bird?'' The answer \nis obviously that Republicans don't hate Big Bird and, in any event, \n``Sesame Street'' is only indirectly supported by the National \nEndowment for the Arts. But there is little question but that some have \nmade this issue one of those wedge issues to inflame passions about \ncultural values and the role of Government, to pit people against each \nother and, again, to make us angry at each other as Americans, and \nfocus in on those things that make us different from one another, on \nthe things that separate us instead of the things that bring us \ntogether.\n  Public support of the arts ought to be one of those points around \nwhich we as Americans can come together, because it is one of the ways \nin which we define ourselves as Americans and in which we communicate \nthe richness of our American culture.\n  The NEA follows in a noble tradition of publicly supported art \ninitiatives. Just last night, we were over at the Library of Congress, \nand there we had an opportunity to see firsthand what public support of \nthe arts can do. That building is one of the more magnificent treasures \nof this country. I hope every American can have the opportunity to see \nit. I was particularly impressed by the room in which we held our \nmeeting, which had been built by American craftsmen--publicly \nsupported, following the end of the Columbian Exposition in my hometown \nof Chicago--who brought a variety of skills to bear on its creation, \nthe woodworking, plaster work, painting, ceramics--some so beautifully \ndone that it lifted spirits just to look at them.\n  Some of them were so refined that, frankly, the talents, skills, and \nart involved are in danger of being lost to us forever.\n  Then in another part of the Library of Congress, there is a wonderful \nexhibit of the Works Progress Administration that was started, as you \nknow, during the Depression, by President Roosevelt. President \nRoosevelt started WPA to hire starving artists, and, frankly, every \nAmerican should be grateful that he did. The work that they did, \npreserved for us the indigenous music out of the Delta of Mississippi, \nfolk music and blues--and oral histories that would have been lost to \nus forever. We would not have the value of the photographs and the \npaintings and the music and the original art that had been created all \nover this country had it not been for the activities and intercession \nof the WPA. And so they did all of this wonderful stuff and left it as \na legacy to all of us.\n  By and through the arts, the cultural fabric of our country was \nreinforced during some of its darkest days. Now the National Endowment \nfor the Arts, which was created in 1965, is under attack again. I point \nout what their charter says. It says: ``To foster excellence, diversity \nand vitality of art and broaden public access to the arts.''\n  That is the charter; that is what NEA is supposed to do, and that is \nwhat it in fact has done. Has it followed tradition? A look at the good \nthings it does for our country resoundingly answers that question. In \nIllinois, it has supported the YMCA of Chicago, The Lyric Opera, the \nArt Institute, and other large institutions that might have private \nsupport, but then it also, most importantly, supports those smaller \ninstitutions that would not have the help otherwise.\n  We have in Illinois received NEA grants for the Peoria Symphony and \nthe Little City Foundation, Glenn Ellyn Children's Choir--activities \nthat would not have the support and would not be able to leverage \nprivate dollars were it not for the NEA.\n  These community initiatives educate children, provide adults with the \ntools to socialize our young people, help communities to build on \npositive values which art inspires.\n  I would like to quote from Tolstoy for a moment who defines art ``as \na human activity having for its purpose the transmission to others of \nthe highest and best feelings to which men have risen.''\n  Obviously, this amendment, I think, takes the position that if you do \nnot have private money, those positive values won't be available to you \nor to your community.\n  Have there been embarrassments among the projects supported? Of \ncourse there have. As with any art, some of it will at all times be \nrepugnant to somebody. There is 16th century art around that some of my \ncolleagues will find offensive. That is a matter of their personal \ntaste. But the truth is that in any republic such as ours the freedom \nwe enjoy starts with the proposition that individual expression is a \npositive value. Instead of allowing for the fact that expression will \nbe of all kinds, the sponsors of this\n\n[[Page S9481]]\n\namendment would shut down all expression because they don't like some \nof it.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this attempt to divide us as \nAmericans, and I urge their support of the NEA.\n  I thank my colleagues for their indulgence and thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished senior Senator from North \nCarolina, Senator Helms, is recognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. I hope the Senator will yield to me 5 \nor 6 minutes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The Senator from Missouri is pleased to yield as much \ntime as the distinguished Senator from North Carolina desires.\n  Mr. HELMS. I certainly appreciate it. I would have been here earlier \nbut we had a meeting on China in the Foreign Relations Committee. I \ncouldn't leave. The witnesses were long-winded, as well as some others.\n  But I compliment the distinguished Senator from Missouri. I have been \nin the same position that he has been in for several years. It is \npretty lonely. But the people all across this country will admire the \nSenator from Missouri for it, and the Senator will hear from them--\npeople who believe in high principles and morality. I just want the \nSenator to know that he is not being overlooked.\n  I want a few minutes this afternoon to reflect upon an Associated \nPress report published Tuesday morning quoting NEA spokeswoman Cherie \nSimon as claiming that ``legislative restrictions'' and ``internal \nreforms'' have solved the NEA problem and that the NEA ``didn't fund \nsome of the programs as Helms condemned''.\n  Mr. President, isn't it interesting? You have a little lady --and I \nknow she is a nice lady because she is somebody's daughter, but I never \nheard of her--make this statement, which is not true in the first \nplace, that the NEA is not furnishing taxpayers' money for a whole \nplethora of rotten material. No other word will fit. This dissembling \nhas been going on, but every year they come up, and say, ``Oh, no. Not \nus. We just fund nice things.''\n  It is sort of like the farmer who heard some noise in his chicken \nhouse. He said, ``Who is out there?'' He heard a voice say, ``Just us \nchickens.'' And that is all the NEA says. I like Jane Alexander. I have \nmet with her. But they are evading the issue every year. They are \ngetting money that they ought not to get every year.\n\n  If spokeswoman Cherie Simon, whoever she is, believes that \n``legislative restrictions,'' as she put it, and ``internal reforms,'' \nas she put it, have, as she put it, ``solved'' the problem, she needs \nto wake up and smell the coffee because she obviously didn't understand \nthe problem in the first place. The truth is that legislative \nrestrictions and internal reforms mean simply that the NEA has been \nusing subterfuge and sophistry to spend the taxpayers' money on \nprograms that every year outrage the taxpayers.\n  So the NEA wants to deny funding this filthy book, with all of their \ndouble talk about who is paying for it, or who has paid for it. This \nbook, called ``Blood of Mugwump'' by a fellow named Doug Rice--the \nsaints have been good to me; I have never heard of him before--the most \nfilthy thing I believe I have ever read. And I have not read but about \nhalf a page of it. But down here it says--what do you guess? The \nNational Endowment for the Arts. Up here it says that the National \nEndowment for the Arts is furnishing the money through the English \nDepartment for Contemporary Literature of Illinois State University, \nIllinois Arts Center.\n  That is the way it always is--subterfuge about what is going on with \nthe taxpayers' money.\n  I am informed that while I was over in the Dirksen Building presiding \nin the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Harkin inserted a letter \nfrom the NEA disavowing NEA connection with the book. Yet, even the \nletter acknowledges that it was published by FC2. That is the \npublishing company, FC2. And FC2 put the NEA seal of approval on the \ncopyright page of this book. All I am doing is reading it to you.\n  The point, Mr. President, is this: The NEA and the FC2 can cook the \nbooks all they want to, but they know what this publishing company is \nall about, and they know about the filth that they have published, \nparticularly in this book. There is not a Senator in this body who will \ntake this book home and show it to his wife, or her husband, let alone \ntheir children. It is filth. And the taxpayers paid for it. No matter \nwhat Cherie Simon says about it, the taxpayers of America paid for this \nbook.\n  On June 24 of this year--long after the Senator from Iowa claimed \nthat the NEA disavowed ``Blood of Mugwump''--Jane Alexander wrote that \nFC2--get this--``FC2 has sustained a commitment to intellectual \nchallenge. . .'' That is the lady who heads the agency. That is the \nlady whom I like personally. She is a nice lady. But I don't know where \nshe is when all of these decisions are made. This book sure is an \nintellectual challenge, isn't it?. I wish every citizen of America \nwould take a look at it; they'd want to throw it in the furnace.\n  Perhaps we should examine another example of how these legislative \nrestrictions and internal reforms work.\n  The other day on this floor I mentioned a grant--for fiscal year \n1997--for a project by choreographer Mark Morris. This is the same guy \nwho once staged a version of The Nutcracker Suite complete with cross-\ndressing and other unsavory themes.\n  If the folks at the NEA want to say that the taxpayers didn't fund \nthat piece of work, they might be accurate. But, knowing this fellow \nMorris and his background, the NEA will nevertheless--nevertheless--\nfunnel $150,000 of the taxpayers' money this year to support his future \nwork.\n  That is what is going on. They come forth with obfuscation and \nconfusion, Mr. President, and they hoodwink a lot of Senators. They \ndidn't hoodwink them over in the House of Representatives.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Missouri deserves to be approved on \na unanimous vote. It won't be, because there are enough weak sisters \nsitting around that will find some excuse for not voting for it.\n  But I commend the Senator, and I praise him for taking the time to \naddress this subject.\n  One final note. I think it is time to end the charade at the NEA and \njust acknowledge to the taxpayers once and for all that Congress will \nno longer waste money on this Federal agency. So the Senate of the \nUnited States ought to do the right thing today by adopting the \namendment of the Senator from Missouri.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield back such time as I may have.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this should be charged to my own time on \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. President, I recommend to my colleagues the rejection of the \nAshcroft amendment with a degree of sympathy and understanding of the \npurity and the sincerity of his motives. I don't intend to go into \ngreat detail on it. Personally, I think there has been too much detail \nspent on this amendment and this bill already.\n  Fundamentally, however, there are large numbers of people in the \nUnited States who believe passionately in the mission of the National \nEndowment for the Arts. There are millions more who benefit from it \ndirectly or indirectly through the various institutions, musical and \notherwise, that it supports and the outreach in educational benefits \nthat they provide. At the same time, there is not the slightest doubt \nbut that the National Endowment for the Arts frequently follows the \nmost recent politically correct trends, that it has wasted some of the \nmoney that has been granted to it and has financed other exhibits under \nthe broad definition of ``art'' that are fundamentally offensive to \nlarge numbers--often to a majority of the American people.\n  I believe that the reforms of the last few years have to a \nsignificant degree corrected that shortcoming but that no set of \nreforms could correct them forever, simply because we have grants at \ntwo different levels. The first are the direct grants from the National \nEndowment itself over which we should exercise at least a degree of \ncontrol that we already have and about which the National Endowment \nshould be even more sensitive than it has been in the past.\n\n[[Page S9482]]\n\n The second level, of course, are what grantees do with grants that \nthey get from the National Endowment for the Arts. The process is more \ndifficult for us to control and often presents some difficulty to the \nEndowment itself.\n  I have little doubt that there are those at the extremes of the art \ncommunity who deliberately go out of their way to use money to offend a \nmajority of Americans. But I want them to control the ultimate outcome \nof this debate no more than I want it controlled by those who would \nremove all limits from the National Endowment and spend far more money \non it than we are doing at the present time.\n  I believe that on balance it is a healthy influence in American \nsociety and, therefore, I think agreeing with the House in abolishing \nit, as this amendment would do, is inappropriate.\n  I have a somewhat greater degree of sympathy with those proposals \nthat would decentralize it and give more to State art entities, \nalthough I must say I am not at all sure they are going to be less \npolitically correct than is the National Endowment itself. My own \nopinion is that it is likely that we will come out of the conference \ncommittee with a somewhat more decentralized system than we have at the \npresent time.\n  But, for the purposes of this debate, I don't believe that the Senate \nis going to accept the Ashcroft amendment. There was no sentiment for \nit on the 15-member subcommittee that I headed that reported this bill, \nand I do believe this is a case in which we should strive for greater \nimprovement and greater public acceptability rather than destroy the \nentity in its entirety.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  I believe it is appropriate for the proponent of the amendment to \nhave the last word.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Washington. \nI believe the 8 minutes that I have remaining will be sufficient for \nme.\n  I want to begin by thanking Senator Helms for his understanding of \nthe fact that subsidized speech, the process of identifying for \nAmericans what they should value and what they should not in terms of \nideas, somehow selecting between one author and another, has been a bad \nconcept. It has been a bad concept which turned into a horrible concept \nas we have literally wasted resources, and it has been a waste of \nresources from the inception. I provided examples from the 1960's, and \nI have examples from the 1990's.\n  Now, part of the activity on the part of the group that would seek to \npraise the National Endowment and say that it is just fine is the \nsuggestion that the NEA disavowed involvement in the publication of the \n``Blood of Mugwump'' book.\n  In March this year they said to the publisher: You shouldn't have \nused the money on ``Blood of Mugwump.'' And this was brought to the \nfloor by the Senator from Iowa as testimony that the National Endowment \nhad nothing to do with the scandalous and literally revolting attack on \nfaith and on persons of spiritual values and upon morality that the \n``Blood of Mugwump'' book represents. And obviously, the National \nEndowment, having been caught in this indiscretion, feels bad about it \nand seeks to repudiate it. But the Senator from Iowa did not provide \nthe additional documentation showing that 5 months before that the \npublisher was submitting a reimbursement form that included ``Blood of \nMugwump'' as part of what was being subsidized.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this ``Request for \nAdvance or Reimbursement'' form to which I am referring be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the form was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                  Request for Advance or Reimbursement\n\n                              (Long Form)\n\n       Please type or print clearly.\n       Complete and mail the top three copies to: Grants Office, \n     National Endowment for the Arts, 1100 Pennsylvania Avenue, \n     N.W., Washington, DC 20506-0001 OR-FAX one copy to 202/682-\n     5610.

Mr. President, the situation is simply this. The \npublisher in the previous year was claiming that it was publishing with \nthe grant the ``Blood of Mugwump.'' I think the record is clear. It may \nbe that the National Endowment for the Arts doesn't want to say that \nthe money, our money, your money, my money, taxpayers' money was being \nused for what was obviously revolting or repugnant literature. But the \npublisher knew what he was using it for and his request for \nreimbursement submitted to the agency well before, during the previous \nyear indicated that the utilization of the resource was for ``Blood of \nMugwump.'' Nevertheless, the National Endowment for the Arts says that \nits grant wasn't ``Blood of Mugwump.'' It was books like this one, ``S \n& M.'' Frankly, I could not read a page out of this book that I have \nseen to the Senate; I could not read it in my home, could not read it \nanywhere else. It says on the front, ``It's funny. It's smart.'' It is \nnot, not at all.\n  Fellow Members of the Senate, the United States of America has been a \nculture that's been rich in good art and has been rich in good culture \nand has attained a level of being a world leader not because of \nGovernment sponsorship, not because of Government telling people what's \ngood and what's not good and awarding scholarships or grants to one \ngroup and not to another. We attained our level of greatness in the \nabsence of those things and in the presence of a free marketplace, in \nthe presence of freedom for art.\n  Less than a month before John Kennedy was assassinated, less than a \nmonth before he died, he was asked to speak at Amherst College in \nMassachusetts to praise American poet Robert Frost. John Kennedy talked \nabout art and about freedom and about how artists need to be free in \norder to express themselves with integrity and how Government might \ncorrupt that process.\n  Now, you have to understand that there was no such thing as the \nNational Endowment for the Arts in the lifetime of John Kennedy, \nPresident of the United States, assassinated in 1963. This program, the \nNational Endowment for the Arts, was part of Lyndon Johnson's \ndiscontent with America, thinking we could make it a great society by \ninfusing Government money everywhere. And you know what he did to\n\n[[Page S9483]]\n\nthe family; you know what he did with the welfare system, and you are \nseeing what he did to the arts.\n  Here are the words of John F. Kennedy.\n\n       For art establishes the basic human truths which must serve \n     as the touchstones of our judgment. The artist, however \n     faithful to his personal vision of reality, becomes the last \n     champion of the individual mind and sensibility against an \n     intrusive society and an officious State.\n\n  Let me just say that again and see if I can say it more clearly. John \nKennedy says that the artist becomes an individual who stands against \nthe intrusive society and the officious State. He sees the artist as a \nline of defense against statism. He sees it as a bulwark of freedom--\nJohn Kennedy. I wonder what he would have thought if the officious \nState was to be guarded by an artist paid by the State.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       The great artist is thus a solitary figure. He has, as \n     Frost said, ``a lover's quarrel with the world.''\n\n  Then John Kennedy is eloquent and insightful.\n\n       In pursuing his perceptions of reality, the artist must \n     often sail against the currents of his time. This is not a \n     popular role.\n\n  Well, against the currents of your time is not what we find is \nhappening with the National Endowment for the Arts. They are directing \nthe current. We have gone over and over the article by Jan Breslauer \nfrom the Los Angeles Times which reminds us that they are demanding \nthat artists be politically correct in accordance with what the \nGovernment would dictate.\n  That is really not rising to the challenge of being against the \nofficious State. That is falling into the trap of being a participant \nof the officious State telling citizens what to believe and how to \nthink. So when John Kennedy was praising Robert Frost, John Kennedy put \nit this way:\n\n       In pursuing his perceptions of reality, the artist must \n     often sail against the currents of his time.\n\n  Perhaps he might even dare be politically incorrect, but were he to \ndo so, woe be unto his chance of being identified for a grant from the \nNEA.\n  Kennedy spoke in praise of Robert Frost who, without subsidy from the \nGovernment, wrote eloquently:\n\n       Two roads diverged in a wood and I, I took the one less \n     traveled by, and that has made all the difference.\n\n  America could have art that was subsidized, controlled by, directed \nby Government. It can happen. You can look at the art of the Soviet \nUnion of the last 70 years. They had art. They took the artists that \nweren't acceptable and they banished them. Solzhenitsyn was one of \nthem. We don't manage artists but we identify ones for approval and \nothers for subsidy, and some of those that don't get the subsidy and \ndon't get the approval are individuals that we ought to be looking \ncarefully at and they should not be discriminated against. A Government \nwhich discriminates against artists by discriminating in favor of \nothers violates our fundamental responsibility of free speech. And when \nit promotes morality, it undermines the very foundation and \nunderpinnings of a culture.\n  We should defund the National Endowment for the Arts. We should not \nspend this $100 million of taxpayer resources.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. GORTON. Has all time expired? I assume that the Senator from \nMissouri wishes a rollcall?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Ashcroft \namendment numbered 1188.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was rejected.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1205\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on amendment No. 1205 \noffered by the Senator from the State of Nevada, Mr. Bryan. Under the \nprevious order, there will now be 2 minutes for debate equally divided \nbetween Senators Bryan and Gorton.\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Presiding Officer bring the Senate to order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please come to order. This is \nan important amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is correct. The Senate \nwill be in order.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat Senator Carol Moseley-Braun be added as a cosponsor to the Bryan \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, I want to tell you, first of \nall, what this amendment is not about. This amendment is not about \ntimber harvesting in the national forests. It does not prevent it. And \nit does not prevent the construction of new roads in the national \nforests for purposes of timber access.\n  What it does is to eliminate a costly taxpayer subsidy that is part \nof the Forest Service program, a subsidy that has been roundly \ndenounced, and correctly so, by virtually every taxpayer group in \nAmerica, such as Citizens Against Government Waste and Taxpayers for \nCommon Sense, because it cannot be justified.\n  Second, this is an important environmental vote, perhaps our most \nimportant environmental vote to date because we reduce by $10 million \nan amount of money that is appropriated for new road construction in \nthe national forests.\n  The amendment does absolutely nothing to reduce or to impede the \naccounts that are provided for in the maintenance of roads in the \nNational Park System.\n  So Mr. President, I urge support of the Bryan amendment because it is \ntruth in budgeting and makes sense from a fiscal point of view and \nbecause environmentally it is sound policy for the Nation.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n1 minute.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, harvesters in national forests have \ndeclined by more than two-thirds over the course of the last several \nyears. This amendment is designed to cause them to decline still \nfurther. Many of its principal sponsors outside of this body have as \ntheir design the entire termination of any harvest on our Federal \nlands. This proposal drives significantly in that direction.\n  The amount of money in the bill for Forest Service roads is the \nrecommendation of the Clinton administration. The Clinton \nadministration reflects no savings of money by the ending of the Forest \nService credit. It is simply another step in the desire to see to it \nthat there is no harvest whatsoever on our forest lands.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time for the debate on the amendment has \nnow expired.\n\n[[Page S9484]]\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not been ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have cleared this request with the Republican leader.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I may address the Senate for not to \nexceed 10 minutes following this rollcall vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would like to make a unanimous-consent \nrequest that I think will inform Members of where we are going in the \nnext few minutes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate considers the following \namendments regarding the National Endowment for the Arts--that will be \nnext--they be considered under a 30-minute time limit, equally divided \nin the usual form: the Abraham amendment No. 1206; the Hutchinson of \nArkansas amendment No. 1187; the Hutchison amendment No. 1186. I \nfurther ask unanimous consent that no second-degree amendments be in \norder to these amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. I further ask unanimous consent that following the debate \non the Abraham and the Hutchinson of Arkansas amendments, the Senate \nproceed to a rollcall vote on or in relation to amendment No. 1206, to \nbe followed by a vote on or in relation to amendment No. 1187.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, \nthere is an effort to have the Armed Services Committee meet. I was \njust speaking with the chairman. Would it be possible to have the votes \non those three amendments lined up together at the end of the debate \nfor all three? Was that part of the UC?\n  Mr. GORTON. The design of this request is that the votes on the first \ntwo be stacked, and there would be an hour between the end of the next \nrollcall and those two. The proponent of the third amendment does not \nwant to stack her amendment with them. But there will be more than an \nhour for the committee to meet.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nunanimous-consent request is agreed to.\n  Under the previous order, the question now occurs on agreeing to \namendment No. 1205 offered by the Senator from Nevada. The yeas and \nnays have been ordered.

Madam President, today marks the 210th anniversary of the \nmost successful political experiment in thousands of years of human \nhistory, because on this date in 1787, the United States Constitution \nwas signed by a majority of delegates attending the Constitutional \nConvention in Philadelphia. This ingenious living document, \nthoughtfully crafted by our Founding Fathers more than two centuries \nago, owes its enduring quality in great measure to one of its most \nbasic, yet most ingenious and revolutionary ideas--namely, that the \npower and sovereignty of the United States Government ultimately rests \nin the hands of its citizens.\n  An active and educated citizenry, is therefore an essential component \nof the constitutional machinery that keeps our Government in tune. A \ncitizen of the United States not only has the right to hold opinions, \nbut he has a duty to work through his elected officials in behalf of \nthose opinions. If the Government is not being run effectively, \nefficiently, and constitutionally, citizens of the United States have a \nresponsibility to work to correct that course through the exercise of \ntheir right to vote. It is not only a right, it is a privilege. In \nother words, the Government that stands over us is ours to endorse or \nto change.\n  Unfortunately, however, a recent poll commissioned by the National \nConstitution Center, an organization established to better educate \nAmericans about the Constitution, reveals that a shocking number of \npeople in this country have virtually no knowledge of what is contained \nin this vital document, and, thus, have no clue about how it affects \ntheir everyday lives.\n  In fact, according to the survey, only 5 percent of Americans could \ncorrectly answer 10 rudimentary questions about the Constitution. That \nis an embarrassingly low percentage. How can citizens be expected to \nmeet their Constitutional responsibilities when they lack even basic \nknowledge about how our Government operates?\n  While 84 percent of those polled felt that to work as intended, the \nU.S. Constitutional system depends on an active and informed citizenry, \nonly 58 percent surveyed could name the three branches that comprise \nour Federal Government--only 58 percent. And, less than half knew how \nmany Members make up the U.S. Senate.\n  These are not difficult questions, but basic knowledge taught to \nschoolchildren at a young age when I was coming along, and should be \ntaught today to schoolchildren at a very young age. Yet, only 66 \npercent of those surveyed knew that the first ten amendments to the \nConstitution are called the Bill of Rights--only 66 percent. Some even \nresponded that the first ten amendments to the Constitution are called \nthe Pledge of Allegiance. Now, think of that.\n  I wonder how many listening right now to my voice know how many \namendments have been added to the Constitution since 1787. Only 19 \npercent of those surveyed answered correctly. There have been 27 \namendments.\n  The 27 amendments that have been added to the Constitution--which \ninclude the first 10 amendments, or the Bill of Rights--reflect the \ngenius that our Founding Fathers demonstrated in the creation of the \ndocument, by equipping the document with the inherent flexibility to \naccommodate the changes of a growing nation. Such flexibility is \nintended to be part of a continuing process, which gives the \nConstitution life and relevance to the daily affairs of all Americans. \nA course of apathy, and an ignorance of our civic responsibilities and \nrights threatens to completely undermine the democratic principles on \nwhich our sacred Republic was founded--the very principles which \nAmericans say they value so highly.\n  If there is anything encouraging to come from the results of the \nNational Constitution Center's poll, perhaps it is that 9 out of 10 \npeople surveyed said that they were proud of the U.S. Constitution. On \nthis anniversary of the signing of the U.S. Constitution, I hope that \nmore citizens will demonstrate that pride by taking it upon themselves \nto learn more about their Constitution and their Government, and teach \ntheir children, so that they can adequately perform the \nresponsibilities which were conferred upon them in Philadelphia in 1787 \nby some of the greatest minds in history.\n  Our first Chief Justice John Marshall once stated ``The people make \nthe Constitution, and the people can unmake it. It is the creature of \ntheir own will, and lives only by their will.'' If that will is \nmotivated mostly by ignorance\n\n[[Page S9486]]\n\nand misinformation our hard won, sacred freedoms appear to be in grave, \ngrave peril indeed.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the dismal results of \nthe National Constitution Center's poll be placed in the Record at this \npoint.\n  I thank Senators for listening and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                How People Answered the Constitution Poll               \n                                                                        \n                                                                        \n                                                                        \nHow do Americans feel about the   Responses:                            \n Constitution?                                                          \n    The U.S. Constitution is         91% agree.                         \n     important to me                                                    \n    I am proud of the U.S.           89% agree.                         \n     Constitution                                                       \n    The U.S. Constitution is         67% agree.                         \n     used as a model by many                                            \n     countries                                                          \n    To work as intended, the         84% agree.                         \n     U.S. Constitutional system                                         \n     depends on active and                                              \n     informed citizens                                                  \n    The U.S. Constitution            72% disagree.                      \n     doesn't impact events today                                        \n    The Constitution doesn't         77% disagree.                      \n     matter much in my daily                                            \n     life                                                               \n    To understand the                77% disagree.                      \n     Constitution, you have to                                          \n     be a lawyer                                                        \nThe question asked:               Percent of correct responses:         \n    When was the Constitution        19%--1787.                         \n     written?                                                           \n    Where was the Constitution       61%--Philadelphia, PA.             \n     written?                                                           \n    What are the first ten           66%--the Bill of Rights.           \n     amendments to the                                                  \n     Constitution called?                                               \n    Do you recall what the           55%--the Preamble.                 \n     introduction of the                                                \n     Constitution is called?                                            \n    How many branches of the         58%--three.                        \n     Federal Government are                                             \n     there?                                                             \n    How many Senators are there      48%--100.                          \n     in the U.S. Congress?                                              \n    How many years are there in      43%--6 years.                      \n     a Senate term?                                                     \n    How many voting members are      23%--435.                          \n     there in the House of                                              \n     Representatives?                                                   \n    How many years are there in      45%--2 years.                      \n     a Representative's term?                                           \n    Who nominates the justices       70%--the president.                \n     of the Supreme Court?                                              \n    According to the                 69%--born in the US.               \n     Constitution, a person must     51%--35 years of age.              \n     meet certain requirements       8%--lived in the US 14 years.      \n     in order to be eligible to                                         \n     be elected President.

Madam President, I just would state at the outset it is \nnot my intention, given the lateness of the day and the other \namendments still to come, to necessarily use all of the time on this \nissue. In fact, I intend to make a brief statement. I will stay here to \ndiscuss it at greater length if opponents of this amendment want to \nengage in more discussion, although I know today most people have \nexpressed themselves already on these issues pertaining to the National \nEndowment for the Arts. So I am going to make a brief statement and I \nwill then wait to see whether others wish to speak. If not, I am \nprepared at a certain point to yield back the remainder of the time.\n  This amendment seeks to accomplish several key objectives.\n\n[[Page S9487]]\n\n  First and foremost, it has been my goal since arriving in the Senate \nto move the NEA in a direction of being a private national entity \nsupporting the arts. I believe that is in the long-term best interests \nof the taxpayers and of the arts. Since arriving here and well before \nmy arrival, it has been obvious to me that these discussions about the \nNEA too often turn on questions of accusations from one side that we \nare spending tax dollars to basically promote things that are \nunacceptable or even obscene, and on the other side arguments from \nthose who are part of the arts community that we in the Congress are \ntrying to somehow censor the creative activities of people in our \ncountry. This will continue, Madam President, as long as taxpayer money \nis involved.\n  What I worry about as a supporter of the arts is that we will \ncontinue to see the NEA reduced in size and scope, both in terms of its \nbudget, as well as in terms of its flexibility, because each time a new \nissue arises, Congress' response has been to reduce funding and to add \nmore strings and more handcuffs to the Endowment.\n  The best way to address it, I think, is to move in the direction of \nprivatization, move this out of the Government, and allow it to be as \nlarge as support for it can be. That is what my amendment seeks to set \nin motion by reducing for the upcoming year by approximately one-third \nthe size of the Endowment but allowing the Endowment to spend a \npercentage of its revenues for the beginning of a fundraising program \ndesigned to ultimately produce adequate funds to sustain itself as an \nindependently chartered entity.\n  I believe that will be a long-term approach. As I laid out in \nprevious debates, I think there are a variety of indicators that \nsuggest support for the Endowment would be existent, that there would \nbe the kind of private support, given the magnitude of national support \nalready for arts activities in our country of $9 billion per year, \ngiven the fact that numerous private institutions are larger than the \nNational Endowment for the Arts, even today. I believe such support \nwould be existent. And so this would be the first step in that \ndirection toward privatization.\n  If my amendment is adopted, I will have sense-of-the-Senate and other \namendments that I will bring at appropriate times to buttress this plan \nof action.\n  The other goal of this amendment is to direct additional Federal \ndollars in support of other national treasures, some of them arch-\nrelated, that I think deserve our commitment: the Star-Spangled Banner, \nEllis Island, the papers of our Presidents and Founders, the works of \nour great composers, Mount Rushmore. All five of these entities or \ninstitutions or documents, or in the case of the Star-Spangled Banner, \nthe flag itself, are in various states of deterioration and lack of \nsupport.\n  My amendment would divert $30 million from the NEA to the support of \nthese entities at the amounts that have been requested by the people \ninvolved with them in order to facilitate restoration where that is \nappropriate, in order to facilitate maintenance where that is \nappropriate, in order to supply additional dollars to ongoing \nrestoration projects, and so on.\n  I believe all of us should be able to agree that these five national \ntreasures that I have outlined in this amendment deserve the support of \nthe Congress. By moving in this direction, we can accomplish two very \nnoble objectives, I think: On the one hand, the privatization and \nliberation of the National Endowment for the Arts, and on the other \nhand the preservation, restoration, and protection of great national \ntreasures.\n\n  For those reasons, I call upon my colleagues to support this \namendment. I think it is perfectly consistent with those who have \nargued for a national entity to support the arts. I think it is \nconsistent with those who have argued that we shouldn't have taxpayer \ndollars engaged in that entity. I believe that it is the right way to \nstrike a balance between the rival positions on this and at the same \ntime do great good in preservation of very important national \ntreasures.\n  At this point, Madam President, I yield the floor and see if anyone \nelse wishes to speak on this amendment.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield--how much time does the Senator from Arkansas \ndesire?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes remaining on his \ntime.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I inquire, do you have other Senators wishing to \nspeak on behalf of your amendment?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. What I was hoping for, if I can just indicate, was to \ndetermine if there was any further discussion or interest on the \nopposing side of this amendment. If there is, then I would want to \nspeak about my amendment more. If not, I will be prepared to yield the \nremainder of my time to the Senator from Arkansas to speak on whatever \nmatter he wants.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I only anticipate perhaps 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. That will be great. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Arkansas to speak on whatever issue he might wish, with respect to \nthis amendment or upcoming amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Thank you, and I thank the Senator from Michigan for \nyielding.\n  Madam President, I commend the Senator from Michigan for his \noutstanding leadership on the issue of the National Endowment for the \nArts, for his very constructive role that he has played over recent \nyears since his entry in the Senate. I know this is an issue he has \nfelt very strongly about, that he has looked for creative and \ninnovative ways in which we can continue to fund arts in this country, \nin which we can continue to emphasize that arts are a priority and, at \nthe same time, address many of the concerns that the American people \nhave addressed concerning the National Endowment for the Arts, its \nadministration and its elitist attitude.\n  I would just like to say in reference to that attitude, which has \ncaused such consternation among those who sincerely believe that arts \nare important in America but are greatly troubled by what they see in \nthe National Endowment for the Arts, a statement that was made by Jane \nAlexander, the Chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Arts, when \nshe testified before the Labor and Human Resources Committee this past \nApril.\n  In a dialog with myself and in response to the questions I posed to \nher, Ms. Alexander said:\n\n       Let me suggest an analogy here with regard to the arts.\n\n  Her response was in direct answer to my question concerning the \nsituation in Arkansas in which, out of 12 grant applications, only one \nwas granted. A little over $400,000 went to the whole State of \nArkansas, while single exhibits around this country received more. In \nresponse to that she said:\n\n       Let me suggest an analogy here with regard to the arts . . \n     . There are apples grown in practically every State of the \n     United States, but there are few States that have the right \n     conditions for nurturing and developing apple trees; and \n     then, they are distributed all throughout the Nation.\n\n  The implication being that arts are like apples, that there are only \na few places they are really going to flourish, and that Arkansas was \nnot one of them. I hope my constituents understand and I hope that my \ncolleagues understand why that was so offensive to me. She went on:\n\n       The same is true of the arts. The talent pools, the areas \n     of nurturing and development of artists tend to be located in \n     a few States.\n\n  Perhaps that explains why one-third of all of the direct grants of \nthe National Endowment go to six cities. Perhaps this attitude, \nrevealed in an unguarded moment, explains why one-third of the \ncongressional districts in this country receive nothing from the \nNational Endowment for the Arts. This is an agency whose original \nmission was to broaden access to the arts. Broaden access to the arts--\nI ask, is that going to be the result of the attitude that development \nof artists tend to be located in a few States, that the talent pool is \nonly located in a few States? I take great, great exception to that, \nand that is why I believe the Senator from Michigan--I have my own \namendment I will be talking on later--but I commend the Senator from\n\n[[Page S9488]]\n\nMichigan for the good job he has done in addressing these kind of \nabuses and this kind of attitude.\n  I have pointed out that the administrative costs for the National \nEndowment are well above most other Federal agencies--almost 20 \npercent. Almost a penny out of every nickel that the NEA has is spent \non administration overhead.\n  So I believe the votes that we are going to cast this evening on the \nAbraham amendment, on the Hutchinson-Sessions amendment, and on the \nHutchison of Texas amendment will be, to a great extent, a vote on \nwhether we want the Washington bureaucracy or whether we want more \nlocal control on funding for the arts.\n  So I ask support for the Abraham amendment. I also ask support for \nother amendments that will be offered concerning the National \nEndowment. We must not obfuscate, we must not confuse what this issue \nis. It is not are you proarts or against arts. So often I have heard \nproponents of the NEA come down and say, ``Well, arts are good.'' Of \ncourse, arts are good. They are beneficial, uplifting and they are \ninspiring and ennobling. They are all of those things, but you cannot \nequate the NEA with arts. In fact, the NEA funds less than 5 percent of \nthe Federal contribution to arts in this country. So it is time that we \nreform. It is time we made a change in the status quo.\n  I commend the Senator from Michigan. I thank him for yielding.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nask unanimous consent that the time not be charged to anyone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, it is my intention to offer a unanimous \nconsent request which I think has now been cleared on both sides. I ask \nunanimous consent that the votes ordered with respect to the NEA issue \nbe stacked to occur at 7:30 p.m., with 4 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to the votes on those issues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I now ask unanimous consent to have the time remaining \non both sides of the debate on the Abraham amendment be yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Abraham amendment No. 1206 is set \naside, and the Senator from Arkansas is recognized to offer a second-\ndegree amendment to the committee amendment on page 96, line 12 through \npage 97, line 8. There will be 30 minutes of debate on the amendment \nequally divided in the usual form.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Was the unanimous consent request agreed to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent request has been agreed \nto.\n  Mr. GORTON. So there will be votes at 7:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, we will try to find some other business \nto occupy the Senate until that time.\n  Does the Senator from Arkansas wish to speak?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nArkansas is recognized to offer his amendment.\n\n\n Amendment No. 1187 To Excepted Committee Amendment Beginning on Page \n                              96, Line 12\n\n  (Purpose: To provide financial assistance to States to support the \n                                 arts)\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 1187.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. HUTCHINSON] for himself, Mr. \n     Sessions, Mr. Abraham and Mr. Enzi, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1187 to excepted committee amendment beginning on \n     page 96, line 12.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, we have 30 minutes equally divided; \nis that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, over and over during the debate on \nthe National Endowment for the Arts we have heard the proponents come \nto the floor and say how good and beneficial the arts are. Who can \nargue with that? The argument they seem to make is, we ought to \nautomatically reauthorize, that we ought to automatically appropriate \n$100 million for the National Endowment for the Arts because art is \ngood, without any scrutiny, without any close examination of how the \nNational Endowment is operating, how they are working today.\n  The debate has in fact deteriorated into kind of a syllogism. The \nsyllogism goes like this: Art is good. The National Endowment for the \nArts is art; and, therefore, the NEA is good.\n  Obviously, art is good. It is inspiring. It is uplifting. We have \nheard anecdote after anecdote of the benefits of art in our lives. But \nthe NEA is not the equivalent of art.\n  In fact, as we see on this chart, the NEA is less than 5 percent of \nthe total Federal support for the arts and the humanities. You can look \nat the Smithsonian, the military bands, the Fulbright International \nExchange, the National Endowment of the Humanities, the National \nGallery of Art, the Holocaust Memorial Council. On and on we find the \nFederal role in arts is not limited to the National Endowment at all.\n  Only 5 percent, in fact, of all of the Federal involvement, involves \nthe NEA. That 5 percent though, as we have seen, has been eroded by \nextravagant overhead, over 18 percent administrative costs that are \nimmediately taken off because of the bureaucracy here in Washington. \nAnd that small 5 percent is absorbed by six cities--six cities. And \none-third of all of the congressional districts in the United States \nreceive nothing from the National Endowment of the Arts.\n  So in all of this debate, the problems in the NEA have gone \nunanswered. I heard the proponents of the NEA come to the floor, and \nover and over again they laud how wonderful art is--Who can object to \nthat?--how great literature is. Who can complain about that? But they \nnever respond to the objections that have been raised concerning the \nNational Endowment for the Arts.\n  Their mission is broader public access to the arts. Yet, as we saw \njust a few moments ago in a statement by Chairwoman Jane Alexander, she \nsays that there are only a few States that have the proper nurturing \nand development to produce artists. That, to me, will never fulfill \ntheir mission of broadening public access to the arts.\n  Fully 85 percent of the 1997 grantees were past recipients of NEA \nlargess-- 85 percent. That is not going out and fostering new artists, \nnew writers, new sculptors.\n\n  Here are the issues before the Senate. No. 1, accountability. As the \nproponents of the NEA come down, they have not responded to the NEA's \nown IG report which listed the abuses, things like 63 percent of the \ngrantees that had project costs that were not reconcilable to \naccounting records, 79 percent with inadequate documentation of \npersonal costs charged to the grant, 53 percent failed to engage \nindependent auditors to conduct grant audits as required by the OMB.\n  No one responded to that. I listened and listened. No one would \nrespond to the inspector general's report or the General Accounting \nOffice's evaluation of the NEA and how it operates. So accountability \nis an issue.\n  Local control is an issue. Do we want to continue to say yes to \nWashington bureaucrats, or do we want to say yes to local control of \nhow these dollars are spent?\n  Third, the issue is fairness and funding. Under the proposal of \nSenator Sessions and myself we have offered an amendment that will \nallow 45 States to receive more for arts. I hope that all of my \ncolleagues in the U.S. Senate will\n\n[[Page S9489]]\n\npick up the ``Dear Colleague'' on their desk that we so often overlook. \nIf Members look up your State, you will see exactly how much more will \nbe available for arts education or available for the local artists \nunder our amendment as opposed to the status quo.\n  Say no to Washington. Say yes to local control. Say yes to the \nHutchinson-Sessions amendment.\n  If there are no opponents here to speak I yield to the cosponsor of \nthis amendment, Senator Sessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I am honored to have the opportunity \nto join Senator Hutchinson from Arkansas in support of this bill which \nI believe certainly answers all the objections of those who are \nconcerned that somehow we would be cutting support for arts in America.\n  It answers the concerns of those who believe that the National \nEndowment for the Arts, as shown by its own inspector general's office, \nhas mismanaged itself, has not managed the taxpayers' money--money \ntaken from working citizens all over America--who have entrusted it to \ntheir Government in hopes that Members of this body will appropriate it \nwisely and effectively to further national goals.\n  Our bill says, all right, we can fund arts, but we want to do it a \ndifferent way. We are tired of trusting that inside group, the elite \ncorps, that has been distributing moneys, in my opinion, unfairly, for \nquite a number of years.\n  It is quite an interesting fact that six cities in this Nation \nreceive one-third of the moneys from the entire National Endowment for \nthe Arts. This chart will reflect that and give some appreciation for \nthis fact. The big cities, the wealthiest cities in the world, really, \nare the ones receiving the most money. That is because the distribution \nof that money is being decided by a group in Washington that is not \nconnected to the arts communities in places all over America--whether \nit is Indiana, Kansas, Ohio, Alabama or Arkansas. They are not \nconnected with those communities. So they tend to further the people \nthey are dealing with. It has been going in drastically unfair \nproportions to cities that are wealthier than any cities in the world. \nWe think that is a major factor that we ought to think about today.\n\n  New York City itself received more money than 29 different States, \nincluding my State of Alabama. Madam President, 75 percent of the \nmoney, as Senator Hutchinson has pointed out, 75 percent of these \nmoneys have gone in what may be considered a political direction. \nSeventy-five percent has gone to the districts of Democratic \nCongressmen. That, I think, should concern people, because a majority \nof the citizens of this country have elected their representatives to \nbe Republicans. It is not fair that the money be distributed just to \nthe Democrats.\n  They made very, very poor funding decisions. They funded programs \nthat are arcane, bureaucratic, bizarre, and often just plain silly, and \nnot supporting funding for programs that are worthy and needy.\n  In my hometown of Mobile, AL, we have an opera that celebrated its \nfiftieth anniversary a few years ago. A group of citizens who love the \nmusic and fine arts came together and formed that organization. It \nreceived a paltry $4,000 from the National Endowment for the Arts, \nwhereas, as Senator Ashcroft so eloquently talked about yesterday, this \norganization gave $1,500 to a poem consisting of one word--L-I-G-H-G-H-\nT. I don't know what it says or what language it is but they spent that \nmuch, and we only got $4,000 for an opera that does outstanding work in \nour community.\n  The opera in Mobile performs works that I think anyone can support, \n``La Boheme,'' and ``Pirates of Penzance,'' one of my favorites, just \nlast year. In ``Pirates'' I recall the great phrase, he is the very \nmodel of a modern major general, he knows all things, agricultural, \nchemical and mineral, but he didn't know how to fight a war. That was a \ngood lesson. Arts do teach us. We learn from those kind of things.\n  I am not against art. I think we can do a better job of supporting. I \nam willing to support arts funding. This bill represents a huge \ninfusion of money into the arts community all over America in virtually \nevery State.\n  Look at this: Alabama goes from $750,000 to $1.6 million, a $900,000 \nincrease; Alaska shows a $50,000 increase; Arizona, a $600,000 \nincrease; Arkansas, a $770,000 increase; California, a $1 million \nincrease; Colorado, a $97,000 increase; Connecticut, a $127,000 \nincrease; Delaware, a $152,000 increase; Washington, DC, $1.8 million \nreduction. Washington, DC, has money already funded for the National \nGallery of Art, the Kennedy Center, and many other activities in this \ncommunity by this body.\n  Madam President, I say that art is valuable. Good art does uplift. \nAll of us who care about a greater America should support the arts. We \nshould support fine arts. But just as good art uplifts, poor art can \ndemean and undermine the qualities of a great Nation.\n  Too often, this organization has supported art that is not healthy, \n``art from the gutter,'' as has been said. Just this past year, as was \ndemonstrated on ``Dateline'' with Jane Pauley this summer, a special on \nthe National Endowment for the Arts showed explicit homosexual \nactivities on the screen using a $31,000 grant by the National \nEndowment for the Arts.\n  One of the reasons they say they want to remain in existence is \nbecause they helped set the standard, they are the Good Housekeeping \nSeal of Approval. What kind of approval is that, for this Government to \nfund obscene and pornographic material with taxpayers' money, against \nand contrary to the basic and deepest decent views of the average \ncitizen in our Nation?\n  Madam President, 45 States will get more. Our orchestras in virtually \nevery State will get more. Our museums will get more. Our theaters will \nget more. Our folk art will have more opportunities for additional \nfunding.\n  I submit this proposal answers all of the objections of the critics \nwho say that we should continue to fund arts. It continues to fund arts \nat a greater degree than we have done before and eliminates the \nmismanagement that we have seen in Washington.\n  This is a good bill. I urge all my colleagues to support it. It is \ntime to bring to an end an agency that has abused its power, who for \nyear after year after year has come before this body and promised to do \nbetter but does not do so. It is time to bring that agency to an end \nand take the taxpayers' money and spend it wisely in real support of \nreal art all over America.\n\n  Madam President, that concludes my remarks. I note that Senator Jesse \nHelms, who voted to end all funding for the National Endowment for the \nArts, also has expressed a wish to join in as a cosponsor to this \namendment. I think that should be noted for the Record.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 15 minutes remaining in opposition \nto the amendment. Senator Hutchinson has 3 minutes 33 seconds remaining \non his side.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I yield myself 7 minutes. If I need an \nadditional minute or so, I may ask unanimous consent for that. Will the \nChair notify me when 7 minutes have expired and maybe we can work \nsomething out here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so advise the Senator.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, let me begin by expressing my appreciation \nto our colleagues who rejected the proposal to eliminate the National \nEndowment for the Arts in its entirety by a vote of 23 to 77. I think \nit was a good vote and a strong vote, one in which the Senate can take \nlegitimate pride. I think that vote expresses the feelings of most of \nus here that the National Endowment for the Arts has been a very \nsuccessful agency that has made a significant contribution, and \ncontinues to do so, to the vitality, health, well-being, and cultural \nheritage of our country.\n  I know it has been said that there have been examples cited of where \nNEA grants or subgrants or subcontracts over the years, from time to \ntime have been given that have supported or produced or been involved \nwith some productions of art that have been distasteful to many people \nin this country. I\n\n[[Page S9490]]\n\nam not here to argue the merits or demerits of those particular cases. \nIn fact, in several instances, I, too, was sort of stunned that certain \nproductions were provided with that kind of financing and backing.\n  But I think it is important for everybody to understand and to put \nthis into context, if we can. As I understand it now, since the \ncreation of the National Endowment for the Arts, going back more than a \nquarter of a century ago, there have been over 100,000 grants that have \nbeen extended by the NEA. Of that 100,000, I am told, if you take all \nthe controversial grants that have been given, the number is around 40 \nor 45 maybe. That, many would argue, goes beyond the ones that were the \nmost controversial, which number in the single digits. I wanted to put \nthat into perspective.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. If I can just finish my remarks, I will be glad to yield at \nthat time.\n  The reason I cite those statistics is I think it is important, as we \nlook at these agencies, that we keep this in context. No agency is \nperfect. There have been questionable grants given by the Housing \nAdministration, by the Defense Department, and by the Commerce \nDepartment. In fact, I would match up the total amount of grants given \nby the NEA, those that are controversial or distasteful, and compare \nthat with almost any other agency of the Federal Government and compare \ntheir track record in terms of cases where there has been fraud, abuse, \nor waste of millions of dollars.\n  So nobody is standing here suggesting perfection at all. What we are \narguing about is whether or not there is a legitimate purpose in having \na National Endowment for the Arts, a federally chartered agency that \ntries to express the importance of the cultural contribution of the \narts. I have often said to students in my State, or elsewhere, when \nthis issue comes up--I think almost every grade school student can tell \nyou the name of the artist who painted the roof of the Sistine Chapel. \nBut I defy anybody to tell you who the Pope was at that time, or to \nname the Emperor of Rome. We don't remember the political figures \nthroughout history, but artists have given us a definition, a \nsignature, in many cases, of a generation or a time. Certainly, we have \nseen that in our country.\n\n  We define our own heritage by literature, art, and music. To have our \nGovernment, in a sense, speak to that and try to provide guidance, \nassistance, and support for areas of the country that would not \notherwise get that assistance, I think is something we ought to build \nupon and perpetuate. We build stadiums for sports with taxpayers' \nmoney. These stadiums today can cost $100 or $115 million to house \n30,000 or 40,000 people to watch a sporting event. The entire budget we \nare talking about here for the National Endowment for the Arts is $100 \nmillion for all 50 States, to support our cultural activities.\n  There has been a tremendous burst and blossoming of activities in the \nlast 30 years in this country in the arts area. The number of nonprofit \ntheaters has grown from fifty-six 30 years ago to over 400 in the \ncountry today. Orchestras have quadrupled in number, to over 200 in our \nNation. Public arts agencies in small towns and cities have climbed to \nover 3,000 in the last 30 years.\n  Yet, today, we see another attempt here to try, in one way or \nanother, to get rid of the agency, to either vote it out of existence \nor, with all due respect, to block grant the money to eliminate it. We \nalso know that this very agency has been the one which has served as \nthe impetus, the spark, if you will, that has aided in the flourishing \nof the arts we have seen over these past three decades.\n  With a deep commitment and a meager beget, the NEA has provided vital \nsupport to States, local communities, schools, artistic and cultural \ninstitutions, artists, and others for over 30 years.\n  While always limited, these dollars do make a difference. It is hard \nto leverage out of a block grant, if you will, the kind of private \ncontributions NEA has been able to generate. So by removing the kind of \nprograms that we have seen here and leaving things up to sort of the \npolitical vagaries, we leave this commitment that we have made over the \nyears in great, great jeopardy.\n  Currently, 35 percent of the NEA's budget flows directly to the \nStates--in effect, a block grant, if you will. I understand that the \nStates deserve a role, but it needs to be a partnership with the \nFederal Government. The success of the NEA is rooted, obviously, in its \nnational presence--once that is lost, I think we all lose in this \ncountry.\n  Why is the Federal leadership role important? First, I happen to \nbelieve that Federal leadership allows better access to the arts for \nall Americans. It assures all Americans, regardless of income or \ngeography, that they will have access to the arts. Grants allow quality \norchestras and theater groups to travel throughout the country. The NEA \nhelps communities with few resources to develop local talent through \nexposure to operas, theaters, and orchestra groups.\n  Second, the NEA develops public-private partnerships that work. NEA \ngrants, as I said a moment ago, help raise and leverage private \ndollars. Also, it is the prestige of an NEA grant that, on average, \nattracts money from other public and private funding sources. There is \nno guarantee that these same sources will risk supporting a festival or \nexhibit sponsored by an unknown State art council with no track record \nand without the stature of the NEA. In essence, NEA grants raise money; \nblock grants do not.\n  Third, support for programs with a national impact is a goal and \ncommitment of the NEA and can only be forwarded by an organization with \nresources and the kind of clout and prestige of a Federal agency. It \nputs us on record, as a nation, that we stand and support these \nefforts.\n\n  The NEA supports such nationally important work as the Vietnam \nVeterans Memorial, or public television shows; these are national in \nscope not State by State, or community by community. We lose that if we \ndon't have a national focus and direction.\n  National studies into the importance of arts education can be lost. \nSupporting American artists that represent the United States as a \nnation in cultural festivals overseas are supported by the NEA. Who is \ngoing to do this if we, in fact, distribute the resources around the \ncountry and lose the national presence of the National Endowment for \nthe Arts?\n  The National Endowment for the Arts dollars go to regional projects--\nnot just State and local ones--such as exhibiting the traditional folk \narts of the Delaware Valley. Only the NEA, as a fully funded Federal \nagency, can garner the resources and provide the leadership for such \nnationally important work.\n  Fourth, NEA dollars receive economic returns. These dollars create \n$37 billion in national economic activity, and $1 billion alone in my \nhome State of Connecticut. Grants spur economic activity throughout the \ncountry. NEA grants generate tourism, stimulate business development, \ndrive urban renewal and contribute to our Nation's economic vitality. \nOver 1.3 million jobs are supported by the arts.\n  Finally, the NEA is a leader. The NEA provides cultural leadership \nfor the Nation in such areas as education, crime prevention \ninitiatives, city design, public arts, and preservation of the Nation's \ncultural heritage.\n  By giving the majority of funds to the States, by cutting out the so-\ncalled middleman here in Washington, you are not helping, necessarily, \nthe local artist, the local orchestra, or the local theater. In many \ncases, I suggest that you are actually hurting them.\n  The NEA is the keystone here. Once removed, I think we all lose.\n  Mr. President, the arts adds to our culture, to our Nation and our \neconomy. I believe it is time that we look for a source of funding, in \naddition to Federal funds, to maintain the NEA's vital role.\n  Our colleague from Alaska, Senator Stevens, has a proposal--a sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution--that we conduct some extensive hearings in \nthe coming Congress to look at ways in which we might supplement the \nFederal funding for the NEA. It is time we do more to ensure the future \nviability of the NEA and the NEH.\n  I am looking at a way in which we might get beyond the debate, and \ncreate a true endowment to supplement\n\n[[Page S9491]]\n\nfederal funds. I suggest looking into an innovative way to create this \ntrue endowment. I propose tapping revenue from a copyright extension to \nfund this true endowment. My idea is to extend, or rather to terminate \nthe copyright period--whatever it may be, 50 70, or 90 years--that \nthere be a period of say 20 years after that period in which the \nGovernment would auction off these copyrights. Individuals would bid on \nthe copyrights. And the resources that came in from the bids would \nsupport a national arts endowment, a true endowment. But this would \nallow one generation of artists supporting future generations; in a \nsense, a true endowment.\n  This is no endowment. I don't know why we call this a National \nEndowment for the Arts. It is not an endowment. It is an appropriations \nthat we have year in and year out. The idea of a true endowment is not \na perfect one at all. But it would be a way of us getting away, if you \nwill, from the constant battle of appropriations to a way of having the \narts in effect generate revenues.\n  You may not get much immediately. But I suspect with all the \ntechnology that is being developed--the preservation, the ability to \npreserve works of art and many art forms emerging--that in the 21st \ncentury, long after all of us are gone, there might be a substantial \namount of revenues that would be generated to support arts activities \nin the country.\n  I raise the idea of a true endowment as a mere suggestion and I hope \nthe Senate will look into the suggestion. It is time to endow the NEA \nand the NEH with a future and secure a national cultural endowment for \ngenerations to come.\n  With that, I thank my colleagues for their patience in listening. But \nI know my colleague from Arkansas wanted to raise a question. I would \nbe glad to at least try to respond.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. First, I commend the Senator from Connecticut for his \ncreative and innovative ideas on how we might truly have endowment of \nthe arts. I hope that everyone understands on both sides of this debate \nthat there is support for funding for the arts. The issue is the \nNational Endowment--the so-called National Endowment for the Arts.\n  As I have listened to the proponents of the NEA, I have heard glowing \ncommendations and glowing reports about arts in America. But what I \nhave failed to hear anyone respond to--and the question I would pose to \nthe Senator from Connecticut--is the very I think deplorable record \nthat the NEA has established, both in its administrative costs and over \n18 cents on the dollar, by a nickel more per dollar, than the National \nEndowment for the Humanities, or other Federal agencies.\n  The inspector general, who, in conducting his grantee audits from \n1991 to 1996, found that absolutely deplorable record of audits, a lack \nof accountability without knowledge of where the money was going, who \nwas spending it, who was receiving it. It is that kind of slipshod \nmanagement that has put a question mark over I think the future of the \nNEA. And when we talk about funding for the arts, only 5 percent of the \nFederal involvement in the arts at the Federal level is the NEA. There \nare literally hundreds of billions of dollars being spent at the \nFederal level in support of various arts programs and other agencies \nand departments. It is not a matter of pulling out the Federal role in \narts.\n  I would welcome the response.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague would give me a chance to respond to the \nquestion, he raises the issue in the committees. He is not just raising \nit here on the floor.\n\n  First, let me--I should have mentioned these in my remarks--comment \nhere. I happen to believe that Jane Alexander has done a brilliant job \nat NEA--a remarkable individual, truly a national treasure. I recall \nthe specific questions being raised about these issues. Certainly \nlegitimate questions should be raised about how well an agency \nfunctions, whether or not we are getting much for the dollar for the \npurposes intended, or how much gets consumed by administrative costs. I \nthink that is a legitimate question raised in ways in which we make an \nagency function better. Certainly we have seen this administration \nfocus a great deal of its attention on so-called ``reinvention of \nGovernment''--trying to streamline 180,000 fewer jobs at the Federal \nlevel, and fewer pages of Federal regulations. I think we all applaud \nthat.\n  I think it is a legitimate issue to look to see how we can make this \nagency perform better so that the American people will be the greater \nbeneficiary, if you will, of the role of and the purpose of the NEA. \nBut I would respectfully say to my colleague from Arkansas, as \nlegitimate as those questions are, it seems to me that we ought not to \ntry to eliminate in effect, through either block grant or total \nelimination, a Federal agency that has played such a critical role in \ngiving national voice, as I said earlier, to the arts efforts, not to \nmention regional aspects, and the like. My fear is that, of course, by \ndoing this through a block grant we would achieve just that--rather \nthan an appropriate examination of how we can make the NEA work better, \nrespond better, reduce its overhead costs so that more of those dollars \nwill actually reach the artists, the communities, and the artistic \nefforts that we all would like to see happen. That is my concern here. \nWe seem to be saying that no matter what you try to do, there is \nnothing that could be done here--that there is no way whatsoever to \nmake this agency work better. I believe there are ways. I think Jane \nAlexander has certainly demonstrated that over the last several years \nunder her leadership.\n  So, I urge that, rather than discarding in a sense de facto--that \nwould be the result here--with all due respect the NEA, we ought to \nlook at ways in which the Senator might suggest how we can improve the \nNEA's performance rather than certainly suggesting its elimination.\n  My colleague I see may have another question.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. No. I was going to inquire of the Chair the amount of \ntime left in this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas controls 2 minutes. \nThe Senator from Connecticut controls 15 seconds.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, if I may, I still have the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator yield? I would like for Members to have \nmore time, if I may.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield for the purposes of making a request.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, we have until 7:30 before the vote. I \nthink it would be appropriate to ask unanimous consent that the time \nbetween now and 7:30 be evenly divided between the two sides with the \nlast 4 minutes devoted to the opponents and proponents using 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, I want to inquire of the \nleadership.\n  I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that an article by \nLewis Hyde that appeared in the Los Angeles Times, a MacArthur Fellow \nand Professor of Art and Politics at Kenyon College, that talks about \nconcept and idea, that I mentioned in terms of establishing a true \nendowment, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Use Copyright Extension to Endow Creativity\n\n                            (By Lewis Hyde)\n\n       The mother lode of creative work from the early days of \n     film and sound recording will soon begin to enter the public \n     domain. This potentially enormous wealth could be used to \n     support the community of artists and scholars from which it \n     ultimately derives. But Congress is considering a bill that \n     would essentially transfer the wealth from the public domain \n     to the pockets of private corporations and individuals. It \n     would be a serious loss if the decision to give the money \n     away were not joined to the debate about how we support \n     creativity.\n       A 1994 proposal from Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) \n     lays out an ingenious way to use the value of past \n     intellectual property to support artists and scholars working \n     today. The ``Arts Endowing the Arts Act'' would add 20 years \n     to the term of copyright protection and use the income from \n     those extra years to underwrite current creative work.\n       At present, U.S. copyright protects an individual's work \n     for his or her lifetime, plus 50 years; corporations with \n     works ``made for hire'' hold rights for 75 years. Under \n     Dodd's proposal, at the end of each of these terms, the \n     rights to an additional 20 years would be publicly auctioned, \n     the proceeds going to\n\n[[Page S9492]]\n\n     build an endowment dedicated to the arts and humanities.\n       Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) is sponsoring a bill that would \n     similarly extend the term of copyright for 10 years, but the \n     proceeds of this windfall would go to current rights holders. \n     Supporters of Hatch's bill point out that the European Union \n     has directed its member states to unify their terms of \n     copyright at ``life plus 70 years,'' and they contend that \n     many benefits would follow if we did the same, chief among \n     them an increase in the U.S. balance of trade. They also \n     contend that many countries follow ``the rule of the shorter \n     term'' when foreign and local laws differ; thus, if the U.S. \n     term is shorter, Americans would forfeit income they might \n     otherwise have earned abroad.\n       None of these arguments holds up under scrutiny. The \n     arithmetic doesn't make sense, for one thing. Corporations \n     owning made-for-hire works currently hold copyrights for 75 \n     years; under Hatch's bill, the term would run 95 years, a \n     welcome change for ASCAP and the Motion Picture Assn, but not \n     one that brings U.S. law into harmony with European law. To \n     do that would mean reducing the work-for-hire term by five \n     years, not adding 20 to it.\n       As for gains in the balance of payments or losses under the \n     ``rule of the shorter term,'' we should remember that \n     Europeans are not the only consumers who would pay for this \n     change. The bulk of the cost of this corporate handout would \n     be borne by U.S. citizens, who would be obliged to continue \n     paying royalties for works that would have otherwise become \n     common property.\n       Since its beginnings in the 18th century, U.S. copyright \n     law has sought to balance private gain and public good. If \n     Congress now wants to change the terms of copyright, the \n     crucial question to ask is not whether it would be harmonious \n     with Europe's, but whether the constitutional mandate to \n     balance private and public good would be upheld. The beauty \n     of the Dodd proposal is that it not only addresses issues set \n     in motion by Europe's longer term, but it does so without any \n     theft from the public side of the scale. It adds a middle \n     term between public and private, a transition period during \n     which we designate as ``the public'' that community of \n     artists and scholars whose calling already makes them the \n     initial heirs of our cultural patrimony.\n       It would be best if the income from such a plan went to \n     build endowments for the National Endowment for the Arts and \n     the National Endowment for the Humanities so they might \n     eventually be free of their reliance on congressional \n     funding. For many years, supporters of the arts have sought \n     some way in which the arts and humanities might benefit from \n     their own streams of wealth, rather than having to go begging \n     for tax dollars. The American creative community already has \n     riches and income. It needs only institutions designed to \n     translate some of that wealth into support for those who \n     labor today to create the cultural riches that will be passed \n     on tomorrow.\n       By extending copyright to help build the endowments, \n     Congress can create such an institution. If, on the other \n     hand, it extends copyright with no regard for the public \n     domain, it will have done little more than sponsor a \n     remarkable theft.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Second, I will conclude my remarks so others may have a \nchance to speak on this issue. In the reauthorization bill, which \npassed 14 to 4 by the Labor and Human Resources Committee, we adopted \nan amendment by our colleague that codifies the inspector general's \nrecommendations that the Senator from Arkansas has identified before \nthe committee today.\n  So that the suggestions that are being made are ones that we think \nought to be made a part of making NEA perform better. That is a \nlegitimate function of a congressional committee--to examine all of our \nagencies to determine how they can function better. We did that pretty \noverwhelmingly in the committee.\n  I commend my colleague for the amendment and the suggestion that \ncodified those ideas.\n  Second, Mr. President, administrative costs were lower at the agency \nwhen, frankly, the appropriations were higher. You shrink a budget down \nand, of course, if you are trying to maintain a programmatic level, \nwhat can happen is you find your percentage costs rise with the \nshrinkage of dollars, so that more and more of it gets eaten up in \nadministration. When we actually appropriated more for the NEA, those \nadministrative costs were a lower percentage of the overall budget. \nAudit findings were from a group of grants recommended by the staff of \nthe NEA for audit because of concerns about the grant administration, \nand they were not randomly selected, I might point out as well.\n  At any rate, Mr. President, just to make the final point on this from \nmy perspective here, I think we ought to be celebrating the success of \nthe agency. To have had 100,000 grants in 30 years with 40 \ncontroversial ones, I defy any other Federal agency to have a track \nrecord even remotely close to that record. Any other agency that \nprovides grants to anyone, where they have had only 40 that fall into \nthe category of controversial, that is a remarkable record and one I \nthink we ought to applaud. We ought to be celebrating the National \nEndowment for the Arts and its contribution to our country and what it \nhas stimulated, what it has brought to enrich our heritage, our \nculture, our time.\n  Someone was pointing out to me earlier today there was a great debate \nin the Congress over whether or not we ought to accept the library of \nThomas Jefferson when he offered it to the United States. Of course, \nthe successor of that it is the Library of Congress, but it was the \nJefferson library that was offered. The debate was a raging debate, and \nsome suggested we only ought to accept the Jefferson library if we \nextracted from it any books which spoke about atheism or other \nquestions which were not mainstream or popular or certainly rejected \nthe values of our society as a whole. It was a relatively close vote, \nbut that idea was rejected and we bought the entire Jefferson library. \nToday, I think our Library of Congress and the contribution that Thomas \nJefferson made is something all of us applaud.\n  We might find it even somewhat amusing today to have heard there was \nthat kind of debate. I would suggest today that even with these highly \ncontroversial performances that people do not like, that offend them, \nwe can focus on that if we want, but why not focus as well on the over \n100,000 grants that have enriched our society, have brought a great \nwealth to this Nation, opportunities to people in areas of this Nation \nthat never would have had that benefit.\n  My hope is that when our colleagues vote on this particular \namendment, they will be mindful of that contribution, of this great \nsuccess and of the great fortune we have as a Nation to have someone of \nJane Alexander's abilities and background and qualities to help lead \nthis agency, as sensitive as she is, listening to the concerns of any \nMember who cares to have her time in how to make this agency work \nbetter. I hope we would keep that in mind as we cast our votes, so \nfuture generations look back on this time and say that in this Congress \nat the close of the 20th century the Senate insisted, a majority of us \nhere, to keep the National Endowment for the Arts, to prepare for the \n21st century and to leave a legacy of riches, of cultural riches. We \nlose that, Mr. President, if we abandon this agency and turn this into \na block grant.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). Who yields time to the Senator \nfrom Alabama?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I yield such time as he might consume to the Senator \nfrom Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized. The \nSenator from Arkansas controls 8 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I say to the eloquent Senator from Connecticut, to talk \nabout retreating from the arts, this is not the appropriate argument \nhere. We are talking about spending more money directly for the arts.\n  As he was talking, I did a quick look at how the State of Connecticut \nwould fair under a block grant program, and they would go from \n$1,265,000 to $1,392,000, actually increase $128,000 in real moneys \nthey can use for arts in the State of Connecticut. But I would also \nadd, Connecticut is one of the wealthiest States, I think perhaps the \nwealthiest State in America. It is a State with a great tradition of \narts, but I notice they received 28 grants last year totaling \n$1,059,000--28 grants, $1,059,000. Under our plan they would receive \nmore money than that.\n  But let me tell you, I represent the people of the State of Alabama, \nand I have had three groups representing orchestras in my State in my \noffice. I know of the great Shakespeare theater in Montgomery. I am \naware of the opera and museums in Mobile. We have a great history of \narts, too, but we received only 11--not 28. We received 11\n\n[[Page S9493]]\n\ngrants at only $540,000, even though we have more people in the State \nof Alabama paying taxes to this country than they do in the State of \nConnecticut.\n  One of the real problems with this program is it has not allocated \nthe money fairly. How can I support a program that takes money from \ntaxpayers in Alabama to support the wealthiest States in art endeavors \nwhen we have art endeavors we are striving every day to enhance and \nimprove?\n  Bureaucracies have never created art. Nothing of beauty has come out \nof a committee. It takes the intelligence and genius of individual \ncitizens to do it. So I say it is the wrong approach to think that we \ncan send money to Washington, DC, and that they can somehow decide how \nto nourish art. That is not the way it is going to happen. Let us put \nthat money out into the States, to the arts councils of the States, and \nlet them look at how they can contribute the money to those budding \nartists who need money, to those orchestras that need just that extra \namount to keep their doors open, to assist those communities that are \nworking hard to raise money to preserve folk art.\n  That is what we ought to be doing. I do not think there is any doubt \nabout it. This is as clear a vote as I have ever seen in this Senate. \nThe choice is clear. Do we send money to Washington to allow them to \nmismanage it and a bureaucracy to use almost 20 percent or do we send \nthis money out to the arts councils around this Nation so they can use \nit to improve the operas and orchestras and museums of our States \nthroughout our Nation? That is what we ought to do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the National Endowment for the Arts has \nbeen accused of elistism. But the true record of the Endowment is far \ndifferent. It is a record of diversity, excellence, and outreach.\n  The Endowment has been supportive of national efforts of the Country \nMusic Foundation. The Endowment supported their commission of the \nThomas Hart Benton famous last painting ``Sources of Country Music'' \nthrough its Art in Public Places Program. The painting is on display, \nit has traveled the Southeast, and has been exhibited in a vast array \nof venues from the Hirshhorn Museum to the cafeteria of the Nissan \nPlant in Nashville, TN.\n  Another grant in the late 1970's catalyzed fundraising for a major \ncountry music discography of the early 78 rpm recordings from 1922 \nthrough the 1940's. The project is just being completed today.\n  Again, in the 1980's, the NEA supported an educational kit entitled \n``Tennessee Traditions'' distributed to every public school in \nTennessee. One of the components of the kit was a folk music tape.\n  Each year the Arts Endowment honors National Heritage Fellows. The \nfellows are from a wide variety of disciplines of the folk and \ntraditional arts. Among the honorees this year are bluegrass musicians \nJim and Jesse McReynolds of Tennessee; Gladys LeBlanc Clark who is a \nCajun weaver from Louisiana; blacksmith Francis Whitaker from \nCarbondale, CO; Hystercine Rankin, a quilter from Lorman, MS; and Ramon \nJose Lopex, a metalsmith from Santa Fe, NM.\n  These honorees will be honored next week at a White House ceremony \nand will perform and celebrate their work. The National Heritage \nFellowships are the Nation's most prestigious recognition of \naccomplishment in the folk and traditional arts. And it is an NEA \nprogram.\n  Another traditional program that owes early and critical support to \nthe NEA is the Cowboy Poets Festival. In the early 1980's Elko, NV, was \nchosen as the site for the Western Folklife Center. It was established \nin the center of the ranching community to celebrate its culture and \nfolk traditions.\n  They approached the NEA for support when corporate sponsors and other \nfunders were hard to come by. With NEA support in 1985, the first \ncowboys festival got underway, with about 60 poets and approximately \n1,000 audience members.\n  Today, corporate supporters join the NEA to support the festival and \nthe center and this year's festival welcomed 8,000 attendees.\n  Support for the folk and traditional arts continues at the Arts \nEndowment. This year the Endowment has funded the Southern Arts \nFederation's ``Southern Connections,'' which is a 2-year training and \ntouring program to support indigenous southern artists.\n  The Endowment also supported the West Virginia Folk Arts \nApprenticeship program; the Creative Arts Guild of Dalton, GA; and the \nAlabama Folklife Association. The grant to Alabama will support the \npublication of documentation of primitive Baptist hymn singing through \na publication, cassette recordings, and compact discs.\n  The Endowment also funded Appalshop, Inc., Roadside Theater in \nWhitesburg, KY. This grant will work with the theater and a consortium \nof the Performing Arts League/Prairie Mountain Players of Choteau, MT, \nand Community Connection of Austin, TX, to develop, test, and document \na nationally applicable model for the creation of rural drama.\n  I hope that, as we debate the appropriate funding level for the \nNational Endowment for the Arts, we can be fair about its record, and \nresponsive to the overwhelming need across America for the programs \nthat the Endowment supports.\n  In many ways, in so many communities, the NEA is a lifeline of \nfinancial stability.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the seemingly relentless attacks of \nthe critics and support the record of the Endowment. Let's support full \nfunding for this small, but worthy, Federal program.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the following is an article written by \nMetropolitan King County Councilman Larry Philips of the fourth \ndistrict and Metropolitan King County Councilwoman Louise Miller of the \nthird district. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Congress Should Embrace Investment in Arts, Culture\n\n                 (By Louise Miller and Larry Phillips)\n\n       ``Democracy demands wisdom and vision in its citizens and * \n     * * must therefore foster and support a form of education, \n     and access to the arts and the humanities, designed to make \n     people of all backgrounds * * * masters of their technology \n     and not its unthinking servant.''--The Declaration of Purpose \n     for the National Foundation of the Arts and Humanities Act of \n     1965.\n       With the establishment of the National Endowment for the \n     Arts (NEA) in 1965, our country has come a long way in \n     achieving the ideal of access to and participation in the \n     arts for all Americans. Today, that ideal is under attack.\n       There has been a movement in Congress to eliminate all \n     public investment in the cultural activities of our nation, \n     specifically, by targeting the NEA. Although funding for the \n     NEA was recently restored by a Senate subcommittee after it \n     had been eliminated by the House, the agency's future remains \n     uncertain. In September, a joint committee of House and \n     Senate members will negotiate the fate of the NEA and the \n     investment we make in our arts and cultural heritage. Is the \n     U.S. to be the only Western nation on earth not to fund its \n     cultural legacy?\n       As elected leaders in King County, we firmly believe that \n     the NEA is a critical investment that helps keep the arts \n     alive and accessible for all residents in our nation and, \n     closer to home, in King County. Why is the NEA so important? \n     With the NEA's support, the King County Arts Commission \n     (KCAC) was created in 1967--the nation's first county arts \n     commission. Since then, an entire ``cultural sector'' has \n     burgeoned in our region, stimulating a stronger economy, \n     enriching our quality of life and enhancing education in the \n     arts.\n       Vital arts organizations and active participation in the \n     arts are increasingly essential to our regional economy. Not \n     only do the arts contribute to our quality of life in the \n     Northwest, but they also generate over $180 million annually \n     to our economy, according to a Corporate Council on the Arts \n     1992 economic impact study. In addition, cultural tourism \n     means big business to our area. When the Seattle Opera \n     presents Wagner's Ring Cycle, it attracts an audience from \n     all 50 states and 18 countries.\n       Opponents of the NEA state that the arts should be funded \n     exclusively through private contributions. This demonstrates \n     a lack of understanding about arts funding. Many private \n     organizations will not make a financial donation to an artist \n     or arts organization unless they have also received grant \n     funding from the NEA or their state or local arts agency. \n     Donations by private corporations, foundations and \n     individuals cannot fill the financial gap that would be \n     created if the NEA were eliminated. In other words, the small \n     percentage of funds contributed by the NEA and public \n     agencies is essential in order for nonprofit arts \n     organizations to leverage donations from private sources.\n\n[[Page S9494]]\n\n       Critics of the NEA have questioned the value of the artwork \n     that has received NEA funds. Let's look at the real picture. \n     In the last three years, over 40 local and regional arts \n     organizations have received $3.1 million in direct NEA grants \n     (equal to about 1 percent of their combined operating \n     budgets). Who are these organizations? They range from major \n     ones like the Seattle Symphony, the Seattle Opera and the \n     Seattle Repertory Theater, so suburban groups like the \n     Village Theater in Issaquah and the Vashon Allied Arts, to \n     youth-centered organizations including the Seattle Youth \n     Symphony Orchestra, the Northwest Girlchoir and Seattle \n     Children's Theater.\n       These organizations reflect the rich diversity of our \n     community and the best work of our finest artists. More \n     importantly, the grant funding helps ensure that the arts--\n     and all the enrichment and joy that they bring--are \n     affordable for the families and young people of our region. A \n     requirement for an arts organization that receives grant \n     funding is to broaden public access to the arts. That may be \n     in the form of reduced ticket prices or special performances \n     for school groups.\n       Another good example of local NEA support is this year's \n     inaugural season of the King County Performance Network, a \n     collaboration between the KCAC and 14 suburban arts agencies. \n     A $60,000 grant from the NEA to the KCAC will help bring \n     outstanding dance ensembles to under-served suburban \n     communities from Redmond to Federal Way beginning Sept. 6. \n     The Performance Network is a good example of the vast \n     majority of projects supported by the NEA: It brings art into \n     the lives of those who may not otherwise have the \n     opportunity.\n       The success of the arts in our region is the result of a \n     strong partnership among the NEA, more than two dozen local \n     governments and nonprofit arts agencies, hundreds of \n     businesses and foundations, and thousands of private \n     citizens. Thanks to this partnership, King County residents \n     enjoy one of the highest cultural participation rates per \n     capita in the nation. With the full participation of the NEA, \n     that partnership is threatened, and the rich cultural \n     environment of our nation and King County will be severely \n     undermined.\n       As we celebrate 30 years of public support of the arts, we \n     strongly believe that public investment for culture and the \n     arts should be strengthened and valued. The partnership we \n     have enjoyed for nearly a generation should be preserved so \n     that today's and tomorrow's citizens may enjoy the cultural \n     heritage and traditions of our region and our nation. As we \n     look toward the future, the county pledges to continue its \n     mission to raise the standard of artistic accomplishment in \n     King County and to broaden cultural opportunities for all our \n     citizens, not merely those who can afford it. Congress should \n     do the same.\n\n  Mr. REED addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I will yield myself such time as is \ncontrolled by the opponents of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3 minutes and 40 seconds controlled \nby those in opposition. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized for \nsuch time.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair.\n  I rise in strong support of the arts. Earlier this afternoon, we were \nable to fend off a frontal asault on the National Endowment by the \nAshcroft amendment. Today we are debating two amendments that would \nalso do great damage to the National Endowment for the Arts.\n  I come to this position with I think a very special standing because \nI have succeeded Senator Claiborne Pell, who was one of the architects \nof the National Endowment for the Arts. Senator Pell recognized that \ncenturies from now this Nation would be recognized far more for its \ncontribution to the human spirit than perhaps anything else. And \nthrough his efforts, the National Endowment was created and through the \nefforts of the National Endowment theater, ballet, and opera has spread \nthroughout this country.\n  One of the fallacies I think that is found in the argument of my \ncolleagues is that the States are quite capable of doing this, they are \nready to do this. But the reality is that before the National Endowment \nfor the Arts there was not much art throughout many parts of this \ncountry, that there were not as there is today opera companies \nthroughout America and theater companies. In fact, if the National \nEndowment for the Arts is eliminated, if this is put into a block \ngrant, I fear, and I think I fear with very, very good evidence, that \nwhat will happen is a shriveling of the arts in America.\n  Many of us have been in State government. We know that there is no \nmonopoly on great wisdom or aesthetic sensibility at the State level, \nno more so than at the Federal level. We know that this money might be \nill used. But we also know that it will be subject to a much more \nnarrower and parochial focus. We have within the National Endowment a \nnational vision, a national vision, though, that acts through local \nindividuals, and that is what is critical also.\n  The National Endowment is not running a great national theater here \nin Washington exclusively. But what it is doing is reaching into every \ncorner of America and giving people an opportunity to appreciate and \nparticipate in the arts. In my home State of Rhode Island, we have \ntheater companies that are supported by the NEA. We have educational \nprograms that allow young children to witness the arts. Indeed, the \nfirst time I ever saw a play was as a grammar school student in \nCranston, RI, when I went to see the Trinity Repertory Company, \nsupported by the National Endowment, by Federal support, put on ``Saint \nJoan'' by George Bernard Shaw. That was a moving experience. And that \nexperience is replicated every day throughout this country because of \nthe National Endowment.\n  In addition to contributing to the artistic quality of America, this \nagency has generated tremendous economic development and progress \nthroughout the country. In my own State, its contribution to the arts \nhas been multiplied in terms of the economic effect. Providence, \nparticularly, has become a city that is proud of our arts, that has \nthriving companies that need the National Endowment, not just for \naesthetic reasons but for good, solid economic reasons. And by \neliminating the National Endowment, or by block granting its funds, we \nwill, I think, dissipate that energy, that enthusiasm, and that \nachievement we have seen today.\n  The arts are not only a source of pleasure, but in many cases a \nsource of great economic progress, particularly in my home State of \nRhode Island. So, for many, many reasons, I believe that these \namendments, while well intentioned, will undercut what is a strong \nnational policy to support the arts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. May I inquire how much time opponents of the \namendment have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the opponents has expired. The \nproponents control 4 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I will take just a few minutes that we \nhave remaining to respond to some of the statements made by the \nopponents of the amendment. I remind Senator Reed, incidentally, the \nState of Rhode Island would gain $123,000 in additional funds for arts \nspending in Rhode Island under the block grant amendment that Senator \nSessions and myself have offered. I remind each Senator that they can \ncheck on their desks here in the Senate Chamber exactly how much, but \n45 States will receive more funds under this amendment to support the \narts within their own States.\n  I was interested that Senator Reed spoke of the shriveling of the \narts. If we take this pittance, this relative pittance, in view of the \nFederal budget, of $100 million and we remove that National Endowment \nfunding, that national entity, that somehow the arts in this country \nwould begin to shrivel. I think, in all due respect, the Senator from \nRhode Island underestimates the American people, underestimates the \narts community in the United States, and underestimates how much the \narts flourish today without a huge injection of Federal funds.\n  As an example, the Metropolitan Opera, which has a total income of \n$133 million, the Lyric Opera, which has an annual income of $37 \nmillion, the Boston Symphony, which has an annual income of $43 \nmillion, and the Art Institute of Chicago, which has an annual income \nof $96 million--all of them receiving NEA grants. Most of these wealthy \norganizations experienced significant cuts in NEA funding in the last 2 \nyears. Yet, in spite of those cuts in NEA funding, each one reported \ndramatic increases in total income in 1996. The point being that even \nas funding cuts in the NEA have occurred, arts in this country have \ncontinued to flourish.\n  But I will tell you what is offensive to me. What is offensive to me \nis that the Metropolitan Opera is getting an NEA grant. What is \noffensive to me is\n\n[[Page S9495]]\n\nthe Boston Symphony, with a $43 million income, is getting an NEA \ngrant, while the Opera Theater in Wildwood, in Little Rock, AR, got \n$4,000. The mission of the NEA was to broadly increase access to the \narts. That is not what is happening. Mr. President, 85 percent of the \ngrantees in the last fiscal year have been previous recipients of NEA \nfunds. That is not increasing access to the arts.\n\n  So I suggest that, if we really care about the arts, removing the \nWashington bureaucracy, sending the money to the States, allowing those \nclosest to the people to make those decisions, will be far wiser and \nfar more productive for arts in this country.\n  I have raised great issues as to the priorities of the National \nEndowment, the decisions they are making. The State of Arkansas--you \nknow, I heard Senator Dodd. I have the greatest respect for him.\n  Mr. REED. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I will be glad to yield, but let me finish my point. \nI have the greatest respect for Senator Dodd, but he spoke of, ``Let's \nnot concentrate on the few bad grants, let's concentrate on the 100,000 \ngood grants.'' When he said that, I thought about Arkansas, because we \ngot one last year. We made 12 applications and we received 1, for the \nArts Council in Arkansas.\n  So I have great questions about the priorities. In Arkansas, the NEA \nspent 17 cents for every man, woman and child in Arkansas; 17 cents. In \nNew York State the NEA spent $1 for every man, woman and child in New \nYork State.\n  I'm sorry, everybody says, ``Give the NEA a chance.'' We have given \nthem chance after chance after chance. Year after year these objections \nand these concerns have been raised. We see no reform. We see no \nchange. Instead we see arrogant elitism. And I say it is time to end \nthe NEA. Don't end support for the arts--no. But end this Washington \nbureaucracy, send that money back so Rhode Island will have another \n$123,000, so Arkansas will have another $700,000, so Alabama him have \nanother half-million dollars, so the States all over this country can \ndo more for those artists, for those schoolchildren who, too often, \nfall through the cracks.\n  I believe that the amendment that we have offered makes eminent \ncommon sense.\n  I will be glad to yield to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I would say you have trotted out some impressive statistics \nabout income as a measure of the wealth of these artistic enterprises \nlike the Metropolitan, but the other side of the equation is their \ncost. Many of these institutions, even the famous ones, find it very \ndifficult to make ends meet.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Reclaiming my time, I will just say, if you check \neach one of these institutions, they are well endowed, they have good \nsupport and good sources of income and the dependence upon any kind of \nNEA grant, I think, is simply not justifiable. If you are looking at \nthe Boston Symphony, the Art Institute of Chicago, with the kind of \nsupport base that they have, and compare them--\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1206\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired on this amendment.\n  We will now proceed with amendment No. 1206, the Abraham amendment. \nBy previous agreed-upon order, there will be 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided between the sides. Who seeks recognition? The Senator \nfrom Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I will quickly summarize. My amendment is \ndesigned to accomplish two things: To begin an effort to privatize the \nNEA so it can be as large as it wants to be and as liberated from the \nstrings which Congress has attached to it as it wants to be. I believe \nthis is feasible and I think it would take away from us, finally and \nonce and for all, this ongoing debate between obscenity and censorship. \nLet the arts be free and creative and at the discretion of an \nindependent entity. At the same time, my amendment would provide new \nfunding to try to maintain and restore such treasures as the Star \nSpangled Banner, the works of our great composers, Presidential papers, \nEllis Island, and Mount Rushmore.\n  By moving in this direction, if my amendment passes, I will be \noffering a sense-of-the-Senate amendment which would incorporate the \nprivatization concept, and then begin working on a variety of \nmechanisms by which I believe we in Congress can legislatively assist a \nprivate entity to thrive and be successful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the National Endowment for the Arts has \nserved this Nation well for many, many years. There are things that we \ncan do to improve its performance, but the wholesale scuttling of the \nNational Endowment would, I think, be a mistake. I believe that we can \nmake improvements but we cannot give up the vision of a national agency \nwhich reaches into every corner of this country to encourage and \ninspire the artistic excellence of the American people. By supporting \nthe NEA, we can accomplish that. I believe these amendments would \ndisrupt that support, and, therefore, I oppose them and request that my \ncolleagues oppose them.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nNo. 1206.

I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. In just a few minutes I will propound a unanimous-consent \nrequest. I had hoped we would be able to finish the interior \nappropriations bill by tonight. We have not been able to do so because \nof a number of conflicts and amendments that have been offered.\n  Senator Daschle and I have tried to move it along and we have not \nbeen able to do so yet. I understand that Senators still have some \namendments they would like to offer. We have one more vote pending \ntonight which has already been called for.\n  I believe the next amendment then would be the Hutchinson amendment. \nI will ask unanimous consent that we have a time limit of about 20 \nminutes,\n\n[[Page S9496]]\n\nand that we do that vote at 9:30 in the morning. I will also ask that \nwe get a list of amendments tonight to see what we are dealing with, to \nbegin to close this out. I don't think we have that many problems, but \nbecause of the length of time that we have put into the amendments we \nhave already voted on, a number of Senators would like to see this list \nand work through it in the morning.\n  Again, I hope we can work together to get it done. We could have as \nmany as five votes tonight--could have. You know, one of these days we \nmay have to do that. But in view of the circumstances, since we seem to \nbe contributing to some of the problems, and everybody has tried to \nwork in good faith, I think the better part of valor tonight would be \nto have this one last vote and get the UC, and we would begin votes \nagain in the morning. Is there any comment on that from the minority \nleader?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the majority leader's \nconsideration of schedules. I do hope that all Senators will cooperate. \nWe have had good debate on the NEA and I hope we can get it behind us. \nWe have a lot of other issues and they all deserve some consideration.\n  I hope we can create a finite list tonight and reach some agreement \nabout what that list is so that we can complete our work, hopefully, \ntomorrow. So I ask for the cooperation of all of our colleagues on my \nside of the aisle in an effort to get that finite list so we can \ncontinue our work and, hopefully, complete it by the end of the day \ntomorrow.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, following the \namendment remaining to be voted on, the next amendment in order to the \nInterior appropriations bill be the Hutchinson amendment, and that the \nvote on that would occur at--we would begin debate at 9:30 in the \nmorning with 20 minutes, equally divided, before the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I further ask unanimous consent that, following the \namendments, we have a list that would be the only remaining amendments \nin order to the Interior appropriations bill, and that they be offered \nin the first or second degree on this list.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in light of that somewhat haphazard \nunanimous consent request, there will be no further votes tonight. \nMembers are urged to get their amendments offered. We will begin voting \nat 9:30 a.m.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1187\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, on amendment No. 1187, the \nHutchinson amendment, which had been previously agreed to.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I thank Senator Sessions, Senator \nAshcroft, and Senator Abraham for their work on behalf of this \namendment. It does not change the appropriations for the arts; it is \n$100 million, block granted to the States. There is a chart down in the \nwell. Everybody has seen what their State will do. Forty-five States \nwill have more resources for arts funding under this amendment.\n  The National Endowment has simply failed on their mission to broaden \npublic access to the arts. One-third of the congressional districts in \nthis country get zero from the National Endowment for the Arts. One-\nthird of the funding of the NEA goes to six cities. This is unfair.\n  The issue is simply local control. The issue is more resources for \nart. I ask my fellow Senators to say ``yes'' to more resources for art \nand to say ``no'' to Washington bureaucrats and support this amendment. \nIt means more money for your States to help on those local arts \nprojects.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second?\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition? Is all time \nyielded back?\n  All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I announce that the Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 37, nays 62, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 245 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--37\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Coats\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     DeWine\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n\n                                NAYS--62\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Grams\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Sarbanes\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     McCain\n       \n  The amendment (No. 1187) was rejected.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1204\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1204.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 1204 is before the Senate.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, this is an amendment that basically \nseeks to preserve tribal Indian land as a cemetery and burial ground in \nKansas City, KA. It is a very contentious issue there. But this is and \nhas been an Indian burial ground since 1855. There are plans to put a \ncasino on it now. This is being contested. But clearly the land should \nremain a tribal ancestral land. We put forth this amendment to do that.\n  I believe we have consent from all sides and all parties for this \namendment to be agreed to.\n  I would like to yield to the Senator from Colorado for a brief \nstatement in that regard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, thank you.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the time, and my colleague from Kansas \nallowing me to speak to this a little bit today.\n  Yesterday, we had a very extended debate here on the floor of the \nSenate, and several of us took the opportunity to address this Nation's \nshameful history in its dealings with American Indians. One of the \nareas that is the most shameful is the history of failing to abide by \nits treaties and agreements with native tribes.\n  This country, as you know, Mr. President, coming from a State that \nhas so many Indian tribes, has had very little respect for the lands \nand rights of aboriginal people, including the rights of the Wyandotte \nTribe in question today.\n  For example, in 1966 the Congress enacted a law requiring the \nWyandotte cemetery be transferred and sold. That law is still on the \nbooks, fortunately. The tribe, however, opposed the action and the \ncemetery was not sold. In this respect, the tribe was seeking to \npreserve its burial site, culture, and history at a time when the \nUnited States was ignoring the tribe's rights.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, being the chairman of the Committee on Indian \nAffairs, I find nothing more distasteful to me than to referee \nintertribal fights. Those disagreements often pit family against \nfamily, brother against brother, sister against sister. But I feel \ncompelled to speak out in support of the Brownback amendment today.\n  Let me try and ferret through this as I understand it. We have two \ntribes linked by culture, linked by history, linked genetically, \nprobably linguistically, too. The Oklahoma Wyandottes have trust title, \nalthough this is being\n\n[[Page S9497]]\n\ncontested as I understand in Federal court and also being dealt with in \nthe Department of the Interior.\n  The focal point is a cemetery. The Indians that have control of the \ncemetery, i.e., they have kept it up and taken care of it, are the \nKansas Wyandottes. This cemetery, as Senator Brownback has said, has \nbeen a burial place for predominantly Indians ever since 1855, 140 \nyears.\n  Now, the Oklahoma Wyandottes want to build a casino on this cemetery. \nThat in itself is very interesting to me, Mr. President, because those \nof us who live on reservations, who come from Indian country, we have \nknown literally since childhood the reverence, the feeling that Indians \nhave about burial places. Most of the time, regardless of years, they \ndon't call them cemeteries. They call them holy places or burial \nplaces. They consider them places that should be undisturbed, treated \nwith reverence, and very seriously. I pity the construction company \nthat would ever try to build a high rise or a roadway or something of \nthat nature through an Indian burial ground because they do have laws \non the books, we have laws on the books right now dealing with Indian \nburial places that prevent construction in those areas.\n  Well, very simply, Mr. President, just because they are Indian, they \ncan't have it both ways, and it would seem to me there are many \nquestions that are left unanswered if we try to make a policy change on \nan appropriations bill. For instance, we have not, to my knowledge, \nheard from the State of Kansas. Under the 1988 IGRA any tribe that \nwants to build a casino or open a casino within a State has to reach \nsome kind of understanding with the State, not to exceed the State law \nin non-Indian owned casinos. To my knowledge, they have not done this. \nWe have not heard, to my knowledge, from anybody at Huron who would be \naffected. We have haven't heard from people in the local communities, \nthe citizens who are going to be affected or the mayor of Kansas City. \nWe simply do not know, if we do pass this into law, how it would affect \nthe ongoing litigation. I simply think it is the wrong vehicle.\n  Now, I am not familiar beyond that with the circumstances of this \ncase, but I think that we could be doing ourselves a disservice by not \nhaving the supporters of this, that is, the opponents of the Brownback \namendment, bring it forward as a legislative piece of paper where we \ncan deal with it in legislative committees. I am not aware of any bill \nbeing introduced to that effect either.\n  So I would go on record, Mr. President, as saying that my feeling \nfrom a historical and cultural standpoint is this should continue to be \nused what it was originally used for, and that's basically what the \nBrownback amendment does. But no Congress is bound by the action of a \nprevious Congress. We all know that. So if at later date a future \nCongress, whether it is the 106th, the 108th or whatever, feels it \nshould reverse that because of something we don't know and do it by \nlegislative action, then that's the way it should be done.\n  Now, they tell me that the Wyandottes of Oklahoma were only informed \nas late as last week of the Brownback amendment, but by the same token \nmany supporters of the Brownback amendment didn't know of the original \nlanguage in this bill until the last couple of days. So I think they \nare on a level playing field from that standpoint.\n  With that, Mr. President, I simply say I hope my colleagues would \nsupport the Brownback amendment. I yield the floor. I thank you.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, as the vice chairman of the Committee on \nIndian Affairs, I feel that I must object to this amendment.\n  However meritorious its intent may be, it seems to me that there are \nserious legal ramifications to the proposal that we have not had an \nopportunity to evaluate.\n  As Americans, we have come to rely on the constitutional protections \nthat are accorded to property rights under the law.\n  One of those rights is to be free in the use and enjoyment of our \nproperty--provided of course that our uses of property do not present \nany danger to the health or safety of the public.\n  Even when land is held in trust by the United States for an Indian \ntribe, the principal restriction on the use of trust property is a \nrestriction against alienation.\n  In the modern era of self-governance and self-determination, this \nGovernment has long since abandoned the paternalistic stance of \ndictating to the tribes the details of everyday life on reservations.\n  The principle which informs the fifth amendment to our Constitution--\nthat there will be no taking of property without just compensation--is \nprecisely why we have spent so much time debating the issue of \nfederally imposed land restrictions in the Congress.\n  The Wyandotte Tribe of Oklahoma has owned the Huron Cemetery--held \nbeneficial title to the Huron cemetery as a function of an 1867 \ntreaty--for 130 years.\n  And yet today, without the benefit of a hearing or any public \nconsideration--and importantly--without the benefit of any consultation \nwith the Wyandotte Tribe of Oklahoma, we are being asked to impose a \nrestriction on the tribe's use of its own land.\n  Mr. President, I am not aware that there is any emergency at stake \nhere.\n  I know of no reason why we must take this precipitous action on an \nappropriations bill.\n  I believe if the good gentleman from Kansas were to introduce his \namendment as authorizing legislation, we could all have the benefit of \nthe kind of information that can be gathered in a formal hearing.\n  We could be apprised of what legal liabilities may flow from the \nproposed amendment.\n  The Wyandotte Tribe of Oklahoma can be afforded the due process of \nlaw which our Constitution guarantees to all Americans, before the \nSenate of the United States decides to dictate to this tribe, the \nmanner in which it can use its property.\n  Mr. President, I would be remiss if I were to fail to seize this \nopportunity to suggest that were we to adopt this amendment without the \nbenefit of any hearings or any assessment of its impact--both as a \nlegal matter and as a matter of policy--we will be establishing a \nprecedent that we ought to think very carefully about.\n  Are we going to vest ourselves with the responsibility of micro-\nmanaging the use of tribal lands across this Nation--50 million acres \nof land?\n  Are we going to return to the days when this Government told the \nIndians that we were the ``Great White Father''--and we would decide \nwhat was best for them?\n  I, for one, will not go down that road, and I hope that my colleagues \nwill not do so either, until and unless, there is some overwhelming and \ncompelling reason for doing do.\n  Personally, I don't believe that the use of the Huron cemetery by the \nWyandotte Tribe of Oklahoma presents that compelling a case--nor do I \nknow why we would or should address this matter today.\n  Mr. President, let us proceed cautiously and deliberately, as the \nAmerican public desires us to do--let us examine carefully what is at \nissue, and take action, only after we have done so, and only after we \nare informed of all of the facts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Is there further debate on the \namendment?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I urge adoption of the amendment, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Kansas.\n  The amendment (No. 1204) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Indian Provisions\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am delighted that a compromise was reached yesterday on \nSections 118 and 120 to the Interior Appropriations bill. As a Senator \nfor California and as a citizen, I am greatly relieved that these two \nprovisions will no longer endanger the rights of our Nation's Indian \ntribes.\n  Sections 118 and 120 would have directly violated the bargain struck \nbetween the United States and Indian tribes over a century ago. In \nhundreds of treaties, the United States agreed to make payments to \nIndian tribes in exchange for nearly 100 million acres of\n\n[[Page S9498]]\n\ntribal lands. Section 118, which would have imposed a means test on \nthese payments, violates both the letter and the spirit of these \ncontracts. The result would have been to impose a penalty against \ntribal governments for improving services for their citizens and trying \nto achieve self-sufficiency.\n  Section 120 would have gone even further in violating the promises \nthe United States made to the tribes. It would have required tribes to \nchoose between the payments promised to them and their inherent right \nto sovereign immunity, a right acknowledged in the United States \nConstitution.\n  The United States has a long history of recognizing tribes as \nsovereign entities. As early as 1895, the United States Court of \nAppeals for the 8th Circuit ruled that tribal sovereign immunity from \nlawsuit is analogous to state sovereign immunity, which is protected by \nthe 11th Amendment to the Constitution. Section 120 would have ignored \nthis history and stripped tribes of their Constitutional right to \nsovereign immunity without due process.\n  Sections 118 and 120 would have also significantly undermined the \nefforts of our Indian tribes to improve the quality of life for their \npeople. Tribal Priority Allocations are funds targeted at addressing \nthe most critical areas of need among our Nation's Native Americans. \nWithout these funds, many tribes would be unable to pay for essential \nservices, such as public schools, health care, social services, law \nenforcement, and road maintenance.\n  Ironically, Section 120 would not have affected the few tribes that \nare economically able to forgo federal funding. Only the most dependent \ntribes, those suffering most from poverty, would have been forced to \ntrade their sovereign status for Federal support they desperately need \nto survive. The effect would have been the creation of two disparate \nclasses of tribes, those who could afford to be sovereign and those who \ncould not.\n  Sections 118 and 120 would have had a particularly harmful effect in \nmy State. In California, there are 104 federally recognized tribes, and \nover 250,000 Native Americans, who would be financially and emotionally \ndevastated had this provision become law. The vast majority of tribes \ndesperately need Federal funds for daily survival. One third of all \nNative Americans live below the poverty level. Nearly half of all \nNative Americans living on reservations are unemployed. Of those who do \nwork, almost a third earn less than $7,000 per year. Those Indian \nbusinesses that are experiencing any measure of success are just now \nbeginning to create jobs and economic opportunity. To take away funding \nnow for essential services like public schools and health care would \nhave destroyed any chance for self-sufficiency for many tribes.\n  We must also keep in mind the potentially devastating effect Section \n120 would have had on our Federal courts. Our Federal court system is \nalready severely overburdened, a situation magnified by the 97 \nvacancies that plague our Federal judiciary. Chief Judge Proctor Hug of \nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals recently reported that he was forced \nto cancel more than 600 civil cases due to the shortage of judges. This \nalready overburdened system could not absorb the thousands of cases \nthat would have potentially flooded our Federal courts had tribes been \nstripped of their sovereign immunity. At a minimum, such a far-reaching \nproposal should be subject to the careful, deliberative process of the \nproper authorizing committees.\n  For all of these reasons, I was, and continue to be, strongly opposed \nto Sections 118 and 120 and I am happy to see them removed from the \nbill.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Interior \nappropriations bill. I commend the chairman and ranking member for \ndeveloping a bill that provides a number of benefits to the people of \nthe Nation and, particularly, the people of the Pacific Northwest. I \nwant to highlight some of the bill's strengths and weaknesses.\n\n\n                           forest road policy\n\n  I voted in favor of the amendment offered by my colleague, Senator \nBryan, on forest road funding and purchaser road credits. I did so in \nresponse to the enormous outpouring of public opposition to the current \nroad-building policies of the Forest Service. Everyplace I've gone in \nrecent months, I have been approached by average citizens--not just \nenvironmental activists--and urged to slow new road construction and \nstop subsidies to timber companies. Editorial boards across my State \nand the Nation have said now is the time for a change in the road \nbuilding policies of the Forest Service. I agree.\n  However, this has been a difficult decision for me. My top forest \npriority is full implementation of the President's forest plan, \nincluding meeting timber production goals. A severe cut in road \nconstruction and reconstruction might have impacted the Forest \nService's ability to meet all of the plan's objectives. However, I have \nbeen assured by the administration that the Northwest forest plan \nremains a top priority and it will not be affected by the $10 million \ncut in road construction proposed by the Bryan amendment. The \nadministration believes it can minimize the impact of these cuts on the \ntimber program throughout the country, but will make the scientifically \nvalidated Northwest forest plan a priority.\n  Despite my strong and continuing support for the Northwest forest \nplan, I am concerned about the Forest Service's policies on roadless \nareas. The scientific assessment recently completed for the Interior \nColumbia Basin ecosystem management project demonstrates the importance \nof roadless areas for fish, wildlife, water quality, and ecosystem \nhealth. Thus, I believe we should only build news roads into large \nroadless areas infrequently and with great care and full environmental \nanalysis.\n  That said, I continue to be a strong supporter of multiple use, \nincluding timber harvest, on our Nation's national forests. I cannot \nfathom why some want to prohibit harvest of second growth timber of \nForest Service land. Timber harvest not only provides needed jobs and \nwood products, but in some cases it can improve the health of timber \nstands and reduce the risk of devastating wildfire.\n  I intend to work with the administration to improve our road-building \npolicies, reduce subsidies, protect vital watersheds, and ensure \necologically healthy systems remain strong. I do not support \nelimination of all new roads, because roads are necessary for timber \nharvest. But we must stop subsidies and/or the appearance of subsidies \nby revamping the agency's accounting systems and ensuring our Nation's \npublic lands are managed as economically viably as possible.\n\n\n                              log exports\n\n  I want to explain why I believe the provisions in this bill regarding \nlog export restrictions make good environmental and economic policy. As \nmany of my colleagues know, the issue of log exports is very \ncontentious. The battle over log export policy has raged in the Pacific \nNorthwest for years. We first passed a comprehensive log export bill in \n1990. Since then Congress has revisited that law in 1992, briefly in \n1996, and again this year. The USDA Forest Service issued regulations \nin 1995 that would have seriously impacted the entire timber economy of \nthe Northwest. Those regulations precipitated a demand by Senator \nGorton for those Washington State entities impacted by log export \npolicy to develop legislation they could all support. That was a tall \norder, but this legislation embodies the best compromise that could \nbe developed. Let met explain what these provisions do.\n\n  First, this bill imposes a permanent ban on the export of all logs \ncut from State lands. My home State of Washington has been the biggest \nexporter of public timber in the Nation. However, under the compromise \nlaw Congress passed in 1990, no timber from State land could be \nexported for the first 5 years of the law. Those 5 years have passed, \nso the State ban on log export will--on October 1--be lifted and the \nexisting law will prohibit the export of only 400 million board feet, \nof a total sale program of 650 million board feet. That means without \nthis bill, 250 million board feet will go overseas without domestic \nprocessing. That means jobs would be lost in rural America and our \nregion's forests would be cut without gaining their highest economic \nvalue.\n  Second, this bill also protects the private property rights and \nvalues of both industrial and family tree farmers. Without these \nprovisions, a timber grower whose land was located next to a sawmill \nthat uses Federal timber could not sell his or her trees to that \nsawmill if that sawmill also used Federal timber. That limitation does \nnot\n\n[[Page S9499]]\n\nencourage domestic processing of timber--one of the original goals of \nthe 1990, and this, legislation. In addition, the proposed agency \nregulations that this legislation will correct would have required all \nprivate timber owners to brand each and every tree cut on his or her \nland. It is simply bad policy and does not encourage landowners to keep \ntheir lands in timber production instead of selling them off for \ndevelopment.\n  Third, some have objected to the so-called buyer-broker provision \nsaying its guts existing log export law. This provision allows a third \nparty sawmill owner that uses Federal timber also to purchase private \ntimber from another company or individual and export a portion and \nprocess a portion of that timber. This allows a timber purchaser both \nto supply an American sawmill and pay the landowner the highest price \nfor the trees. Currently, the State of Washington has very similar \npolicy instituted in its log export regulations--and the ban on State \nlog export has worked, by all accounts, very well. This provision \nprovides necessary flexibility and will likely lead to more private \ntimber being processed domestically than would otherwise occur. And, \nlet me be clear, under this bill, a private company that grows timber \non its own land still cannot export that timber from the same area in \nwhich it purchases Federal timber.\n  Finally, this provision will hopefully bring closure to log export \npolicy. I--and the vast majority of the public--support a permanent ban \non the export of unprocessed timber from public lands. Most of us would \nalso like to encourage greater processing of private timber. This \nprovision provides the tools to accomplish these goals. It is the right \neconomic and the right environmental policy.\n\n\n               export of forest service alaska red cedar\n\n  I have offered an amendment that I hope will be accepted under \nunanimous consent regarding the domestic processing of Alaska red cedar \nfrom National Forests in Alaska. Alaska is a unique place. When most of \nus think of exporting a product, we think of exporting it out of the \nUnited States. In Alaska, a product is exported if it leaves Alaska--\neven if that product goes to the lower 48 States.\n  Thus, on the Tongass National Forest, Western red cedar is first \noffered to Alaska timber purchasers. However, there is no market or no \ncapacity to manufacture this species in Alaska, so it has been declared \na ``surplus species.'' As a surplus species, these fine, scarce logs \ncan be sold on the long export market to Asian buyers. While American \ncompanies are certainly free to purchase these public logs, they must \npay the significantly higher prices offered on the export market. In \nthe lower 48 States, Western red cedar is very much in demand.\n  Under my amendment, these national logs must be offered at domestic \nprices to mills in the lower 48 States. My amendment requires the \nForest Service to establish a three-tiered policy giving Alaskans first \npriority, other American companies next priority, and only if no one \nwants these logs--which is highly unlikely--may they be exported.\n  The current policy must be remedied. I hope my amendment will be \naccepted.\n\n\n                    land and water conservation fund\n\n  This bill provides critical funding for important land acquisition \nwithin the Pacific Northwest. The Columbia Gorge National Scenic Area \nwill receive $8 million to purchase land to protect the ecological and \nscenic values in the gorge. It includes funds to acquire land and \ndevelop a trail along Cape Horn, one of the most beautiful areas on the \nWashington side of the gorge. Outside of the gorge, we appropriated \n$1.5 million for vital wetlands along the Black River in Thurston \nCounty. This unique, spring-fed river contains lands threatened by the \ngrowing population around Olympia and Tacoma.\n  I am very excited by the commitment Chairman Gorton has made to help \nsecure funding to purchase the Elwha and Glines Canyon dams with land \nand water conservation funds. The acquisition and removal of the Glines \nCanyon and Elwha dams have been a priority of mine since I was elected \nin 1992. So far, we have $8 million authorized to purchase both dams \nfrom Diashowa Co. for a total of $29.5 million. It appears we can tap \nsome of the $700 million allocated for LWCF purchases this year to \nacquire both dams and begin the process of removing one dam and \nrestoring the outstanding salmon fisheries in this Olympic National \nPark River.\n\n\n                      recreational trails funding\n\n  I also support the increased funding for trails contained in this \nbill. Recreational use of our national forests has increased almost \nevery year since the 1950's. This year, we added $3.5 million to the \nPresident's already high budget request for Forest Service trails \nmaintenance in Washington and Oregon. These dollars desperately needed \nto keep our beautiful forests accessible, disperse forest users, and \nprotect the forest system.\n\n\n                                title vi\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I rise for a brief colloquy with the manager of the bill. \nFirst, I would like to commend the Senator from Washington for his hard \nwork on title VI of this bill. Title VI, which includes the forest \nresources conservation and shortage relief provisions, represents a \nconsiderable amount of effort. The title is a thoughtful attempt to \nresolve a very complex issue in an equitable fashion. The title is \nnecessary because of difficulties caused by the administration \nregulations restricting the movement of logs across different \njurisdictions. However, because the provisions of the title are so \ncomplex and involve so many intensely disputed issues, I would hope we \nwould use the next year as a time for testing the provisions in the \ntitle and securing additional comments from all interested parties. We \ncan evaluate how successful the provisions are, and develop any \nnecessary changes together with other interested Senators over the \ncourse of the next year. I ask my colleague from Washington whether he \nagrees that we should look at the following year as a test period for \nthis measure so that we can together evaluate any needed changes.\n  Mr. GORTON. I fully understand the concerns that have been raised \nabout these provisions. As is the case with any measure developed over \na long process, there are parts of this title which will not please \neveryone. I believe my proposal represents the most comprehensive \nsolution possible given this issue's complexity. While I sincerely hope \nthat we do not have to revisit this issue again next year, it is \ncertainly appropriate to look at the next year as a test period, to \nevaluate how well the provision works, and to assess what changes, if \nany, are necessary. I commit to my colleague from Idaho that I will \nwork with him and other interested Senators and parties to this end.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I also would like to commend the Senator from \nWashington for his diligence in pursuing a solution to this issue. I \nwould be pleased to work with the Senators from Washington and Idaho on \nthis effort to evaluate how well this provision works, and to consider \nthe need for any changes.\n\n\n        FUNDING FOR RENOVATION OF MONTEZUMA CREEK HEALTH CLINIC\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as the Senate considers the Interior \nappropriations bill, H.R. 2107, I want to comment briefly about a small \nbut very important provision in the bill that will provide $100,000 in \nFederal money to renovate the Montezuma Creek Health Clinic in \nMontezuma Creek, Ut.\n  The Montezuma Creek Clinic is located in the rural community of \nMontezuma Creek in the southeastern part of Utah in San Juan County. \nThis community serves as the population center for the eastern portion \nof the Utah Navajo region which is home to more than 6,000 Navajos who \nlive on and around the Navajo Reservation.\n  This area also has one of the most critical health care shortages in \nUtah and, in fact, in the entire region of the western United States.\n  Located in the heart of this community is the Montezuma Creek Health \nClinic which was initially operated by the Indian Health Service [IHS] \nto serve the Navajo population.\n  Today, the clinic principally serves the 6,000 Navajos as well as the \nnon-Indian population who live in southeast Utah and northeast Arizona. \nThe clinic is presently operated in a cooperative effort between the \nUtah Navajo trust fund as the owners of the clinic facility, the San \nJuan County Health Care Services as the county provider of\n\n[[Page S9500]]\n\nhealth services, and the IHS which provides contract support services.\n  It is ironic that there is only one IHS facility located in the \nentire State of Utah when neighboring States have as many as a dozen or \nmore facilities each. The only IHS facility in Utah is an outpatient \nfacility at Fort Duchesne which is located over 350 miles away.\n  It is obvious that the health care needs for this segment of the Utah \nNative American population are greatly under-served.\n  For over 3 years, I have worked with the IHS, the Utah Navajo trust \nfund, the State of Utah, the Aneth Chapter of the Navajo Nation, San \nJuan County and many other concerned parties in an effort to improve \nthe delivery of health care for the residents of this community.\n  Unfortunately, it has not been an easy task.\n  The Federal budgetary pressures on facility construction projects \nwithin the IHS budget have prevented federal dollars for the \nconstruction of a new Facility at Montezuma Creek.\n  Moreover, the current IHS facility's priority list--which includes \nconstruction funding for projects on the priority list--has as a \npractical matter precluded the addition of new facilities for Utah. \nThis is very unfortunate for the community of Montezuma Creek. It seems \nthat Utah has always been short-changed when it comes to IHS and IHS-\nrelated health care services in our State.\n  And, I would remind my colleagues that the health status of Utah \nNavajos living in San Juan County is lower than the Utah Native \nAmerican population in general which, overall, is even lower than the \nNative American population as a whole.\n  In spite of the difficulties, the Montezuma Creek Clinic continues to \noperate and provide life saving health care services to the community \nalbeit in the facility that is clearly outdated and in need of \nrenovation.\n  Although the facility is functional, it is in poor condition and \ninadequate for the provision of needed services to the 65 to 110 \npatients served on a daily basis. In addition, there is a need to bring \nthe facility into compliance with modern building codes for medical \nfacilities.\n  Accordingly, I am delighted that the Interior bill contains Federal \nfunds in the amount of $100,000 for design and construction purposes in \nrenovating the existing facility.\n  Moreover, these funds will be matched dollar for dollar by the State \nof Utah and the Utah Navajo trust fund to collectively bring the total \nto $300,000. It is my hope that the Federal commitment of $100,000 will \nalso prompt private contributions from those national corporations \noperating in San Juan County. I believe with the collective support and \nbacking of all parties we will be able to set in motion much needed \nimprovements in health care for the residents of Montezuma Creek.\n  I also want to thank my good friend and colleague from Utah, Senator \nBennett who, as a member of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, \nwas extremely helpful in securing these funds for this project.\n  Moreover, let me thank the distinguished chairman of the Interior \nSubcommittee, Senator Gorton, for agreeing to this modest request and \nincluding it in the bill.\n  I must say that I am delighted we are finally able to help this \nclinic.\n  A great deal of time and effort has been devoted by many people in \nsecuring both the needed money and the cooperative arrangements for \ncarrying-out this project.\n  In addition to Senator Bennett and Senator Gorton, I want to thank \nJudy Edwards with the Utah Department of Health, Ed Alter who serves as \nChairman of the Utah Navajo trust fund in which the combined funding \nwill be deposited, Mark Maryboy with the Aneth Chapter of the Navajo \nNation--Utah--and Donna Singer with the Montezuma Creek Clinic.\n  I look forward to working with these individuals and others in the \nmonths ahead on the long needed renovation of Montezuma Creek Clinic.\n\n\n                  AMERICAN HERITAGE RIVERS INITIATIVE\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, the American Heritage Rivers \nInitiative [AHRI] was first announced by President Clinton in his State \nof the Union address to provide federal support to communities \nundertaking river restoration projects through improved access to \nfederal resources and by encouraging private sector support for local \nefforts.\n  An interagency team led by the Council on Environmental Quality [CEQ] \nwas established. The CEQ formally announced the program in the May 19, \n1997, Federal Register. The Federal Register announcement stated that \nthe goal of the AHRI was to address a ``need for concerted, long-term \nefforts in water quality improvement, river restoration, and economic \nrevitalization within and along the river.'' Under the proposed rule, \nany person or community may nominate a river or entire watershed for \ndesignation by the Administration.\n  I, like many of my Colleagues, have concerns about this initiative. \nFor one thing, those who could be affected by such a proposal have not \nhad sufficient time or opportunity to comment. Second, Members of \nCongress have not received a detailed briefing from the administration \non how this plan is to be carried out. It appears that the \nadministration has completely circumvented the affected public and \nCongress in an effort to implement the AHRI.\n  I have concerns about where the funding and staff necessary to run \nthis program will come from. In a time where budgets are constrained \nand the Federal Government is required to do more with less, it is \ndifficult to support increased funding for a proposal initiated by the \nadministration and where Congress has been left out of the \nimplementation strategy.\n  A while back I co-signed a letter to the administration outlining our \nconcerns with this proposal, and to request an extension of the public \ncomment period for an additional 120 days which was granted, and \nexpired on August 20. I signed a second letter from the Idaho \ndelegation to Ms. Katy McGinty, CEQ Chair.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 5, 1997.\n     Hon. Kathleen A. McGinty,\n     Chair, Council on Environmental Quality, The White House, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ms. McGinty: We are writing on behalf of numerous \n     constituents who have an interest in the newly announced \n     American Heritage Rivers Program, which involves thirteen \n     executive departments and agencies. We are requesting an \n     extension in the public comment period of 120 days.\n       According to the May 19, 1997 Federal Register \n     announcement, under this program rivers across the country \n     will be designated as ``American Heritage Rivers.'' A \n     designation is intended to address a ``need for concerted, \n     long-term efforts in water quality improvement, river \n     restoration, and economic revitalization within and along the \n     river.'' Any person can nominate a river or entire watershed \n     for designation by the administration, which is intended to \n     preserve the natural, historic, cultural, social, economic \n     and ecological diversity of the nation's rivers.\n       This program was first announced by President Clinton on \n     February 4, 1997. Several public hearings were apparently \n     held during April and May, although the hearings were not \n     noticed in the Federal Register, nor were Congressional \n     offices uniformly notified of the hearings. On May 19, 1997 \n     this program was announced in the Federal Register for the \n     first time. The comment period closes June 9, 1997, allowing \n     only three weeks for public comment.\n       Given the vast scope of the goals of this proposed program \n     and the magnitude of possible designations, this program will \n     potentially implicate a vast range of interests. We believe \n     that three weeks is clearly an insufficient amount of time to \n     permit all interested parties to submit meaningful comment on \n     the proposal.\n       Under the circumstances, and with the large impact this may \n     have on the citizens of our states, we urge you to extend the \n     comment period for an additional 120 days. This would ensure \n     the submission of thoughtful comment representative of all \n     interested parties and organizations. Surely you agree that \n     the success of the proposed program hinges on addressing the \n     concerns of the widest cross-section possible of affected \n     parties. To adequately inform all parties, we also urge you \n     to schedule public hearings on this program, after first \n     notifying all congressional offices and noticing the hearings \n     in the Federal Register of the scheduled hearings.\n       Thank you for your most expeditious response to these \n     concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n         Conrad Burns, Rick Santorum, Sam Brownback, Ted Stevens, \n           Larry E. Craig, Kay Bailey Hutchison, Robert T.\n\n[[Page S9501]]\n\n           Bennett, Tim Hutchinson, Craig Thomas, Richard Shelby, \n           Slade Gorton, -- -- --, Trent Lott, Dirk Kempthorne, \n           Pete Domenici, and Don Nickles.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                         The Idaho Delegation,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 14, 1997.\n     Hon. Kathleen A. McGinty,\n     Chair, Council on Environmental Quality, Old Executive Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman McGinty: The following are comments from \n     Idaho's united Congressional delegation on the American \n     Heritage Rivers Initiative as described in the Federal \n     Register, Volume 62, No. 96, Monday, May 19, 1997.\n       Let us be clear--we have serious concerns with the \n     initiative. We are not only concerned about the initiative \n     itself, but the manner in which it was advanced. It is a \n     clear effort on the part of the Administration to bypass the \n     Constitutionally directed lawmaking power of Congress and our \n     system of checks and balances. Congress has not authorized \n     this initiative and has not appropriated money for this \n     program. Additionally, the Council on Environmental Quality \n     (CEQ) is not granted the power to govern or regulate rivers \n     or watersheds within sovereign states. As such, this \n     initiative represents a challenge of Congress' power and the \n     rights of states, in line with the protections guaranteed in \n     the Fourteenth Amendment.\n       We have other objections beyond this fundamental concern. \n     For example, this initiative actually works against its \n     stated goals: to streamline the federal process dealing with \n     river protection. There are existing federal and state \n     authorities that are charged with the mission of regulating \n     water resource planning and allocation. In addition, there \n     are nearly a hundred grass roots watershed councils across \n     the nation that are accomplishing the same objectives as the \n     initiative, but they have local input as opposed to federal \n     control. The initiative creates an unnecessary, additional \n     layer of bureaucracy that will make it more difficult for \n     private individuals to continue to develop and use water \n     resources that have in the past been controlled by state and \n     local government entities.\n       Another concern relates to the effort to obtain local input \n     regarding the designation of rivers as an American Heritage \n     River. While we support obtaining local input, we question \n     whether the initiative is designed to achieve a truly \n     representative sampler. This is because the local input is \n     based upon what is referred to as ``river communities.'' Any \n     small group, environmental organization or local civic club \n     could be defined as a ``community.'' The initiative redefines \n     communities, watersheds, and jurisdictional boundaries to \n     create this governing entity, which will then have the power \n     to decide the ``length of the area'' to be designated \n     ``whether it be an entire watershed, the length of an entire \n     river, or a short stretch of a river, and may cross \n     jurisdictional boundaries.''\n       Because these communities have no set definition and \n     because of the diverse, and often conflicting set of options, \n     this may cause real communities to become fragmented. Worse, \n     there is no guarantee that private property owners will be \n     included in any decisions made by this river community. In \n     fact, a river could be designated over the specific protests \n     of local private property owners whose land would be most \n     affected.\n       This potential threat to property rights is a serious one. \n     There are no safeguards written into the initiative to \n     protect the rights of property owners. On the contrary, it \n     appears the initiative could result in rezoning properties, \n     thereby disallowing legitimate uses or development. It's also \n     feared that property values will decline because of the \n     designation.\n       Another major concern with this initiative is that the \n     designation of a river is essentially permanent. Wile CEQ may \n     claim that a river can be undesignated at any time, according \n     to the wishes of the local community, there is no defined \n     process for undesignation. And you are aware, the needs and \n     wishes of communities change and a community may decide it no \n     longer wants to have that section of river designated.\n       The process by which this initiative was proposed is \n     flawed, as well. It is in violation of the National \n     Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which requires an \n     Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to be filed for any \n     federal action which would significantly impact our \n     environment. No EIS was filed. Furthermore, NEPA requires a \n     ninety-day public comment period for any EIS. A mere three \n     weeks was originally provided for public comment. While we \n     appreciate the extension of the comment period to sixty days, \n     it was only after extensive public outcry.\n       Despite all of these significant problems with the \n     initiative, there is still one more that cannot be ignored. \n     If this initiative were to be enacted, it would conflict with \n     the Idaho Constitution. Article XV, Section 1 of the \n     Constitution of the State of Idaho, as approved by the U.S. \n     Congress states: ``The use of all waters . . . [is] subject \n     to the regulations and control of the state. . . .'' \n     Additionally, Idaho Code 42-101 states: ``All the waters of \n     the state, when flowing in their natural channels, including \n     the waters of all natural springs and lakes within the \n     boundaries of the state are declared to be the property of \n     the state, whose duty it shall be to supervise their \n     appropriation and allotment to those diverting the same \n     therefrom for any beneficial purpose.'' Idaho clearly has \n     jurisdiction, control, and sovereignty over water within her \n     own borders and any federal attempt to usurp or interfere \n     with that authority will be aggressively resisted.\n       As you can see, we have some serious reservations about \n     your American Heritage Rivers initiative. Our concerns can be \n     summed up into three basic areas: the lack of Congressional \n     approval, the vague language and absence of definitions and \n     the excess federal control over private property and state \n     water rights.\n       We thank you for extending the comment period to sixty \n     days, but we request you withdraw this initiative and allow \n     the local stakeholders and the state to use their current \n     laws to govern their water.\n           Sincerely,\n     Helen Chenoweth,\n       Member of Congress.\n     Larry E. Craig,\n       United States Senator.\n     Mike Crapo,\n       Member of Congress.\n     Dirk Kempthorne,\n       United States Senator.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, Idahoans are quite opposed to the \nAHRI. They see it as a further encroachment of the Federal Government \nnot only into their lives but onto their lands. Even though the \nadministration insists the initiative would be locally driven and \nadministered, the average Idahoan strongly disagrees with this notion \nand simply wants the Federal Government's role to decrease in every \npossible aspect.\n  Mr. President, I support the amendment to H.R. 2107 submitted by the \nSenator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to \nproceed in morning business for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/17/senate-section/article/S9486-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9501-S9502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HELICOPTER CRASH IN BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise this evening to comment on the \ntragic news from Bosnia. Earlier today, a U.N. helicopter carrying \nseveral international officials crashed 40 miles northwest of Sarajevo. \nTwelve people are reported dead and four injured. The latest reports \nindicate that on board were four or five Americans, still unidentified, \nwho were working for the International Police Task Force and the Office \nof the High Representative for Bosnia. Among the dead was Gerd Wagner, \nthe Senior Deputy High Representative for Bosnia. Ambassador Wagner was \nwell known to many of us in the Congress, since before he took up his \npost this past summer he was the political counselor at the German \nEmbassy in Washington.\n  A Balkan expert who learned Serbo-Croatian while serving in Belgrade \nearlier in his career, Ambassador Wagner answered the call to take up \nthe challenging and dangerous post as Senior Deputy to High \nRepresentative Carlos Westendorp.\n  I had dinner with the Ambassador 3 weeks ago in Sarajevo. In the \npresence of a diverse group of Bosnian Muslims, Croats, and other \ninternational officials, he spoke out forcefully in favor of the \ndifficult task of making the Federation work. Much of the credit for \nrefugee resettlement and for fleshing out the political institutions \nmandated by the Dayton accords belongs to Gerd Wagner.\n  Mr. President, this terrible helicopter crash follows just 2 years \nafter the accident on Mount Igman that took the lives of three \ndedicated American diplomats--Joe Kruzel, Bob Frasure, and Nelson Drew. \nIn neither the Mount Igman accident in 1995 nor today's helicopter \ncrash was any foul play suspected.\n  As a matter of fact, the early reports are reminiscent--Dr. Haltzel, \nof the Foreign Relations Committee staff, and I were talking about it \ntoday--of our own helicopter travel in Bosnia 3 weeks ago. We were in a \nsimilar situation. Reportedly the reason Ambassador Wagner's delegation \ncrashed was heavy fog. We also took off from Sarajevo in a peasoup fog, \nand the pilot of our American Blackhawk helicopter expressed concern \nabout the fog and the mountains. Obviously, in our case it turned out \nnot to be a problem. Tragically in this case for Ambassador\n\n[[Page S9502]]\n\nWagner's Czech-made helicopter, it ended up being a fatal problem.\n  As I mentioned, apparently the crash was not the consequence of any \nfoul play. The accident occurred while Ambassador Wagner's party was on \na regular peacekeeping mission. The sacrifices of these brave \nindividuals point out the dangers that international peacekeepers, \nmediators, diplomats, USAID workers, and others face in Bosnia every \nday, even if they may not be the direct victims of the ethnic fighting.\n  If the cause of stabilizing the fragile peace in Bosnia and putting \nthat country back on the road to political and economic recovery is \nimportant to the United States and its allies, as I firmly believe it \nis, then we must take the risks to achieve our goals. Our diplomats in \nBosnia understand that simple truth, our volunteer professional \nsoldiers in SFOR understand that simple truth, our USAID workers in \nBosnia understand it, and our volunteers working for the International \nPolice Task Force in Bosnia understand it. And Gerd Wagner understood \nit.\n  Mr. President, our hearts go out to the families of all the victims, \nthe relatives of the as yet unnamed Americans on board, and Ambassador \nWagner's wife, Mrs. Sandra Wagner, their two sons, and their daughter, \nwho has been studying at the University of California at Berkeley. Gerd \nWagner was a fine German diplomat, a dedicated international civil \nservant, and a good friend of the United States of America. He will be \nsorely missed.\n\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Iowa for allowing me to \nspeak ahead of him, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/17/senate-section/article/S9501-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9502-S9503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO BOBBY SILVERSTEIN\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise now to pay tribute to a great \nfriend of mine, a close personal friend and someone who has added \nsignificantly to the Senate and the House over the course of almost an \nentire adult lifetime of work and, moreover, who has added to moving \nAmerica forward in terms of how we feel and how we care about each \nother and really moving America forward toward the ideal of our Nation. \nAnd that is a nation without barriers to anyone, a nation of \nopportunity for all.\n  Mr. President, I speak of Bobby Silverstein, who later this month \nwill leave the Senate to teach and establish a center for the study and \nadvancement of disability policy at George Washington University.\n  For the past decade, Bobby has been my chief counsel and staff \ndirector of the Subcommittee on Disability Policy. During this time, he \nhas been the behind-the-scenes architect of legislation that has truly \nrevolutionized our Nation's policy towards its citizens with \ndisabilities and expanded opportunities for the more than 49 million \nAmericans with disabilities and their families. There is simply not a \nmore knowledgeable, skillful, accomplished and respected person in the \nfield of disability policy in our entire Nation.\n  Bobby Silverstein played a significant role in crafting the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act, ADA. Before the ADA, discrimination on the basis \nof disability was wrong, but it was not illegal. Bobby helped me \nfashion a coalition of grassroots and Washington-based advocacy groups \nand demonstrated the significant political strength of this unity. \nThrough this coalition, every Member of Congress was educated that \ndisability is a natural part of the human experience, that \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability can be tolerated no longer, \nand that people with disabilities must be judged on what they can do, \nnot on the basis of myths, stereotypes or fears.\n  His mastery of the issues, unrivaled negotiating skills, patience, \nand excellent working relationships with those in the disability \ncommunity, the business community, the Congress, and the White House \nenabled what many have called the emancipation proclamation for people \nwith disabilities--the Americans With Disabilities Act.\n  Under Bobby's behind-the-scenes leadership, public policy for \ninfants, children, and adults with disabilities and their families has \nbeen strengthened and expanded in every aspect of life: education, \nemployment, civil rights, housing, income maintenance, health, \ntransportation, telecommunications, and recreation. In addition to the \nADA, he was my chief aide responsible for securing passing of \nlegislation establishing the National Institute of Deafness and \nCommunication Disorders at the National Institutes of Health. This \nInstitute has contributed significantly to the knowledge of deafness, \nand has led to improvements in the lives of millions of Americans who \nare deaf or hard-of-hearing, including senior citizens. Bobby also \nshaped legislation to reauthorize the Rehabilitation Act, which \nsupports essential job training, employment, and independent living \nopportunities for thousands of adults with disabilities. On October 16, \n1990, the Television Decoder Circuitry Act became law and opened up the \ninformation available on television to the millions of individuals who \ncan benefit from captioned television, including deaf individuals and \nthose children and adults who are learning English.\n  Prior to this time, people who were deaf, like my brother Frank, had \nto have a great big box that they set on top of their television set \nthat would receive the signal and decode it for that television. Those \nunits cost, if I am not mistaken, in the neighborhood of a couple of \nhundred dollars. But as my brother said to me one time, that's fine \nwhen I'm home watching television; I can get the news and the weather \nand other information I need through my decoder on my television. But \nwhat about when I travel and I stop at a motel or hotel and I want to \nfind out what the weather is going to be, or I want to listen to the \nnews? I can't take that box with me.\n  So, beginning in 1988, 1989, we began having hearings on the \npossibility of mandating every television set sold in America have a \nlittle chip put in it so that every television could decode the signal \nfor closed captioning. I remember the hearings. The companies came in \nand said, ``Oh, no, this was going to cost too much money.''\n  Bobby wasn't satisfied. He went to the manufacturers of the chips, \nasked how much it would cost to produce the chips, and if every \ntelevision set had them in it how much would it cost. And it came down \nto mere pennies. So, armed with that information, we were able to get \nthat information to our committee, to Members of the Senate and the \nHouse. The bill passed and, as I said, was signed into law by President \nBush on October 16, 1990.\n  So, every time when you turn on that television and a phone call \ncomes in and you want to watch what is going on but you want to turn \nthe sound down so you punch that button on your remote and the captions \ncome up so you can follow the news and still answer that phone call, \nthink of Bobby Silverstein. He is the one who made it happen. It was a \ngreat law and one that has just helped millions of Americans, including \npeople like me who do not suffer from deafness, for just the very kind \nof purpose I just mentioned.\n  Bobby also championed the Assistive Technology for Individuals With \nDisabilities Act, protection and advocacy legislation for individuals \nwith mental illness, the Development Disabilities Assistance and Bill \nof Rights Act and landmark family support legislation. Most recently, \nBobby was the lead Democratic staffer for the negotiations that led to \nthe bipartisan enactment of Public Law 105-17, the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act--known as IDEA--Amendments of 1997. This \npassed this year. IDEA guarantees a free, appropriate public education \nfor more than 6 million children with disabilities.\n  Bobby came to the Senate after several years working for Congressman \nPat Williams of Montana in the House of Representatives, where his \nskills resulted in landmark legislation that established early \nintervention and preschool opportunities for very young children with \ndisabilities--what we now call part H. These two programs have enabled \nhundreds of thousands of children to obtain the services and support \nthey need to live with their families and develop to their potential.\n  In addition to his impressive legislative achievements, Bobby has \nextensive experience working in Federal agencies and the private \nsector. He has drafted policy interpretations for the Office of Civil \nRights of the United States Department of Health, Education and\n\n[[Page S9503]]\n\nWelfare on issues related to persons with disabilities under section \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; race and national origin issues \nunder title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; and gender issues under \ntitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. In private practice, he \ntrained professionals on the legal framework of the Rehabilitation Act, \nas well as serving as legal counsel for parents of children with \ndisabilities in cases relating to securing a free appropriate public \neducation for their children.\n  Bobby Silverstein has won not only my unquestioned respect and deep \nadmiration, but that of Republican and Democratic Senate and House \nMembers, leaders of the disability community, the business community \nand grassroots activists. His knowledge of the issues and his \nintellectual rigor and honesty are recognized by everyone with whom \nhe's worked.\n  If Bobby Silverstein says something or is involved with putting \nforward a point of view, everyone knows that he has come to that \nposition after meticulous study and careful, objective and reasoned \nanalysis. Bobby has taught us all the importance of working together to \nachieve a common goal. He was able to achieve consensus among parties \nwith strongly held competing views. The great respect he commands from \nthose across the political spectrum is rare and is clearly a tribute to \nhis abilities and tireless dedication to good research and sound \nanalysis. It is this widespread trust and respect for Bobby and his \nwork that has made much of the legislation we've enacted possible.\n  Mr. President, I, along with every American, owe a great debt to \nBobby Silverstein. In all my years in public service, I have not \nencountered a more dedicated, caring and good-hearted person. He \nexemplifies all that is good about public service. He is truly among \nthe best and the brightest individuals in the field of public policy. \nIn the field of disability policy, he has no equal.\n  Mr. President, as you know and as I know and so many people know, as \nwe pass legislation here, it gets our name on it. We are the sponsor of \nthe bill. When it is enacted into law, it is our name that is on it. So \noften we know it is dedicated staff that really do the work.\n  I said so many times that most of the legislation that we pass \ndealing with people with disabilities, if it were not for Bobby \nSilverstein, it never, ever would have happened.\n  So, in that way his mark will remain for a long, long time, not only \nhere in the Senate but all across America.\n  I will yield to my friend and colleague, the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I could not help but come in and join you, associate \nmyself with your remarks for Bob, because I worked with him both in the \nHouse and the Senate. I agree with everything you said. He did so much \nto assist all of us who wanted to benefit those in the most needy \nsituations. I agree with you. If it wasn't for him--and also of course \nPatricia Morrissey on my side, those two who worked so very closely \ntogether all during that period of time--we would not have accomplished \nso much. Bobby was incredible. I know he is going to have even, \nperhaps, a more useful role now that the basic work is done in the \nprofession he is going into. But he is one wonderful person.\n  You are to be commended for recognizing that and utilizing him, of \ncourse, to benefit all of us. I thank the Senator for his comments.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend, the Senator from Vermont, who again is \nknown for his keen intellect, but also a big heart. I appreciate what \nhe just said about Bobby Silverstein. I should have recognized the fact \nthat the Senator would have worked with him, of course, on the House \nside.\n  Again, the people who worked so hard to make our country more fair \nand to break down barriers of discrimination against people--surely no \none can claim that Senator Jim Jeffords needs to take a back seat to \nanyone.\n  Certainly, Senator Jim Jeffords of Vermont need not take a back seat \nto anyone. Senator Jim Jeffords has always been in the forefront of \nthose fights, especially working on the issue I have been talking \nabout, people with disabilities. The Senator from Vermont has always \nbeen in the forefront assuring that people with disabilities have their \nfull constitutional and civil rights in this country. So I appreciate \nwhat he said about Bobby Silverstein, and coming from the distinguished \nSenator from Vermont, believe me, it means a lot to me and it means a \nlot to Bobby Silverstein.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have enjoyed working with the Senator \nfrom Iowa. I think we have been together on every issue here over the \ncourse of the years. I have been with him, or just a little bit behind \nhim, on all of these. I commend him for all the work he has done. We \nboth know that without Bobby and Pat Morrissey, we would not have been \nas successful as we were.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Absolutely true. I appreciate what the Senator said. It \nhas been a real joy working with the Senator from Vermont both in the \nHouse and in the U.S. Senate.\n  So, Mr. President, as the Senator from Vermont said, Bobby is moving \non. I am absolutely certain that his next endeavor, which is the center \nfor the study and advancement of disability policy located at George \nWashington University, will have an immediate and long-term effect on \nnational policy for Americans with disabilities. I might just add as an \naside, Bobby is capable of nothing less.\n  So as Bobby Silverstein leaves the Senate, I congratulate him on his \noutstanding accomplishments. I thank him for his tireless service to \nhis country. I extend my best wishes to Bobby, to his wife Lynne and \ntheir sons, Mark and Evan, for continuing success in the many years \nahead. So, Bobby, thank you for a job well done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/17/senate-section/article/S9502-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9503-S9510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  1998\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, while we are waiting for a final draft \nof the amendment I intend to offer, I thought in the meantime I might \njust as well talk about it, and then we can take care of it when it is \nready.\n  Senator Torricelli and I had a very interesting time earlier this \nweek in helping celebrate the aftermath of the reenactment of the \nBattle of Antietam which occurred this past weekend, which reenacted \none of the most, if not the most, violent battles in the history of \nwarfare in the Civil War.\n  It was a remarkable experience, because not only were there thousands \nof people participating in the reenactment, but there also were over \n100,000 people who watched the reenactment of that incredible battle \nwhich was, they say, the most bloody of the Civil War.\n  It reminded me of this Nation, as we march on toward the end of this \nmillennium, that we do have an obligation to make a commitment to \nourselves in this interim before we go to the next millennium to ensure \nthat we have learned the lessons of history, especially in this Nation, \nnow the most proud and important and strongest Nation in the world, of \nhow we formed and how we lived our lives up through the time it was \ncreated in respect to its modern form of people arriving from Europe \nand other places, and the struggles that we had which were not easy \nones.\n  We are still, in a sense, living some of the aftermath with respect \nto some of the biases and problems of discrimination in this Nation \nagainst those in the black community, who, as we all know, came over \nhere as slaves, and then the great Civil War between the North and the \nSouth fought, to some extent, based upon the principles of the States \nrights, and yet also the very, very difficult question of abolishment \nof slavery in this country.\n  I have had the opportunity over the course of time to study a great \ndeal about that war, for Vermont was very dedicated and, in many ways, \nwas the leader in the sense of commitment, for it was early on that \nVermonters participated in a higher number per capita than any State in \nthe North. In battle after battle, Vermonters were at the head of the \ntroops. In fact, Lincoln at one time commented after reviewing the \nefforts of Vermonters, ``Just tell them to follow the Vermonters.''\n  When I was first in the Senate, our Vermont Legislature, in \ncommemoration of the 100th year of the Battle of\n\n[[Page S9504]]\n\nCedar Creek--I guess it was a little longer than that, 120th, or \nsomething like that, because that was 1864, so I wasn't quite here yet, \nobviously. But anyway, they, in a sense, passed a resolution telling \nthe Vermont delegation that they should go to the Battle of Cedar Creek \nand locate a monument which was erected there many, many years ago \nwhich commemorated the Vermonters. I will mention a little bit about \nthat in a moment.\n  We went there and had to locate it. It was at the back of a private \nhouse, and we found that it was all grown up and trees were winding in \nand out of the fencework around it. So we took immediate steps to get \npermission from the landowner and then transferred that information \nback to our legislature.\n  But it brought to mind that before the memorabilia and memorials all \ndisappeared, it would be important for us to try and see what we could \ndo to retain them and make them available for future generations.\n  So I introduced a bill to commemorate, in a sense, the battle in 1864 \nwhich led to the election of Lincoln, but also I became so entranced \nwith Stonewall Jackson that I began to study the Stonewall Jackson \ncampaign which occurred earlier in 1862 and recognized and realized \nfrom reading that it was the Jackson campaign in the Shenandoah Valley \nthat led to a whole new concept of how to conduct war.\n  In those battles, Stonewall Jackson took advantage of modern movement \nby the railroads. So he would appear in one place in Virginia, lodge a \nbattle and then hop on a train and move to a totally different area, \nand in wonderment, he would appear miles and miles away and have \nanother battle.\n  So I came to the conclusion that it would make it very interesting if \nwe could save those battlefields and to create a sort of historic trail \nwith the Park Service so that people could, in a few days, start and \nfollow the Stonewall Jackson campaign and move up through the \nShenandoah Valley and then turn around and come back.\n  That idea grew. Then attached to that at that time came the thought \nthat we ought to take a look at conserving all battlefields that had a \nmeaningful part of our history. Thus, the Battlefield Commission was \ncreated and the coin and all to try and fund it. That happened.\n  Now we are coming, as I started to say, to the end of our century, \nthe end of the millennium, and still much needs to be done to be able \nto make sure that the history and the battlefields which were the main \nbattles of the Civil War are not lost for future generations.\n  We have found that many of them are up for sale or the lands around \nthem or critical pieces of land that were involved with those \nbattlefields are up for sale.\n  Thus, shortly we will be introducing an amendment to make sure that \nwe do not lose the opportunity to provide the funding and the direction \nto the appropriate Federal officials to make sure that there are funds \navailable to ensure that we can maintain the integrity of the main \nbattlefields of the Civil War.\n  I know my friend from New Jersey, who was with me as we thought about \nthis and met with people this past week, joins me in this. I now yield \nthe floor and allow him to participate in this discussion as we await \nthe final draft.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Jeffords for giving me \nthe opportunity to join with him in this amendment and offer not only \nmy support by my appeal to our colleagues to not only support us in \nthis effort tonight but in future years to keep the commitment to \nrespond to the threat to battlefield sites and other aspects of \nAmerican history, to give our true measure to protecting the history of \nthis country.\n  In his Pulitzer prizewinning book, ``Battle Cry of Freedom,'' James \nMcPherson once wrote of the Civil War that:\n\n       Most of the things that we consider important in this era \n     of American history--the fate of slavery, the structure of \n     both the North and South, the direction of the American \n     economy . . . the definition of freedom, the very survival of \n     the United States--rested on the shoulders of those weary men \n     in blue and grey * * *.\n\n  Most of those men, Mr. President, were simple volunteers, laborers, \nfarmers. They were paid little and endured horrific conditions. \nThroughout the duration of the war, 620,000 Americans, black and white, \nNorth and South, soldiers and sailors, paid an extraordinary price to \npreserve this Nation or to define it as they would have had its future.\n  Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Jeffords in memory of those \nbrave men because the lands where they fought, the places where they \nsacrificed, face a new threat. The battlefields of America, which \ndefine this country, where they gave their lives, may be lost to \nhistory. Future generations who might have been instructed by their \nsacrifices or discovered America by understanding what occurred on \nthese lands will be denied the opportunity.\n  We rise, Mr. President, on an auspicious occasion in offering this \namendment because it was 135 years ago today, only miles north of this \nSenate Chamber, when more than 125,000 Americans, Union and \nConfederate, gathered on the rolling fields near Sharpsburg, MD, for \nwhat we know as the Battle of Antietam.\n\n  It is therefore a fitting evening as we gather tonight to consider \nsaving the lands where they died, to remember that only 12 hours after \nthey gathered, in what would be remembered tomorrow, 23,000 men lay \ndead in what was the bloodiest day in American history, a day in which \nthree times as many Americans fell as died on D-Day.\n  I remember this anniversary, Mr. President, because I come to this \neffort helping Senator Jeffords here tonight because, with friends, I \nvisited the Antietam Battlefield only months ago. I stood in the Sunken \nRoad where 5,000 men fell as a part of that battle.\n  And as I stood in the Sunken Road, where so many men gave their \nlives, looking from the Confederate positions to where the Union \nassault would have come, I recognized something peculiar that did not \nbelong, strange to a great Nation, a ``For Sale'' sign stuck into this \nsacred ground rested where brave men led an assault to save or define \nor to change the United States.\n  Mr. President, when Abraham Lincoln dedicated the national cemetery \nat Gettysburg, he said:\n\n       We cannot consecrate--we cannot hallow this ground. The \n     brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have \n     consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract.\n\n  I recall these words in this Chamber today because it is now for us \nto decide whether Lincoln was right or was wrong, because a ``For \nSale'' sign is on lands where so many Americans fell, where generations \nwill seek to visit to learn of their sacrifice and understand the rich \nand proud history of America. It is no place for commercial \ndevelopment, the sale and destruction of lands. It is, Mr. President, a \ndesecration.\n  The battlefield of Antietam is not alone. Today, hundreds of \nbattlefields, where thousands of others died, face the similar threat \nof ``For Sale'' signs, a future as shopping malls, strip development, \nor suburban housing tracts.\n  The battlefields of Antietam, where Senator Sessions and Senator \nMurray tell me that their own great-grandfathers lost their lives, will \nsoon be housing tracts or the same commercial development that I fear.\n  North of Antietam, in Gettysburg, home to Pickett's charge, Senator \nLott tells me his own great-grandfather fell, on the left flank of what \nwas the bloodiest battle where 55,000 Americans died in 3 days, more \nthan in all the battles in the war of 14 years in Vietnam.\n  South of here, in the lands around Fredericksburg, best captured by \nthe photograph to my right--home to the battles of Chancellorsville, \nWilderness, and Spotsylvania Court House--important Civil War \nlandmarks have already been destroyed by housing tracts and shopping \ncenters.\n\n  Places where schoolchildren would have visited to remember their own \nrelatives, learn about their sacrifices, understand how America came to \nbe as we know it today will never have the experience. But it isn't \njust Gettysburg, it isn't only Antietam, it isn't simply experienced by \nFredericksburg. It's Vicksburg, MS; Petersburg, VA; Mobile, AL; Fort \nDonelson, TN; Perryville, KY; Bentonville, NC; Chickamunga, GA.\n  Indeed, two-thirds of the most important Civil War battlefield sites \nin our Nation in the next 6 years could be irrevocably lost to history. \nWe are not, Mr. President, the first Senate to recognize this threat. \nIn November 1990,\n\n[[Page S9505]]\n\nunder the leadership of Senator Bumpers and in the House of \nRepresentatives under the leadership of Congressman Mrazek of New York, \nwith the signature of President Bush, we established the Civil War \nSites Advisory Commission to advise the Congress on how to preserve \nthese lands. This 15-member panel identified 384 critical Civil War \nbattles or engagement sites that, in their judgment, should be \npreserved.\n  Even 7 years ago, however, they recognized that 20 percent were \nalready lost to history through commercial development. But they \nrecognized that there are still 260 that could be saved. They warned \nthen that time was short. Now, it is even shorter.\n  Our amendment, through a sense of the Senate, will ask that the \nconferees use their best efforts to use funding available in the Land \nand Conservation Fund to immediately make available, within Park \nService boundaries, funding to save those lands still available. It \nwill use less than 10 percent of the funding available to the Congress \nthis year out of the conservation funds.\n  We offer this as a sense of the Senate because we have Senator Lott's \ncommitment, and I believe his sincere pledge, to defend the interests \nof this Senate in preserving these lands, but mostly because Senator \nGorton has given his own commitment. Because of his own sincere belief \nin this effort, he will lead us in this important cause.\n  Mr. President, I am standing here tonight as a representative of a \nyoung country. We are challenged, I think, by the notion that if we \nstood not in the U.S. Congress but in the French National Assembly, the \nBritish Parliament, or any other great assembly in Europe, it would be \nunthinkable that the lands of Verdun or Stalingrad or Waterloo would \never be destroyed through commercial development.\n  Perhaps our Nation is not as old, but its history is just as \nimportant. Our own children will look for instruction from what \noccurred in these important lands just as much as those of France, \nRussia or Britain.\n  So, Mr. President, I offer this amendment with Senator Jeffords, \ngiving my thanks to our colleagues who join with us and, indeed, to \nProfessor McPherson, who has inspired yet another generation with his \nwriting and battle cry of freedom and for writing to Members of the \nSenate today in support of this important amendment.\n  Senator Jeffords, thank you for your leadership, and, Senator Gorton, \nthank you for your help in representing the Senate in the conference in \npreserving the sense of the Senate and dedicating these funds to this \nimportant effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as I said at the beginning of the \ndiscussion of this bill last Thursday afternoon, my subcommittee is an \nextremely popular one. I had some 1,800 special requests from Members, \nalmost all for projects of one sort or another in their own States. I \nbelieve we may finish this bill tomorrow, but we have some two pages of \namendments, most of which are not matters of profound national policy \nbut, again, for specific programs or projects in individual States.\n  It is with that in mind that I want to say how refreshing it is to \nhear from these two Senators of their tremendous desire to save the \nsites of the most important battles, many of the most important \nbattles, in the history of the United States that were fought in that \nprofound turning point in our history, the Civil War.\n  I am quite a Civil War buff myself, a fan of Professor McPherson's \nbook, perhaps an even greater fan of Shelby Foote, but with all of my \nreading, I fail to remember a single battle that took place in the \nState of New Jersey, and I can remember of only one skirmish that took \nplace in the State of Vermont that was made into a movie a couple of \ndecades ago. So the Senate has not heard from two Senators who are \nattempting to create projects in their own States. They are hearing \nfrom Senators who care deeply about our heritage and care deeply about \nthe preservation of the physical aspects of that heritage.\n  At least two of the amendments that will be adopted tomorrow will \nrelate to sites of battles that have already been preserved in large \npart but where the ravages of time are having a negative impact. The \nSenators know of my bias in favor of supporting them.\n  Even so, when the two Senators who sponsor this amendment first \nbrought it to me, they placed me on the horns of a dilemma from which \nthey now have most graciously removed me. The source of the money for \nthe preservation of these sites is the Land and Water Conservation \nFund. A $700 million infusion into the Land and Water Conservation Fund \nwas a recommendation of the President, which at least at that level was \nacceded to by the Senate leadership in negotiations over the budget. It \nwas not a mandatory part of that budget agreement. The House of \nRepresentatives omitted to fund any portion of that $700 million.\n  Feeling very strongly, in general terms, about the importance of not \njust this kind of preservation but of other preservation, my bill does \ninclude that $700 million. It sets three priority items for use of that \nmoney, two of which amount to almost half of the $700 million, high-\nprofile priorities of the President of the United States--the \nHeadwaters Forest in California and the New World Mine in Montana.\n  Another $100 million in it is appropriately earmarked for the States' \nshare program, money to share with the States as we have in the past \nfor their own preservation of recreational and other property.\n  So when the Secretary of the Interior came to me with this request, \nwe made the determination that we would not earmark money directly for \nany other projects. I didn't want to be faced with a whole series of \nrecommendations from the administration in which we in the Congress \nplayed no role. And I think it's safe to say the Secretary of the \nInterior and the administration didn't want us to spend all of the \nmoney without the administration playing any role in that \ndetermination. So I agreed that we would oppose additional specific \nearmarks in this bill.\n  At that point, these two Senators came along, either on their own, or \nknowing my own biases, and asked for money for a purpose which I think \nis worthy and of the highest possible priority. So they did put me on \nthe horns of a dilemma. They have now agreed to make this a sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution as to how the money ought to be spent, with my \nsupport and with the support of the majority leader.\n  So I want to do two things. I want to thank them for phrasing it in \nthis fashion and I pledge my support as we vote on the amendment. I \nalso want to tell them that as we do work with the administration to \nset priorities across the country for the spending of the money from \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund, assuming that we can get the \nHouse of Representatives to agree that we are going to have the money \nat all, it is very difficult for me to imagine any higher priority than \nthe preservation of these Civil War sites. So I want to agree with this \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1218\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the preservation \n                       of Civil War battlefields)\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords] for himself and Mr. \n     Torricelli proposes an amendment numbered 1218.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n       Sec.  . It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) preserving Civil War battlefields should be an integral \n     part of preserving our Nation's history; and\n       (2) Congress should give special priority to the \n     preservation of Civil War battlefields by making funds \n     available for the purchase of threatened and endangered Civil \n     War battlefield cites.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, my amendment is a critically important \namendment to make sure that we preserve the Civil War battlefields for \nthose people who will be in the next millennium to better understand \nthis Nation.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to be joined today by Senator Torricelli in \noffering this amendment of national historic significance.\n\n[[Page S9506]]\n\n  The American Civil War is thought by many historians to be the \nfundamental event shaping the character of the United States. This \namendment takes a giant stride at preserving our history by \nestablishing that it is these funds that be made available to protect \nthe threatened American Civil War battlefields.\n  I am proud to say that there is in this land a great wellspring of \ncaring for the places where freedom was won and defended. Millions of \nAmericans have, in recent years, become aware of the hallowed ground of \nour Civil War battlefields, have visited them, read of them, many have \nwritten of them.\n  The clear and eloquent message I hear is that these treasured places \nshould be saved, intact, for future generations. The preservation \nmessage goes forth from Gettysburg, Antietam, Manassas, Cold Harbor, \nMalvern Hill, Cedar Creek, Petersburg, Stones River, and dozens more \nCivil War places.\n  When battlefields become severely threatened there quickly develops a \ncontinuity of Americans that spreads nationwide. The American people \ncare about their history, look on these places as national treasures, \nand speak eloquently and effectively for their preservation.\n  Preserving our Nation's battlefields is a subject very close to my \nheart. My efforts to preserve our Nation's historic places actually \nbegan in my State of Vermont several years ago when the Vermont \nLegislature unanimously passed a resolution asking Congress to save the \nplaces where Vermonters fought in the Civil War. The resolution was \npresented to me, and I went to work finding out all I could about the \nbattlefields and what was needed. It quickly became apparent that the \nCivil War battlefields were in need of protection.\n  Over 7 years ago, Congress responded to the growing awareness of our \nCivil War heritage and the concern for the sites where that heritage \ntook form, by passing legislation that created a national Civil War \nSites Advisory Commission. Composed of distinguished historians, \nsupported by a staff of National Park Service experts, the commission \nfor 2 years studied the remaining Civil War battlefields. Civil War \nsites were visited, public meetings held, and in the end a report was \nwritten. The report presented a plan of action for protecting what \nremain of the Civil War battlefields. It is a plan that has recognized \nthe need to act, a plan that I strongly favor.\n  Mr. President, as a proud American, preserving our great history is \nan opportunity I am always ready to seize. Congress should do what we \ncan to help meet the recommendations of the Civil War Advisory \nCommission by preserving the country's most endangered Civil War sites.\n  In fighting to preserve Civil War battle sites, we have aimed to \ncreate the chance for our citizens to travel from battlefield to \nbattlefield and to relive the brilliant Jackson campaign of 1862, and \nthe successful Union campaign of 1864. By preserving these sites, we \nwill allow people to enjoy the beautiful surroundings such as the \nShenandoah Valley and give area economies an important boost.\n  Several years ago, I had the privilege to travel from battlefield to \nbattlefield with several Civil War historians and Civil War buffs. We \nsaw those battlefields pretty much as they were during the Civil War. \nWe relived Jackson's battles of the 1862 campaign, one of the most \nstudied campaigns in history. We also retraced the Union campaign of \n1864. At that time the election was not looking so good for President \nLincoln, and the Union was in dire need of battle victories. General \nSheridan marched the Union forces up to the valley and won a series of \nbattles culminating in the Battle of Ceder Creek. Many historians \nbelieve that this was the turning point in the war.\n  Mr. President, I came away from this trip with the strong feeling \nthat it is my responsibility as U.S. Senator to help preserve this part \nof our national heritage. Bruce Catton, one of our Nation's most \neminent historians has written:\n\n       Any historian who confronts a gap in the record of bygone \n     days knows moments of despair when he complains bitterly that \n     no one took the trouble to dig out and assemble all of the \n     facts while those facts where still available. To use \n     unlimited resources in as broad and as all-inclusive as it \n     possibly can be, to do it while everything is still fresh, \n     and to do it with no other earthly motive than a desire to \n     establish the full truth--this is the sort of thing that only \n     governments can do, and they almost never dream of doing it.\n\n  Mr. Catton's words are more important than just an expression of the \nhistorian's frustration at not having access to ``all the facts.'' His \nwords constitute a challenge, a challenge to government to preserve and \nprotect the fragile bits and pieces of our Nation's history that remain \nwith us today, but which tomorrow could vanish forever.\n  Just this past weekend, the Battle of Antietam or Sharpsburg, as it \nwas referred to by the Confederates, was relived as over 15,000 civil \nwar enthusiasts reenacted this bloody battle before over 100,000 \nspectators. On this day, 135 years ago, over 23,000 brave Americans \nlost their lives at the Battle of Antietam. The number of casualties \nwas three times greater than the number of Americans killed at Normandy \non D-day. Left for the dead on the battlefield, but surviving, was a \nyoung captain from Massachusetts who became one of the nation's most \nrespected Supreme Court Justices, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. General \nMcClellan sent a message to Washington of a great victory, however the \nConfederates escaped across the Potomac and retreated into the lower \nShanandoah Valley with little interference. Many believe that the \nvictory prompted Abraham Lincoln to unveil his preliminary Emancipation \nProclamation on September 22, 1862.\n  Mr. President, if we persist, we could give to future generations of \nAmericans a gift of history, the opportunity to see, to walk, the \nhallowed ground of one of the most beautiful places on earth where this \nNation's history was written. If we fail, we must answer to future \ngenerations who go in vain to seek places of our heritage. On October \n19, 1864, with victory in his grasp, Jubal Early declined to launch a \nlast attack. Early believed his valiant Confederate troops had won an \nadequate victory for the day along the banks of Cedar Creek. ``But this \nis the Sixth Corps,'' an aide protested, ``and they will not go unless \nwe drive them.'' Early did not attack and his day was soon lost.\n  To those who would act too cautiously here, I say, ``But this is the \neleventh hour. The battlefields will be lost unless we act now and \ndecisively.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an editorial from the New \nYork Times of July 4, 1997, on the ``latest battle of Gettysburg'' be \nprinted in the Record, along with a letter from James M. McPherson, of \nPrinceton University, supporting my amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 4, 1997]\n\n                    The Latest Battle of Gettysburg\n\n       When Abraham Lincoln said of Gettysburg that ``the brave \n     men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated \n     it, far above our poor power to add or detract,'' he did not \n     reckon on the power of 20th-century developers.\n       At issue are 50 acres just outside the protective \n     boundaries of the Battlefield Historic District at the \n     interchange of Routes 15 and 30 in Pennsylvania. Gettysburg \n     has mushroomed as a bedroom community in the last five years \n     because of its proximity to the Baltimore-Washington area. \n     Wal-Mart, several large hotels, fast-food franchises, grocery \n     stores and a miniature golf course line the Route 30 \n     corridor. Now, developers want to build a Giant Superstore on \n     land that used to be Camp Letterman.\n       Camp Letterman was merely a field hospital in the sense \n     that Gettysburg, where more than 7,000 died and 50,000 were \n     wounded, was merely a battle. Nearly 5,000 union and \n     Confederate soldiers were cared for in 500 tents at the camp. \n     Historical records indicate that more than 1,200 were buried \n     at the site. Although a mobile home park now sits on a small \n     portion of Camp Letterman, which is under option by a \n     development company, there has been no bulldozing or land \n     contouring. Straban Township, where the camp is located, \n     recently granted conditional approval to the development \n     plan, although final approval is still pending with the Army \n     Corps of Engineers, which can withhold building permits if \n     significant archeological resources are discovered during \n     excavation efforts. Archeological surveys so far have yielded \n     indications of a grave.\n       The situation at Camp Letterman is emblematic of a national \n     epidemic. Hallowed ground throughout the country is \n     threatened by commercial development. For instance, a gravel \n     company has optioned Buffington Island, the site of the only \n     major battle in Ohio. If plans go through, the battlefield \n     will be mined into a heap of pebbles. One of the more \n     infamous struggles between development and historical \n     preservation occurred in 1994 when the Walt Disney Company \n     proposed to build a theme park in Virginia near\n\n[[Page S9507]]\n\n     the Civil War shrines of Manassas. Had it not been for loud \n     opposition from a conglomerate of scholars and legislators, \n     Disney would have damaged an important historic area.\n       But most of the sites in jeopardy do not get publicity on \n     the scale of Manassas, if they receive any attention at all. \n     That should not diminish the significance of places like Camp \n     Letterman, where soldiers spilled their blood for the sake of \n     their country. In 1991, Congress created the Civil War Study \n     Commission to avoid such dilemmas. The commission was charged \n     with identifying high-priority sites and drawing up a plan to \n     protect them. One of the most important discoveries involved \n     public perception. Americans overwhelmingly believe that all \n     Civil War sites are already protected. In fact, less than 4 \n     percent fall under the national park system. More than one-\n     third of all important battlefields are either ruined or \n     nearly so. Without swift preservation efforts, the nation \n     stands to lose two-thirds of its main battlefields within 10 \n     years.\n       When the commission released its report in 1993, it \n     recommended that Congress enact a ``Civil War Heritage \n     Preservation'' law that would establish a national policy to \n     protect the battlefields and related sites through a \n     cooperative effort by national, state and local governments \n     and private groups. But in a time of shrinking fiscal \n     resources, its suggestions were shelved.\n       Sites like Camp Letterman tell the story of bravery and \n     human suffering and conviction. The exchange of this heritage \n     for strip malls and grocery stores is reprehensibly cheap. \n     Before important parts of our past disappear, Congress should \n     look to the future by re-examining the Civil War Study \n     Commission's recommendations.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                             Princeton University,\n\n\n                                        Department of History,\n\n                                Princeton, NJ, September 16, 1997.\n     Senators James Jeffords and Robert G. Torricelli,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Jeffords and Torricelli: I strongly support \n     the American Heritage Preservation Amendment that you have \n     introduced in the Senate to use part of the proceeds from the \n     Land and Water Conservation Fund for Civil War battlefield \n     preservation.\n       In his address at Gettysburg to dedicate the cemetery for \n     soldiers who had died in the epic battle, Abraham Lincoln \n     said that the world ``can never forget what they did here.'' \n     Nor has the world forgotten. Millions of people visit \n     Gettysburg and other Civil War battlefields every year. Most \n     come away profoundly moved by the experience. Yet portions of \n     many of these battlefields are endangered by encroaching \n     commercial and residential development. Thousands of acres of \n     hallowed ground may disappear under concrete and asphalt \n     unless we act now.\n       As a member of the congressional Civil War Sites Advisory \n     Commission, which in 1993 recommended urgent action by \n     public-private partnerships to purchase or otherwise protect \n     these acres. I have been disappointed by the failure of \n     Congress to act. Private organizations such as the \n     Association for the Preservation of Civil War Sites, the \n     Civil War Trust, and the Conservation Fund have raised \n     millions of dollars for this purpose. But they cannot do it \n     all alone. That is why I urge Congress to pass your American \n     Heritage Preservation Amendment, which will dedicate a small \n     portion--no more than 10 percent--of the $700 million already \n     designated for land acquisition from the LWCF for the \n     purchase of important Civil War sites.\n       ``We cannot consecrate--we cannot hallow this ground,'' \n     said Lincoln at Gettysburg. ``The brave men, living and dead, \n     who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor \n     power to add or detract.'' Lincoln was both right and wrong. \n     We cannot consecrate this ground, but we can desecrate it. We \n     must take steps now to prevent that desecration. The \n     Jeffords-Torricelli Amendment is a crucial first step toward \n     this goal.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                               James M. McPherson.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1218) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on the bill, I ask unanimous consent to \nmake a technical clarification to the committee report on page 32 of \nthe report, which indicates that a report on the Natchez National \nHistoric Park as being due on January 30, 1997.

Mr. President, this suspends, for the period of this next \nfiscal year, the implementation of fees for recreational use for cabins \nin a national forest in Idaho, while Senator Craig and the appropriate \ncommittee discusses the method by which those fees were arrived at. It \nis cleared by both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1212) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON.

The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton], for Mr. Murkowski, proposes \n                      an amendment numbered 1215.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       ``Sec.   . Entry and permit limitations for Glacier Bay \n     National Park shall not apply to the Auk Nu Marine--Glacier \n     Bay Ferry entering Bartlett Cove for the sole purpose of \n     accessing park or other authorized visitor services or \n     facilities at, or originating from, the public dock area at \n     Bartlett Cove: Provided, That any such motor vessel entering \n     park waters for this stated and sole purpose shall be subject \n     to speed, distance from coast lines, and related limitations \n     imposed on all vessels operating in waters designated by the \n     Superintendent, Glacier Bay, as having a high probability of \n     whale occupancy based on recent sighting and/or past patterns \n     of occurrence: Provided further, That nothing in this Act \n     shall be construed as constituting approval for such vessels \n     entering the waters of Glacier Bay National Park beyond the \n     immediate Bartlett Cove area as defined by a line extending \n     northeastward from Pt. Carolus to the west to the \n     southernmost point of Lester Island, absent required \n     permits.''\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this amendment is designed to bring an \nimportant element of the Alaskan national park experience to a wider \nrange of visitors than has previously been the case.\n  Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, west of Juneau, can be \nreached only by boat or plane. Park headquarters at Bartlett Cove is 65 \nmiles from Juneau. It is an additional 40 miles from Bartlett Cove to \nthe park's signature tidewater glaciers.\n  Glacier Bay proper is highly regulated by the National Park Service. \nCurrently, only two cruise ships are allowed to proceed, from the \noutside, into Glacier Bay per day.\n  This amendment is not about cruise ships, nor will it adversely \nimpact the forty miles from Bartlett Cove to the tidewater glaciers. In \nfact, this amendment has nothing to do with going into the bay beyond \nBartlett Cove at the entrance to the Park.\n  Bartlett Cove, within Glacier Bay National Park, contains the Glacier \nBay Lodge and Visitor Center, campground, Ranger Station, employee \nhousing, maintenance facilities, etc. In short, it is the only \ndeveloped area within the 3.3 million acre park.\n  The Cove also includes the docking facilities for NPS craft and the \ndaily concession-operated tour boat. Overnight facilities are extremely \nlimited, so day-use concession trips are one of the only ways, short of \ntaking a cruise ship from Vancouver, to visit the park.\n  According to a recent ``Consumer Report's'' article, Glacier Bay is \nthe highest rated park in America. The article does, unfortunately, \nmention the words ``if you can get to it''.\n  Currently, daily or overnight guests who leave Juneau by ferry for \nGlacier Bay National Park must disembark at the Gustavus docking \nfacility and then get into a bus and drive for 45 minutes to an hour, \nto get to the NPS unpaved portion of the road which then leads to the \ndocking facility so that you can again board a tour boat to go out and \nsee the tidewater glaciers.\n  On the way back to Juneau from the glaciers, visitors travel by tour \nboat, then by the bus back through Gustavus, and finally by boat, back \nto Juneau.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is about: Convenient visitor access, \naccess for the handicapped, access for the elderly; and, safety.\n  Somewhere along the line, in its effort to control the waters of \nGlacier Bay, the Bureaucracy forgot the concept that we are here to \nserve the all of the public * * * all of the people who would like to \nbe National Park visitors * * * including the elderly, including those \nwith handicaps and those whose age or physical condition necessitate \neasier forms of access to their national park.\n  It may be a surprise to some, but, some park visitors cannot leap \ntall facilities in a single bound. Some visitors, because of a \ndisabling condition cannot get from the deck of a boat to a \ndeteriorating dock facility 18 feet overhead.\n  Some visitors, even the most able among us, cannot be expected to \njump from a boat on to an unprotected dock in high and windy seas just \noff of Icy Passage.\n  Unfortunately, in Alaska, and specifically Glacier Bay National Park, \nwe have forgotten about the park visitor's convenience and safety. The \ndock facility at Gustavus is inconvenient, it is less than handicapped \naccessible, it can certainly be considered unsafe in certain wind and \nsea conditions.\n  This amendment will only allow the Auk Nu Marine--Glacier Bay Ferry \nto deliver park visitors, safely, to the protected harbor at Bartlett \nCove within the boundaries of Glacier Bay National Park so that they \ncan conveniently board the tour boat, or go to the lodge * * * period. \nThe amendment does nothing else.\n  This amendment does not preclude the Superintendent from imposing \nspeed limits and/or taking any other such actions to protect the \nwildlife and the other natural resources or waters of Glacier Bay \nNational Park.\n  The amendment is not an attempt to subvert the current permit system, \nit is not as complicated as how do you know when it's time to tune your \nbagpipes. The amendment is simple and straight forward.\n  This amendment only involves safe and user-friendly access to the \ndeveloped park facilities. I urge my colleagues to join me in this \neffort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1215) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1216\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof Mr. Murkowski and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton], for Mr. \n     Murkowski, proposes an amendment numbered 1216.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Title I of Public Law 96-514 (94 Stat. 2957) is amended \n     under the heading ``Exploration of National Petroleum Reserve \n     in Alaska'' by striking ``(8) each lease shall be issued'' \n     through the end of the first paragraph and inserting in lieu \n     thereof the following:\n       (8) each lease shall be issued for an initial period of ten \n     years, and shall be extended for so long thereafter as oil or \n     gas is produced from the lease in paying quantities, or as \n     drilling or reworking operations, as approved by the \n     Secretary, are conducted thereon; (9) for purposes of \n     conservation of the natural resources of any oil or gas pool, \n     field, or like area, or any part thereof, lessees thereof and \n     their representatives are authorized to unite with each \n     other, or jointly or separately with others, in collectively \n     adopting and operating under a unit agreement for such pool, \n     field, or like area, or any part thereof\n\n[[Page S9509]]\n\n     (whether or not any other part of said oil or gas pool, \n     field, or like area is already subject to any cooperative or \n     unit plan of development or operation), whenever determined \n     by the Secretary to be necessary or advisable in the public \n     interest. Drilling, production, and well re-working \n     operations performed in accordance with unit agreement shall \n     be deemed to be performed for the benefit of all leases that \n     are subject in whole or in part to such unit agreement.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 69, lines 9 and 10, strike ``the relocation of the \n     Regional Office for Region 10 to Ketchikan and other''.\n       On page 77, beginning on line 14 add the following: ``Funds \n     appropriated by this Act for Region 10 of the Forest Service \n     to implement the Revised Tongass National Forest Land \n     Management Plan, shall be spent and obligated at the Forest \n     Supervisor and Ranger District levels. No funds appropriated \n     under this or any other Act for the purpose of operations \n     conducted at the Region 10 headquarters, including funding of \n     centralized field costs for funding of persons employed at \n     the Regional Office, shall be obligated or expended in excess \n     of $17,500,000 from the total funds appropriated for Region \n     10''.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the managers of the bill have accepted \nan amendment I have offered concerning the organization and funding for \nthe Alaska Region of the U.S. Forest Service. I appreciate the \nconsideration of the managers on this matter.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the Forest Service has recently \ncompleted the Tongass land management plan after a 10-year and $13 \nmillion effort. The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources has \nconducted an extended oversight process on the development of this plan \nand on the prospects for successful implementation upon completion. \nHearings held in July, August, and this month have raised significant \nquestions about whether the Forest Service is organized, staffed, and \nfunded to assure full implementation of the Tongass land management \nplan.\n  As a consequence of concerns raised during the early hearings in this \nseries, the subcommittee chairman agreed to include language in the \ncommittee bill directing a reorganization of the Alaska Region. In \nsubsequent hearings, we have collected additional information that \nsuggests that, rather than moving to immediately reorganize the Alaska \nRegion, it might be better to provide the Agency some direction on: \nFirst, the allocation of funds within the Alaska Region; and second, \nthe development of a transition plan for implementation of the Tongass \nland management plan.\n  I believe that through the information collection in the oversight \nprocess conducted by the Commission on Energy and Natural Resources we \nhave developed a more perfected proposal than the one included in the \ncommittee bill. Therefore, I am offering, as an amendment to the \ncommittee bill, new language which directs that:\n\n       Funds appropriated by this Act for Region 10 of the Forest \n     Service to implement the Revised TLMP shall be spent and \n     obligated at the Forest Supervisor and Ranger District \n     levels. No funds appropriated under this or any other Act for \n     the purpose of operations conducted at the Region 10 \n     Headquarters, including funding of centralized field costs or \n     funding of persons employed at the Regional Office, shall be \n     obligated or expanded in excess of $17.5 million from the \n     total funds appropriated for Region 10.\n\n  The managers have also agreed to the following explanatory language \nin their statement explaining changes made to the committee bill:\n\n       The Tongass Land Management Plan reduces the Allowable Sale \n     Quantity of the Alaska region. It is presumed that the Forest \n     Service will tailor its workforce and organization \n     appropriately. The Committee notes that expenditures on \n     Regional Office operations and centralized field costs at the \n     Region Headquarters has risen to 30 percent from 18 percent \n     of annual appropriated funds since 1993. The Committee \n     recognizes that the reduced timber volume offered under this \n     plan will create economic hardships for local communities and \n     that imbalanced distribution of remaining federal jobs and \n     spending in the region may compound those hardships. \n     Accordingly, the Committee expects the Regional Forester to \n     conduct a regional work load study and to develop a workforce \n     plan that ensures high levels of customer service throughout \n     the region, preserves the Regional Headquarters in Alaska, \n     evaluates the need to consolidate and/or relocated offices, \n     including relocating the Regional Office to Ketchikan, and \n     provides for implementation by January 1, 2000. Further, the \n     Committee expects the workforce plan to reflect the full \n     participation of affected Southeast Alaska communities, and \n     to include a community by community assessment of economic \n     impacts and the rationale used by the Regional Forester to \n     distribute federal jobs under the workforce plan. The \n     Committee expects that the workforce plan will emphasize \n     retention of personnel experience in Southeast Alaska's \n     multiple use mission, will make maximum use of local hiring \n     authority, and will be submitted to committees of \n     jurisdiction in both the House and the Senate by March 1, \n     1998 for review and further guidance, if warranted. Any \n     expenditures at the Regional Office in excess of $17.5 \n     million from the funds provided to the Region shall be \n     preceded by a 60-day notification of the Appropriations \n     Committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives.\n\n  I believe that this language will provide direction to the Forest \nService to allocate funds in a fashion that will come closer to \nassuring full implementation of the Tongass land management plan.\n  This approach will materially improve Forest Service operations in \nAlaska. During our oversight process, we discovered that over the last \n6 years the Agency has increased the amount of funds consumed in the \nRegional Office from an average of 18 percent of annual Regional \nappropriations to something closer to 30 percent. This has diminished \nthe Agency's field capability. Now, with the TLMP complete\n\n[[Page S9510]]\n\nit should be the Forest Service's intention to focus more of the \nfunding and effort at the field level.\n  Should the conferees be agreeable to adopting the language that we \nare including in the Senate bill, I would hope that conference report \nlanguage could be included which directs the Forest Service to tailor \nits work force and organization appropriately.\n  I would hope that the conferees note that expenditures on regional \noffice operations and centralized field costs at the regional \nheadquarters have risen to 30 percent from 18 percent of annual \nappropriated funds since 1993.\n  I trust that everyone recognizes that the reduced timber volume \noffered under the new TLMP plan will create economic hardships for \nlocal communities and that imbalanced distribution of remaining Federal \njobs and spending in the region may compound those hardships. \nAccordingly, I would hope that the conference report would direct the \nregional Forester to conduct a regional work load study and to develop \na work force plan that ensures high levels of customer service \nthroughout the region, preserves the regional headquarters in Alaska, \nevaluates the need to consolidate and/or relocate offices, including \nrelocating the regional office to Ketchikan, and provides for \nimplementation by January 1, 2000.\n  Further, the workforce plan should reflect the full participation of \naffected southeast Alaska communities, and include a community-by-\ncommunity assessment of economic impacts and the rationale used by the \nregional forester to distribute Federal jobs under the work force plan. \nI hope that any work force plan will emphasize retention of personnel \nexperienced in southeast Alaska's multiple use mission, will make \nmaximum use of local hiring authority, and will be submitted to \ncommittees of jurisdiction in both the House and Senate by March 1, \n1998, for review and further guidance, if warranted.\n  Under my amendment, any expenditures at the regional office in excess \nof $17.5 million from the funds provided to the region would have to be \npreceded by a 60-day notification of the Appropriations Committees of \nthe Senate and the House of Representatives. I believe this language \nproperly reflects the results of the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources oversight efforts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1217) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor a great friend and a \ngreat Kentuckian. This month, Ronnie Abrams will retire from Coopers & \nLybrand L.L.P. after 40 years of dedicated service. I first met Ronnie \nand his wife Marie when I was Governor of Kentucky. Since then, I've \nnot only had the pleasure of working with him on many Kentucky \nprojects, but I've also come to count on his advice and counsel over \nthe years.\n  Ronnie has made many contributions to his hometown of Louisville \nthrough his work with a wide range of groups including Adath Israel \nB'Rith Sholom, the Jewish Community Federation, Metro United Way, and \nthe Louisville Chamber of Commerce. In each of these organizations, \nRonnie has served in leadership positions and devoted countless hours \nof volunteer service. In recognition of his efforts to make the \ncommunity a better place for everyone, the B'nai Brith honored him with \nthe 1992 Person of the Year Award.\n  Ronnie has also been an active member of his profession through the \nAmerican Institute of CPA's tax division, the Louisville Chamber of \nCommerce's State tax committee, the Estate Planning Council of \nLouisville, and as chairman of the Kentucky Society of CPA's State \ntaxation committee.\n  Beyond his community and professional activities, Ronnie has been an \ninvaluable advisor to many political leaders, myself included.

As a result, the number of \ndiscretionary advisory committees (established under general \ncongressional authorizations) was held to 501, or 37 percent fewer than \nthose 801 committees in existence at the beginning of my \nAdministration. Savings achieved through the elimination of \ndiscretionary committees during fiscal year 1996 totalled $2.5 million.\n  Through the advisory committee planning process required by Executive \nOrder 12838, departments and agencies have worked to minimize the total \nnumber of advisory committees specifically mandated by statute. The 407 \nsuch groups supported at the end of fiscal year 1996 represents a \nmodest 7 percent decrease over the 439 in existence at the beginning of \nmy Administration. However, more can be done to assure that the total \ncosts to fund these groups in fiscal year 1997, or $38.5 million, are \ndedicated to support high-priority public involvement efforts.\n  During fiscal year 1996, the General Services Administration (GSA) \ninitiated a process for collaborating with executive departments and \nagencies to increase public participation opportunities at all levels \nof American society. Building upon my Administration's commitment to \nexpand access to Federal decisionmakers, managers at all levels will be \nprovided with more timely guidance that includes enhanced options for \nachieving objectives, better training, and exposure to a variety of \ntools and techniques, which when used in conjunction with advisory \ncommittees, offer additional flexibility to address a wide variety of \npublic participation needs.\n  Actions to broaden the scope and effectiveness of public \nparticipation within the Federal sector will continue during fiscal \nyear 1997. During the year, GSA will develop newly updated guidance \nimplementing FACA. At the same time, GSA will continue to support and \nwork closely with such agencies as the Council on Environmental Quality \nand the Departments of Agriculture and the Interior to align its \nefforts with key Administration policies relating to ecosystem and land \nmanagement priorities.\n  My Administration will continue to work with the Congress to assure \nthat all advisory committees that are required by statute are regularly \nreviewed through the congressional reauthorization process and that \nremaining committees are instrumental in achieving national interests.\n                                                  William J.

This report is \nsubmitted pursuant to section 204(c) of the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c) (IEEPA), section 401(c) of the \nNational Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1641(c), and section 505(c) of the \nInternational Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1985, 22 \nU.S.C. 2349aa-9(c). This report discusses only matters concerning the \nnational emergency with respect to Iran that was declared in Executive \nOrder 12957 and does not deal with those relating to the emergency \ndeclared on November 14, 1979, in connection with the hostage crisis.\n  1. On March 15, 1995, I issued Executive Order 12957 (60 Fed. Reg. \n14615, March 17, 1995) to declare a national emergency with respect to \nIran pursuant to IEEPA, and to prohibit the financing, management, or \nsupervision by United States persons of the development of Iranian \npetroleum resources. This action was in response to actions and \npolicies of the Government of Iran, including support for international \nterrorism, efforts to undermine the Middle East peace process, and the \nacquisition of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver \nthem. A copy of the order was provided to the Speaker of the House and \nthe President of the Senate by letter dated March 15, 1995.\n  Following the imposition of these restrictions with regard to the \ndevelopment of Iranian petroleum resources, Iran continued to engage in \nactivities that represent a threat to the peace and security of all \nnations, including Iran's continuing support for international \nterrorism, its support for acts that undermine the Middle East peace \nprocess, and its intensified efforts to acquire weapons of mass \ndestruction. On May 6, 1995, I issued Executive Order 12959 to further \nrespond to the Iranian threat to the national security, foreign policy, \nand economy of the United States.\n  Executive Order 12959 (60 Fed. Reg. 24757, May 9, 1995) (1) prohibits \nexportation from the United States to Iran or to the Government of Iran \nof goods, technology, or services; (2) prohibits the reexportation of \ncertain U.S. goods and technology to Iran from third countries; (3) \nprohibits dealings by United States persons in goods and services of \nIranian origin or owned or controlled by the Government of Iran; (4) \nprohibits new investments by United States persons in Iran or in \nproperty owned or controlled by the Government of Iran; (5) prohibits \nU.S. companies and other United States persons from approving, \nfacilitating, or financing performance by a foreign subsidiary or other \nentity owned or controlled by a United States person of certain \nreexport, investment, and trade transactions that a United States \nperson is prohibited from performing; (6) continues the 1987 \nprohibition on the importation into the United States of goods and \nservices of Iranian origin; (7) prohibits any transaction by a United \nStates person or within the United States that evades or avoids or \nattempts to violate any prohibition of the order; and (8) allowed U.S. \ncompanies a 30-day period in which to perform trade transactions \npursuant to contracts predating the Executive order.\n  At the time of signing Executive Order 12959, I directed the \nSecretary of the Treasury to authorize, through specific licensing, \ncertain transactions, including transactions by United States persons \nrelated to the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in The Hague, \nestablished pursuant to the Algiers Accords, and related to other \ninternational obligations and United States Government functions, and \ntransactions related to the export of agricultural commodities pursuant \nto preexisting contracts consistent with section 5712(c) of title 7, \nUnited States Code. I also directed the Secretary of the Treasury, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of State, to consider authorizing \nUnited States persons through specific licensing to participate in \nmarket-based swaps of crude oil from the Caspian Sea area for Iranian \ncrude oil in support of energy projects in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and \nTurkmenistan.\n\n  Executive Order 12959 revoked sections 1 and 2 of Executive Order \n12613 of October 29, 1987, and sections 1 and 2 of Executive Order \n12957 of March 15, 1995, to the extent they are inconsistent with it. A \ncopy of Executive Order 12959 was transmitted to the Speaker of the \nHouse and the President of the Senate by letter dated May 6, 1995.\n  2. On March 5, 1997, I renewed for another year the national \nemergency with respect to Iran pursuant to IEEPA. This renewal extended \nthe authority for the current comprehensive trade embargo against Iran \nin effect since May 1995. Under these sanctions, virtually all trade \nwith Iran is prohibited except for trade in information and \ninformational materials and certain other limited exceptions.\n  3. On August 19, 1997, I issued Executive Order 13059 in order to \nclarify the steps taken in Executive Order 12957 and Executive Order \n12959, to confirm that the embargo on Iran prohibits all trade and \ninvestment activities by United States persons, wherever located, and \nto consolidate in one order the various prohibitions previously imposed \nto deal with the national emergency declared on March 15, 1995. A copy \nof Executive Order 13059 was transmitted to the Speaker of the House \nand the President of the Senate by letter dated August 19, 1997.\n  The order prohibits (1) the importation into the United States of any \ngoods or services of Iranian origin or owned or controlled by the \nGovernment of Iran except information or informational material; (2) \nthe exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply from the United States \nor by a United States person, wherever located, of goods, technology, \nor services to Iran or the Government of Iran, including knowing \ntransfers to a third country for direct or indirect supply, \ntransshipment, or reexportation to Iran or the Government of Iran, or \nspecifically for use in the production, commingling with, or \nincorporation into goods, technology, or services to be supplied, \ntransshipped, or reexported exclusively or predominantly to Iran or the \nGovernment of Iran; (3) reexportation from a third country of \ncontrolled U.S.-origin goods, technology, or services by a person other \nthan a United States person; (4) purchase, sale, transport, swap, \nbrokerage, approval, financing, facilitation, guarantee, or other \ntransactions or dealings by United States persons, wherever located, \nrelated to direct or indirect trade with Iran or the Government of Iran \nor to goods or services of Iranian origin or owned or controlled by the \nGovernment of Iran; (5) new investment by United States persons in Iran \nor in property or entities owned or controlled by the Government of \nIran; (6) approval, financing, facilitation, or guarantee by a United \nStates person of any transaction by a foreign person that a United \nStates person would be prohibited from performing under the embargo; \nand (7) any evasion, avoidance, or attempt to violate a prohibition \nunder the order.\n  Executive Order 13059 became effective at 12:01 a.m., eastern \ndaylight time on August 20, 1997. Revocation of corresponding \nprovisions in prior Executive orders does not affect the applicability \nof those provisions, or of regulations, licenses, or other \nadministrative actions taken pursuant to those provisions, with respect \nto any transaction or violation occurring before the effective date of \nExecutive Order 13059. Specific licenses issued pursuant to prior \nExecutive orders continue in effect, unless revoked or amended by the \nSecretary of the Treasury. General licenses, regulations, orders, and \ndirectives issued pursuant to prior orders continue in effect, except \nto the extent inconsistent with Executive Order 13059 or otherwise \nrevoked or modified by the Secretary of the Treasury.\n  4. The Iranian Transactions Regulations, 31 CFR Part 560 (the \n``ITR''),\n\n[[Page S9513]]\n\nwere amended on April 18, 1997 (62 Fed. Reg. 19670, April 23, 1997), on \nJuly 30, 1997 (62 Fed. Reg. 41851, August 4, 1997), and on August 25, \n1997 (62 Fed. Reg. 45098, August 25, 1997). In April 1997, Section \n560.603 was amended to require a United States person to file a \ntransaction report as to each foreign affiliate that engages in \nreportable oil-related transactions involving Iran of $1,000,000 or \nmore during the calendar quarter.\n  In July 1997, sections 560.510(d)(1) and (d)(2) were amended to \ngenerally license all payments of awards against Iran issued by the \nIran-U.S. Claims Tribunal in The Hague, irrespective of the source of \nfunds for payment, and to generally license implementation (except \nexports or reexports that are subject to export license application \nrequirements of Federal agencies other than the Department of the \nTreasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)) as well as payment \nof awards or settlements in cases to which the United States Government \nis a party.\n  Sections 560.525(a)(3) and (a)(5)(i) were amended to generally \nlicense the provision of legal services to initiate and conduct U.S. \ncourt and other domestic legal proceedings on behalf of persons in Iran \nor the Government of Iran and to initiate proceedings to resolve \ndisputes between the Government of Iran or an Iranian national and the \nUnited States or a United States national, notwithstanding the \nprohibition on exportation of services to Iran. On August 25, 1997, \ngeneral reporting, record keeping, licensing, and other procedural \nregulations were moved from the ITR to a separate part (31 CFR Part \n501) dealing solely with such procedural matters. (62 Fed. Reg. 45098, \nAugust 25, 1997). A copy of these amendments is attached.\n  5. During the current 6-month period, OFAC made numerous decisions \nwith respect to applications for licenses to engage in transactions \nunder the ITR, and issued 12 licenses. The majority of denials were in \nresponse to requests to authorize commercial exports to Iran--\nparticularly of machinery and equipment for various industries--and the \nimportation of Iranian-origin goods. The licenses issued authorized \ncertain financial transactions, including those relating to disposal of \nU.S.-owned goods located in Iran and extension of, but not payment \nunder, standby letters of credit. Pursuant to sections 3 and 4 of \nExecutive Order 12959 and consistent with the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-\nProliferation Act of 1992 and other statutory restrictions concerning \ncertain goods and technology, including those involved in air-safety \ncases, Treasury continues to consult with the Departments of State and \nCommerce on these matters.\n  The U.S. financial community continues to scrutinize transactions \nassociate with Iran and to consult with OFAC about their appropriate \nhandling. Many of these inquiries have resulted in investigations into \nthe activities of U.S. parties and, where appropriate, the initiation \nof enforcement action.\n  6. On March 20, 1997, a seven-count indictment was returned by a \ngrand jury in the District of Maryland against a U.S. resident and two \nIranian co-conspirators. The March indictment superseded a two-count \nindictment handed down on February 13, 1997. Each indictment charged \nviolations of IEEPA and the ITR involving the attempted exportation \nfrom the United States to Iran of sophisticated state-of-the-art gas \nchromatographs used in the electric power industry, which were \nprevented from reaching Iran.\n  The U.S. Customs Service has continued to effect numerous seizures of \nIranian-origin merchandise, primarily carpets, for violation of the \nimport prohibitions of the ITR. Various enforcement actions carried \nover from previous reporting periods are continuing and new reports of \nviolations are being aggressively pursued. Since my last report on \nMarch 14, 1997, OFAC has collected four civil monetary penalties \ntotaling nearly $22,000. The violations relate to the unlicensed import \nfrom or exports of goods to Iran. Civil penalty action is pending \nagainst 37 companies, financial institutions, and individuals for \nviolations of the Regulations.\n\n  7. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month \nperiod from March 15 through September 14, 1997, that are directly \nattributable to the exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the \ndeclaration of a national emergency with respect to Iran are \napproximately $850,000, most of which represent wage and salary costs \nfor Federal personnel. Personnel costs were largely centered in the \nDepartment of the Treasury (particularly in the Office of Foreign \nAssets Control, the U.S. Customs Service, the Office of the Under \nSecretary for Enforcement, and the Office of the General Counsel), the \nDepartment of State (particularly the Bureau of Economic and Business \nAffairs, the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, the Bureau of Intelligence \nand Research, and the Office of the Legal Adviser), and the Department \nof Commerce (the Bureau of Export Administration and the General \nCounsel's Office).\n  8. The situation reviewed above continues to present an extraordinary \nand unusual threat to the national security, foreign policy, and \neconomy of the United States. The declaration of the national emergency \nwith respect to Iran contained in Executive Order 12957 and the \ncomprehensive economic sanctions imposed by Executive Order 12959 \nunderscore the United States Government opposition to the actions and \npolicies of the Government of Iran, particularly its support of \ninternational terrorism and its efforts to acquire weapons of mass \ndestruction and the means to deliver them. The Iranian Transactions \nRegulations issued pursuant to Executive Order 12957 and 12959 continue \nto advance important objectives in promoting the nonproliferation and \nantiterrorism policies of the United States. I shall exercise the \npowers at my disposal to deal with these problems and will report \nperiodically to the Congress on significant developments.\n                                                  William J.

Mr. President. I am proud today to introduce--along with \nmy colleagues Senators Kennedy, Abraham, Leahy, and DeWine--the Mother \nTeresa fee waiver bill of 1997.\n\n  While daily newscasts focus our attention on the scourge of senseless \ncrime and deadly drugs in our country and around the world, Mother \nTeresa's death last week focused the world's attention on the simple \ngood works that are all too often overlooked.\n  As the flag of India was draped over Mother Teresa, an observer \ncommented ``She now belongs to the State.'' I think it is more accurate \nto say that Mother Teresa has and will always belong to the world. In \nan era where the phrase ``global economy'' has become commonplace, \nMother Teresa represented a ``global morality.'' Her good works, and \nthose of so many other religious organizations around the world are \nnot, and should not be, confined by national borders and boundaries.\n  Shortly before her death, Mother Teresa personally sought a waiver of \nthe fees charged to her missionaries seeking to enter this country on a \ntemporary basis to help the poorest of the poor and the sickest of the \nsick in our own cities. Of course, she was absolutely right. We should \ngive thanks to these kind and giving persons who travel to foreign \nlands for no other purpose than to give of themselves to help the \nneediest in those lands. Instead, we've been charging them. It is an \nabsurd situation that needs to be remedied.\n  I am, therefore, pleased today to stand with my colleagues in \nintroducing a simple and straightforward bill that would waive the fees \nfor persons coming here temporarily for the purpose of engaging in \ncharitable activities to help the needy. This bill is but one small but \nfitting and timely tribute to Mother Teresa who stood under 5 feet but \nwhose goodness and righteousness made her tower among us.\n  I look forward to the Senate's swift action on this measure.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am pleased to join with Senator Hatch in sponsoring \nlegislation requested by Mother Teresa to waive visa application fees \nfor religious workers coming to the United States to perform charitable \nwork for temporary periods.\n  During her visits to the United States, Mother Teresa asked President \nClinton to take this step to waive visa fees for her missionaries \ncoming to work in this country. Her Missionaries of Charity come to \nAmerica to help the poor in our communities and to minister to the sick \nand the elderly. Each time they travel here, they are required to pay a \n$120 visa fee to the U.S. Government.\n  It makes no sense to require these religious workers to pay a fee to \nthe Federal Government in order to come here to help our communities. \nThe legislation we introduce today would waive the fee in these \ninstances.\n  This past weekend, while attending Mother Teresa's funeral in India, \nthe First Lady met with Sister Nirmala, Mother Teresa's successor at \nthe Missionaries of Charity Order in Calcutta. Sister Nirmala asked \nonce again for a waiver of the visa fee and was delighted to learn that \nthe U.S. Senate would be considering legislation this week to \naccomplish this goal as Mother Teresa had requested.\n  This is an important step that Congress can take to honor the memory \nof Mother Theresa and the compassionate work that her order brings to \nAmerica. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of \nlegislation\n\n[[Page S9516]]\n\nauthored by Senators Hatch and Kennedy to waive the visa fees for \nreligious workers who enter to perform charitable functions.\n  It is not in the U.S. interest to impose fees that inhibit or \notherwise burden individuals who seek to help our communities. Mother \nTeresa spoke specifically of eliminating these fees for members of her \nmission coming to the United States to serve the poor, so as to make \nthe money available for more good works. I applaud Senators Hatch and \nKennedy for introducing this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 1185. A bill to provide employees with more access to information \nconcerning their pension plans and with additional mechanisms to \nenforce their rights under such plans; to the Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources.\n\n\n                         THE PENSION TOOLS ACT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce \nthe Pension Tools Act of 1997. Why pension tools? Because this \nlegislation contains the components, or tools that will assist pension \nparticipants and retirees to understand the fundamentals of their \npension plans, get them to think about their retirement for the long \nterm, and when problems arise--help put in place a cost-effective \nconflicts resolution process.\n  This legislation is very important to today's retirees and workers. \nIn June, the Senate Aging Committee, which I chair, convened a hearing \nwhich highlighted the growing problem of pension mistakes. That's \nright, Mr. President. A pension mistake. The problem addressed at the \nhearing did not target intentional wrongdoing--but honest mistakes by \nemployers which can lead to a cut in a monthly pension payment or a \nlump-sum payment a worker takes when leaving a job.\n  It's impossible to determine how big the problem is, but it is a \ngrowing concern. To try to document how big the problem could be, I \nasked the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation [PBGC] to provide me \nwith data about a program they administer called the standard \ntermination audit program. The program audits a sample of plans which \nhave terminated--these are not plans which have gone bankrupt. The PBGC \nreleased a letter to my committee which showed that certain pension \npayouts have errors in the range of 8 percent. That number has \nincreased since the program started back in 1986 when it was 2 percent. \nMany of these errors involve substantial sums of money. In fact, one in \nthree people who were shortchanged, were shortchanged by at least \n$1,000.\n  Other pension experts and advocates would put the number of mistakes \nat a higher rate--in the range of 15 to 20 percent. But we just can't \nsay what the number is because none of the agencies who regulate \npensions audit whether or not the pensions and lump-sum payments that \nare made to the majority of workers and retirees are usually accurate. \nMost employers are doing their best to pay the right amount but \nmistakes do happen. The problem is that people are not aware that they \nreally need to verify that their pension payouts are the right amount.\n  The hearing called attention to that very problem. Too many workers \nlack a full understanding of how their pension works and how much their \nbenefit will be until just before retirement.\n  It is my hope that this legislation will be a vital part of our \neffort to educate people about the need to prepare for retirement. One \nof the components of good retirement preparation is tracking your \nemployer-provided pension and knowing your pension rights.\n  Specifically, this legislation will give employees the opportunity to \nhave benefit statements sent to them on a regular basis. In addition, \nthe legislation clarifies that pension plan participants and \nbeneficiaries should have access to plan documents which show how their \npension benefit was calculated. That way, they can check the math and \nverify that their benefit is correct.\n  My bill will also address two other problems raised at the hearing. \nFirst, one problem faced by pension participants and beneficiaries is \nthat employers are slow to respond to their requests for information. \nTo address that problem, we will authorize the Secretary of Labor to \nassess a fine if an employer fails or refuses to provide information in \na timely manner. The other problem that this bill will address is to \nclarify that a person who has been cashed out of a plan can still get \ninformation from the plan administrator if a problem arises after the \nperson separates from employment.\n  Senator Breaux and I are also including a directive to the Secretary \nof Labor to draft model procedures for alternative dispute resolution. \nThe enforcement option open to pension participants now--a lawsuit--is \nsimply too costly for many people who are living on a fixed income.\n  Part of the problem we see is that pensions are very complex. It is \nhard for employers to administer pensions even with the expert advice \nof paid pension consultants. I am continuing to seek ways to alleviate \nsome of the pressure on employers. We have already taken the first step \nof asking the General Accounting Office to review the changes in the \nlaw since the passage of GATT--this had an impact on interest rates--\none of the areas where we see the most problems in pension errors. We \nare also looking into the usefulness of mandating that employers \nprovide a summary annual report of the pension plan to participants \nevery year. These summary reports are not user-friendly and do not \nprovide the participants with information in an accessible way. Benefit \nstatements and the use of education and outreach may provide a \nsubstitute for the annual mailing of summary annual reports to pension \nparticipants.\n  I am also submitting for the Record two letters of support for the \nlegislation. The first letter is from the Pension Rights Center here in \nWashington, DC. The center has a long history as an effective advocate \nfor participant rights. The second letter was submitted by the American \nSociety of Pension Actuaries. This group strongly supports the idea of \nautomatic benefit statements and we will certainly work with them to \nclarify language in the legislation.\n  While great strides have been made since the act went into effect, \nparticipants and beneficiaries still lack access to basic but vital \ninformation and tools to enforce their rights. Having a pension can \nmake all the difference to people once they retire. The Pension Tools \nAct strikes the right balance to get people useful information about \ntheir pensions and help them enforce basic rights to that information. \nI urge my colleagues to support the efforts of Senator Breaux and \nmyself to ensure that retirees and workers get every penny they have \nearned when the time comes to retire.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                               American Society of\n\n\n                                            Pension Actuaries,\n\n                                Arlington, VA, September 16, 1997.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Special Committee on Aging, U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Grassley: The American Society of Pension \n     Actuaries appreciates your efforts to ensure that plan \n     participants and beneficiaries have sufficient information \n     about their plan benefits. ASPA believes that better informed \n     participants will become more active participants. \n     Particularly, ASPA strongly supports your proposals to \n     provide for participant benefit statements and benefit \n     calculations. This invaluable information will allow plan \n     participants to more accurately plan for retirement.\n       We agree conceptually with the other proposals outlined in \n     the ``Summary of Pension Tools Act of 1997,'' which was \n     provided to us by your staff. However, we are unable to more \n     fully endorse the entire bill until we have had an \n     opportunity to review the detailed legislative language. \n     Further, we would like to alert you about two general \n     concerns we have pertaining to two of the proposals outlined.\n       First, one of the proposals would treat participants who \n     have been ``cashed out'' of the plan as ``active'' \n     participants for purposes of obtaining information about the \n     plan as allowed under the Employee Retirement Income Security \n     Act. Although we appreciate the general objective underlying \n     this proposal, we are concerned if the proposal would allow, \n     for instance, a former participant to request a benefit \n     calculation after ten years. Such a request would be a \n     tremendous hardship on the plan sponsor or plan administrator \n     since in most cases such records are not retained for a long \n     period of time. We would suggest giving participants a fixed \n     period of time--such as 18 months after they have received \n     their benefits--to request this information.\n\n[[Page S9517]]\n\n       Second, another proposal would require the Secretary of \n     Labor to develop model alternative dispute resolution \n     procedures. We agree that such procedures can often be a more \n     efficient means for resolving disputes, and we also agree \n     with your conclusion to give plans the option of choosing to \n     adopt such procedures. The summary further indicates that the \n     Secretary of Labor would formulate a list of neutral experts \n     to serve as mediators. We are concerned that such a list \n     would become politicized. Consequently, we would suggest as \n     an alternative that the Secretary of Labor be tasked with \n     simply maintaining the list and that any pension professional \n     meeting objective qualification requirements be permitted to \n     be listed.\n       We hope these comments are helpful and we look forward to \n     working with you and your staff toward passage of this \n     legislation.\n           Respectfully,\n                                             Brian H.

Your proposed legislation will help assure that \n     employees will receive accurate and timely information about \n     their future pension benefits. It will also give retirees the \n     opportunity to check the accuracy of plan calculations, and \n     develop an inexpensive forum where they can challenge \n     improper benefit denials.\n           Sincerely your,\n                                                Karen W.

A bill to provide for education and training, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                the workforce investment partnership act\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, as a member of the Senate Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee and chairman of the Subcommittee on \nEmployment and Training, I have spent the last few years examining our \nFederal job training programs. During this examination, it has become \nclear to me as well as many others, that these programs are in dire \nneed of reform. The status quo is just plain unacceptable.\n  What we are faced with today is a fragmented and duplicative maze of \nnarrowly focused programs administered by numerous Federal agencies \nthat lack coordination, a coherent strategy to provide training \nassistance, and the confidence of the two key consumers who utilize \nthese services--those seeking the training, and those businesses \nseeking to hire them. Despite spending billions of tax dollars each \nyear on job training programs, most Federal agencies do not know how \ntheir programs work and if their programs are really helping people \nfind jobs.\n  Here is what we do know. Today's job training system is no system at \nall--it is a complex patchwork of numerous rules, regulations, \nrequirements, and overlapping bureaucratic responsibilities. As a \nresult, programs are largely ineffective. Frustration and confusion is \nwidespread throughout the system--by program administrators and \nemployers, and most important, by those seeking assistance. People have \ndifficulty knowing where to begin to look for training assistance \nbecause there are no clear points of entry and no clear paths from one \nprogram to another.\n  This is frustration at the breaking point.\n  Frustration to the point that business community participation, which \nis absolutely necessary for success, is waning.\n  Frustration to the point that community activists, again whose \nparticipation is absolutely necessary for success, are becoming \ndisenchanted.\n  Frustration to the point that we have begun to question our \ncommitment to job training.\n  Fragmentation, duplication, ineffectiveness, and frustration--these \nare the words that describe the current Federal job training apparatus. \nThat is the status quo. That is unacceptable. That is largely why \nreform is needed now.\n  There are other important reasons why reform is necessary. The \neconomic future of our country depends on a well-trained work force. I \nhave heard from employers at every level who find it increasingly \ndifficult to attract and find qualified employees for high-skilled, \nhigh-paying jobs as well as qualified entry level employees. If we are \ngoing to remain economically competitive, we must address this growing \nshortage of workers.\n  Reform also is needed if the welfare reform bill Congress passed last \nyear is going to have any chance of succeeding. We need to provide \nStates with the tools necessary to develop a comprehensive system to \nassist people make work, not welfare, their way of life.\n  To achieve all of these goals, job training is the key.\n  The bill that I introduce today with Senators Jeffords, Kennedy, and \nWellstone represents a bipartisan belief that we can do better and we \ncan achieve these goals. We can replace the current system of \nfrustration and provide a framework for success.\n  By removing or reforming outdated rules and regulations, we can \nremove the barriers that have stymied reform in the past. We can \nempower States to boldly move forward, transforming the current \npatchwork of programs into a comprehensive system to make it easier for \nall consumers seeking assistance to receive assistance.\n  Just like we did with welfare reform, job training reform is about \nrecognizing the leadership of States that have shown innovation and \ninitiative over the last few years, even in the midst of numerous \nFederal barriers and obstacles. It is about allowing them and \nencouraging them to continue with the innovations they have implemented \nwithout Federal reform legislation.\n  We can establish a framework for a system that provides consumer \nchoice. Individuals seeking assistance should have a say in where, how, \nand what training they will receive. At the same time, the Federal \nbureaucracy should not engage in micro-management by mandating vouchers \nor any other specific local delivery system. This is a decision that \nbelongs to the States and localities. This bill takes the opposite \napproach--it provides States and localities the flexibility to develop \ntraining programs that meet the real needs of those seeking training. \nIt is to the consumer that these programs should be tailored to, not \nWashington.\n  We can establish an accountable system. Training programs must \ndemonstrate their effectiveness to be certified as eligible programs. \nThis means proving that training leads to meaningful, unsubsidized \nemployment--showing how many people were placed, at what cost, and how \nmany people remained employed 6 months to a year later. We owe this to \nthe individuals seeking assistance and to the American taxpayers who \npays for these programs.\n  We can establish a framework that not only allows for business \ncommunity involvement, but business community leadership. The private \nsector must outline their employment needs and assist in the design of \ntraining programs.\n  The Workforce Investment Partnership Act incorporates all of these \nprinciples. The programs incorporated in the legislation include job \ntraining, vocational education, and adult education. Additionally, it \nprovides strong, mandatory linkages to welfare to work, Wagner-Peyser, \nJob Corps, Older Americans, Vocational Rehabilitation, the Bureau of \nApprenticeship and Training, veterans, Trade Adjustment Assistance, as \nwell as other training related programs.\n  While separate funding streams will be maintained for each of the \nactivities, in recognition of their function, States and localities \nwill be empowered with the tools and the flexibility to implement real \nreform in order to provide comprehensive services to those seeking \nassistance.\n  Under this bill, States will have the ability to submit a unified \nplan for all of the programs incorporated in and linked to this \nlegislation to the appropriate Secretary describing how they will \ncoordinate services in order to avoid duplication.\n  Statewide and local partnerships, led by the business community, will \nbe established to assist in the development of such a plan, set policy \nfor training, and generally advise the appropriate elected official \noverseeing the system.\n  At the local level, all services provided must be accessible through \na one stop customer service system. Consumers, both employers and job \nseekers seeking assistance, will be able to receive comprehensive \ninformation regarding the availability, eligibility,\n\n[[Page S9518]]\n\nand quality of the programs. With this kind of system, we can remove \nthe confusion and frustration inherent in the current programs.\n  Finally, training will be delivered under a framework of an \nindividual training account which will be used to ensure the principle \nof consumer choice. The specific nature of the individuals training \naccount will be determined by States and localities.\n  In conclusion, I would like to thank my colleagues, Senators \nJeffords, Kennedy, and Wellstone, as well as the other members of the \nSubcommittee of Employment and Training for their cooperation and \ndedication in developing a piece of legislation that moves us forward. \nThis has been a bipartisan effort from Day One. I believe that level of \ncooperation and leadership is essential if we are to have a chance to \npass real reform.\n  There have been a number of orgnizations--both public and private--\nwho have participated in an open and constructive process used to \ndevelop this legislation. Their input has been vital.\n  Again, the Workforce Investment Partnership Act is designed to \naddress and reform the Federal Government's role in providing job \ntraining assistance to Americans. For too long, that role has been to \nfoster confusion, frustration and complication. With this bill, we \noffer a new foundation, and a positive framework for success. Instead \nof rules that tie the hands of States and localities, this bill \nprovides the tools to empower them to develop comprehensive work force \ninvestment systems that address the needs of job seekers and employers. \nThis bill is a road map to a better system, and if we are to achieve \nthe goals we have set--a stronger economy, a better-trained work force, \nand welfare reform--we need to begin that journey today.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, an educated work force has become the \nmost valuable resource in the modern economy. Our Nation's long term \neconomic vitality depends on the creation of an effective, accessible, \nand accountable system of job training and career development which is \nopen to all our citizens. Schools must assume more responsibility for \npreparing their students to meet the challenges of the 21st century \nworkplace. Disadvantaged adults and out of school youth need the \nopportunity to develop job skills which will make them productive \nmembers of the community. Dislocated workers who have been displaced by \nthe rapid pace of technological change deserve the chance to pursue new \ncareers. The way in which we respond to these challenges today will \ndetermine how prosperous a nation we are in the next century.\n  The importance of highly developed employment skills has never been \ngreater. The gap in earnings between skilled and unskilled workers is \nsteadily widening. For those who enter the work force with good \nacademic training and well developed career skills, this new economy \noffers almost unlimited potential. However, for those who lack basic \nproficiency in language, math and science and who have no career \nskills, the new economy presents an increasingly hostile environment.\n  The Workforce Investment Partnership Act which I am introducing with \nSenators Jeffords, DeWine, and Wellstone will provide employment \ntraining opportunities for millions of Americans. It responds to the \nchallenge of the changing workplace by enabling men and women to both \nacquire the skills necessary to enter the work force and upgrade their \nskills throughout their careers. It will provide access to the \neducational tools that will enable them not only to keep up, but to get \nahead.\n  The legislation which we will be introducing represents a true \ncollaboration of our four offices. I want to publicly commend Senators \nJeffords and DeWine for the genuine spirit of bipartisanship which has \nmade this collaborative effort possible. Senator Wellstone and I \nappreciate it. Over the last 6 months, each of us has devoted an \nenormous amount of time and effort to fashioning a legislative \nconsensus which will truly expand career options, encourage greater \nprogram innovation, and facilitate cooperative efforts amongst \nbusiness, labor, education, and State and local government. While each \nof us can cite provisions in this bill which we would like to change, \nwe all believe that the Workforce Investment Partnership Act will \naccomplish our principal goals.\n  I also want to recognize the important role President Clinton has \nplayed in bringing about this dramatic reform of our current job \ntraining system. He has consistently emphasized the need for greater \nindividual choice in the selection of career paths and training \nproviders. The philosophy behind the skill grant proposal is reflected \nin our legislation.\n  The Workforce Investment Partnership Act is designed to provide easy \naccess to state of the art employment training programs which are \ngeared to real job opportunities in the community. The cornerstones of \nthis new system are individual choice and quality labor market \ninformation. In the past, men and women seeking new careers often did \nnot know what job skills were most in demand and which training \nprograms had the best performance record. All to often, they were \nforced to make one of the most important decisions in their lives based \non anecdotes and late-night advertisements.\n  No training system can function effectively without accurate and \ntimely information. The frequent unavailability of quality labor market \ninformation is one of the most serious flaws in the current system. In \norder to make sound career choices, prospective trainees need both \ndetailed information on local career opportunities and performance \nbased information on training providers. That information will now be \navailable at easily accessible one stop employment centers, along with \ncareer counseling and other employment services. The legislation places \na strong emphasis on providing information about what area industries \nare growing, what skills those jobs require, and what earning potential \nthey have. Extensive business community participation is encouraged in \ndeveloping this information. Once a career choice is made, the \nindividual must still select a training provider. At present, many \napplicants make that choice with a little or no reliable information. \nUnder our bill, each training provider will have to publicly report \ngraduation rates, job placement and retention rates, and average \nearnings of graduates.\n  Because of the extensive information which will be available to each \napplicant, real consumer choice in the selection of a career and of a \ntraining provider will be possible. The legislation establishes \nindividual training accounts for eligible participants, which they can \nuse to access career education and skill training programs. Men and \nwomen seeking training assistance will no longer be limited to a few \npredetermined options. As long as there are real job opportunities in \nthe field selected and the training provider meets established \nperformance standards, the individual will be free to choose which \noption best suits his or her needs.\n  This legislation will organize the delivery of services more \neffectively and utilize resources more creatively. There will be a \nsignificant consolidation of the dozens of narrowly focused programs \nwhich currently exist into several broad funding streams for the \ndistinct populations needing assistance. Consolidation makes sense in \nthose areas in which multiple programs are currently serving the same \npopulation. However, it is equally important to preserve separate \nstreams of funding for distinct populations. The programmatic needs of \nmiddle age dislocated workers with extensive employment histories are \nquite different from the services required by young adults with limited \nskills and no work histories. Similarly the problems faced by out of \nschool youth require very different solutions than those confronting \nthe adult population. Ensuring that services which are designed to meet \nthe needs of each of these populations are available is a Federal \nresponsibility. For that reason, this legislation maintains distinct \nprograms with separate appropriations for dislocated workers, \ndisadvantaged adults, and at risk youth.\n  The WIPA gives State and local government significantly enhanced \ndiscretion in designing their training systems. If this reform is to be \ntruly responsive to those at the community level who are in need of \nservices, it is essential that the authority which the Federal \nGovernment delegates to the States be exercised through a broad\n\n[[Page S9519]]\n\nbased decisionmaking process. Governors, State legislatures, mayors, \nand other county and local officials should all have a meaningful voice \nin the design of a State's new job training system and they will under \nthis legislation. Local boards of business, labor, education and \ncommunity leaders are--in my opinion--essential to insuring that \nprograms meet the real world needs of participants, and that the \ntraining programs correspond to labor market demands. The success we \nhave had a Massachusetts has been due to large measure to active \nparticipation by local business leaders on the regional employment \nboards. WIPA strengthens the role of such boards, giving them major new \npolicy making responsibilities. These boards will play the primary role \nin assuring that training programs address the actual employment needs \nof area businesses.\n  An essential element of the new system we have designed in \naccountability. As I noted earlier, each training provider will have to \nmonitor and report the job placement and retention achieved by its \ngraduates and their average earnings. Only those training programs that \nmeet an acceptable performance standard will remain eligible for \nreceipt of public funds. The same principle of accountability is \napplied to those agencies administering State and local programs. They \nare being given wide latitude to innovate under this legislation. But \nthey too will be held accountable if they programs fail to meet \nchallenging performance targets.\n  There is no challenge facing America today which is tougher or more \nimportant than providing at risk, often out of school, youth with \nmeaningful education and employment opportunities. Far too many of our \nteenagers are being left behind without the skills needed to survive in \nthe 21st century economy. I am particularly proud of the commitment \nwhich the Workforce Investment Partnership Act makes to these young men \nand women. This legislation authorizes a new initiative focused on \nteenagers living in the most impoverished communities in America. These \nareas range from the poorest neighborhoods of our largest cities to \nimpoverished rural counties. Each year, the Secretary of Labor will \naward grants from a $250 million fund to innovative programs designed \nto provide opportunities to youth living in these areas. The programs \nwill emphasize mentoring, strong links between academic and worksite \nlearning, and job placement and retention. It will encourage broad \nbased community participation from local service agencies and area \nemployers. These model programs will, we believe, identify the \ntechniques which are most effective in reaching those youth at greatest \nrisk.\n  The Workforce Investment Partnership Act includes titles \nreauthorizing major vocational education and adult literacy programs. \nBoth programs will continue to be separately funded and independently \nadministered. We have incorporated them in the Workplace Act because \nthey must be integral components of any comprehensive strategy to \nprepare to meet the demands of the 21st century workplace. Students who \nparticipate in vocational education must be provided with broad based \ncareer preparation courses which meet both high academic standards and \nteach state of the art technological skills. Adult literacy programs \nare essential for the 27 percent of the adult population who have not \nearned a high school diploma or its equivalent. Learning to read and \ncommunicate effectively are the first steps to career advancement. In \nvocational education and adult literacy, we are placing the same \nemphasis on program accountability which we did in job training.\n\n  The Workforce Investment Partnership Act we are introducing today \nwill make it possible for millions of Americans to gain the skills \nneeded to compete in a global economy. In doing so, we are also \nenabling them to realize their personal American dreams.\n  In closing, I want to recognize the important contribution which \nStephen Springer, a key member of my staff during the 104th Congress, \nplayed in the evolution of job training reform. Tragically, he died at \na young age after a courageous battle with cancer. He believed that the \ntype of innovative work force development system which this legislation \nwould create had the potential to open doors of opportunity for \nmillions of Americans. His commitment was extraordinary. He continued \nto work on this issue even as his health was failing. He is no longer \nwith us, but he continues to inspire us. Stephen Springer's creative \nvision of a work force development system equal to the challenges of \nthe 21st century economy is reflected in the Workforce Investment \nPartnership Act. When enacted, it will be a wonderful legacy for this \nextraordinary individual.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, \nSenators DeWine, Jeffords, and Kennedy, in introducing the Workforce \nInvestment Partnership Act of 1997. This bipartisan bill is a major \naccomplishment for Americans who need Federal assistance to acquire \nskills to qualify for good jobs.\n  The bill also is a major accomplishment for my colleague from Ohio, \nSenator DeWine, Chairman of the Labor Committee's Employment and \nTraining Subcommitee, whom I commend for bringing us to this point \nthrough numerous valuable hearings and a rigorous, cooperative drafting \nprocess. A number of Minnesotans testified at our hearings. Groups from \nMinnesota and from around the country have been consulted and listened \nto. I thank both Senator DeWine and Senator Jeffords for the openness \nof the process. As always, I would also like to acknowledge the \nleadership of Senator Kennedy. His deep experience and commitment have \nhelped make this an excellent bill.\n  As leaders for our respective parties on the Subcommittee and on the \nfull Labor Committee, the four of us may not always agree on issues \nfacing America's working families. But we agree on this bill. It will \nfundamentally improve our Federal system of job training, adult and \nvocational education, and vocational rehabilitation programs.\n  The bill will help coordinate, streamline and decentralize our \nFederal job training system. It will make that system more accountable \nto real performance measures. It gives private sector employers--the \npeople who have jobs to offer and who need workers with the right \nskills--a greater role in directing policy at the State and local \nlevel, which is where most decision-making power resides in this bill. \nAnd it moves the whole country to where Minnesota has already moved \ndecisively: to a system of one-stop service centers where people can \nget all the information they need in one location. At these one stops, \npeople then will have the ability to make their own choices, based on \nthe best information, about which profession they want and ought to \npursue, about the skills and training they'll need, and about the best \nplace to get those skills and that training. I have visited one-stop \ncenters in Minnesota. They work.\n  In addition, and this is very important, our bill achieves the things \nI have mentioned above without neglecting the need to target resources \nfrom the Federal level to those who need them most: to disadvantaged \nadults and youth, and to dislocated workers.\n  That is crucial. This bill does not overreach. It does not block-\ngrant all Federal job training, adult education and vocational \neducation progams to governors. It retains crucial federal priorities, \nthen allows State and local authorities to decide how best to address \ntheir needs. That is why I believe this Congress will succeed where we \ndid not during the last Congress. We'll pass this bill, reach an \nacceptable conference agreement with the House, and send major, \nimportant legislation to the President for his signature.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Hollings and Mr. Thurmond):\n  S. 1187. A bill to suspend temporarily the duty on ferroboron; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                      DUTY SUSPENSION LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwith Senators Hollings and Thurmond to temporarily suspend the rate of \nduty imposed on imported ferroboron. Ferroboron is the key raw material \nin amorphous metal electrical power distribution transformer cores. \nTransformers using these cores reduce energy losses and greenhouse gas \nemissions associated with these losses by 60 to 80 percent when \ncompared to other transformer core technologies. This provides both \nincreased energy conservation and decreases environmental\n\n[[Page S9520]]\n\ndegradation in those developing nations where the most promising market \nopportunities exist.\n  While these benefits are tangible and significant, they, and the \nextensive research and development that yielded them, are costly. An \namorphous metal transformer has an initial cost 20 to 30 percent higher \nthan the less energy efficient and environmentally friendly \ntransformers it seeks to replace. Fortunately, because of its many \nbenefits, the total owning cost of an amorphous metal transformer over \nits 20- to 30-year life is far lower than the initially cheaper \ncompetition. Reducing the cost of an important and costly raw material, \nby suspending the duty paid on it, helps to ensure the cost-\ncompetitiveness of the end product in the export markets. This is good \nfor manufacturers, for American workers, and for our economy.\n  Mr. President, I have received assurances from my constituent, \nAlliedSignal, Inc., that there is no U.S. manufacturer of ferroboron, \nthus, this legislation does not adversely affect any American business.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1187\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend chapters 83 and 85 of title 28, United \nStates Code, relating to the jurisdiction of the District Court for the \nDistrict of Columbia, and the United States Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n          THE COURT CONSISTENCY IN COMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Court \nConsistency in Communications Act of 1997. The purpose of this bill is \nto bring consistency to the judicial interpretation of some of the \ncentral provisions of the Telecommunications Act, to make sure that an \nappellate court with broad and deep understanding of these issues can \nbring its expertise to bear on them, and to resolve related litigation \nas quickly as possible. In many other areas, such as bankruptcy and \nlabor, strong precedent exists for consolidation of cases to bring \nabout more efficient and informed judgments.\n  This measure is simple, effective and straightforward. It \nconsolidates in the District of Columbia Federal courts all appeals of \nFCC decisions under title II of the Communications Act of 1934 and \nState commission decisions under section 252 of the Telecommunications \nAct of 1996. Let me tell you why this legislation is crucially needed.\n  The telecommunications industry accounts for about one-sixth of our \nnational economy. And almost 2 years ago we passed legislation designed \nto unleash competition in the industry. It was signed into law with \ngreat fanfare. As President Clinton said, ``Today with the stroke of \n[my] pen, competition and innovation can move as quick as light.'' But \nwe are still waiting for lower rates, better service, and greater \ninnovation that was promised when the Telecom Act was signed.\n  The sad truth is that the promise of the Telecom Act has gotten \nbogged down in litigation. Lawyers are arguing about the meaning of its \nprovisions in courts all across the country. Indeed, today a major \nchallenge to the FCC's jurisdiction over long distance service is being \nfiled in the Eighth Circuit. In my opinion, even under current law this \ncase should have been filed in the District of Columbia.\n  We don't, of course, want to take away people's ability to redress \ngrievances through the courts. The right to sue is, for better or \nworse, almost sacred to American culture. But while some people may \nchoose to wait for a resolution to emerge from the 93 different Federal \ndistrict courts and 12 distinct Federal circuits, to my mind the better \nway to bring competition to telecommunications markets is to have some \njudicial certainty about the rules of the game--and to have it sooner, \nrather than later. This bill should create the necessary framework for \npredictability in the courts, so that companies can shift their rivalry \nfrom the courtroom to the marketplace.\n  This proposal is not a panacea, but it does move us in the right \ndirection. By streamlining the appellate process, the Court Consistency \nin Communications Act will speed the arrival of local and long distance \ntelephone competition.

A bill to increase the criminal penalties for assaulting or \nthreatening Federal judges, their family members, and other public \nservants, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              the federal judiciary protection act of 1997\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, former Secretary of State, John \nFoster Dulles once stated that ``Of all the tasks of government, the \nmost basic is to protect its citizens against violence.'' While this \nhas been one of our biggest challenges, Congress has the ability to \nalso strengthen those laws that deter violence and provide protection \nto those whose careers are dedicated to protecting our families and \nalso our communities.\n  With that intent, I rise today with my colleague, Senator Hatch, to \nintroduce the Federal Judiciary Protection Act, a bill to provide \ngreater protection to Federal law enforcement officials and their \nfamilies. Under current law, a person who assaults, attempts to \nassault, or who threatens to kidnap or murder a member of the immediate \nfamily of a U.S. official, a U.S. judge, or a Federal law enforcement \nofficial, is subject to a punishment of a fine or imprisonment of up to \n5 years, or both. This legislation seeks to expand these penalties in \ninstances of assault with a weapon and a prior criminal history. In \nsuch cases, an individual could face up to 20 years in prison.\n  This legislation would also strengthen the penalties for individuals \nwho communicate threats through the mail. Currently, individuals who \nknowingly use the U.S. Postal Service to deliver any communication \ncontaining any threat are subject to a fine of up to $1,000 or \nimprisonment of up to 5 years. Under this legislation, anyone who \ncommunicates a threat could face imprisonment of up to 10 years.\n  Briefly, I would like to share an example illustrating the need for \nthis legislation. In my State of Oregon, Chief Judge Michael Hogan and \nhis family were subjected to frightening, threatening phone calls, \nletters, and messages from an individual who had been convicted of \nprevious crimes in Judge Hogan's courtroom. For months, he and his \nfamily lived with the fear that these threats to the lives of his wife \nand children could become reality, and, equally disturbing, that the \nindividual could be back out on the street again in a matter of a few \nmonths, or a few years.\n  Judge Hogan and his family are not alone. In April of this year, the \nwife of a circuit court judge in Florida was stalked by an individual \nwho had been convicted of similar offenses in 1994 and 1995. Mrs. Linda \nCope, the wife of Circuit Judge Charles Cope was leaving a shopping \nmall one afternoon and as pursued by a man named Stelios Kostakis. As \nshe left the parking lot, she realized that she was being followed and \nattempted to lose Kostakis by taking alternative routes and speeding \nthrough residential streets. In a desperate attempt, Mrs. Cope cut in \nfront of a semitrailer truck, risking a serious accident and possible \nloss of life, to escape. Even after this third offense, stalking the \nwife of a circuit court judge, he was sentenced to only 6 months on \nprobation and $150 in fines and other court costs.\n  In September 1996, Lawrence County Judge Dominick Motto was stalked, \nharassed, and subjected to terrorist threats by Milton C. Reiguert, who \nwas upset by a verdict in a case that Judge Motto had heard in his \ncourtroom. After hearing the verdict, Reiguert stated his intention to \n``point a rifle at his head and get what he wanted.''\n  Mr. President, these are only a few examples of vicious acts focused \nat our Federal law enforcement officials. As a member of the \nlegislative branch, I believe it is our responsibility to provide \nadequate protection to all Americans who serve to protect the life and \nliberty of every citizen in this Nation. I encourage my colleagues to \njoin us in sponsoring this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 1190. A bill to reform the financing of Federal elections; to the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n               the campaign finance integrity act of 1997\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, campaign finance reform is the catch \nphrase of the year in politics. The problem is that every Senator has a \ndifferent definition of reform, including myself. That is why today I \nam introducing the Campaign Finance Integrity Act. I want to ensure \nthat we change the campaign finance system without being \nunconstitutional and that flies in the face of the first amendment, \nespecially in light of the fact that today is the 210th anniversary of \nthe signing of the Constitution.\n  Some in Congress have stated that freedom of speech and the desire \nfor healthy campaigns in a healthy democracy are in direct conflict and \nthat you can't have both. But fortunately for those of us who believe \nin the first amendment rights of all American citizens, the Founding \nFathers and the Supreme Court are on our side.\n  Thomas Jefferson repeatedly stated the importance of the first \namendment and how it allows the people and the press the right to speak \ntheir minds freely. Jefferson clearly stated its importance back in \n1798 with, ``One of the amendments to the Constitution * * * expressly \ndeclares that `Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment \nof religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the \nfreedom of speech or of the press,' thereby guarding in the same \nsentence and under the same words, the freedom of religion, speech, and \nof the press; insomuch that whatever violates either throws down the \nsanctuary which covers the others.'' Again in 1808, he stated that \n``The liberty of speaking and writing guards our other liberties.'' And \nin 1823, Jefferson stated, ``The force of public opinion cannot be \nresisted when permitted freely to be expressed. The agitation it \nproduces must be submitted to.'' Jefferson knew and believed that if we \nbegin restricting what people say, how they say it, and how much they \ncan say, then we deny the first and fundamental freedom given to all \ncitizens.\n  The Supreme Court has also been very clear in its rulings concerning \ncampaign finance and the first amendment. Since the post-Watergate \nchanges to the campaign finance system, 24 congressional actions have \nbeen declared unconstitutional, with 9 rejections based on the first \namendment. Out of those nine four dealt directly with campaign finance \nreform laws. In each case, the Supreme Court has ruled that political \nspending is equal to political speech.\n  In the now famous decision, or infamous to some, Buckley versus \nValeo, the Court states that,\n\n       The First Amendment denies government the power to \n     determine that spending to promote one's political views is \n     wasteful, excessive, or unwise. In the free society ordained \n     by our Constitution it is not the government but the people--\n     individually as citizens and candidates and collectively as \n     associations and political committees--who must retain \n     control over the quantity and range of debate on public \n     issues in a political campaign.\n\n  Simply stated, the government cannot ration or regulate political \nspeech of an American through campaign spending limits any more than it \ncan tell the local newspaper how many papers it can print or what it \ncan print. This reinforces Jefferson's statement that to impede one of \nthese rights is to impede all first amendment rights.\n  Also, supporters of some of the campaign finance reform bills, \nbelieve that if we stop the growth of campaign spending and force \ngiveaways of public and private resources then all will be fine with \nthe campaign finance system. It seems to me that if you look at \nhistory, price controls didn't work in the 1970's and they won't work \nin the 1990's. The Supreme Court agrees and is again very clear in its \nintent on price controls in campaigns. The Buckley decision says, ``* * \n* the mere growth in the cost of federal election campaigns in and of \nitself provides no basis for governmental restrictions on the quality \nof campaign spending.* * *''\n  Campaigns are about ideas and expressing those ideas, no matter how \ngreat or small the means. The ``distribution of the humblest handbill'' \nto\n\n[[Page S9522]]\n\nthe ``expensive modes of communication'' are both indispensable \ninstruments of effective political speech. We should not force one \nsector to freely distribute our political ideas just because it is more \nexpensive than all the other sectors. So no matter how objectionable \nthe cost of campaigns are, the Supreme Court has stated that this is \nnot reason enough to restrict the speech of candidates or any other \ngroups involved in political speech.\n  We need a campaign finance bill that does not violate the first \namendment, while providing important provisions to open the campaign \nfinance of candidates up to the scrutiny of the American people and I \nbelieve the Campaign Finance Integrity Act does that.\n  My bill would: Require candidates to raise at least 50 percent of \ntheir contributions from individuals in the State or district in which \nthey are running; equalize contributions from individuals and political \naction committees, PAC's, by raising the individual limits from $1,000 \nto $2,500 and reducing the PAC limit from $5,000 to $2,500; index \nindividual and PAC contribution limits for inflation; reduce the \ninfluence of a candidate's personal wealth by allowing political party \ncommittees to match dollar for dollar the personal contribution of a \ncandidate above $5,000; require organizations, groups, and political \nparty committees to disclose within 24 hours the amount and type of \nindependent expenditures over $1,000 in support of or in opposition to \na candidate; require corporations and labor organizations to seek \nseparate, voluntary authorization of the use of any dues, initiative \nfees or payment as a condition of employment for political activity, \nand require annual full disclosure of those activities to members and \nshareholders; prohibit depositing of an individual contribution by a \ncampaign unless the individual's profession and employer are reported; \nencourage the Federal Elections Commission to allow filing of reports \nby computers and other emerging technologies and to make that \ninformation accessible to the public on the Internet less than 24 hours \nof receipt; ban the use of taxpayer financed mass mailings, and create \na tax deduction for political contributions up to $100 for individuals \nand $200 for a joint return.\n  This is commonsense campaign finance reform. It drives the candidate \nback into this district or State to raise money from individual \ncontributions. It has some of the most open, full, and timeliest \ndisclosure requirements of any other campaign finance bill in either \nthe Senate or the House of Representatives. I strongly believe that \nsunshine is the best disinfectant.\n  The right of political parties, groups, and individuals to say what \nthey want in a political campaign is preserved but the right of the \npublic to know how much they are spending and what they are saying is \nalso recognized. I have great faith that the public can make its own \ndecisions about campaign discourse if it is given full and timely \ninformation.\n  Many of the proponents of the more popular campaign finance bills try \nto reduce the influence of interests by suppressing their speech. I \nbelieve the best ways to reduce the special interests influence is to \nsuppress and reduce the size of government. If the government rids \nitself of special interest funding and corporate welfare, then there \nwould be little influence left for these large donors. Campaign \ncontributions would no longer be based on special interests but on \nideas. Let's stop corporate welfare, especially the Overseas Private \nInvestment Corporation, OPIC, where companies get a subsidized ride on \nthe backs of taxpayers in order to invest without risk or without the \nmarket controlling the outcome. The best way to eliminate corporate \nsubsidies is to eliminate the Department of Commerce, where a majority \nof corporate welfare programs are funded. To break special interest \nmoney, we must break the so-called iron triangle of big business, big \nlabor, and big government.\n  Ojbecting to the popular catch phrase of the moment is very difficult \nfor any politician, but turning your back on the first amendment is \nmore difficult for me. I want campaign finance reform but not at the \nexpense of the first amendment and that is what my legislation does. \nNot everyone will agree with the Campaign Finance Integrity Act and \nmany of us will disagree on this issue but the first amendment is the \nreason we can disagree.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1190\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I want to share with you and my \ncolleagues an interesting experience from the last recess. It's a great \nexample of the power of public-private partnerships. Improved mining \ntools, detection of land mines, public-private partnerships, and \nCooperative Threat Reduction programs may not seem to be closely \nrelated, but I visited with a small business that is demonstrating the \npower of integrating several different national programs into a focused \napproach to some of our most challenging technical problems. And the \nfact that this small business is located in a remote corner of New \nMexico, far from major population centers, is testimony to the ability \nof our nation's small business to compete in the most complex business \narenas by carefully utilizing the power of well crafted partnerships.\n  Larry Stolarczyk of Raton Technology Research (RTR), in Raton, NM \nleads this unique small business. He's built a range of products \nthrough partnerships with Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories \nusing different approaches. And he even brought in expertise from \nRussia through the Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention Program.\n  RTR tapped into different federal programs to build their products. \nIn some cases, they contracted directly with a national laboratory when \nthat laboratory had a unique capability that wasn't available from U.S. \nindustry. In that case, RTR paid the full support costs for the \nnational laboratory personnel. RTR has also used the CRADA or \nCooperative Research and Development Agreement approach, enabled by my \nNational Competitiveness and Technology Transfer Act of 1989. A CRADA \nenables cost-shared research involving both industry and laboratory \nscientists working toward common goals.\n  Where a research subject is closely related to a laboratory's \nmission, the CRADA is a wonderfully cost-effective way for industry to \ntap into national\n\n[[Page S9528]]\n\nlaboratory resources. Usually, industry pays only for their part in the \nCRADA partnership, with the national laboratory costs provided through \nDOE funding. Furthermore, the CRADA mechanism provides good protection \nto industry for jointly developed intellectual property.\n  Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention (IPP) is a program within \nthe Department of Energy. The program involves 10 national \nlaboratories, over 20 institutes in the Former Soviet Union, and well \nover 50 U.S. corporations. The U.S. companies form the U.S. Industry \nCoalition or USIC and Larry Stolarczyk was a founding member of USIC. \nIPP traces its origins to the Cooperative Threat Reduction program \nestablished by Senators Lugar and Nunn.\n  Each of RTR's products involves transmission of radio frequency waves \nand detection of reflected and scattered waves. Analysis of the return \nsignals documents characteristics of materials near the sensor.\n  With the IPP program, Larry Stolarczyk built a team that couples \nexpertise from Sandia National Laboratories with his company and with \nthe Sedakov Institute for Measuring Systems Research of Nizhny Novgorod \nin Russia.\n  They are developing a borehole radar system for mapping fractures \nwithin tens of meters surrounding a borehole in an oil/gas reservoir. \nPrecise understanding of these fractures outside the borehole enables \noptimization of the oil recovery strategy. Halliburton Logging Services \nis working with Raton Technology for initial field demonstrations.\n  The borehole radar tool can help reach some of the 300 billion \nbarrels of oil remaining under U.S. soil, oil that can reduce our \ndependence on foreign sources. Furthermore, while the Russian institute \nwas 100 percent supported by military missions before these programs \nstarted, it now has about 70 percent non-military support. Shifting \nthese institutes away from military support toward commercial projects \nis one of the strongest objectives of the IPP Program.\n  In Raton, New Mexico, coal mining has been an important industry, and \nthat's led RTR to apply its high technology capabilities to that \nsector. RTR has developed a Horizon Sensor to allow coal mining \nequipment to follow a coal seam. In coal mining, following that seam is \nimportant! Mining into the roof can cause a collapse, leaving \nsignificant coal in the seam reduces the profitability of the mine, and \nmining into the floor contaminates the coal. The low-tech solution is \nto have a miner posted near the cutting drum, not the world's safest \nlocation. The RTR approach mounts the sensor on the cutting head and \nallows measurements up to 20 feet ahead.\n  And now let me talk about RTR's contributions to locating land mines. \nI don't need to remind any of my colleagues that proliferation of land \nmines is a critical international problem. It's estimated that more \nthan 100 Million land mines are buried in third world countries. Daily \nheadlines discuss the tragic consequences of civilian encounters with \nthese mines. The innocent victims are frequently children, who may \nincur life-threatening injuries or as a minimum, are forced to face \nlife without some of their limbs. Around 27 Thousand people are killed \nor injured annually by land mines. Finding land mines, especially non-\nmetallic ones, is very difficult.\n  The landmine project is funded through the U.S. Army Night Vision \nLaboratory. Los Alamos and NASA Johnson Space Flight Center are \nsubcontractors to Raton Research. The instrument being build by Raton \nTechnology will detect and image mines with a hand-held device. It may \nbe the best chance we have of ridding the world of the scourge of non-\nmetallic land mines.\n  These experiences were especially interesting to me, since I have \nstrong personal interests in each of these national programs. I've \nencouraged partnerships between our national laboratories and U.S. \nindustry. These partnerships provide benefits to the taxpayer by \nstrengthening the laboratories for their national missions and they \ncertainly provide benefits to U.S. business by enabling new commercial \napplications of lab technologies.\n  In addition, I've been a strong supporter of the Cooperative Threat \nReduction programs designed to reduce the threat of proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction. IPP encourages interactions between our \nnational laboratories and institutes in the Former Soviet Union, and \nalso build opportunities for U.S. industries to work with these foreign \ninstitutes. These programs are designed to ensure that the scientists \nworking on weapons of mass destruction in these foreign institutes stay \nright where they are, and are not lured to rogue states to build new \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  I'm pleased to see that these national programs are really working \nand providing the benefits we intended.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/17/senate-section/article/S9527-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MAYOR DANNEL MALLOY\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to \ncongratulate the great city of Stamford, Connecticut, and Mayor Dannel \nMalloy, for having been ranked on the Children's Environmental Index as \none of the most ``kid-friendly'' cities in the United States. Normally \nwe consider the number 13 to be an unlucky number, but Stamford ranked \nnumber 13 of 219 cities in the nation on the quality of life for its \nchildren. Stamford was also ranked second in the nation in the \neducation category which included student-teacher ratio and drop-out \nrate. This index, measured by the organization Zero Population Growth \n(ZPG), is the sixth in a series of bi-annual studies used to focus \nattention on the quality of life in the nation's largest cities. It is \nthe third index which directly addresses the social and physical \nenvironment of children, measuring such areas as infant mortality, teen \npregnancy, childhood poverty, high school drop-out rates, air quality, \nand crime rates.\n  Mr. President, I was recently appointed by Minority Leader Tom \nDaschle to chair the Senate Democratic Strike Force for Kids named \n``Right Start 2000''. The purpose of this strike force is to develop \nconstructive ways for us in Washington to best address the educational, \nhealth, and safety needs of America's children in the first six years \nof life. It is very clear from this index that we have much to learn \nfrom many of our Nation's cities. Clearly Stamford and other cities are \ntaking bold and innovative steps to nurture our Nation's children.\n  The children of today are the leaders of the next millennium. As \nsuch, it is critical that we ensure they grow up in surroundings which \nprotect, nurture, educate, and care for them. Stamford has shown its \nwillingness to invest the resources necessary to produce the next \ngeneration of leaders. We can only hope that this index will give the \nimpetus to other cities to focus upon what is really critical for our \nfuture, healthy and happy children today.\n  The road toward a better future for our kids will be a collective \neffort on the part of parents, schools, religious institutions, \ncommunity, State, and national leaders. But this effort will be made \neasier in an environment where groups and individuals work in \npartnership with one another. I am delighted to know that this work is \ngoing on in my home State of Connecticut, and I particularly \ncongratulate Mayor Malloy and all of the people of Stamford for their \nachievements on behalf of Stamford's children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/17/senate-section/article/S9528-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9528-S9529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.
