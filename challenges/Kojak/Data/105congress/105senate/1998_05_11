Mr. President, today, I want to take a few minutes to speak \non the latest actions by the Federal Aviation Administration with \nrespect to its emergency inspection order of Boeing 737's.\n  Last Thursday, May 7th, the FAA issued an airworthiness directive \nwhich ordered the inspection and possible replacement of fuel tank \nwiring insulation in certain Boeing 737's, 747's and 767's. The FAA \norder for 737's required immediate action on an estimated 152 U.S. \nregistered Boeing 737-100 and -200 models with more than 50,000 hours \nof flying time. A second directive also ordered the operators of 264 \nBoeing 747's and 231 Boeing 767's to inspect wiring within 60 days.\n  Yesterday, Sunday May 10th, the FAA ordered the immediate inspection \nfor all older Boeing 737's with between 40,000 and 50,000 flight hours. \nThe FAA ordered that the aircraft could not be operated in commercial \nservice until mechanics could inspect, and repair, if needed, the fuel \ntank wiring. The FAA's action on Sunday came about after initial \ninspections by the airlines found additional evidence of electrical \nproblems in the fuel tank wires.\n  There is no question that the FAA's actions inconvenienced a number \nof travelers yesterday. The decision by the FAA to issue the emergency \norder was a tough call, but it was the right call to make. It also \ndemonstrates the FAA's continuing commitment to safety.\n  As Administrator Garvey said ``Safety is our highest transportation \npriority''. Her actions and words are to be commended. I wanted to come \nto the floor to recognize the actions of FAA Administrator Garvey. She \nand her staff acted quickly and decisively. Many of us around here have \noften taken to the floor to say that the FAA's first priority should be \nsafety. And the actions taken by Administrator Garvey are a clear \ndemonstration to all of us that the FAA is vigilant in improving safety \nwithin the aviation industry. The actions are also clear evidence of a \nchange in the culture of the FAA--that the agency is proactive in \nenforcing safety standards.\n  We should also acknowledge the actions taken by the airlines and the\n\n[[Page S4604]]\n\nBoeing Company. Working in partnership with the FAA, these inspections \nwere undertaken quickly and as a result, a potentially disastrous \nsituation was averted.\n  I, for one, feel re-assured this morning because of the actions taken \nby the FAA. I have always been confident that FAA Administrator Garvey \nwould do an outstanding job. Her actions over the weekend have only \ndeepened my confidence in and respect for her, and for the agency.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I may consume such \ntime as I may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/11/senate-section/article/S4603-6", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4604-S4606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  EULOGY TO SENATOR JENNINGS RANDOLPH\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it is my sad duty to announce to the Senate \nthe death on last Friday of our former colleague, U.S. Senator Jennings \nRandolph. With countless West Virginians, and with his many friends \nacross America, I am saddened by the passing of my longtime friend.\n  Jennings Randolph was a man possessed of a profound love for West \nVirginia and for the Nation. More, he was a man of seemingly boundless \nenergy and limitless horizons. Both in Government and in his several \nother fields of interest and expression, Senator Randolph seemed \nconstantly to be looking for ways to assist other people to achieve \ntheir own potential, or for avenues by which others might attain a \nbetter life for themselves. He was, paradoxically perhaps, an \nindefatigably optimistic realist. Jennings Randolph knew that life \noften demands struggle and many times ends in defeat; but for every \nproblem, Jennings believed that good-willed, intelligent, and decent \nmen and women could find solutions to their mutual and individual \nproblems, if they united their talents in a mutual effort to overcome \nfrustration or evil, or if they but reached into their deepest \nresources of character.\n  An educator, writer, public speaker, aviation enthusiast, corporate \nexecutive, a Representative and a Senator, Jennings Randolph was a \nmaster of many talents. I was honored to serve with him as a colleague, \nand honored to call him my friend.\n  If events can foreshadow destinies, perhaps Jennings Randolph's \ndestiny was outlined at his birth, 96 years ago, in 1902. One of \nSenator Randolph's father's closest friends was the great William \nJennings Bryan. Jennings was fond of recounting the anecdote that his \nfather was with Bryan shortly after Jennings' birth. When told of the \narrival of a new Randolph male, Bryan asked Mr. Randolph, ``Have you \nnamed this boy?'' ``No,'' the father replied. ``Then why don't you give \nhim part of my name as a good Democrat?''\n  So Jennings Randolph received his name from the perennial \nPresidential candidate, William Jennings Bryan--a name that Randolph \nnever tarnished and that he burnished brilliantly in his own career.\n  I recall another story that Jennings Randolph sometimes told out of \nhis boyhood in Salem, West Virginia. According to Jennings, Salem had a \nwater tower that stood high on a hill above the town.\n  Jennings said that he told his father and mother, ``If I could just \nget a long pole and * * * climb up on that tank, and hold out that \npole, I believe I could touch the sky.'' That is a story that shows the \ntheme of this man's life--the tale of a boy who wanted to touch the \nsky. And when that boy became a man, touch the sky he did.\n  Jennings Randolph graduated from Salem College in 1924. From there he \nwent into newspaper work in Clarksburg, West Virginia, and later in \nElkins. A short step more took him onto the faculty of Davis and Elkins \nCollege as a professor of speech and journalism, and the director of \nathletics. Working in that capacity, in 1932 Jennings Randolph was \nelected to the U.S. House of Representatives, entering as a strong \nsupporter of Franklin D. Roosevelt's ``New Deal,'' and serving in the \nHouse until January 3, 1947.\n\n  In 1947, he accepted a position as assistant to the President of \nCapital Airlines and Director of Public Relations. In 1958, however, \nJennings Randolph returned to politics. He loved politics; he loved to \n``Press the flesh.'' He couldn't get politics out of his blood. So he \nwon election to the U.S. Senate to complete the unexpired term of the \nlate Senator Matthew Mansfield Neely from West Virginia. On November 5, \n1958, Jennings took the oath of office as U.S. Senator.\n  Elected in that same election for a full Senate term, for 26 years, I \nshared with Jennings Randolph the privilege of representing and serving \nWest Virginia in the United States Senate. That partnership I shall \ncherish always. No man could have asked for a more generous, dedicated, \nor thoughtful colleague than I had in Jennings Randolph. And I know \nfrom my own experience that Jennings Randolph was certainly a man whose \ntouch reached the sky. In West Virginia to this day, thousands of \npeople bless his name for the deeds that he did for them as a friend \nand as a faithful public servant.\n  One of Jennings Randolph's greatest areas of ongoing contribution was \nto the development and advancement of air flight.\n  Some may recall the ancient Greek myth of the flight of Icarus. \nAccording to that legend, Icarus attempted to fly, using wings attached \nto his body with wax.\n  Icarus flew, to be sure. But Icarus flew too close to the sun. The \nsun melted the wax on Icarus's wings, and he fell into the sea.\n  Early on, Jennings Randolph became interested in flight. Fortunately \nfor him and for us, Jennings went about getting into the air more \nsafely than Icarus did.\n  As I mentioned, in 1947, Jennings Randolph became an assistant to the \nPresident and Director of Public Relations for Capital Airlines--one of \nthe companies that later formed United Airlines. In that position, for \nthe next eleven years, Jennings Randolph advanced the airline industry \nhere and abroad. While Jennings was with Capital Airlines, however, he \nundertook one mission that places him on an equal footing with Icarus--\nin bravery and, of course, Jennings was far more successful than \nIcarus. On November 6, 1948, with a professional pilot at the controls, \nJennings Randolph flew from Morgantown, West Virginia, to the \nWashington National Airport in a propeller plane fueled with gasoline \nmade from coal. Now, that was just like Jennings Randolph--out there \npioneering, not only in flight, but also in the use of fuel in that \nplane that had a West Virginia Source--coal. Certainly, that project \nwas an act of faith, for which many remember Senator Randolph.\n  Not as well remembered is Congressman Jennings Randolph's \nintroduction in 1946 of legislation to create a National Air Museum. \nThree decades later, on July 4, 1976, Senator Randolph dedicated the \nNational Air and Space Museum complex on the Mall in Washington--noted \ntoday as one of the most popular tourist attractions in the Nation's \nCapital.\n  Jennings Randolph was an advocate of numerous other items of vital \nlegislation as well--legislation to aid the handicapped and black lung \nvictims, legislation to promote clean water and clean air, legislation \nto provide vocational and career education, and the legislation that \ncreated the National Peace Academy in 1983.\n\n  In announcing his decision not to run for reelection to the Senate in \nthe 1984 race, Jennings said, ``* * * It's been a happy road. I have no \nregrets. * * * I believe the Bible says there is a season and a time \nfor every purpose. It is time for me not to run for reelection.''\n  That ``happy road'' was an unparalleled example of citizenship and \npublic service. In an era in which so many seem preoccupied primarily \nwith grasping and grabbing for themselves, Jennings Randolph was \ncommitted to exerting himself--his intellect, his energy, and his \nconsiderable talents--on behalf, and in behalf, of his fellow citizens, \nhis fellow West Virginians, his fellow Americans, his fellow human \nbeings.\n  Jennings lived a long time--a full and active life. But all of us, \nhigh and low, rich and poor, must one day say goodby to friends and \nloved ones in this earthly life and make our journeys to that unknown \nbourne from which no traveler returns.\n  It was on last Friday morning that the pallid messenger with the \ninverted torch beckoned Jennings to depart.\n  Jennings' passing reminds me of Thomas More's lines.\n\n     When I remember all\n     the friends so linked together\n\n[[Page S4605]]\n\n     I've seen round me fall\n     like leaves in wintry weather\n     I feel like one who treads alone\n     some banquet hall deserted\n     whose lights are fled\n     whose garlands dead\n     and all but he departed . . .\n\n  Whether Jennings, on that last morning, saw a more glorious sun rise \nwith unimaginable splendor above a celestial horizon; whether his \ndexterous and disciplined faculties are now contending in a higher \nsenate than ours for supremacy; whether he yet remembers us as we \nremember him, we do not know. These questions are much like the \nquestion that came from the lips of that ancient patriarch, a man of \nUz, whose name was Job, ``If a man dies, shall he live again?''\n  But we have the consolation expressed by that same man of Uz,\n\n     Oh that my words were written in a book and engraved\n     With an iron pen, and\n     lead in the rock forever,\n     For I know that my\n     Redeemer liveth and that\n     in the latter day he shall\n     Stand upon the earth.\n\n  So, Jennings Randolph has crossed the Great Divide.\n  I think of others who were serving here when Jennings Randolph and I \ntook the oath of office to serve in this Chamber. It was almost 40 \nyears ago. I remember Senators on both sides of the aisle: Senator \nAiken, Senator Anderson of New Mexico, Senator Harry Byrd, Sr., of \nVirginia, Senators Capehart of Indiana, Chavez of New Mexico, Cooper of \nKentucky, Dirksen, Douglas of Illinois, Eastland, Ellender, Fulbright, \nHayden, Hennings of Missouri, Hickenlooper of Iowa, Hill of Alabama, \nHolland of Florida, ``Scoop'' Jackson of Washington, Johnson of Texas, \nJohnston of South Carolina, Langer of North Dakota, McClellan of \nArkansas, Magnuson of Washington, Wayne Morse of Oregon, Murray of \nMontana, Willis Robertson of Virginia, Richard Russell, Saltonstall of \nMassachusetts, Stennis of Mississippi, Symington of Missouri, and \nMilton Young. All of these, and others, were here.\n  Of that illustrious band which sat in this Chamber when Jennings \nRandolph and I first entered the Senate, only Strom Thurmond and I \nremain here.\n\n     They are drifting away, these friends of old\n     Like leaves on the current cast;\n     With never a break in their rapid flow,\n     We count them, as one by one they go\n     Into the Dreamland of the Past.\n\n  Erma and I extend our condolences to Jennings' two sons, Jay and \nFrank, and to others of his family.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it probably would not have been \nwithin the nature of the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Jennings \nRandolph, to object to something that was about to be said about one of \nhis departed colleagues. He was not like that. But I need to report to \nyou, as of course our colleagues know, that Senator Randolph has died. \nMy colleague, Senator Byrd, spoke to the subject, and did so very \neloquently.\n  I think the sad news, of course, is that he is no longer with us. The \ngood news is, in talking with one of his two sons Jay and Frank--and \nthe Senator from West Virginia talked with Jay--he said he died very \npeacefully on Friday. He was a great defender of all 13 States in the \nAppalachian Regional Commission, including the State of Mississippi.\n  It was a very interesting decision, in fact, when Senator Randolph \ndecided to resign. I now can tell a story which I have never told \nbefore because it was one of such exquisite sensitivity on the part of \nthe then-senior Senator from West Virginia, Senator Randolph.\n  No Governor has ever been elected to the U.S. Senate from the \nposition of Governor of West Virginia. It has never happened in our \nhistory. There are reasons for that. In any event, my term was expiring \nas Governor in 1984, and I wanted very much to run for the Senate, but, \non the other hand, Senator Randolph was a very, very formidable \nSenator, obviously a powerful committee chairman, had been in the \nCongress longer than anybody. He was the only person to reach back to \nthe original first days of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Jr., and he was \nliterally at Franklin Roosevelt's side on a number of occasions when he \nsigned bills. This is an enormous bridge of history and bridge of \nspirit. I think he wanted to rerun for another term. I don't know that, \nbut it is my feeling that he did, because he was a very young 84. \nAnyone who knew Jennings Randolph knew him to be hardy, vigorous, \nstrong, and very much in love with his job.\n  He, understanding my interests, and my understanding his interests, \nhe being obviously by far in the stronger position, asked me to come \nhave breakfast with him at his hideaway. Being senior, he had a very \nnice hideaway. I had never been to a hideaway before, and rarely have \nbeen to one since. He had a nice breakfast served there. There was \npleasant conversation. He was very relaxed. Then he simply turned to me \nand he said, ``Jay, would you like to be the next Senator from West \nVirginia?''\n  I said ``Senator, yes, I would, but not if you, Senator Randolph, \nwant to run for reelection.'' And I meant that.\n  Without really pausing anymore than I had, he said, ``Well, I think \nyou should be the Senator.''\n  If one thinks back as a Senator of what one has known over the years, \nit is very rarely that a Senator who has spent virtually all of his \nlife in public service willingly, generously, and warmly gives up his \nseat, which probably could have been his again, in order to step aside \nfor somebody somewhat younger.\n  That is not a story I have ever heard told before because I am not \nsure it has happened before, but it is a story that I am very proud to \nsay today because I told Senator Randolph's son, Jay, that I wanted to \ntell it today. Jay knew about it because his father had told him about \nit. It is something that, better than anything I could say, \ncharacterizes the nature of the generosity of this man, which was \ncounteracted on the other side by a ferocity of intensity about his \nwork.\n  It is very hard to make any other case, but this man was a giant in \nlegislative history, and one could say for no other reason than he \nserved for as long as he did, simply to say, ``I served with Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt.'' How many times did I hear him talk about Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt?\n  He was by nature a man who believed in government--and he was very \nmuch a Democrat that way, although he was a conservative Democrat on \nmany social issues--in terms of what is it the people need, what is it \nthe people shall have, what is it that I think I can help them get. In \nfact, when he made that decision not to run, our unemployment rate in \nWest Virginia was somewhere around 17 or 18 percent. Government was \nvery important to Senator Randolph, and he led his life and his \nlegislative life very much with that in mind.\n\n  He and Senator Byrd were elected at the same time in 1958 because \nthere was a special vacancy because of a special circumstance.\n  Positive, civil, courteous, and kind he was. I asked, before I arose \nto make these remarks, where he sat, and I was informed that he sat in \nfive different desks. One of them, I think, is the desk from which \nSenator Levin from Michigan just spoke.\n  Over his time here, he insisted on courtesy in the Senate, something \nwhich has been paralleled by his colleague, Senator Byrd, for so many \nyears. I am told by my father-in-law, Senator Percy, who was also his \nvery close friend, that he would often get up and insist on order in \nthe Senate. He was very much a stickler for protocol and order and also \nfor voting from his or her desk, which is something that Senator Byrd \nalso feels very strongly about.\n  I remember a Senator of kindness, of good humor who was always in an \nebullient mood, who actually bounced sometimes when he talked he was so \nenthusiastic about what he was doing. But he demanded dignity in the \ntreatment of others. He demanded respect in the treatment of others. He \nwas very old-fashioned in his ways and, thus, I think we miss him even \nmore these days.\n  He did many things. He was always open to new ideas. He actually, \nmore than 50 years ago, flew an airplane for some distance that was \npowered entirely by methanol. One, he knew how to fly an airplane, \nwhich was unusual; two, he flew an airplane which was powered by \nmethanol, which was almost unprecedented. He involved himself at a very \nearly age, and he did so with extraordinary effectiveness.\n  I could talk for an hour, which I will not, about what he \naccomplished. Everybody knows that he really was the\n\n[[Page S4606]]\n\nfounder of the Appalachian Regional Commission, which has done so much \nto help not only the State he loved, West Virginia, but 12 other States \nin addition to that. He was a principal architect of the Interstate \nHighway System which helps to place him in time, because that was done \nduring, as we know, the middle and late fifties.\n  I think the proudest of all of his achievements, or the one that \ncaused him to talk the most and to be the most enthusiastic about, was \nthe 26th amendment. He was the author and the driver of the 26th \namendment which gave 18-year-olds the right to vote in this country.\n  He protected the environment with ferocity. He was tremendously \ninterested in coal, as well as the environment, in worker safety and, \nas I have indicated, in aviation issues, and in just simply countless \nother areas.\n  He was prodigious in his volume of output. Of course, that was, in \npart, because he was chairman of a very powerful committee, and he was \nchairman of that committee for a very long time. That was in the days \nwhen the Senate tended to be more in control by one party than the \nother for a very long time. He worked with the Scoop Jacksons and the \nLyndon Johnsons and all of the others. They were able to accomplish an \nenormous amount. He did that and he loved it--he simply loved doing \nthat. He simply loved laying pavement out across the wide horizons of \nour country.\n  There was an interesting aspect to Senator Randolph. He was intense \nabout all of his work, but he was very much of a U.S. Senator from the \nState of West Virginia. He accepted full responsibility for the title \n``U.S. Senator'' and acted on all matters that related to that with \nincisiveness and careful thought. But he liked to say--and often said, \nand said with great pride--quoting him--``I essentially am a West \nVirginia Senator. I'm not what you'd call a national Senator or \ninternational Senator.'' I think if he were here today, I am not sure \nthe words would be that different.\n  And to understand that one has to understand his roots. He was born \nin this tiny community of Salem, WV, which is now the home of probably \nas many Japanese students in a Salem-Tokyo University setting as reside \nanywhere else in this country. His father was the mayor of Salem. He \nwas born with very little money, and he worked his way in farm jobs. He \nknew agriculture very well. He worked for anybody who would give him a \njob to put a few dollars in his pocket so he could further his \neducation and improve his possibilities. I liked that about him, \nbecause he was utterly a rural Senator, but with an urban reach when it \ncame to the national part of his responsibilities.\n  He started in journalism and was always a prolific writer. He married \nKatherine Babb and won election to the House of Representatives in 1932 \nat the age of 30. One can do that these days, although one cannot go \nmuch younger than that legally. But then it was extraordinary, it was \nextraordinary to be able to do that. And I indicated he has two sons, \nJay and Frank.\n  So more than 50 years later, I think the occupant of the Presiding \nOfficer's chair will understand that it is quite a feeling for me to \nhave succeeded him, to have been allowed to succeed him by his own \ngesture of generosity and, frankly, just to be able to succeed him.\n  He is long remembered in this body, as well as in the House, for the \nvery exceptional nature that he had: High optimism, great confidence, \nenormous belief in country, and his absolute love for his State. He \nalso--and I will say this in closing--he had a great love for his \nprofession. And in that I think many of us join him. He was not one of \nthose who felt being in public service was some kind of a second \nchoice; I think he felt it was the best choice of all.\n  He was somebody who honored his craft, who brought great distinction \nto his craft, who never compromised on his principles. And when he \nfaced a West Virginia audience or a Senate Chamber, he could stand tall \nand strong and broad shouldered, as he was, and do his work, because he \nknew he was doing work which was enormously important for helping the \npeople that he so loved from the State of West Virginia.\n  So this is a day and a time that we have reason to reflect on \nJennings Randolph and what made him an exceptional person. It is sad, I \nthink, this tradition in the Senate when we do this about Senators when \nthey die. It would be almost impossible to create a tradition where we \ndid that while they were still living. But it would be nice if they \ncould hear what it was that we say about them. And I suspect that \nSenator Jennings Randolph is able to hear and to know on this day, and \ndays to succeed, what his colleagues think about him.\n  I personally am grateful to him for many reasons, as I think should \nbe very obvious.

Mr. President, we are not moving along too quickly this \nmorning, so I thought I would take an opportunity to visit about an \nobservation that I have made. We had a few moments ago the remarks by \nthe good Senator from West Virginia about the passing of a former \nSenator from his State. He talked a bit about the past, a bit about the \nhistory of the Senate, and it was extremely interesting. This place, of \ncourse, is filled with history, it is filled with tradition, and that \nis good.\n  On the other hand, there are changes that have taken place, and one \nof them is a little troubling to me. It does seem as if we are \nincreasingly moving governance into more of show business and into more \nof political spin, more of promotion, more of advertising than really \ndealing with issues based on the facts and how they impact us.\n  The basic principle, of course, of our historic democracy, \nthankfully, continues to exist, and we must insist that it does \ncontinue to exist--the idea of a government by Constitution and \nadhering to the basic tenets of the Constitution, the separation of \ninstitutions that provide some semblance of power division among the \nexecutive and the legislative and judicial branches; the idea of public \naccess, that people have an opportunity to participate fully in \ngovernment, that people have an opportunity to have the background and \nthe facts that are necessary to participate; the idea of disclosure--we \ntalk about that a lot--majorities deciding the direction that we take \nin this country based on facts, rule of law. In short, a government of \nthe people, by the people and for the people, of course, and these are \nbasic elements of democracy.\n  An informed public is essential to that government of the people. \nIronically, technology, which has provided us with the greatest \nopportunity to know more about what is happening more quickly than \never--can you imagine what it must have been like 100\n\n[[Page S4607]]\n\nyears ago to be home in Wyoming and wonder what is going on in \nWashington? I suppose there was some comfort in that, as a matter of \nfact, but, nevertheless, it is quite different than what we have now. \nWe have now the greatest opportunity in history for people to know what \nis happening and to know instantly what is happening. If a decision is \nmade in Israel this morning, minutes later, the whole world, of course, \nis familiar with it.\n  Unfortunately, the same technology that has provided us the \nopportunity to know so much more has accommodated and, in fact, I \nsuppose, engendered some of the changes that are taking place in terms \nof the promotion of ideas and our method of governance.\n  Unfortunately, spinning, promotion, and media hype have replaced real \ndebate based on the issues, and that is too bad. It seems to me that \nthis administration and, I must say, my friends in the minority, have \nperfected the idea that success is not policy or success is not \nfinishing the job; success is having an opportunity to spin an issue on \nthe evening news; success is getting coverage on the 5 o'clock national \nreport. If polls indicate there is an issue out there in which people \nare interested and it is currently being discussed, this administration \nis quick to describe the problem and promise a Federal solution with \nlots of Federal money--``We'll fix it for you.''\n  Often there is no plan presented to deal with the problem. There is \ngenerally no real proposal to implement, nothing is laid before the \nCongress. Frankly, there is really no expectation that anything is \ngoing to happen; that the idea is, ``Here's the problem, here's what \nthe polls have said; we'll fix it.'' And if you don't agree with that, \nsuddenly you are out of step with the world. So success is measured in \nmedia rather than solutions. Unfortunately, I think we see more and \nmore of that.\n  It is interesting to me, because, depending upon your point of view \nabout government, there are problems and there are appropriate ways to \nfix them and appropriate ways to deal with them. Of course, it is true \nthat people have different views about that. There are those who \nbelieve the Federal Government ought to be the primary fixer of \nwhatever the problem. That is a legitimate liberal view. There are \nthose who believe that it is more likely to find satisfactory solutions \nif you go to the State, the local government, or the private sector. \nThat, I guess, is a more conservative view. But more important than the \nphilosophy, I think it is appropriate that when you have something you \nwant to deal with, we ought to talk a little bit about where it can \nmost appropriately be fixed.\n\n  Should it be done at the Federal Government level? Should it be the \nkind of program that is one size fits all? I am very sensitive about \nthat, I suppose, being from Wyoming. We are the smallest, population-\nwise, State in this country. So things that work in Pennsylvania, \nthings that work in New York, do not necessarily work in Wyoming or \nNevada or Kansas. So we are better off, in many instances, to say, \n``Wait a minute. This service can better be delivered on the basis of a \nState solution, although the politics of it is, `Let's get on TV and \nsay we'll fix it for you,' '' even with no expectation of having it \nhappen.\n  So I think we are finding more and more of that. And it just seems to \nme that it is something we ought to really evaluate, this idea that we \nwatch the polls, find an issue, go to the TV, say we will fix it, and \nthen beat up on everybody who really does not agree with that, without \nhaving any genuine--genuine--debate or discussion or analysis of how we \nbest deal with the problem and where it works.\n  Generally, these are things that are done certainly in a broad \ncontext. Everyone cares about children, so if you have a proposal on \nchildren--and to suggest that we do not is offensive to me. Everybody \ncares about child care, but where is it best dealt with? Everybody \ncares about health care. Where is it best provided? Everybody cares \nabout secondary and elementary education. Where do we best deal with \nit? It is not enough just to say, ``We've got a problem. I want 100,000 \nteachers; I want the Federal Government to pay for it. It will become a \nmandatory program, and we have more and more Federal control.''\n  Those are the debates. Those are the debates. I guess it troubles me \nbecause we sort of trivialize governance with this business of applying \nthe media technique. I understand that the minority--and Republicans \nhave been in the minority, of course. For the minority it is easier to \nmake proposals. It is easier to throw stones and things because you do \nnot have the responsibility to finish it up.\n  So it is, I think, an interesting kind of thing and one that I \nbelieve has some bearing on us really solving problems here. I think it \nis something we all ought to give some consideration to so that we \nbegin to say to ourselves, ``Here's the problem. How do we best resolve \nit?'' not just ``How do we get the best 5 o'clock news out of it?'' \nSuccess should not be how much media coverage; success ought to be \ndealing with the problem, trying to resolve it with real debate, real \ndesire to put it where it belongs. Many problems are best solved in the \nprivate sector, best solved in State and local government, best \nsolved--some--by the Federal Government. And those are the decisions \nthat we should make.\n  So, Mr. President, as we move forward I hope that we do maintain the \nelements of democracy. I have had the occasion, being chairman of a \nsubcommittee on Foreign Relations, to go some places where they do not \nhave democracy. And obviously the things that keep them from that is \nnot having a constitutional government to which people can adhere and a \nrule of law which enforces it, an opportunity for people to voice their \nopinions and an opportunity for people to be informed as they form \nthese opinions. These are the things that I think are important to our \ndemocracy and I am very interested in maintaining.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, am I correct that I am recognized by \nprevious order for 15 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/11/senate-section/article/S4606-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4607-S4609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE Y2K PROBLEM\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise because this is an anniversary \ndate, not an anniversary of something that happened in the past but an \nanniversary of something that is going to happen in the future. This is \nan anniversary that is counting backwards. Depending on how you count \nit, this is either day No. 599 or day No. 600; 599 to the 31st of \nDecember, 1999, or 600 days prior to January 1, 2000--the day of the \ngreat New Year's Eve party that everybody is reserving their time for \nin Times Square, in the various hotels in New York. But it is also a \nday that we need to look forward to with some concern because of what \nhas come to be known as the millennium bug, the year 2000 problem, or, \nas the computer people abbreviate it, Y2K.\n  I used the phrase ``Y2K,'' and my wife said, ``What are you talking \nabout? What does it stand for?'' Well, the ``Y'' stands for ``year;'' \n``2'' and ``K,'' for ``kilo'' or 1,000 years--2,000--so it shortens it. \nCall it Y2K. She stopped and thought about it a minute, and she said, \n``Y2K or year 2000, you only save one syllable. What's the point?'' \nNevertheless, that is what it has come to be known as.\n  As the chairman of the newly created committee dealing with this \nchallenge here in the Senate, I want to take this anniversary date to \nbring the Senate and any who are listening over C-SPAN out in the \ncountry as a whole up to date on where we are with the Y2K problem.\n  First, let me outline the dimensions of the problem. A lot of people \nsay, ``Oh, yes; we understand it. It is simply that computers are \ngeared to handle the date with two digits instead of four.'' So 1998 \nwould be in the computer as ``98'' instead of ``1998.'' And that means \nwhen you get to the year 2000, the ``00'' to the computer means \n``1900'' because the ``19'' is assumed in advance.\n  Actually, it is more serious than that. There are three areas of \nconcern about Y2K.\n  The first one, of course, is the software concern that I have already \nmentioned. The software is programmed with two digits for the date \ninstead of\n\n[[Page S4608]]\n\nfour. If you do not change the software program, the computer runs into \nproblems and starts to do very strange things when it hits the year \n2000. That is the first area, the area we have been focused on.\n  Since I have been involved in this issue--and it has been almost a \nyear since I began to focus on it--I have discovered there were two \nother areas. So in addition to software, you have a hardware problem \nsymbolized in the phrase ``embedded chips.'' These little tiny chips \nthat drive the computers, the miracles of the modern technological age, \nvery often have a date function built into them. And, again, in order \nto save space on the chip, the date function is built in with two \ndigits.\n  Where are the embedded chips? They are embedded everywhere. Andy \nGrove, the CEO of Intel, the largest producer of chips in the United \nStates, was here in Washington a week or so ago. He was asked, ``How \nserious is the Y2K problem?'' He said, ``It is very serious. And the \nreason is''--he is focusing on the chip side--``you don't know where \nthe embedded chips are embedded.'' ``For example,'' he said, ``the \nthermostat in your home may not work after New Year's Eve, 1999.'' Now, \nit will not do you any good to call the manufacturer of the thermostat \nand ask him, because the manufacturer himself does not know. The chips \nwere purchased, put into the thermostat, without concern as to whether \nor not they had a date function. And if the manufacturer got some chips \nthat had date functions in them and put those chips into your \nthermostat, you are going to be very chilly on New Year's Day in the \nyear 2000. And there is no way of knowing in advance whether that is \ngoing to happen.\n\n  That can be a nuisance for you, it can be a life-or-death situation \nfor some people, and it can be an enormous manufacturing challenge \nwhere we are storing and refrigerating meat and other perishables that \nare dependent on those embedded chips. It can be a life-or-death \nsituation for an automobile manufacturer whose entire plant is now \nautomated with robotics, all of which have embedded chips.\n  So, as I said, Mr. President, it is not just the software that needs \nto be changed, as the first of these three areas of concern; it is also \nthe embedded chips that need to be found and dealt with.\n  As a final footnote to this, I was discussing this whole Y2K issue \nwith an individual at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, \nmore commonly known as the Mormon Church, the largest church in the \nState which I represent, asking him how prepared the church was. \nFortunately, it was good news. He said the church was quite prepared. \nBut he said, ``We have identified, among other things, two embedded \nchips in the tabernacle organ, which if we do not replace means that \nthe Mormon Tabernacle Choir will not have any organ accompaniment to it \non January 1, 2000.'' That shows how ubiquitous the problem of the \nembedded chips can be and how it can show up in places no one would \never think.\n\n  I said there were three areas of concern. I talked about the software \nand the embedded chips. What is the third? This is the area of \nconnections. Everything in the computer world is connected to \neverything else in one way or another. I was at the Defense Department \ntalking to those officials about their Y2K problem and made the comment \nabout how difficult it will be in our defense establishment if, on \nJanuary 1, the screen goes blank, the various screens that handle the \ncomputerized information, in our defense establishment.\n  Deputy Secretary Hamre said, ``No, Senator, if the screen goes blank, \nwhile that is a problem, it is not a catastrophe; because if the screen \ngoes blank that tells you you have a problem in that particular piece \nof equipment. The thing we are worried about is if the screen does not \ngo blank, the computer continues to operate, but another computer \nsystem to which it is connected starts feeding it inaccurate data.'' If \nthe computer continues to function, make its calculations that ``zero \nzero'' really does mean 1900 and begins to give you bad information, \nthat could contaminate your entire database. That, he says, is a bigger \nconcern than if the screen goes blank. Frankly, that had not occurred \nto me. I was able to add, unhappily, a third category of concern--\nsoftware, hardware in embedded chips, and now connections.\n  What are we looking at in our special committee with respect to the \nyear 2000 problem? I have divided it up into seven areas and \nprioritized these areas. We will look at them in the following order to \ntry to see what we can do to avert disaster in the next 599 days--all \nthe days that are remaining to us. Obviously, we would like to pass a \nresolution saying that we have an extra 2 or 3 years. We do not, no \nmatter what the Congress does, no matter what the President does, no \nmatter what anybody else does, we have 599 days and counting down, \ninexorably from right now.\n  These are the areas of concern. No. 1, utilities. If the power grid \ngoes down because of connections in the computers or because of \nembedded chips in certain power plants that shut those power plants \ndown because of bad software somewhere, then it is all over. It doesn't \nmatter if every computer in the country is Y2K compliant if you can't \nplug it into something. So we are focusing first and foremost on \nutilities and not just power. The water treatment system in every \nmunicipality in this country is computer driven and has the potential \nof being upset because of embedded chips and bad software. Utilities, \ntherefore, are at the top of the list of the things we are addressing \nin our committee and are doing what we can to try to expose information \nabout and get people worried and working on it.\n  Second is telecommunications. What happens if you pick up the phone \non January 1, 2000, and you cannot get a dial tone? I don't think that \nis going to happen in the United States. But the evidence is fairly \nclear that it is going to happen in some countries. If you are running \na multinational organization, be it the Defense Department or a \ncorporation, and you pick up the phone and you cannot get a dial tone \nin various parts of the world, you are in serious trouble. So, behind \nutilities, we are looking next at telecommunications.\n\n  Third, transportation. Instantly people think of the FAA and the \ninability of the air traffic control system to control airplanes, and \nthat is a concern, but what about shipping on the high seas--global \npositioning systems that all have chips in them that control the \nnavigation of the oil tankers and the other freighters that are moving \ncommerce all over the world? Here in the United States the railroads \nare heavily dependent on computer systems to route the traffic that \nproduce the shipment of the heavy materials that keep our Nation going. \nTransportation is clearly No. 3 following utilities and \ntelecommunications.\n  No. 4 is the area that got me interested in this problem in the first \nplace, the financial services. What happens if the banks cannot clear \nchecks? What happens if there can be no electronic transfers of funds? \nI am happy to report that I believe we are fairly well along the road \ntoward getting this problem solved. We have had seven hearings in my \nsubcommittee on the Banking Committee on this issue, but we cannot \nrelax here, either. The financial services clearly come in as the No. 4 \nconcern.\n  Then, No. 5, general government services, not only Federal but State \nand local, as well. What happens if in our large cities the county \ngovernment cannot distribute welfare checks, the county government \ncannot handle food stamp distribution because of computerization of the \nway that situation is handled? What happens if HCFA, the Health Care \nFinancing Administration, cannot handle reimbursement of Medicare or \nMedicaid funds? I have talked to hospitals and other health care \nproviders that are dependent on HCFA reimbursements for their cash \nflow projections and they use the HCFA cash flow to do such things as \npurchase ordinary supplies for running the hospital. The whole health \ncare system could grind to a halt if the government services in this \narea are not made Y2K compliant. The doctors who I have talked to tell \nme we have long since quit dealing with HCFA with paper. All of our \ninterconnections with HCFA are electronic, and if that system goes \ndown, the ripple effect will be tremendous.\n\n  Next, general manufacturing. Fortune magazine had an article on their\n\n[[Page S4609]]\n\nweb site pointing out how much trouble General Motors is in. I don't \nmean to single out General Motors because I think every manufacturer \nhas the same kind of problem. In today's world, where computers are \navailable, we operate a just-in-time inventory system where you do not \nhave huge stockpiles of spare parts out on the back lot anymore. With \nthe computer, you have it worked out with your supplier that your spare \nparts arrive just in time for you to put them in your final \nmanufacturing product. The just-in-time manufacturing system shuts down \naltogether and the manufacturing shuts down. General Motors has done a \nsurvey of every one of their manufacturing plants and they have found \nembedded chips in every one of their robotic systems. If they do not \nget this problem solved, they will not be able to produce an automobile \nafter January 1, 2000.\n  And then, finally, No. 7, listed last because it will come last \nchronologically, but probably should be listed first in terms of its \nfinancial impact if we do not get the other six solved, is litigation. \nThe lawsuits that will be filed will be enormous. Estimates before my \nsubcommittee of the Banking Committee indicate the total litigation \nbill could run as high as $1 trillion, one-seventh the size of the \ntotal economy that will change hands as people sue each other over the \nproblems created by Y2K. We have to make sure we solve the other six so \nthat No. 7 doesn't hit us and destroy us.\n  The purpose of the special committee created by the Senate, I \nbelieve, is to examine all seven of these areas, act as a coordinating \npoint for people involved with each of the areas, and then give \nreports, both to the Senate and to the people in the country as a \nwhole, as to where we are, because it is not all doom and gloom. We do \nhave areas where we are making progress.\n  I talked this morning with John Koskinen who heads this effort on \nbehalf of President Clinton in the executive branch. He reported to me \nthat contrary to some of the information we have seen in the press, the \nSocial Security Administration will be all right, and will indeed be \nable to distribute Social Security checks in the year 2000. Now, if the \nbanking system is all right, those checks can be received, and that is \na demonstration of the problem of interconnectivity that we have. But \nthat is a piece of good news. As we focus on the challenge of Y2K, we \nshould not lose sight of the fact that there is good news and there is \nprogress being made.\n\n  I close with this observation about the importance of this entire \nissue. One of the experts with whom I have been in contact since I \nassumed this new chairmanship said to me, ``The one thing we know for \nsure about this is that nobody has ever done it before. We have no \nhistorical precedent to guide us, to tell us how to handle this and \nwhat we can expect.'' And, of course, he was accurate. Of course, that \nis a true summation of where we are.\n  Yet when I made that comment to another friend of mine, he said \nsomething that I think summarizes exactly the challenge we are facing. \nHe said, ``No, Bob, that is not true. We have a historic example. I \nsaid, ``What is it?'' He said, ``the Tower of Babel.'' He said, ``The \npeople got together and decided they were going to build a tower to \nheaven, and God didn't like it, so he fixed it so they could not talk \nto each other and that ended it.'' He said, ``That is the paradigm of \nwhat we are dealing with here, Y2K.'' We are facing the possibility \nthat after January 1 we cannot talk to each other because the world is \nall wired by computers, and if, indeed, that turns out to be the case, \nas was the case in Genesis, that will end it.\n  I am hoping that everyone recognizes this anniversary for what it \nis--a milepost on the road toward an inexorable challenge, and that we \nuse the opportunity to take the remaining 599 days to see to it that \nwhen we get to New Year's Eve 1999, we can look back and say that we \nwere facing something as serious as the Tower of Babel, but we have, as \na Nation, and as a world, faced up to that, and now Y2K is going to be \na bump in the road instead of a drive off the cliff.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator from Utah yield for a brief question?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am through with my presentation. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I feel very comforted knowing that the \nSenator from Utah is a cochair of the task force along with Senator \nDodd. I compliment the majority leader, Senator Lott, and Senator \nDaschle for putting together a commission of the type they have \nestablished. I know, serving as ranking member of the legislative \nbranch appropriations subcommittee of which Senator Bennett is \nchairman, that he has, in every circumstance, at every hearing, gone \nthrough in some detail this Y2K problem. He knows it well and is very \nconcerned about it.\n  As he properly indicates here in the Senate, this doesn't just deal \nwith Federal agencies. In fact, that is only a very small fraction of \nwhat can be affected, unless this problem is dealt with as a nationwide \npriority. But I wanted to just say, as I have said before on the floor, \nI think Senator Bennett is one of the finest people serving in this \nbody. He has devoted a lot of attention to this issue. If this is not \nhandled properly all across this country in both the public and private \nsector, this could have catastrophic consequences. If handled properly, \nwe probably won't even know that this situation came and went. But I \njust want to tell you that I feel comforted by his leadership. I thank \nhim very much for all of the attention and time he has devoted to this. \nHe and Senator Dodd will spend a substantial amount of time between now \nand the year 2000 on this very significant issue.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank my friend who has been very \nindulgent in my obsession with this issue in the subcommittee of the \nlegislative branch of appropriations. In the spirit of what I just said \nabout reports, I can report to the Senate that he and I heard testimony \nbefore our last appropriations subcommittee that the Senate will indeed \nbe Y2K-compliant in the year 2000. The Sergeant at Arms, the Secretary \nof the Senate, and others, have focused on the priorities and are doing \nthe things necessary to get us there. They are changing the computers \nin the Senate at the rate now of about a thousand a month. I was \nstartled, as I think my friend, Senator Dorgan, may have been, to learn \nthat there were close to 9,000 computers in the Senate; that is 90 for \neach Senator. I didn't think we needed that many. But there are. They \nare being made Y2K-compliant at the rate of about a thousand per month \nnow. That will allow us the requisite amount of time to test the \nvarious fixes and see to it that we have it under control.\n  The one disquieting note that came out of the hearing that I share \nwith my colleagues was that they said, ``We will have the mission-\ncritical systems Y2K compliant by January of 2000.'' I said, ``What is \nyour definition of a `nonmission-critical system?' '' They said, \n``Well, the copier in your office may not work.'' There will be many \nconstituents that will be delighted to know that we cannot make copies \nin January of 2000 until additional work gets done. But I thank my \nfriend for his support in that area and for his very kind words. They \nare much appreciated.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I also say to my colleague from Utah \nthat I hope he continues with his ``obsession,'' as he described it, \nbecause we really need his leadership. I am grateful to him for the \nimportant work he is doing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/11/senate-section/article/S4607-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4609-S4611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES IN INDONESIA\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter \nthat I have sent to the President, which expresses my concern about the \nongoing human rights abuses in Indonesia, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 11, 1998.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     President of the United States,\n     White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I write to express my deep concern \n     about the ongoing human rights abuses in Indonesia. According \n     to the State Department's Country Reports on\n\n[[Page S4610]]\n\n     Human Rights Practices for 1997, the Indonesian Government \n     met calls for political reforms with arrests and crackdowns \n     on opposition parties. The Suharto regime maintains its power \n     through policies of corruption, intimidation and government \n     enforced repression of opposition groups. According to many \n     credible human rights NGO reports, government critics are \n     frequently arrested, tortured, raped, unlawfully killed or \n     disappeared. The people of Indonesia are systematically \n     denied democratic freedoms such as free and fair elections, \n     freedom of the press and freedom of assembly. The lack of an \n     independent judiciary and the lack of accountability for \n     members of the armed forces play a major role in the \n     continuation of serious human rights abuses.\n       Countless thousands have been subjected to arbitrary \n     detention, with torture used to force detainees to produce \n     names of opposition supporters. Mr. Pius Lustrilanang, a \n     prominent opposition leader who was abducted earlier this \n     year and detained for two months, has said that his captors \n     beat him and administered electric shocks to his hands and \n     feet in an attempt to discover details of his political \n     activities. Lustrilanang spoke out about this experience at \n     great personal risk, endangering not only his own safety, but \n     that of his family as well. Student leaders of the People's \n     Democratic Party, which was banned last September, have been \n     arrested and sentenced to heavy terms of up to thirteen \n     years. Their crime was organizing worker rallies, calling for \n     a referendum on East Timor, and campaigning for a more open \n     political system.\n       The United States has pursued a policy of engagement and \n     friendship with Indonesia. I feel that we could do more to \n     promote freedom and human rights. While I commend the \n     Pentagon's recent decision to cancel a joint training \n     exercise with the Indonesian military, I am deeply troubled \n     by reports earlier this year that the United States may have \n     been involved in the training of KOPASSUS Special Forces, \n     Indonesia's notoriously brutal military unit, responsible for \n     torture; night raids; and frequent disappearances. The United \n     States also has supplied the Indonesian government with much \n     of the military hardware which is used to foster a climate of \n     fear and intimidation. The military plays a key role in \n     preserving nondemocratic rule in Indonesia by deploying \n     forces at all levels of society to crush peaceful dissent. \n     Continued military support indicates U.S. approval of the \n     Suharto regime's ongoing repression. As a worldwide symbol of \n     freedom and democracy, our foreign policy should reflect our \n     philosophy of political pluralism and government by the \n     consent of the people.\n       In our economic support for the Indonesian government, \n     through institutions such as the IMF, we should be using our \n     leverage to press for political reforms, democratization and \n     greater respect for human rights. Instead, we have virtually \n     ignored the IMF's statute where it is written. ``The \n     International Monetary Fund shall advance the cause of human \n     rights, including by seeking to channel assistance toward \n     countries other than those whose governments engage in gross \n     violations of human rights of citizens.''\n       How can the United States justify bailing out a regime \n     which grows more repressive by the day? We have made economic \n     reforms a condition of our bailout and, at least so far, the \n     Indonesian government has complied. However, the solution to \n     the present economic crisis will require more than just \n     financial transparency and the elimination of corruption. \n     Lack of confidence in the political system is preventing new \n     investments from the private sector. Markets respond with \n     greater confidence to transparent, stable political \n     environments. If we are truly concerned about the welfare of \n     the Indonesian people, our continued funding should be \n     contingent upon greater political openness and improvements \n     in Indonesia's human rights record.\n       It is time to clearly signal to the Suharto regime that we \n     support multi-party democracy, fair labor practices and a \n     respect for human rights.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Paul Wellstone,\n                                                      U.S. Senate.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the context of my speech on the floor \nof the Senate today is as follows. I have been, as the Senator from \nMinnesota, moved by the courage of students in Indonesia who are \nchallenging a very repressive government. They do this at great risk. \nBut they have shown the courage to speak out. President Suharto has \nleft for a conference in Egypt and has made it crystal clear that \nstudents and others in Indonesia who dare to speak out will suffer the \nconsequences.\n  The Suharto regime has been corrupt; it has been repressive. There \nare many reports by all of the reputable human rights organizations of \npeople being arrested, tortured, raped, killed, or they have \ndisappeared. It is in this environment that these young people in \nIndonesia now step forward with a tremendous amount of courage to speak \nfor freedom and democracy in their country--Indonesia.\n  It is for this reason that as a U.S. Senator I come to the floor of \nthe Senate to support them. It is for this reason I have sent this \nletter to the President. It is my hope that our Government, and all of \nus here in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, will make it \nclear to Mr. Suharto that we will not turn our gaze away from this \nrepressive government, and that we will support these students and \nother citizens in Indonesia who speak out for the very things that make \nour country such a wonderful country--freedom, the right to be able to \ndissent, democracy.\n  Mr. Pius Lustrilanang, a prominent opposition leader, was abducted \nearlier this year and was detained for 2 months. He talks about the \nways in which his captors beat him, administered electric shocks to his \nhands and feet, in an attempt to discover details of his political \nactivity. His political activities were political activities we take \nfor granted. He was writing, speaking, and doing things people should \nbe able to do in their countries.\n  Student leaders of the People's Democratic Party, which was banned \nlast September, have been arrested and sentenced to terms of up to 13 \nyears. Students, young people--I say to pages who are here--your age, \nhave been sentenced to 13 years in prison. What was their crime? They \norganized worker rallies, they called for a referendum on East Timor, \nand they were campaigning for a more open political system; in other \nwords, for the right of people to be able to organize and to speak out. \nThey now are faced with 13-year prison sentences.\n  I am concerned about what is now happening in Indonesia. I think our \nGovernment should be stronger in our support of the students and for \nthe men and women who are speaking up for democracy and human rights in \nIndonesia. I commend the Pentagon's recent decision to cancel a joint \ntraining exercise with the Indonesian military. But I am deeply \ntroubled by reports that the United States may have been involved in \ntraining with the Indonesian special forces, which has really become or \nis known as a very brutal military unit responsible for the torture, \nthe midnight raids, and the frequent disappearance of citizens.\n  Mr. President, in addition in this letter that I have sent to \nPresident Clinton, I raise questions about the ways in which we bail \nout a regime which grows more repressive day by day. The infusion of \ncapital by the IMF makes ``economic'' reform a condition for the \nbailout. I am not sure the IMF prescription has helped. I have said on \nthe floor before that I am an internationalist. I think we ignore the \nworld at our own peril. I think economic development support is \ncritically important, as is humanitarian assistance. I sometimes think \nthe IMF just pours fuel on the fire. In this particular case, the \nGovernment says it is raising fuel prices and taking other action like \nthis in response to the IMF, which, of course, imposes additional pain \nand hardship on the poor, not on Suharto and his family.\n  But, in any case, it seems to me that if we are truly concerned about \nthe welfare of the Indonesian people, our continuing funding should be \ncontingent upon greater political openness and improvement in \nIndonesia's human rights record.\n  I don't know why the administration--President Clinton, the \nadministration, our Government; really, the President speaks for our \nGovernment--I don't know why we are not more insistent on these \ngovernments who attack, torture, rape, and murder their citizens to \nabide by elementary standards of decency. In some kind of way, we \nshould make some of our assistance contingent upon this. Surely we can \nat least speak up. Surely we can at least send a clear signal to the \nSuharto regime that we support democracy, that we support fair labor \npractices, that we support human rights, and that we will not stand by \nidly as this regime, the Suharto regime, continues to repress its \ncitizens.\n  I come to the floor of the Senate today to speak for the students. I \ncome to the floor of the Senate today to call on the President to speak \nfor the students, courageous students, courageous young people, who I \nbelieve are capturing the imagination of Indonesia. They are lighting a \ncandle with their courage. And I think the President and I think the \nU.S. Congress and the United States of America ought to be on their \nside.\n\n[[Page S4611]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate very much what the Senator \nfrom Minnesota had to say about the dissidents in Indonesia who, at \ntheir own peril and at the risk of their lives, are saying that they \nwould like the right of self-determination and they would like freedom.\n\n  I was in China the day Wang Dan was sentenced to 11 years, I believe, \nin prison in China for criticizing his Government. And I saw Tiananmen \nSquare, I say to the Senator, and I thought about that young man in the \nwhite shirt.\n  You remember the picture during the demonstration in Tiananmen Square \nwhen the tanks came to break up the demonstrators and this young man in \na white shirt walked out and stood in front of this column of tanks in \nfront of the first tank and forced the tank to change course. Then he \nmoved over again in front of the tank.\n  I watched that. I thought, What on Earth must be inside of this young \nman? What kind of courage must it take to say, ``I am going to stand in \nfront of a tank and risk my life for freedom''?\n  That is what the Senator from Minnesota is talking about with respect \nto the price that is paid by, in many cases, young people, and older \npeople as well, who demonstrate to resist regimes that are oppressive \nand regimes that tend to try to squelch freedom of speech.\n  So I think this country should always be vigilant about the need to \nstand up for those around the world who do that at their own peril. \nThey are asking for only what we understand in this country makes a \ngood society. That is freedom--freedom of speech, freedom of movement.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a comment?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes. Certainly.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Given what the Senator just said about Tiananmen \nSquare, given the courage, again, of the students and others, that is \nwhy I wish the President would not go to Tiananmen Square. I think the \nPresident is making a terrible mistake. I didn't think the President \nshould be there.\n  I will just make that comment to my colleague.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would respond to the Senator by saying that I think, \nand have always thought, that our foreign policy must always have a \nhuman rights component to it. That is, it seems to me, what we owe to \nothers around the world who struggle for freedom. And I appreciate the \nleadership of the Senator from Minnesota in this matter. He is once \nagain today calling the Senate's attention to the importance of human \nrights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/11/senate-section/article/S4609-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4611-S4612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CBO'S MONTHLY BUDGET REVIEW\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak first about \nthe Congressional Budget Office, which last week released its monthly \nbudget projection. And I noticed that this projection, this estimate, \nreceived prominent coverage in the Washington Post and in other major \ndaily newspapers around the country last week.\n  Actually, those papers may have mentioned this CBO report twice. \nFirst there were news stories saying says that the Congressional Budget \nOffice now predicts that in this fiscal year --1998--we will have a \nbudget surplus, they say, of anywhere from $43 billion to $63 billion. \nAnd in the next 24 and 48 hours, there was a spate of stories about a \ngroup of people telling us what they would like done with this alleged \nsurplus.\n  Just as quick as you can light a candle around here, any discussion \nabout a surplus brings people who want to spend it or give it back in \ntax breaks. And very quickly they clustered around that flame of the \nsurplus and told us what they thought should be done about this.\n  I would like to simply say that the Congressional Budget Office does \nus no service when it gives us half the story. The Congressional Budget \nOffice is a fine organization, and I mean no disrespect to the work of \nCBO or the people who do that work. And CBO is right to say that we \nhave made substantial progress dealing with fiscal policy, and \nespecially the Federal budget deficit in recent years. For a number of \nreasons, our deficits have shrunk dramatically. We have made remarkable \nprogress.\n  But we are not there yet, and we will not have and do not have a \nsurplus this year. We will continue to have a deficit this year, albeit \na much smaller deficit--shrunk dramatically from its previous size. We \nare continuing to make great progress, and we will have a surplus soon, \nbut we will not have a surplus this year. Let me explain why.\n\n  On April 2d of this year, this Senate passed a budget. I might add \nthat this House still has not yet figured out what it wants to do on a \nbudget. But in the Senate budget resolution, which billed itself as \nproviding a budget surplus, on the fourth page, I believe, it admits \nthat the actual deficit for fiscal year 1998 is going to be $95.6 \nbillion.\n  That is very much at odds with the Congressional Budget Office, which \nsays, ``Gee, things are rosy, and they are getting better. In fact, we \nwill have a very significant surplus.'' And we have people slicing up \nthis estimate of a surplus, figuring out how to give it back or what to \ndo with it when, in fact, our budget resolution says we are going to \nhave a deficit this year of $95.6 billion.\n  The key to the difference is in the Budget Act. The Budget Act says--\nthis is law--``The concurrent resolution''--that is, the budget \nresolution--``shall not include the outlays and revenue totals'' of the \nSocial Security system.\n  In other words, we have enshrined in the law the principle that the \nrevenue of the Social Security system is dedicated tax revenue going \ninto a trust fund to be used only for Social Security. And the revenue \nwill be used for Social Security--because it will be needed in the long \nterm. We all understand that. But this provision of law says that you \ncan't use that revenue, you can't bring it out of that trust fund over \nhere to the budget and say, ``By the way, we have all of this revenue \nwe are using over here and the budget looks great.''\n  The law says you cannot do that. But the Congressional Budget Office \nreport just ignores that law. They don't admit they re using the Social \nSecurity trust fund, but they, in fact, do it because that is the way \nthey report. They say, well, we are going to have a $43 billion to $63 \nbillion surplus in this year. How do they get that? By taking the \nSocial Security trust fund money, adding it in as other revenues and \nsaying, wow, we have a surplus. And so we have folks who are going to \nspend this alleged surplus, or create some new tax breaks to give back \nthe supposed surplus before a surplus really exists.\n  Now, my own vote on the surplus, if one develops, is to say let us \nbegin to reduce the Federal debt just a bit. If for 30 consecutive \nyears you increase the Federal debt, it seems to me that when times are \ngood and you begin to have some significant progress in fiscal policy \nand you begin to run a real surplus, the prudent thing would be to \nbegin to reduce the Federal debt. So that would be my vote.\n  But we are not there yet. And I certainly do not support those who \nrush to this flame now and say, well, if CBO says there is a surplus, \nhere is how we ought to deal with it: Let's provide some more tax \nbreaks. Let's provide some more spending.\n  What about let's do some honest accounting? What about let's say that \nthe CBO, when it reports, if it reports, it must follow budget law and \nreport to the American people the facts, not just half the story?\n  So I come to the floor not to say there is not a parade going on--I \nguess there is a parade--but they are celebrating the wrong thing. Let \nus celebrate some success. We have had some major progress in fiscal \npolicy. That progress is due in no small part, in my judgment, to the \nPresident's 1993 recommendations on a new fiscal policy. That plan \nrequired some effort to vote for it, but we did, and things are better. \nI would also say some restraint on spending by the Republicans and \nDemocrats here in the Congress and also a growing economy have also \nhelped our budget picture.\n  All of that contributes to a better story on fiscal policy. But we \nare not at a real surplus yet. And the Congressional Budget Office \nknows better, as do the newspapers that print this. In fact, I sat with \na reporter last Thursday just briefly just to say hello. We\n\n[[Page S4612]]\n\nhappened to see each other accidentally, and I said I read the story \nabout the supposed budget surplus. I said, ``You know that's not in \nsurplus.''\n  Well, that reporter understood about unified budget surpluses and on-\nbudget deficits. But the fact is that CBO was reporting half the story \nlast week, and the press dutifully reports it the way CBO says it, and \nCBO and everybody here knows they are wrong.\n  So I hope those who began last week to talk about what they want to \ndo with all this alleged surplus, and who will likely waste this week \ntrying to figure it out, I hope they will take a look at page 32-33 of \nThe Economic and Budget Outlook produced by CBO in January. There--not \nin the monthly review, but in the annual January report--CBO has a line \nthat describes what the real deficit is.\n  But that line is nowhere to be found on their monthly reports that \nthey put on the Internet that resulted in last week's press statements. \nI hope CBO will change that, and put the information about the real \nstate of our budget in its monthly reviews. And I hope the press picks \nup on that information and starts reporting it.\n  That information will add enormously to our budget discussions this \nsummer. Then we might have an honest debate on whether there really is \ngoing to be a surplus at the end of this fiscal year, a surplus that \ncan be used for purposes other than Social Security. I don t think \nthere will be, and I look forward to making that point.\n\n\n                        A Return-Free Tax System\n\n  Mr. President, one additional point. Last week we passed a major IRS \nreform bill. I voted for the bill because I think it has many \nprovisions that ought to be very helpful for taxpayers dealing with the \nIRS. I have some continuing concerns about other parts of the bill. For \nexample, I m concerned about the method used to pay for it. It was a \nsleight-of-hand kind of method and needs to be changed in conference.\n\n  Having said all that, in this Chamber last week I complimented \nSenators Roth, Moynihan and others for their leadership in writing some \nof these provisions. I want to point out a significant provision in the \nbill that requires the Treasury Department to study and develop \nprocedures for implementing a return-free tax system beginning after \nthe year 2007.\n  I have described to my colleagues a piece of legislation that I have \nworked on for many months that could provide a return-free tax system \nfor up to 70 million Americans. While I am very encouraged by what \nSenator Roth and Senator Moynihan have done and fully support it--and \nthink they have advanced this issue some, I have also visited with \nboth, encouraging them to work with us in conference to move up this \n2007 date.\n  The fact is we could much more quickly go to a return-free income tax \nfiling system for anywhere from 50 to 70 million Americans. It is not a \nvery complicated thing to do. It would be relatively easy to say to \nmost Americans with incomes mostly from wages and salaries--and who \nhave only a modest amount of non-wage income such as interests, \ndividends and capital gains--that they could decide never to file a \nfederal income tax return again. These taxpayers would make a few \nsimple adjustments on their W-4 form at work, and their employers would \nwithhold their precise tax liability over the year using a table \nprovided by the IRS. This withholding now becomes their exact tax \nliability for the year. No return needs to be filed. They don't have to \ngo looking for records. They don't have to rush to the post office on \nthe night of April 15 to get a postmark. It becomes the exact tax \nliability. And, in most cases, these taxpayers won't have to worry \nabout an audit.\n  Two additional adjustments would be put on the W-4, which all \nemployees now file with their employer, to capture the per child tax \ncredit that Congress adopted last year and a tax deduction for home \nownership. These adjustments are provided by the IRS on a table. These \nadjustments would be no more difficult for the employer.\n  But from that process, I believe that 50 to 70 million people could \nbe relieved of the obligation to file an income tax return. Some 365 \nmillion hours of work now done by taxpayers to prepare returns and get \nthem filed could be eliminated. How much paper for 70 million tax \nreturns and supporting materials gone? And we could do this in the next \nyear or so.\n  I rise today only to say I am very pleased that Senator Roth and \nSenator Moynihan included this return-free approach in the Senate s IRS \nrestructuring bill. I would just commend to them that a piece of \nlegislation I have written would advance that very quickly. We could do \nit in a year or so. More than thirty countries around the world use \nsome form of return-free filing system--no paper. Employees do not have \nto file a return. Some of the countries, incidentally, have a \nreconciliation by the taxing agency, while others mirror my approach \nwhere you simply retool the W-4 form to make it slightly more accurate. \nIt isn't much longer and is no more difficulty for the employer, but my \nplan relieves probably 50 to 70 million people from having to file an \nincome tax return.\n  I think if we did that, it would be a giant step towards real tax \nsimplification for millions and millions of Americans. There are others \nin Congress who say, well, what we want to do is get rid of the entire \ntax system, which is fine. If one believes we should do that, then with \nwhat do you replace it? They say, well, a flat tax so that Donald Trump \npays the same tax rate as the barber in my hometown.\n  I don't happen to share the belief that would be a fair system. I \nthink maybe Donald--maybe I shouldn't use his name, but he seems to \nhave his name on everything. He probably would not mind my using it. I \nthink Donald might want to pay a slightly higher rate than the barber \nin my hometown; or others say, well, let's have a national sales tax.\n\n  A study by a tax expert at the Brookings Institution says if you have \na national sales tax, the rates would probably be over 30 percent, and \nthen add the State and local taxes, and that would be on almost \neverything. So say you would like to buy a house and here is the price \nwe have agreed on, and then have someone tell you, oh, yes, you have a \n37-percent sales tax applied to that price, 30 percent Federal, 7 \npercent State and local.\n  Others say a value-added tax. There are all kinds of ideas for how to \nchange the tax system. I would say it is unlikely that we are going to \nsee the current income tax system completely obliterated. I expect that \nin some form it will be around for some while, and if it is, I would \nvery much like to see it radically simplified for most of the American \npeople. It is hard to have a one-size-fits-all. I understand that some \npeople have very complicated income situations; they have a lot of \nincome from different areas and a lot of expenses from other areas. I \nthink in some cases those are very complicated; it is very hard to \nsimplify that. But for the vast majority of the American people, \nworking families whose main income comes from a wage or salary and who \nhave very little other income, this income tax system need not be a \nheadache. It could be radically simplified. It could be done very \nquickly.\n  We could move to a return-free system, as I indicated, for up to 70 \nmillion Americans and we could do it in a year. I very much hope--with \nthe cooperation of my friend, the Senator from Delaware, Senator Roth, \nand Senator Moynihan--we can make some progress on that.\n  As I close, let me also say, as I did last week, they have provided \nsignificant leadership, I think, to pass the legislation we did through \nthe Senate last week. I once again commend both of them for that \nleadership.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I make a point of order a quorum \nis not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/11/senate-section/article/S4611-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4612-S4613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1618, S. 1723, S. 1260, and S. 2037\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I intend to, on behalf of the majority \nleader, propound a unanimous consent request. I understand that at this \ntime the Democratic leader may have to oppose this unanimous consent \nrequest.\n\n[[Page S4613]]\n\n But I also believe that given the next couple of hours perhaps we can \nget some agreement. Both Senator Lott and Senator Daschle, I \nunderstand, are in discussion. But I think we ought to move forward as \nwe told the Senate we would and at least start discussions of these \nbills.\n  So, therefore, understanding that we have some optimism about a \nunanimous consent agreement within the next couple of hours, I will \npropound the unanimous consent request. I understand Senator Dorgan, \nthe Senator from North Dakota, will object.\n  Madam President, on behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the majority leader, after consultation with the Democratic \nleader, may proceed to the consideration of S. 1618.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that there be a total of 2 hours of \ndebate equally divided in the usual form. I further ask that the only \namendment in order other than the committee amendments be a managers' \namendment.\n  I finally ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the \nabove amendments the bill be read a third time and the Senate then \nproceed to a vote on passage of S. 1618 with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  Madam President, that is the antislamming bill, on which, as we know, \nthere have been numerous hearings and discussion and debate not only \nwithin the Senate but in the entire country.\n  Additionally, I ask unanimous consent that the majority leader, after \nconsultation with the Democratic leader, may proceed to the \nconsideration of S. 1723. I further ask unanimous consent that there be \na total of 2 hours of debate equally divided in the usual form. I \nfurther ask that no amendment be in order other than the committee-\nreported substitute amendment.\n  I finally ask unanimous consent that following disposition of the \nabove amendment, the bill be read a third time and the Senate then \nproceed to a vote on passage of S. 1723 with no intervening action or \ndebate. That, Madam President, is the skilled workers immigration bill \nthat is sponsored by Senator Abraham.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that the majority leader, after \nconsultation with the Democratic leader, may proceed to the \nconsideration of S. 1260. I further ask unanimous consent that there be \na total of 2 hours of debate equally divided in the usual form. I \nfurther ask that no amendments be in order other than the committee-\nreported substitute amendment.\n  I finally ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the \nabove amendment, the bill be read a third time and the Senate then \nproceed to a vote on passage of S. 1260 with no intervening action or \ndebate. That bill is the Uniform Standards Act.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the majority leader, after \nconsultation with the Democratic leader, may proceed to the \nconsideration of S. 2037. I further ask consent there be a total of 30 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form, with an additional \n15 minutes under the control of Senator Ashcroft. I further ask that no \namendment be in order to the bill.\n  I finally ask unanimous consent that following the expiration or \nyielding back of the time, the bill be read a third time and the Senate \nproceed to a vote on the passage of S. 2037 with no intervening action \nor debate.\n  Madam President, that is the so-called WIPO copyright legislation \nfrom Senator Hatch, reported out of the Judiciary Committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. And I shall object, but under my reservation let me point \nout, as I think the Senator from Arizona pointed out, no such agreement \nhas been reached between the majority and minority leaders on these \npieces of legislation dealing with the procedures under which they will \nbe considered. All of the unanimous consent requests provide a limited \ntime and limited amendments. I think in most cases only the managers' \namendment would be allowed, which would then preclude amendments from \nother Members of the Senate. It is my hope that some kind of an \nagreement will be reached by the majority and minority leaders, but \nuntil such an agreement is reached, I am constrained to object, so I do \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I remain hopeful that within the next \ncouple of hours we can reach this unanimous consent agreement. There \nhas been a great deal of discussion about taking up these pieces of \nlegislation--in fact, several others in addition. But I believe that \nthe Senator from North Dakota shares my optimism that perhaps we can, \nwith some modifications, achieve a unanimous consent agreement.\n\n  I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, if the Senator will yield, I do not \nthink the question here is about the particular issues the Senator \nproposes to bring to the floor. In fact, most of them will have rather \nwide support. The question deals with the conditions under which they \nwill be brought to the floor and on the restriction on amendments. As \nthe Senator knows, that is a product of having to consult with other \nmembers of the caucus and the consultation between the majority leader \nand the minority leader. I know they are visiting, and I would expect \nand hope that that is resolved. But until it is resolved we must \nobject, and I appreciate very much the understanding of the Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/11/senate-section/article/S4612-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4613-S4615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE EFFECT OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ON THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I want to quote from the Department of \nCommerce:\n\n       During the past few years, the U.S. economy has performed \n     beyond most expectations. A shrinking budget deficit, low \n     interest rates, a stable macroeconomic environment, expanding \n     international trade with fewer barriers, and effective \n     private sector management are all credited with playing a \n     role in this healthy economic performance. Many observers \n     believe that advances in information technology driven by the \n     growth of the Internet have also contributed to creating this \n     healthier than expected economy.\n       In recent testimony to Congress, Federal Reserve Board \n     Chairman Alan Greenspan noted:\n       ``Our Nation has been experiencing a higher growth rate of \n     productivity--output per hour worked--in recent years. The \n     dramatic improvements in computing power and communication \n     and information technology appear to have been a major force \n     behind this beneficial trend.''\n\n  Madam President, we all pay close attention to Federal Reserve Board \nChairman Alan Greenspan, and usually, especially in this case, we \nagree.\n\n       Some have even suggested that these advances will create a \n     long boom which will take the economy to new heights over the \n     next quarter century.\n       While the full impact of information technology cannot yet \n     be precisely evaluated, its impact is significant. \n     Information technology industries have been growing at more \n     than double the rate of the overall economy, a trend that is \n     likely to continue. Investments in information technology now \n     represent over 45 percent of all business equipment \n     investment. Declining prices for information technology \n     products have lowered overall inflation.\n       Because the Internet is new and its uses are developing \n     very rapidly, reliable economy-wide statistics are hard to \n     find and further research is needed. Therefore, we have to \n     use industry and company examples to illustrate the rapid \n     pace at which Internet commerce is being deployed and \n     benefits are being realized. Examples showing the growth of \n     the Internet in electronic commerce this past year are \n     numerous.\n       Fewer than 40 million people around the world were \n     connected to the Internet during 1996. By the end of 1997, \n     more than 100 million people were using the Internet. As of \n     December 1996, about 627,000 Internet domain names had been \n     registered. By the end of 1997, the number of domain names \n     more than doubled to reach 1.5 million.\n       Traffic on the Internet has been doubling every 100 days.\n\n  Madam President, I feel compelled to repeat that.\n\n       Traffic on the Internet has been doubling every 100 days.\n       Cisco Systems closed 1996 having booked just over $100 \n     million in sales on the Internet. By the end of 1997, its \n     Internet sales were running at a $3.2 billion annual rate.\n       In 1996, Amazon.com, the first Internet bookstore, recorded \n     sales of less than $16 million. In 1997, it sold $148 million \n     worth of books to Internet customers.\n       One of the Nation's largest book retailers, Barnes & Noble, \n     launched its own on-line\n\n[[Page S4614]]\n\n     bookstore in 1997 to compete with Amazon for this rapidly \n     growing on-line market.\n       In January 1997, Dell Computers was selling less than $1 \n     million of computers per day on the Internet. The company \n     reported reaching daily sales of $6 million several times \n     during the December 1997 holiday period.\n       Auto-by-Tel, a web-based automotive marketplace, processed \n     a total of 345,000 purchase requests for autos through its \n     web site in 1996 for $1.8 billion in auto sales. As of the \n     end of November 1997, the web site was generating $500 \n     million a month in auto sales, which is $6 billion \n     annualized, and processed over 100,000 purchase requests each \n     month.\n\n  Madam President, that is just a few examples of the way this industry \nis exploding into American life and through all parts of it. How it is \nchanging America is dramatic and, frankly, there are very few of us who \nknow exactly what the end results are going to be. And there are \ndiffering opinions among different experts as to what these impacts are \ngoing to be, but there is one area of agreement, and that is it has \nchanged American commerce and perhaps the world's commerce and flow of \ninformation in a way that will fundamentally change a lot of the \nprecepts under which we have operated since the Industrial Revolution.\n\n       If the trend suggested by this preliminary analysis \n     continues, it, and electronic commerce, can be expected to \n     drive economic growth for many years to come. To realize this \n     potential, however, the private sector and governments must \n     work together to create a predictable, market-driven legal \n     framework to facilitate electronic commerce, to create \n     nonbureaucratic means that ensure that the Internet is a \n     safe environment, and to create human resource policies \n     that endow students and workers with the skills necessary \n     for jobs in the new digital economy.\n\n  Thus, in real terms, the expansion of the IT sector accounts for an \neven larger share of overall economic growth in the mid- to late 1990s. \nIn recent years, IT industries have been responsible for more than one-\nquarter of real economic growth.\n\n       Despite these impressive trends, the digital revolution is \n     just beginning. Growth could accelerate in the coming years \n     not only in the IT sector itself, but across all sectors of \n     the economy as the number of people connected to the Internet \n     multiplies and as its commercial use grows. The growth will \n     be driven by four types of economic activity:\n       Building out the Internet: In 1994, three million people, \n     most of them in the United States, used the Internet. In \n     1998, 100 million people around the world use the Internet. \n     Some experts believe that one billion people may be connected \n     to the Internet by 2005. This expansion is driving dramatic \n     increases in computer, software, services and communications \n     investments.\n       Electronic commerce among businesses: Businesses began \n     using the Internet for commercial transactions with their \n     business partners about two years ago. Early users already \n     report significant productivity improvements from using \n     electronic networks to create, buy, distribute, sell, and \n     service products and services. By 2002, the Internet may be \n     used for more than $300 billion worth of commerce between \n     businesses.\n       Digital delivery of goods and services: Software programs, \n     newspapers, and music CDs no longer need to be packaged and \n     delivered to stores, homes or news kiosks. They can be \n     delivered electronically over the Internet. Airline tickets \n     and securities transactions over the Internet already occur \n     in large numbers. Other industries such as consulting \n     services, entertainment, banking and insurance, education and \n     health care face some hurdles but are also beginning to use \n     the Internet to change the way they do business. Over time, \n     the sale and transmission of goods and services \n     electronically is likely to be the largest and most visible \n     driver of the new digital economy.\n       Retail sale of tangible goods: The Internet can also be \n     used to order tangible goods and services that are produced, \n     stored and physically delivered. Though Internet sales are \n     less than 1 percent of total retail sales today, sales of \n     certain products such as computers, software, cars, books and \n     flowers are growing rapidly.\n       Where advances in telecommunications and computing largely \n     occurred side-by-side in the past, today, they converge in \n     the Internet. Soon, virtually all information technology \n     investment will be part of interlinked communications system, \n     whether internal to a business, between businesses, between \n     individuals and businesses, or individual to individual.\n       However measured, the Internet is expanding at a very rapid \n     pace.\n       For instance, the number of Americans using the Internet \n     has grown from fewer than 5 million in 1993 to as many as 62 \n     million by 1997. . . .\n       The number of names registered in the domain name system \n     grew from 26,000 in July 1993 to 1.3 million in four years . \n     . .\n       In January 1995, just over 27,000 top-level commercial \n     (com) domain names were assigned. Most businesses used them \n     for little more than posting product and company \n     descriptions, store locations, annual reports and information \n     about how to contact corporate headquarters. Two and a half \n     years later, commercial domain names number 764,000. Static \n     brochures and bulletin boards are giving way to full-fledged \n     businesses offering financial services, news and information, \n     manufactured goods, and travel and entertainment to \n     individuals and businesses.\n       To meet this increased demand, consumer electronics \n     companies, media giants, phone companies, computer companies, \n     software firms, satellite builders, cell phone businesses, \n     Internet service providers, televisions cable companies and, \n     in a few cases, electric utilities, are aggressively \n     investing to build out the Internet.\n\n  Madam President, I made the opening statement as we take up, frankly, \nwhat are some very modest bills, pieces of legislation which have to do \nwith the telecommunications industry. I hope this is a beginning. My \nfundamental premise is, we should get out of the way and stay out of \nthe way of this burgeoning, incredible revolution we are seeing take \nplace throughout the world.\n  But there are times where we have to act. I would argue that we have \nto act in a deregulatory manner and a procompetitive manner. One of the \nissues that the Senator from North Dakota and I have discussed on many \noccasions and will continue to discuss--and hopefully we can reach some \nagreement--is the issue of Internet taxation. Other issues that we are \ngoing to take up, which are visible and very important to many \nAmericans, like this business of slamming, will have to be addressed.\n  Madam President, the Presiding Officer now in the chair, you have \nbeen very significantly involved in this issue. Your findings and \nrecommendations have been made part of this bill. I understand you may \nhave additional changes that you wish to be made. But we are in \nagreement this abuse has to stop, and it has to stop immediately.\n  I hope the Congress, as representatives of the people, will \nunderstand that this industry we are talking about today, the \ntelecommunications industry, opens broad new vistas for our children \nand grandchildren. It also opens vistas for people and countries who \nhave never had access to information and knowledge before. It opens up \nnew vistas and ways for people in rural parts of America, and in low-\nincome parts of urban America, to receive information and knowledge. It \nseems to me that it has to be one of the most important issues that we \naddress in a comprehensive, cooperative, bipartisan fashion.\n  I see no reason for partisanship on an issue which really is so \nimportant to the future of America. I know we are in agreement that we \nwant to see it grow and expand. And all of us are astonished, literally \nastonished, at the amount of growth that we have seen. It is not just \nus neophytes. Literally every expert who has studied the \ntelecommunications industry has underestimated, sometimes by a factor \nof 10, the growth that has taken place in the past few years. So, \ntherefore, it is very likely they are underestimating the dramatic \nchanges and growth that we will see in the future.\n  There are some who argue that the information technology we are \nexporting around the world makes our trade deficit far less meaningful \nthan it has been in the past. There are some who argue that we, as a \nbody, and as a nation, are going to have to address this issue of the \nproliferation of pornography that now penetrates and permeates every \npart of the Internet, to the point where young children today, when \nthey go on the Internet and dial an innocuous word like ``White House'' \nor ``teen'' or ``nurse,'' are treated, as the search engine comes upon \nthem, to enticements to people to take advantage of the pornography \nwhich is available. I am not advocating censorship here. I don't \nbelieve the majority of this body is. But it is a problem. It is an \nissue that we need to address as well. But it is one of many.\n  I could spend many hours on the floor here, discussing the challenges \nof this telecommunications transformation that we are observing. I hope \nwhat we do in the next couple of days will do several things. One is to \naddress these relatively modest issues, although slamming is certainly \na very important one, but, at the same time, make a commitment that we, \nas a body, understand, appreciate, the importance of this industry to \nthe future of America, and that we will address these issues in an \norderly and bipartisan fashion.\n\n[[Page S4615]]\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I certainly share the sentiment offered \nby the Senator from Arizona about the excitement of the Internet, the \nfascinating, remarkable growth of the telecommunications industry and \nall that it means for the future of our country and the world. Things \nare moving so quickly, and changing so rapidly, it is just breathtaking \nand very hard to keep up with. From a public policy standpoint, \nregarding the kind of legislation that will be brought to the floor of \nthe Senate at some point--for example, such as the Internet Tax Freedom \nAct--it is very important that we understand exactly what we are doing \nand what the consequences of what we are doing might be now and in the \nfuture.\n  I would say the increased commerce over the Internet, that is \nincreasing at a very dramatic pace, illustrates that there is nothing \nat the moment, nothing anywhere that I am aware of at the moment, that \nimpedes the transaction of commerce on the Internet.\n  The very growth of that commerce suggests there are no impediments. \nOne way to do commerce in this country is to set up a web page and \nadvertise and sell books, automobiles, travel services, or whatever it \nis you want to advertise over the Internet. That is one way to do \nbusiness.\n  Another way to do business is to rent a storefront someplace to get \nsome inventory moved in, hire some people, open the door and put ``Open \nfor Business'' and invite customers to come in and look at your \nmerchandise and sell merchandise that way.\n  Still another way is to have your merchandise in a warehouse \nsomewhere and send a catalog through the mail and do business through \nmail-order catalogs.\n  If the Congress decides to change the state and local Tax Codes \nrelated to all of those different ways of doing business, it is very \nimportant that we not create a circumstance where one way of doing \nbusiness has preference over another way. I certainly hope that \nwhatever we do to those involved in Internet transactions, we will say, \n``To whatever extent you are advantaged by this new legislation, the \nMain Street businesses will be similarly advantaged.''\n  The Internet Tax Freedom Act is very controversial in my judgment. \nThe concerns Governors and many others have about what impact it might \nor might not have on the State and local revenue bases are serious. The \nInternet Tax Freedom Act is a very significant piece of legislation and \nit is very controversial.\n  Another issue that the Senator from Arizona mentioned is the slamming \nissue. For those who are not familiar with slamming, it refers to the \nunauthorized practice of a company changing a consumer's telephone \nexchange service or telephone toll service. In other words, a company \nsays if you are using one long distance service, we are going to change \nthat and your new long distance carrier is XYZ, and all of a sudden you \nbegin getting bills from XYZ when, in fact, you never authorized \nchanging your long-distance carrier. That is called slamming, and it is \na growing, continual problem in this country.\n  The FCC had about 20,000 complaints of slamming in the last year. We \nunderstand the ``king of slammers'' identified by Chairman Kennard of \nthe FCC is a man named Daniel Fletcher. GAO investigators allege that \nFletcher switched at least a half million customers' long-distance \nservice without their knowledge or consent.\n  I noticed a story in the paper this past weekend in North Dakota that \none of the victims of slamming was the attorney general of North \nDakota, Heidi Heitkamp. ``Heitkamp Victim of Phone Billing Scam'' reads \none headline.\n  This company that was slamming would have been well-advised to stay \naway from the attorney general of that State.\n  I am confident that the North Dakota attorney general is on the case. \nShe is aggressive and tough and will get to the bottom of who is \ninvolved in this slamming.\n  To all the slammers out there I will say, ``Senator McCain, I and \nothers will bring a piece of legislation to the floor that will attempt \nto shut the door on slamming. But, slammers might want to stay away \nfrom attorneys general and law enforcement officers, because it is \nagainst the law. We hope, prior to the legislation being passed, we can \ncount on State authorities and the FCC to take appropriate action to \nlevy fines and other penalties against those who are involved in this \nkind of activity.\n  There are a number of other issues we will discuss when we talk about \nslamming. I expect the U.S. Senate will pass this legislation by a \nwide, wide majority. It is a good piece of legislation. I compliment \nSenator McCain for bringing it to the floor. Only because the majority \nleader and minority leader have not talked and reached agreement on the \nquestion of procedure we are not able to proceed at this point. But I \nexpect in the coming hours, when Senator Lott and Senator Daschle will \nfind a mechanism by which we are able to consider this legislation.\n  I just received a note from someone else, from another Senator in the \nChamber that says, ``I've been slammed twice.'' I don't know if that \nSenator wishes to be identified. In any event, it is not something that \nonly relates to attorneys general. I have not been slammed once, and I \nam not looking forward to the first slam. Hopefully, before that \nhappens, this kind of legislation can pass. Those who have been victims \nwill be victims no more, and those who have been involved in slamming \nwill begin to pay a significant price for criminal behavior.\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Senators will be present. They will be able to hear the \ndebate. And our respective conference lunches will hear more debate on \nthis issue, and hopefully, following our hour debate, at 2:15 the issue \nwill be clearer for all of us and perhaps we will be able to proceed \ntomorrow to final action on this report.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank all Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I just want to concur in the unanimous \nconsent agreement and commend my chairman, Senator Lugar, for his \nleadership on this bill. This is an extremely important bill. We should \nhave gotten it through a long time ago. There are farmers out in my \narea of the country, all up and down the Midwest--I am sure in the \nSenator's home State also--who have contracts up this summer on crop \ninsurance, and if we don't hurry up and get this through, we are going \nto be in big trouble; we will not have the money for the crop insurance \nprogram to allow these farmers to renew their contracts for next year. \nSo it is imperative that we do get it through.\n  If this bill were to be recommitted--and I will have more to say \nabout this tomorrow, but I wanted to talk about this a little here--I \nthink that would be the end of the bill. We tried for a long time in \nconference to get to this point. It is a delicate balance of many \ninterests, but it is a good balance. It is one that balances all of the \ninterests in all sections of the country. It advances the cause of \nagricultural research; it does the job of providing the necessary funds \nto keep the crop insurance program going; and it also fills in the gap \non the food stamps for legal immigrants, elderly, disabled, and \nchildren, and also refugees and asylees who are in this country.\n  Madam President, as I said, the conference report of the Agricultural \nResearch Extension and Education Reform Act of 1998 represents a strong \nstatement by the Senate on the importance of research to the future of \nAmerican agriculture and fulfills important promises to restore food \nstamp benefits to legal immigrants, refugees, and asylees, and to fully \nfund the crop insurance program.\n  Again, I am pleased that both sides of the aisle in both the House \nand the Senate have come together to invest in the future of \nagriculture in rural communities as well as nutrition programs for \nneedy individuals who were unfairly cut off from food stamp benefits in \nthe welfare reform bill that we passed in 1996.\n  I again commend Chairman Lugar for his diligent and tireless efforts \nto, first of all, get the changes made in the research program that we \nso vitally need in this country in our ag research program, and his \nefforts to get the bill through, and through conference, and to the \npoint where we are now. Chairman Lugar has done a great job in guiding \nand directing and leading us in a bipartisan fashion to get the bill \nthrough.\n  We have had great cooperation. I am thankful to him for the great \ncooperation he has given me as the ranking member, and to his staff for \nthe many kindnesses that his staff has afforded our staff. I also \ncommend our colleagues in the House for assisting and aiding us getting \nthis bill through. I am especially pleased that the agriculture, \nnutrition and immigrant communities are united in support of this \nconference report.\n  Reinforcing the strong support for this bill, on April 24, 71 \nSenators sent a letter to the leadership asking that we bring up this \nbill and pass it. Madam President, 71 Senators signed a letter to the \nmajority leader of the Senate asking we bring up this bill and pass it. \nSo I hope we can move quickly on this vital piece of legislation.\n  Let me just mention the three components of the bill. First, the \nissue of food stamps. This bill will spend about $816 million over the \nnext 5 years to restore food stamp eligibility for nearly 250,000 \nindividuals. Again, with this action we have reaffirmed our compassion \nand our priority for taking care of the most vulnerable in our society. \nThe bill takes a major step towards fulfilling a promise that was made \nby our President and many of us here in the Congress on both sides of \nthe aisle to correct inequities made in the 1996 Welfare Reform Act.\n  What we have done in this bill, Madam President, mirrors the changes \nmade in last year's balanced budget agreement. That bill eliminated \neligibility for several classes of legal immigrants for food stamps. \nRefugees, asylees, elderly and disabled legal immigrants and their \nchildren, Hmong refugees and certain native Americans who were unfairly \ndenied food stamp benefits will once again be eligible for this \nimportant food assistance under this bill before us.\n  I might also add, parenthetically, that it is not just compassion, \nbut it is dollar wise. We know in the past when these people are cut \noff from the needed food stamps, the elderly and the disabled, their \nkids are cut off, and when they lack nutrition, where do they end up? \nThey are at the emergency room door of our hospitals, and we pay for \nthat. Better we put some money into adequate food and nutrition to keep \nthem healthy in the first place rather than pay for the needed medical \nservices they would require later on.\n  Under research and rural development, the research provisions of this \nbill will ensure that our farmers and ranchers have the word's best \nscience and technology at their disposal to produce food and fiber, to \nprotect the environment, and to create rural economic opportunities. In \nthis regard, we are devoting $600 million in new funds over the next 5 \nyears to advance the science and technology underlying our agricultural \nsystem. This new initiative will invest in priority research\n\n[[Page S4617]]\n\ntopics like food safety, biotechnology and environmental quality. There \nare new incentives for the development of new crops and new uses for \nexisting crops. Finally, modest reforms in the land grant system will \nhelp it to remain a leader in research, education and outreach in the \ncoming century.\n  We have also extended the Fund for Rural America through the year \n2002, and we have reaffirmed our commitment to the pressing development \nneeds of our rural communities. This fund was a key component of the \n1996 farm bill, created to provide funds to help farmers in rural \ncommunities to transition to the new farm policy environment. Although \nI wish we could have found more funds for this purpose, I am pleased \nthat over the next 5 years, an additional $100 million was added to the \nFund for Rural America.\n  Finally, the third component of the bill is crop insurance. Since the \nlast Crop Insurance Reform Act in 1994, participation in crop insurance \nhas more than doubled in our country. Without agreement to this \nconference report, millions of farmers face the possibility of canceled \ninsurance policies in just the next few months. That would leave them \nwithout risk protection for the 1999 crop season.\n  The action we have taken in this bill will secure funding for the \nCrop Insurance Program for the next 5 years. It will set the stage also \nfor a vigorous debate about how to further restructure and reform the \nprogram in the coming years. I look forward to working with Chairman \nLugar in moving that discussion and that debate forward. The more tools \nand options we can give our farmers to manage the risks of production, \nthe more resilient our rural communities will be in the face of market \nand weather fluctuations.\n  So this conference report accomplishes a great deal in a single \npackage. We have let the world know that we care about the vulnerable \nin our society, those who are refugees and asylees who are escaping \npersecution--many times religious persecution in other countries. A lot \nof times when they come here, they don't have a million dollars in \ntheir pockets. Usually those aren't the kind of people who are \npersecuted. But those who are persecuted for religious beliefs or \notherwise, a lot of times who flee their countries, who come here, they \ndon't have a lot of money. They need an education. And, yes, we provide \nthem food assistance. I think that is a part of what we ought to be \nabout in this country. What this bill does is it restores it. We say to \nthose people, if you are escaping intolerable situations in other parts \nof the world, our doors will be open to refugees and asylees, and we \nare going to assure that you have adequate nutrition to get you to the \npoint where you can apply for citizenship.\n  Second, we have let the world know we are serious about equipping \nAmerican agriculture for future food production challenges. We have \ntaken the steps to assure the taxpayers that research dollars are \nexpended in the most efficient manner. Finally, we ensure that our \nfarmers will have good risk management tools available to them.\n  We have done all of this in a very strong, bipartisan manner. We can \nall take pride in the fact that today we have made a significant \ninvestment in a better future, not only for our farmers and ranchers, \nbut also in a better future for an increasingly crowded and hungry \nworld. So, Madam President, I urge my colleagues to agree to this \nconference report without delay.\n  Madam President, I will have more to say tomorrow about the pending \namendment by the Senator from Texas, who as I understand, would exempt \nfrom the coverage of the Food Stamp Program, refugees and asylees who \ncome to this country after, I think it is August of 1996, if I am not \nmistaken. I think that would just be the wrong step to take, first of \nall, for a compassionate and caring society, and for those of us who \ncare about asylees and refugees. I think that covers both political \nparties, and certainly covers all of the religious institutions in \nAmerica. I know I received letters from--I know Cardinal O'Connor in \nNew York, from many members of the Jewish faith, other Christian faiths \nwho have written to us asking us to please make this fix in food stamps \nto cover these very vulnerable people who are in our society.\n\n  And, second, I would just say again, if the amendment contemplated by \nthe Senator from Texas were to be successful, that is referring this \nback to conference committee, that would be the end of this bill. Make \nno mistake about it. The amendment that I have seen written and \nproposed--he has not offered it yet, but as proposed by the Senator \nfrom Texas--would kill this bill. It would kill the research provisions \nof this bill and it could kill the crop insurance provisions of this \nbill along with the food stamp provisions.\n  Why do I say that? For two reasons. First, because we worked long and \nhard to get to this point in a bipartisan fashion. There were long, \nserious discussions both in the Senate and in the House and in \nconference, and we reached our agreements and we have strong bipartisan \nsupport for this. If this were to go back to the conference committee--\none, either the conference committee would not or could not make these \nchanges, and thus the bill would die in conference; or if the \nconference committee voted to make these changes and it went back to \nthe House, there is no way that it would succeed in the House. Maybe it \nwouldn't even succeed in the Senate. I don't know.\n  But, Madam President, I have been on the Agriculture Committee now, \nboth in the House and the Senate, for 23 years. I have been through a \nlot of farm bills and a lot of farm bill amendments and modifications. \nAnd we have for a long time had a good working relationship with our \nurban friends in keeping a good, strong coalition together to both \nanswer the needs of those of us who represent rural America and to \nanswer the needs of those who represent urban America.\n  I believe it has been a good working relationship. When we look at \nit, hunger in America is almost nonexistent. Yes, we have some gaps out \nthere. Yes, we have some nutritional gaps out there, but compared to \nany other country, we are light-years ahead.\n  We provide the needed nutrition from the School Breakfast Program to \nthe School Lunch Program to afternoon programs to the Food Stamp \nProgram to Women, Infants and Children nutrition program, and then we \nprovide support for our food banks and our soup kitchens and feeding \nfacilities around the country along with the private sector.\n  We have taken care to address the nutritional needs of those who live \nin our urban areas, and we have taken care of the needs of those who \nlive in our rural areas. As I said, part of this bill is funds for \nrural America that helps continue to invest in rural economic \ndevelopment so our people who live in small towns and communities will \nhave the kind of jobs and support they need. Our farmers will have the \nrisk management tools and crop insurance they will need to provide the \nfood and fiber for America.\n  It has been a good coalition, a healthy coalition. The amendment \ncontemplated by the Senator from Texas will tear that coalition apart. \nThat is why I say, if it were to succeed--I don't think it will, I hope \nit won't, I don't think it will--if it were, that would be the end of \nthis bill.\n  I am hopeful, and I know the Senator from Texas is sincere in what he \nis trying to do--I happen to disagree with him, deeply disagree--that \nwe ought to carve out asylees and refugees from the food stamp \nprovisions of this bill.\n  Be that as it may, I still suggest that this amendment really is a \nbasic amendment that will kill this bill. We can't afford to have that \nhappen. I hope all my colleagues will support the chairman and support \nothers on both sides of the aisle who signed the letter to bring up the \nbill and to pass it as it is. If we do that, I think we can have a \nswift conclusion of this bill tomorrow, get it down to the President \nfor his signature, our farmers can go ahead and get their crop \ninsurance contracts renewed, we can begin the process of changing our \nresearch system, and we can meet the nutritional needs of the most \nvulnerable in our society. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Mississippi is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the order has been \nentered for the consideration of the conference report on the \nagriculture research bill. As Senators may remember, when we passed the \n1996 farm bill, the research\n\n[[Page S4618]]\n\nprograms were only authorized to the year 1997. This allowed the \ncommittees of jurisdiction to undertake a reevaluation of the way in \nwhich Federal dollars are allocated to research facilities that are \noperated by the Department of Agriculture and that are used for grants \nfor research and extension service activities at colleges and \nuniversities throughout the country.\n  As a result of that review, this legislation was produced. It \nimproves the way those funds are allocated. It targets those funds to \nthe highest priority subjects for agriculture research in our country. \nIt is this Senator's hope that the Senate will approve the conference \nreport and we can proceed to consider other related legislation.\n  I point out the fact that we are in the appropriations process now \nfor the next fiscal year. The passage of this conference report will \nfacilitate the handling of the appropriations bill for the Department \nof Agriculture and other departments of the Government. If we are sent \nback to rewrite the bill in conference on a motion to recommit, it will \nslow down the process. It will make it more difficult to achieve the \nkind of coherent funding procedure that we would otherwise be able to \nenjoy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/11/senate-section/article/S4615-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1873\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nmandatory quorum under rule XXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this legislation was introduced by me and \nthe distinguished Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye, last month. It is \nlegislation that would change the policy of our country with respect to \nthe deployment of a national missile defense system that would protect \nour Nation against limited ballistic missile attack. Since its \nintroduction, 48 other Senators have joined us as cosponsors of the \nlegislation, and the Senate Armed Services Committee has reviewed the \nlegislation and reported it for the consideration of the Senate. The \ncommittee report is available as Calendar Order No. 345, and I invite \nthe attention of Senators to the report.\n  The legislation was produced because of the findings of the \nSubcommittee on International Security, Proliferation, and Federal \nServices, which I chair, which conducted hearings over the past year \nlooking into the threat caused by the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction and the means for delivering those weapons of mass \ndestruction, particularly missile systems.\n  We had numerous expert witnesses who talked about the basics of how \nmissile systems are developed, how the Atlas system was developed in \nour own country. General Bernard Schriever, who was the manager of the \nAtlas intercontinental ballistic missile program, told of the \nchallenges faced by those who worked to build this first long-range \nmissile system for the United States almost 50 years ago. He told of \nhow, with the passage of time and the development of new technologies \nand communications systems and the easy access to scientific and \ntechnical information, those hurdles that were so difficult to overcome \nback then are now not difficult at all; that nation states who are \nintent on developing the capacity to deliver weapons of mass \ndestruction over long distances now can achieve those results not with \na 10-year program, but almost overnight if they have the determination, \nare willing to commit the dollars necessary to acquire the component \nparts, and have access to outside assistance in the form of either \ncomponents or technical expertise.\n  You can see evidence of that and why that is really a new concern for \nus as a country without a national missile defense system, without the \ncapacity to defend ourselves against an accidental launch of an \nintercontinental ballistic missile, or an unauthorized launch from \nanother country possessing these systems, or from a rogue nation which \nputs all of these ingredients together without our being able to detect \nit and threatens the security of this country.\n  So this is an effort to change our national policy from the current \n3+3 program of the administration, which is to develop within 3 years, \nstarting in 1997, a national ballistic missile defense capability, and \nthen, if a threat is perceived to exist thereafter, to deploy such a \nsystem within 3 years from the date that the threat is perceived to \nexist. That is the 3+3 program of this administration. We are seriously \nconcerned that this is inadequate to meet the threat that currently \nexists.\n  First of all, the 3+3 program assumes that there is no threat at this \ntime to the security of the United States or to the citizens of the \nUnited States. The legislation we have introduced says that there is a \nthreat, we are vulnerable. There could be--although it might be \nunlikely--an accidental or unauthorized missile attack from Russia or \nfrom China, both of whom, as we know, have intercontinental ballistic \nmissile capabilities right now.\n  There is also an emerging threat that exists right now, because of \nevents that have occurred over the last several years that we have not \nbeen able to detect or discover through our intelligence gathering \nagencies. I am going to cite some examples. And I invite the attention \nof Senators to the bill itself, which recites a series of facts that \nwere uncovered during the course of the hearings our committee \nconducted last year.\n  The case of Iran is a good example. When that country was provided \nmissile components from Russia, we realized that they were capable of \nacquiring new expertise not discernible by the Central Intelligence \nAgency. As a matter of fact, during testimony that was provided to the \nSenate, the Director of Central Intelligence indicated that it was \nanticipated that Iran would not be able to develop a medium-range \nmissile system for some 8 years or 9 years into the future.\n  Now, 1 year after that testimony was delivered to the Senate in 1997, \nthe Director of Central Intelligence suggested that because of outside \nassistance obtained by Iran from other countries, it appears that they \nwould be able to deploy a medium-range ballistic missile much sooner \nthan had been earlier predicted. Even though the Director of Central \nIntelligence did not say exactly when that capability could be fielded, \na State Department witness told the Senate that, within a year or a \nyear and a half, that missile system could be deployed by Iran.\n  So what had been viewed as a threat which could occur 8 or 9 years in \nthe\n\n[[Page S4619]]\n\nfuture, now, according to testimony recently received, it is clear it \ncould be fielded some 7 or 8 years earlier than had been anticipated as \nrecently as a year ago.\n  Another example is the case of Pakistan, which recently--a month ago, \nApril 6--tested a ballistic missile with a range of 1,500 kilometers. \nIf you look at a report that was made available to the public back in \nNovember of 1997 on proliferation issues, it suggests that Pakistan has \nmissiles at this time with ranges of 300 kilometers. Now we see them \ntest a missile last month with five times the range of what was said to \nbe in their arsenal back in November, 6 months ago.\n  These are two examples of why the Director of Central Intelligence \nhas said that he is not able to predict with any degree of certainty \nwhen other nations, rest-of-world countries, will have intercontinental \nballistic missile capability--because of ``gaps and uncertainties.'' He \nused that phrase in his testimony to the Senate.\n  Another example of these surprises involved Iraq. You will recall \nthat Secretary Cohen, then Senator Bill Cohen, made comments on the \nfloor of the Senate about the surprise that had occurred when Iraq was \nable to launch a vehicle that almost put a satellite in Earth orbit \nand--not only that--demonstrate the capability of using missiles with \nmuch longer ranges, with much more sophistication than anyone in our \ncountry had anticipated. That was an example of a surprise to our \nintelligence agencies, who had not anticipated that those capabilities \nhad been developed in Iraq.\n  Iraq surprised us in other ways. With the purchase of Scud missiles \nfrom North Korea and improvements that were made in Iraq, almost \novernight the world was confronted with a nation state that had a \nlethal missile capability; was threatening its neighbors and \nothers; was developing weapons of mass destruction which could be \ncarried as warheads by these missiles; was threatening others with \ndestruction, suggesting that if it had a missile system that would \nreach the United States, it might use it. Actual threats were being \nmade about catastrophic damage being inflicted on the United States by \nIraq.\n\n  Fortunately for the defense of our security interests in that region, \nthe Army had been developing the Patriot missile defense system to \nprotect troops in the fields. It was a short-range system; that was \nreally all we had. When the Persian Gulf war broke out, Americans were \nable to see that this system was effective. It was not the best or the \nmost perfect system you could have because many of the Scud rockets got \nthrough. Some of them broke up over Israel. Some of them inflicted \nproperty damage all around the region. Twenty-eight soldiers were \nkilled in Dahran. United States troops were killed with those missiles \nbecause we were unable to protect their security at that time. We \ndidn't have a system that was good enough to be perfect or fail-safe. \nThere are risks.\n  But here we are now almost 10 years later and what have we done to \nimprove the capability to protect the citizens of the United States \nagainst threats that we have heard from others--which the bill \nrecites--and against the emerging sophistication and range of new \nmissile systems that are under development in other parts of the world? \nWe have gotten ourselves, I think, in the mindset of thinking about \nRussia and China as the only nations that we have to worry about who \nhave intercontinental ballistic missile capability. We have had with \nRussia a relationship that has kept either one of us from using our \nmissile weaponry and we are very grateful for the fact that we have \ncome through this period of confrontation with the old Soviet Union \nwithout having a catastrophic tragedy as a result of these weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  But now we can't just focus our attention on Russia and China. We \nhave to consider what is going on in the rest of the world where there \nare ``gaps and uncertainties'' in our ability to know exactly what is \ngoing on with respect to weapons development and missile development. \nBut what we know is what we have been able to observe. And what we have \nobserved is a steady and in some cases a rapid acceleration of \ncapability and sophistication in countries that do not consider \nthemselves friends of the United States. Some have talked about \nthreatening us with missile attacks, destroying the United States. \nOther comments have been made by people like Muammar Qadhafi. Others \nwho have expressed their anger toward the United States do not share \nour values.\n  We have to consider this to be a serious threat. The administration's \npolicy is a wait-and-see policy. Let's do research and let's proceed \nwith the development of a missile defense system, but let's wait and \nsee if there is a threat to our security interests posed by \nintercontinental ballistic missiles, and then we will proceed to deploy \nthe missile defense system.\n  You listen to anyone who has observed the funding process, the \nrequest for appropriations and authorization to proceed to the \ndevelopment of this program, and everybody agrees that there hasn't \nbeen enough money put in the program to reach a point where you will \nhave a system deployment. The administration assumes we will have \ndeveloped a defensive missile system within 3 years. We are into that \nnow, looking at the second year of that program, and the Secretary of \nDefense has already sent up a request for additional moneys over and \nabove what the President had said they would want for the program, \nadmitting in a letter he has written in response to this legislation \nthat there had not been robust enough funding to achieve that result.\n  I don't think you can find anybody who says that they are really \ngoing to complete this. They have now awarded a contract to a lead \nsystem integrator to develop a program pulling together all the \ncomponent parts that had been under separate research and development, \nto try to make a coherent system that could be deployed. But I don't \nknow of anybody who believes that can really be done in 3 years.\n\n  What we are trying to say to the Senate and to the administration \nwith the filing of this bill and calling up this legislation is that we \nneed to get serious. This is a threat which exists now. It is emerging \nin other nation states--some rogue states--and we are not doing enough \nto protect the security interests and the safety of American citizens \nwith the current policy. It is immoral to sit back and do nothing or to \ndo no more than talk about it.\n  If you look at the executive orders that have been signed by the \nPresident over the last 5 years, he has said repeatedly that we are \nconfronted with a national emergency as a result of ballistic missile \ndevelopments and weapons of mass destruction that we find going on in \nthe world today--a national emergency.\n  I wonder what would be the judgment of the historians who would \nobserve us in this situation. We are coming upon the end of a fiscal \nyear where it is projected we will have a budget surplus of $30 \nbillion--some say it may go as high as $50 billion--and we wake up one \nmorning to a ballistic missile threat that is very real, or a ballistic \nmissile attack that is made against our country. The American people \nare going to say what were we doing. And the administration said we \nasked for 3 billion dollars in this fiscal year. That doesn't sound \nmuch like a national emergency to me.\n  What I am beginning to realize is that if you talk like you are \nconcerned about the problem and you sound sincere about wanting to do \nsomething about it or solve a problem, that that is enough. You don't \nreally have to deliver. That is the political situation that I think we \nsee today. We are hearing rhetoric, we are hearing promises, we are \nhearing a plan announced to get us to a point where we will have a \nballistic missile defense system, but when you cut through all the talk \nand all the orders declaring it to be a national emergency, all of the \nbudget requests, all of the testimony before the hearings and you find \nout what is really going on, you see a program that has already been \ndescribed as a ``rush to failure,'' because of the architecture, the \nway it is constructed, the way the program is managed, all of the \nreasons that we have seen described in glowing terms by those who say \nwe are doing the right thing, we are doing just enough to keep us on a \nsteady course so we can protect the security of the country.\n  I don't believe we are doing enough. I don't believe we are managing \nthe program in a correct way, and I don't think we are going to get to \na point\n\n[[Page S4620]]\n\nwhere we have the capacity to protect our security or the safety of \nAmerican citizens at a time when there is a threat that we have to be \nconcerned about. I think we need to be concerned now. That is what this \nlegislation does.\n  I hope that Senators will look at our proposal. It says simply that \nit is the policy of the United States to deploy a system to defend our \ncountry against a ballistic missile attack as soon as the technology is \navailable. That is all this bill says.\n  The Congressional Budget Office was asked to assess the cost of the \nlegislation. They say that passage of this legislation has no cost \nimpact. The progress of the program to develop and deploy a system \nwould depend upon the annual authorization and appropriations process, \nlike any other acquisition program. And that is the point. This program \nhas not been treated like any other acquisition program, and that is \nthe problem. That is why it is a ``rush to failure.'' It is a rush to \nact like you are doing something, but not really accomplishing what you \nare saying you are setting out to accomplish. You are experimenting. \nYou are conducting some tests on various component parts, whether it is \ncommunications, missile systems, guidance systems, the interceptors \nthat are needed, the sensors that are necessary. All of those things \nare being tested. Some are considered successful; some have been \nconsidered unsuccessful. We had testimony from General Lyles, who runs \nthe Ballistic Missile Defense Office, who said that they have learned \nsomething from all of these tests. To that extent, all of the tests \nhave been successful in that we build on the knowledge gained. Some of \nthe critics who say it is a bad idea to have the capacity to defend our \ncountry against ballistic missile attack say that unless you have a \nperfect test that shows an interceptor hitting an in-coming missile, it \nis a failure, and it proves that we don't know how to do it.\n\n  Well, look back to 1991, when the Persian Gulf war occurred, when we \nsaw Patriot missiles intercepting Scud rockets. Some of the Patriots \nwere intercepting and blowing the Scuds up, or were near hits. The fact \nis that some of those interceptor missiles were working even then. We \nhave proven that we can hit a bullet with a bullet. We have the \ntechnology to do that today. What we don't have is the will to deploy a \nsystem to defend our country.\n  Now, let me say something about the relationship with Russia and the \nABM Treaty. Some are saying, ``Well, doesn't this mean you are backing \nout of the ABM Treaty?'' You have a treaty with Russia that says each \nwill not develop a defense system against the ballistic missiles of the \nother. Well, first of all, the ABM treaty doesn't have anything to do \nwith some of these nation states who are developing their own \nsophisticated and long-range weapons systems. We don't have a treaty \nwith them. We don't have a mutual-assured destruction arrangement with \nthem. We don't have any defense against their missiles. Even under the \nABM treaty, there is an opportunity to deploy a single-site missile \ndefense system, and it is under that premise that our program has been \ndeveloped up to this point--with a view that, if in the minds of those \nwho defend the current policy a threat is perceived to exist at some \nfuture date, then we will deploy a system that is compatible with the \nprovisions of the antiballistic missile agreement with Russia.\n  The treaty also permits that agreement to be amended. Whenever it is \nconsidered to be in the national interests of either country, \nnegotiations can take place. As a matter of fact, our President was \nurged by the Senate to commence negotiation for the purpose of amending \nthe agreements. We know that the administration has undertaken \ndemarcation talks to try to distinguish between theater ballistic \nmissile defense systems and the national ballistic missile defense \nsystem contemplated by the ABM Treaty, so that we can proceed to \ndevelop theater defenses like the Patriot, Navy Upper-Tier, the \nAirborne Laser system of the Air Force, and the Theater High Altitude \nDefense Area Program of the Army--looking at the different options that \nwe have for protecting our troops and limited areas against ballistic \nmissile attack. And so the ABM Treaty has some relevance in the debate, \nof course; but it is not an impediment to the adoption of this bill. It \nwould not contravene or in any way fly in the face of the Anti-\nBallistic Missile Treaty.\n  Some are beginning to realize that inevitably, at some point, we may \nhave to discuss with Russia further amendments to the ABM Treaty. \nRussia may consider those amendments to be in their interest, too. They \nare located in close geographical proximity to some of these other \ncountries that we have already mentioned. Not to suggest that there is \nany threat now, but there may be. Later, the Russians may have reason \nto agree with us that this is not only in our mutual interest, but it \nis in their individual interest. And so this is not a referendum on the \nABM Treaty. We do not seek to amend it or withdraw from it, or violate \nit by the passage of this legislation.\n  I am hopeful that after Senators review the report of the Armed \nServices Committee, the fact that the committee has recommended the \napproval of this legislation, and the findings that were made by our \nsubcommittee, some of which are recited in the language of the bill \nitself, that it will be the will of the Senate to adopt this bill and \nto say to all--the American citizens who may be worried about the \nvulnerability that we find ourselves in now, and those who may be \ncontemplating stealing a march on the U.S. by developing quickly a \nlong-range missile capability that could be used to threaten, \nintimidate, blackmail, or coerce our leadership--that we are not going \nto sit idly by and wait and see any longer. We are going to do what is \nnecessary to develop and deploy a national missile defense system \nagainst limited ballistic missile attack. So don't waste your money, \ndon't get carried away and go on a spending spree with a national \nprogram to develop a weapons system that is going to intimidate the \nUnited States, because we are not going to be intimidated. We are not \ngoing to be defenseless any longer.\n\n  And, finally, this is not a vote today to deploy a system now. It is \na vote today to say it is our policy to deploy a system when it is \ntechnologically possible, when an effective national missile defense \nsystem can be deployed.\n  So I hope that Senators will agree with this. Fifty Senators are \nsponsors of this legislation. I urge its adoption by the Senate.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the legislation being discussed this \nafternoon would undermine a carefully designed program called the \nNational Missile Defense Deployment Readiness Program, which is \ncurrently in place. That is why the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff and the Secretary of Defense do not support this bill and why \nthey favor their current program that is in place.\n  This bill would commit us to deploy a national defense system before \ndevelopment is completed, without considering the critical factors that \nshould inform a deployment decision.\n  There are a number of critical factors. What is the impact on arms \nreduction of such a commitment to deploy a system that could violate \nthe Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty? There is nothing in the language of \nthis bill that says it will be treaty compliant. Nothing in this bill \nsays that the national missile defense system that it commits us to \ndeploy will be compliant with the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.\n  That is a treaty, a solemn agreement between us and Russia. If we \nthreaten to break out of that treaty unilaterally, we threaten the \nsecurity of this Nation because that treaty permits Russia to ratify \nthe START II agreement and to negotiate a START III agreement, reducing \nthe number of warheads that they have on their missiles and warheads \nthat could also potentially proliferate around the world and threaten \nany number of places, including us. This is not just a cost debate; it \nis a debate about committing ourselves to deploying a system not yet \ndeveloped, and without knowing the cost of that system.\n  It is not just a debate over whether we ought to commit ourselves to \na system of unknown cost, without consideration of other threats to \nthis country from weapons of mass destruction and\n\n[[Page S4621]]\n\nof the likelihood of those threats actually happening. All those \nfactors should be taken into consideration.\n  This bill would commit us to deploy a system which could undermine, \nweaken, lessen, the security of this Nation. And that is why this bill \ndoes not have the support of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. That is why \nthis bill does not have the support of the Department of Defense. Yes; \nit commits us to deploy a system before we know the cost of the system, \nwithout even knowing what the cost is and without comparing the cost of \nthis system to the cost of deploying other systems which could defend \nagainst or address different threats of delivery of weapons of mass \ndestruction, like ships or trucks.\n  This bill would simply commit us now to deploy. As far as I know, we \nhave never in the history of this Congress ever committed ourselves to \ndeploy a weapon system before it was developed. But this bill does \nthat. It would be a mistake to do so without consideration of those \nfactors--cost, threats, and relative threats. But the biggest mistake \nthat this bill makes is to commit us to deploy a system which could \nweaken and reduce the security of this Nation.\n  All of us want to defend this country. The good Senator from \nMississippi wants to defend this country. He is a good friend of mine, \nand I know he does. I know that is 100 percent his motivation. And I \nhope and believe that he knows that is my motivation as well.\n  The question, though, is whether or not we are helping the security \nof this Nation or reducing the security of this Nation. If we commit \nourselves to deploy a system which, in all likelihood, would violate a \ntreaty between ourselves and Russia it would not help our security; it \nwould reduce our security. By the way, if that is not an intent, it is \nvery easy to amend this bill to say it would be a treaty-compliant \ndeployment. But that language is not in this bill. To threaten to break \na treaty which is key to the security of this Nation is a terrible \nmistake.\n  I just want to repeat what that threat is. Russia has signed the \nSTART I agreement and has significantly reduced the number of warheads. \nIt is very clear that if we break out of this ABM Treaty unilaterally, \nand if they face ABM defenses here, they will not continue with the \nSTART I reductions, ratification of START II, and negotiation of START \nIII.\n  The ABM Treaty has been discussed between our President and the \nRussian President. It has been discussed at the highest levels of \ngovernment at a summit meeting. They have issued statements following \nthose summits. Most recently at the Helsinki Summit, March 21, 1997, \nPresident Clinton and President Yeltsin issued the following joint \nstatement:\n\n       President Clinton and President Yeltsin, expressing their \n     commitment to strengthen strategic stability and \n     international security, emphasizing the importance of further \n     reductions in strategic offensive arms, and recognizing the \n     fundamental significance of the antiballistic missile treaty, \n     for these objectives, as well as the necessity for effective \n     theater missile defense, consider it their common task to \n     preserve the ABM Treaty, prevent circumvention of it, and \n     enhance its viability.\n\n  That is the highest level that we can reach here, at least in our \nGovernment. You can't go higher than having the President of the United \nStates and the President of Russia issuing a joint statement, which \nthey just did in March of 1997, that recognizes the fundamental \nsignificance of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty for the objective of \nfurther reductions in strategic offensive arms. That is about as \nserious a statement as you can get.\n  I think we all want those reductions. I don't know of anybody in this \nbody who does not want to reduce the number of strategic nuclear \nweapons that exist in this world. But for us to threaten to deploy a \nsystem which would, in all likelihood, violate the Anti-Ballistic \nMissile Treaty and would then jeopardize the reduction in nuclear \nweapons, which we all hope for so fervently, could undermine and weaken \nthe security of this Nation. That is why this bill does not have the \nsupport of our uniformed military.\n\n  So this isn't a question of whether you are for the security of the \nUnited States or not. We are all for the security of United States. \nThis is a question of how best to achieve the security of the United \nStates. By committing ourselves to deploy a system which will lead to \nmore weapons remaining on this Earth's surface and thus contributing to \nthe proliferation of those weapons, by the mere fact that we would be \njeopardizing reductions in the number of weapons, is not a way to \ncontribute to the security of this Nation.\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs has written us a letter. I hope \nevery Member of this body will take some time to read this letter--it \nis dated April 21, 1998--in which he compares the bill that we are \ndiscussing now, S. 1873, to the current program, the so-called National \nDefense Deployment Readiness Program. Under the current program, we are \ngoing to develop the capability to have a missile defense against \nintercontinental ballistic missiles. We are going to do it as fast as \nwe can.\n  But what I think is particularly notable about the defense \nauthorization bill--which will hopefully be on the floor later this \nweek--is that I don't think there is a member of our committee, \nwhichever side of this issue that they are on, who voted additional \nmoney for national missile defense. The budget for national missile \ndefense has a significant amount of money in it, some $950 million \ndollars. And if we are not doing anything, as my good friend from \nMississippi said, if we are just sitting around on our hands, or \ntwiddling our thumbs while our security is jeopardized, and if we are \nnot developing a national missile defense system as quickly as we \nshould because we have not made the commitment to deploy, then you \nwould think somebody on the Armed Services Committee, 10 of whom voted \nfor the bill before us, would have voted to add money to develop that \nsystem, or proposed it at least.\n  But while the Armed Services Committee is deeply divided on the \nquestion of this bill--10 people voting yes and 7 people voting no, if \nmy recollection is correct--nobody proposed that we add money to the \nnational missile defense to develop a system which is referred to in \nthis bill, presumably, because I think everybody on the committee \nthought we had adequate funding in our authorization. I do not want to \nbe presuming here. We have to find out whether that is true. Perhaps \nwhen the bill comes to the floor, somebody will move to add additional \nfunds.\n  But I caution people, you can only move at a certain speed without \njeopardizing the program. You don't want to do certain things before \nyou have adequately tested what you have already done. General Larry \nWelch, the retired Air Force Chief of Staff who studied this issue for \nthe Department of Defense, has cautioned us that we should not put more \nmoney, should not force more money, into a program and push for a \nfaster deployment without adequately testing what we are doing and \nproviding sufficient time for such testing.\n  But, nonetheless, we will find out on the floor whether there are \npeople who think we can usefully add more money to the development of a \nnational missile defense, and, if so, I presume there would be an \namendment. But that is not this bill. This bill doesn't add any money \nto a national missile defense system. This bill commits us to deploy \nthe system before it is developed, without consideration of the impact \non nuclear arms reductions and without consideration of the cost of the \nsystem, since we have not developed it. It also commits us without \ncomparing the relative cost of deploying this system against the long-\nrange missile threats there are at the time of the decision against the \ncost of deploying defenses against whatever other threats are coming \nfrom different directions in the area of weapons of mass destruction.\n  So we have these two approaches. One is the current approach to a \nnational missile defense system, supported by the Secretary of Defense \nand the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which puts a significant \namount of money into development and which then declares that when the \nsystem is developed, that we will make a decision whether or not to \ndeploy. That decision will be made after we have adequately developed \nand tested a system.\n  That decision will be based on a number of facts, including the \nthreats, the cost, the cost-effectiveness, the operational \neffectiveness and, very critically, what arms reductions could be\n\n[[Page S4622]]\n\njeopardized by a unilateral deployment of whatever system is developed.\n  Now, the letter from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to me \ncompares the two bills, as I started to say, and it says that ``the \nbill and the program that we currently have are consistent on many \npoints. However, the following differences make it difficult to support \nenactment.''\n  Now, these are the reasons why the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, \nGeneral Shelton, in his letter to me, says it is difficult to support \nenactment.\n  First, he says:\n\n       The bill would establish a policy to deploy as soon as \n     technology allows. The NMD program, on the other hand, \n     requires an emerging ballistic missile threat as well as \n     achievement of a technological capability for an effective \n     defense before deployment of missile defenses.\n\n  Secondly, as to why General Shelton says it is difficult to support \nenactment of this bill, he points out that:\n\n       The bill asserts that the United States has no policy to \n     deploy an NMD system. In fact, the NMD effort is currently a \n     robust research and development program that provides the \n     flexibility to deploy an initial capability within 3 years of \n     a deployment decision. This prudent hedge ensures that the \n     United States will be capable of meeting the need for missile \n     defenses with the latest technology when a threat emerges.\n\n  Third, General Shelton says:\n\n       I disagree with the bill's contention that the United \n     States ability to anticipate future ballistic missile threats \n     is questionable. It is possible, of course, that there could \n     be surprises, particularly were a rogue state to receive \n     outside assistance. However, given the substantial \n     intelligence resources being devoted to this issue, I am \n     confident that we will have the 3 years' warning on which our \n     strategy is based.\n\n  The fourth point in his letter he has subsequently modified, I \nunderstand, so I won't quote that point. I believe he sent a subsequent \nletter to Senator Cochran advising that it no longer is relevant or \nthat the point is now moot, I believe, agreeing with Senator Cochran on \nthat point.\n  But the fifth point he makes as to why he says that ``it is difficult \nto support enactment,'' as he phrases it, is that ``the bill does not \nconsider affordability or the impact a deployment would have on arms \ncontrol agreements and nuclear arms reductions. Both points are \naddressed in the NMD Deployment Readiness Program and should be \nincluded in any bill on NMD.''\n  Now, those are his reasons. We have a letter from the Secretary of \nDefense, as well, saying that he does not support this bill, and \ndescribing the current system, which is basically the hedge strategy \nthat the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs described in his letter.\n  General Shalikashvili, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, wrote us in May of 1996 the following:\n\n       In this regard, efforts which suggest changes to or \n     withdrawal from the ABM Treaty may jeopardize Russian \n     ratification of START II and, as articulated in the Soviet \n     statement of 13 June 1991, could prompt Russia to withdraw \n     from START I. I am concerned that failure of either START \n     initiative will result in Russian retention of hundreds or \n     even thousands more nuclear weapons, thereby increasing both \n     the costs and the risks that we face.\n\n  Now, that is the issue which we must decide here. Do we want to \ncommit ourselves to the deployment of a system not yet developed, the \ncosts of which are not known, the risks of which are many including--\nand these are the words of General Shalikashvili--that we could face \nadditional thousands of nuclear weapons ``thereby increasing both the \ncosts and the risks that we face.''\n  Might we want to deploy a system? The answer is yes. Weighing all of \nthe factors which General Shalikashvili and General Shelton tell us \nshould be considered, might we want to deploy a system after it is \ndeveloped? The answer is yes. That is why we are developing it--to put \nourselves in a position where we could deploy--could deploy--a national \nmissile defense system.\n\n  Do we want to commit to deploying it before development is completed, \nwithout consideration of the impact on arms reductions, without \nconsideration of what the threat is at the time that the deployment \ndecision should be made, without the consideration of those factors? We \nshould not.\n  Much more important than my saying that is what General Shelton said \nand what General Shalikashvili said and what the Secretary of Defense \nsaid. Do we all want to increase the security of this Nation? We do. \nWill a commitment to deploy a system which could lead us to face \nadditional thousands of nuclear weapons contribute to the security of \nthis Nation? I doubt it. Could there be a circumstance under which we \nmight want to deploy, despite the ABM Treaty? There could be. Does that \ncircumstance exist now? It does not.\n  Should we seek to negotiate with the Russians a shift from focusing \non offensive weapons to including defenses? We should. Should this be a \nmutual discussion? Should this be a mutual activity? Surely, it should \nbe. Can we unilaterally now commit ourselves to deploy a system which \nin all likelihood would violate a keystone treaty between ourselves and \nthe Russians? Should we commit ourselves to do that now? No. Because by \ndoing so we will weaken us, not strengthen us.\n  Are we doing nothing? No. We are spending billions to develop a \nsystem to permit us to decide to deploy it, should we need to. So this \nis not a matter of should we do something or should we do nothing. We \nare pursuing a hedge strategy with our current NMD program, as General \nShelton described. The hedge is that we are developing a system as fast \nas it makes sense to develop. And again, if we should develop it faster \nand if we can, then I am assuming that we would face an amendment on \nthe defense authorization bill that would seek to add more funds for \nthat purpose. But we are developing a system as fast as is prudent. \nGeneral Welch suggests that we may even be developing it faster than is \nprudent, thereby jeopardizing the effectiveness of the system we \ndevelop.\n  But nonetheless, should we develop it as quickly as prudent? Yes. Are \nwe? Yes. Should we prejudge the deployment decision and make a \ndetermination which, as far as I know, has never been made in the \nhistory of Congress to deploy a system before it is developed? We \nshould not. And General Shelton and General Shalikashvili, our senior \nuniformed military, and our civilian defense leaders, are urging that \nwe stay with the current system, which is that hedge strategy of \ndeveloping so that we could deploy should all those factors point in \nthat direction after the development is completed.\n  Finally, Madam President, I want to read one additional paragraph \nfrom the letter of General Shalikashvili, then Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, to Senator Nunn, a letter dated May 1, 1996. I ask \nunanimous consent that this letter, plus the additional letters that I \nhave referred to, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   Chairman of the\n\n\n                                        Joint Chiefs of Staff,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 1, 1996.\n     Hon. Sam Nunn,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on Armed Services, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nunn: In response to your recent letter on the \n     Defend America Act of 1996, I share Congressional concern \n     with regard to the proliferation of ballistic missiles and \n     the potential threat these missiles may present to the United \n     States and our allies. My staff, along with the CINCs, \n     Services and the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization \n     (BMDO), is actively reviewing proposed systems to ensure we \n     are prepared to field the most technologically capable \n     systems available. We also need to take into account the \n     parallel initiatives ongoing to reduce the ballistic missile \n     threat.\n       In this regard, efforts which suggest changes to or \n     withdrawal from the ABM Treaty may jeopardize Russian \n     ratification of START II and, as articulated in the Soviet \n     Statement to the United States of 13 June 1991, could prompt \n     Russia to withdraw from START I. I am concerned that failure \n     of either START initiative will result in Russian retention \n     of hundreds or even thousands more nuclear weapons thereby \n     increasing both the costs and risk we may face.\n       We can reduce the possibility of facing these increased \n     cost and risks by planning an NMD system consistent with the \n     ABM treaty. The current National Missile Defense Deployment \n     Readiness Program (NDRP), which is consistent with the ABM \n     treaty, will help provide stability in our strategic \n     relationship with Russia as well as reducing future risks \n     from rogue countries.\n       In closing let me reassure you. Senator Nunn, that I will \n     use my office to ensure a timely national missile defense \n     deployment decision is made when warranted. I have discussed \n     the above position with the Joint Chiefs and the appropriate \n     CINCs, and all are in agreement.\n           Sincerly,\n                                            John M. Shalikashvili,\n     Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n                                  ____\n\n\n[[Page S4623]]\n\n                                         The Secretary of Defense,\n\n\n                                             Defense Pentagon,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 21, 1998.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing in response to your request \n     for the views of the Department of Defense on S. 1873, the \n     American Missile Protection Act of 1998.\n       The Department of Defense is committed to ensuring that we \n     properly protect the American people and America's national \n     security interests. This requires that we have a carefully \n     balanced defense program that ensures that we are able to \n     meet threats to our people and vital interest wherever and \n     whenever they arise. A key element of our defense program is \n     our National Missile Defense (NMD) program, which as you know \n     was restructured under Secretary Perry and with the support \n     of Congress as a ``3+3'' deployment readiness program. Under \n     this approach, by 2000 the United States is to be in a \n     position to make a deployment decision if warranted by the \n     threat, and if a decision to deploy were made at that time \n     the initial NMD system would be deployed by 2003. If in 2000 \n     the threat assessment does not warrant a deployment decision, \n     improvements in NMB system component technology will \n     continue, while an ability is maintained to deploy a system \n     within three years of a decision.\n       The Quadrennial Defense Review reaffirmed this approach, \n     although it also determined that the ``3+3'' program was \n     inadequately funded to meet its objectives. Accordingly, I \n     directed that an additional $2.3 billion be programmed for \n     NMD over the Future Years Defense Plan. It must be \n     emphasized, though, that even with this additional funding, \n     NMD remains a high risk program because the compressed \n     schedule necessitates a high degree of concurrency.\n       I share with Congress a commitment to ensuring the American \n     people receive protection from missile threats how and when \n     they need it. S. 1873, however, would alter the ``3+3'' \n     strategy so as to eliminate taking into account the nature of \n     the threat when making a deployment decision. This could lead \n     to the deployment of an inferior system less capable of \n     defending the American people if and when a threat emerges. \n     Because of this, I am compelled to oppose the adoption of the \n     bill.\n       Please be assured, however, that I will continue to work \n     closely with the Senate and House of Representatives to \n     ensure that our NMD program and all of our defense programs \n     are designed and carried out in a manner that provides the \n     best possible defense of our people and interests.\n           Sincerely,\n     William S. Cohen.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   Chairman of the\n\n\n                                        Joint Chiefs of Staff,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 21, 1998.\n     Hon. Carl M. Levin,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Armed Services, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: Thank you for the opportunity to \n     comment on the American Missile Protection Act of 1998 (S. \n     1873). I agree that the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction (WMD) and their delivery systems poses a major \n     threat to our forces, allies, and other friendly nations. US \n     missile systems play a critical role in our strategy to deter \n     these threats, and the current National Missile Defense (NMD) \n     Deployment Readiness Program (3+3) is structured to provide a \n     defense against them when required.\n       The bill and the NMD program are consistent on many points; \n     however, the following differences make it difficult to \n     support enactment. First and most fundamental are the \n     conditions necessary for deployment. The bill would establish \n     a policy to deploy as soon as technology allows. The NMD \n     program, on the other hand, requires an emerging ballistic \n     missile threat as well as the achievement of a technological \n     capability for an effective defense before deployment of \n     missile defenses.\n       Second, the bill asserts that the United States has no \n     policy to deploy an NMD system. In fact, the NMD effort is \n     currently a robust research and development program that \n     provides the flexibility to deploy an initial capability \n     within 3 years of a deployment decision. This prudent hedge \n     ensures that the United States will be capable of meeting the \n     need for missile defenses with the latest technology when a \n     threat emerges.\n       Third, I disagree with the bill's contention that the US \n     ability to anticipate future ballistic missile threats is \n     questionable. It is possible, of course, that there could be \n     surprises, particularly were a rogue state to receive outside \n     assistance. However, given the substantial intelligence \n     resources being devoted to this issue, I am confident that we \n     will have the 3 years' warning on which our strategy is \n     based.\n       Fourth, the bill uses the phrase ``system capable of \n     defending the territory of the United States.'' The NMD \n     program calls for defense of only the 50 states. Expanding \n     performance coverage to include all US territories would have \n     considerable cost, design, and location implications.\n       Finally, the bill does not consider affordability or the \n     impact a deployment would have on arms control agreements and \n     nuclear arms reductions. Both points are addressed in the NMD \n     Deployment Readiness Program and should be included in any \n     bill on NMD.\n       Please be assured that I remain committed to those programs \n     that discourage hostile nations from the proliferation of WMD \n     and the missiles that deliver them. In that regard, I am \n     confident that our current NMD program provides a \n     comprehensive policy to counter future ballistic missile \n     threats with the best technology when deployment is \n     determined necessary.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Henry H. Shelton,\n     Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n                                  ____\n\n         General Counsel of the Department of Defense, Defense \n           Pentagon,\n                                   Washington, DC, April 20, 1998.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This is in response to your request for \n     the views of the Department of Defense on S. 1873, 105th \n     Congress, a bill ``To state the policy of the United States \n     regarding the deployment of a missile defense system capable \n     of defending the territory of the United States against \n     limited ballistic missile attack.''\n       The Department of Defense and the Administration object to \n     the American Missile Protection Act of 1998. In response, the \n     Department of Defense would note that the Administration's \n     National Missile Defense Deployment Readiness Program is \n     correct, prudent, and positions the United States to deploy a \n     defense when a threat emerges.\n       S. 1873 would seek to make it United States policy ``to \n     deploy as soon as technologically possibile an effective \n     National Missile Defense system capable of defending the \n     territory of the United States against limited ballistic \n     missile attack (whether accidental, unauthorized, or \n     deliberate).''\n       The Administration's National Missile Defense program is \n     premised on the view that not only must the technology be \n     developed to allow for an effective defense, but that \n     deployment should be based on an emerging rogue ballistic \n     missile threat to the United States. To do otherwise is to \n     waste scarce Defense resources and to forego deploying the \n     most effective defense when the threat actually emerges.\n       The Intelligence Community has concluded that a long-range \n     ballistic missile threat to the United States from a rogue \n     nation, other than perhaps North Korea, is unlikely to emerge \n     before 2010 but could be accelerated if those nations \n     acquired this capability from beyond their borders. The \n     Intelligence Community concluded that the only rogue nation \n     missile in development that could strike the United States is \n     the North Korean Taepo Dong 2, which could strike portions of \n     Alaska or the far-western Hawaiian Islands. however, as \n     Secretary Cohen stated in his 1998 Annual Report to the \n     President and the Congress, the likelihood of the Taepo Dong \n     2 being operational by 2005 is very low. The Administration \n     is not complacent about this assessment. The National Missile \n     Defense program is designed to account for the uncertainty \n     about when and where threats may emerge by developing a \n     National Missile Defense capability that can be deployed well \n     ahead of this estimate. The Administration agrees that the \n     United States must work to defend all 50 states against \n     potential limited missile threats from rogue nations. The \n     National Missile Defense Deployment Readiness program will \n     position the United States to deploy an initial capability as \n     early as 2003. But, the Administration opposes S. 1873 \n     because it would commit the United States to deploy a \n     National Missile Defense system in the absence of an emerging \n     rouge state ballistic missile threat. The crucial difference \n     is in timing of a deployment decision. Commitment to \n     deployment now, in the absence of a threat, would divert \n     vital defense funds from more pressing military needs and \n     would result in premature commitment to a technological \n     option that may be outdated when the threat emerges.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that, from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program, there is no \n     objection to the presentation of this report for the \n     consideration of the Committee.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Judith A. Miller.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the paragraph to Senator Nunn reads as \nfollows.\n\n       We can reduce the possibility of facing these increased \n     costs and risks.\n\n  And here he is talking about the risk he cited earlier in this letter \nof thousands of more nuclear weapons being retained by Russia should we \nunilaterally develop or deploy defenses in violation of the ABM Treaty. \nGeneral Shalikashvili says:\n\n       We can reduce the possibility of facing these increased \n     costs and risks by planning an NMD system consistent with the \n     ABM Treaty. The current National Missile Deployment Readiness \n     Program, which is consistent with the ABM Treaty, will help \n     provide stability in our strategic relationship with Russia \n     as well as reducing future risks from rogue countries.\n\n  Those are the risks we are all concerned about, risks from rogue \ncountries being particularly of concerns--missile risks, yes, but other \nrisks of delivery of weapons of mass destruction also.\n  I think that is the greatest threat, those weapons of mass \ndestruction and\n\n[[Page S4624]]\n\nthe delivery by various means, everything from suitcases to ships to \ntruck bombs, perhaps to missiles. Those are the greatest risks that \nthis Nation faces as we enter the next century. But we are not reducing \nthose risks; we are probably increasing those risks, if Russia, seeing \nus commit to deploy a system unilaterally which could violate the ABM \nTreaty, then decides, as General Shalikashvili suggests they would, \nthat they can no longer comply with START I, cannot ratify START II, or \nnegotiate further reductions in START III.\n  So, I hope that this bill will not be adopted. It was a vote of 10 to \n7 in the Armed Services Committee which approved reporting this bill to \nthe Senate. I assume it would be a very heavily debated bill, should it \ncome before the Senate. But in the meantime, I oppose this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that we \nmight proceed as in morning business.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Reserving the right to object, Madam President, and I \ndon't want to object, but I had hoped we could conclude this debate \nhere and I would withdraw this motion. I know of no Senators coming \nover to speak, unless the Senator from Oregon is seeking to speak on \nthis motion to proceed to the bill. I heard there were other Senators \nwho were interested. If the Senator will permit me a couple of minutes, \nthen I will withdraw this motion and he can proceed as in morning \nbusiness. But right now, the business is the motion to proceed to \nconsider this missile defense bill. It won't take long, I assure the \nSenator, if he will indulge me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I would like to make one closing point \nthat I think should be made regarding the nature of the threat that \nexists now from other nations that are rapidly increasing both the \nrange and sophistication of their missile systems. I talked about Iraq, \nour experience in the Persian Gulf war, what we have known about the \ncapability which they developed very quickly after the purchase of \nsystems from North Korea. We talked about Iran and the medium-range \nShahab-3 and -4 systems that they are developing. We talked about \nPakistan's testing last month a 1,500-kilometer-range missile, when 6 \nmonths ago the Defense Department's report on proliferation around the \nworld said that Pakistan had only a 300-kilometer-range missile and a \nshorter-range missile in their arsenal. No mention was made of any \nlonger-range missile.\n  But I have neglected to point out what is happening, and what we know \nhas happened, in North Korea, which has led to an assessment that they \nare developing missiles with much greater ranges than that. There is \nunder development the Taepo-Dong 2 missile with a 6,000-kilometer \nintercontinental capacity, which would put within its range portions of \nAlaska and Hawaii.\n  These are facts. These are reports that have been made public. We \nknow that they have already deployed systems that are of shorter range \nthan that, creating a very unstable and stressful situation because of \nthe missile threat in that region of the world. We are kidding \nourselves if we continue to assume that there is no emerging threat. \nThese threats have emerged, they exist now, and they show the capacity \nof nation states to develop, with their own technology, their own \ntechnicians, weapons systems that are going to have longer and longer \nranges and the capacity to deliver weapons of mass destruction.\n  That is the reality. And when a CIA Director says that he cannot \npredict when rest-of-the-world nations will have intercontinental \nballistic missiles because of ``gaps and uncertainties''--when we don't \nhave the capacity to make those findings and projections--it seems to \nme that the facts are clear, and the facts are serious. They should \ncause us great concern and convince the Senate that it ought to take \naction in the passage of this legislation, and change our policy of \n``wait-and-see'' to one of ``deploy as soon as the technology is \nready.'' It is going to be in our interests to deploy a system 1 year \nsooner than it is needed rather than 1 year after it is needed.\n  Madam President, I had notified other Senators that we were going to \nwithdraw the motion to proceed to consider this bill. There will be \nother opportunities to talk about it when it comes up on Wednesday, if \na vote on cloture is ordered then, or Senators may talk about it as in \nmorning business during the remainder of this evening. But if other \nSenators do not wish to talk on the subject, it is my intention to \nwithdraw the motion.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, briefly, I ask unanimous consent that the \nportion of the annual report to the President and Congress from \nSecretary Cohen entitled ``National Missile Defense Program'' be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the excerpt of the report was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\nExcerpt of Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen's Annual Report to the \n             President and the Congress, 1998, Pages 65-66\n\n       The Intelligence Community has concluded that the only \n     rogue nation missile in development which could conceivably \n     have the range to strike the United States is the North \n     Korean Taepo Dong 2, which could strike portions of Alaska or \n     the far-western Hawaiian Islands, but the likelihood of its \n     being operational by 2005 is very low. With this exception, \n     no country, other than the declared nuclear powers, will \n     develop or otherwise acquire a ballistic missile in the next \n     15 years that could threaten the United States, although \n     outside assistance is a wild card that could shorten \n     timelines to deployment.\n       The NMD program is structured to develop and test system \n     elements the United States could deploy if intelligence \n     indicated that a new strategic threat was emerging. The \n     United States is not making a decision to deploy a national \n     missile defense at this time. Deploying before the threat \n     emerges would preclude deploying the most advanced technology \n     if and when the threat does emerge. If a threat does not \n     emerge, the NMD program will continue to improve the \n     performance of the system by advancing the technology of each \n     element and adding new elements as necessary, while \n     maintaining the capability to deploy a system in a short \n     period of time.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I will just read one paragraph from this, \nand then I want to ask my good friend from Mississippi a question. The \nparagraph reads:\n\n       The national Missile Defense Program is structured to \n     develop and test system elements the United States could \n     deploy if intelligence indicated that a new strategic threat \n     was emerging. The United States is not making a decision to \n     deploy a national missile defense at this time. Deploying \n     before the threat emerges would preclude deploying the most \n     advanced technology if and when the threat does emerge. If a \n     threat does not emerge, the NMD program will continue to \n     improve the performance of the system by advancing the \n     technology of each element and adding new elements as \n     necessary, while maintaining the capability to deploy a \n     system in a short period of time.\n\n  There is also a discussion in the previous paragraph, which is now \nincorporated in the Record, as to why, relative to the North Korean \nTaepo Dong 2, and the ``likelihood of its being operational by 2005 \nbeing very low.''\n  Now, my question of my friend is this. He made reference to the fact \nthat the motion is being withdrawn. I want to be sure I understand; I \nassume he means that the motion is being set aside at this time--is \nthat correct?--and that the scheduled vote on Wednesday is what is \ncontemplated.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. That is the intention of this Senator. Thank you.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion \nto proceed be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, we had a thoughtful discussion on the \nfloor of the Senate earlier today with Senator McCain and Senator \nDorgan especially with respect to the high-tech issues that will be \ncoming up over the course of this week.\n  In a sense, it is ironic that we call it high-tech week here. I am \nvery pleased that Senator Lott and Senator Daschle have been able to \nget an agreement to deal with these issues. And, in a sense, we are \ngoing to be dealing with high-tech issues all year round as we face the \n21st century. It is not going to be something that we look at just from \ntime to time, but it will essentially dominate, in my view, debate \nabout public policy in the years ahead. And I am particularly hopeful \nthat this week we will have an opportunity on the Senate floor to \ndebate the Internet Tax Freedom Act which, as our Presiding Officer \nknows, was debated at some length in the Senate Commerce Committee \nearlier this year.\n  My sense is that these tax issues are especially important because it \nis so critical that our country lay out a set of ground rules, a set of \nprinciples that will address the question of taxation and the digital \neconomy.\n  Right now, you can live in the Dakotas, and if you want to send a \ntasty fruit basket from a company in Oregon, you can order it on line, \nsay, from a firm in Virginia, and pay for it with a Florida bank card, \nand you can end up absolutely baffled with respect to how many \njurisdictions may be in a position to impose taxes on this particular \ntransaction.\n  We have already heard in testimony before the committee that the \nuncertainty surrounding these transactions has caused some businesses \nto go under. In particular, we heard from a small business in Tennessee \nabout the problem. The Wall Street Journal recently reports in a Peat \nMarwick survey that many financial executives are uncertain with \nrespect to how transactions will be handled in cyberspace. This has \ncontributed to uncertainty and reluctance to go forward and do business \non line.\n  Recently, one of the prominent analysts, a firm by the name of \nVertex, cited several States where it was really impossible to know how \nto proceed with respect to electronic commercial transactions because, \nin effect, the rules were so fluid that you would have to get an \ninterpretation of tax law that really was not written.\n  So I and others have introduced the Internet Tax Freedom Act. And its \npurpose is simple. That is to give consumers and businesses engaged in \nelectronic commerce a timeout from discriminatory taxes so that our \ncountry can develop a fair and reasonable policy on Internet taxation.\n  And we are very proud of the strong bipartisan support that this \neffort has received. Governor George Bush, for example, from the State \nof Texas, has recently spoken out on this issue. Our colleague, Senator \nPat Leahy of Vermont, Steve Forbes--the list of supporters for this \neffort literally spans the spectrum.\n  I believe that the reason it has been possible to generate such \nstrong bipartisan support for the Internet Tax Freedom Act is that \nduring this period where there will be a bar on discriminatory taxes on \nelectronic commerce, all other forms of taxation that are used in the \nregular course of business would be allowed to go forward. So during \nthe period when our country tries to develop a set of ground rules for \ntaxation of electronic commerce--all of the property taxes, all of the \nsales taxes, all of the use taxes, all of the business license fees \nthat are nondiscriminatory--would stay in place.\n\n  For our colleagues that have been following this issue, it is all \nlaid out very specifically in section 3 of our legislation. For \nexample, under our legislation if Mr. Brown in South Dakota picks up \nthe phone and orders a sweater from J.C. Penney in Illinois he would \npay the same sales tax as if he walked into J.C. Penney in Sioux Falls, \nSD. South Dakota taxes sales of goods over the Internet the same as \nsales of tangible personal property through more traditional channels. \nExactly the same treatment for a transaction, whether it is conducted \nover the Internet or whether it is conducted through more traditional \nmeans.\n  Going further, if you are a chef in Charleston, SC, and you order a \nnew saucepan from Williams-Sonoma in California, under our legislation \nyou would pay the same sales tax as if you walked in to the Williams \nSonoma shop in Charleston. South Carolina taxes sales of goods over the \nInternet the same as sales of tangible personal property through more \ntraditional channels.\n  Now, there has been an effort by some to say that this legislation \nwould in some way harm Main Street. The fact of the matter is that Main \nStreet has overwhelmingly come out for this legislation. I will append \nto my statement a long list of the business groups that support the \nlegislation, but every Member of the U.S. Senate has received a letter \nfrom the Chamber of Commerce in recent days with a ringing endorsement \nof the Internet tax freedom legislation. And the reason for this very \nstrong support, in my view, is that Main Street business has come out \nstrongly for the legislation. I believe the reason that Main Street \nbusinesses are so strongly supporting the Internet Tax Freedom Act is \nthat for them, the opportunity to do business on-line ensures that \ngeography will be irrelevant in the 21st century.\n  A lot of those small businesses on Main Street in rural America--and \nI represent many of them in the State of Oregon--do have difficulty \ncompeting today in the global marketplace. One of the reasons they do \nis because geography is a very big barrier in terms of their ability to \ntap the global economy. With the Internet Tax Freedom Act ensuring that \nthey are treated fairly both during this period when there is an effort \nto come up with new ground rules, and for the 21st century, we give new \nopportunity to those small Main Street businesses across America. I \nbelieve that is why they have endorsed this legislation so strongly.\n  If ever there was an issue that was appropriate for the U.S. Senate \nto deal with, it is this question. This is what article 1 of our \nConstitution is all about. We have 30,000 taxing jurisdictions in \nAmerica. I believe it is fair to say that if a fair number of these \ntaxing jurisdictions go forward and levy taxes on electronic commerce, \nin a discriminatory way this will do enormous damage to what I believe \nwill be the business infrastructure of the 21st century.\n  Senator McCain and Senator Dorgan, as I said, had a very thoughtful \ndiscussion of the potential of Internet commerce in the years ahead. \nBut let us make no mistake about it, if these small businesses all \nacross this country are going to suddenly have to put on accountants \nand various kind of tax specialists to figure out what kind of taxes \nthey owe in various local jurisdictions across this country, this will \ndamage electronic commerce and the ability of the small businesses to \ncompete in a profound way.\n\n  If you have a two-person operation, a two-person business operating \nout of an individual's home, and they are somehow supposed to collect \nscores of different sales and property taxes across this country there \nis going to be enormous confusion just as we see the electronic \nmarketplace take off. I know no Member of the U.S. Senate wants to see \nthat happen.\n  The bottom line is that the Internet Tax Freedom Act applies only to \nthose taxes that are not technologically neutral. Only those taxes that \nsingle out the Internet would be affected, and every business in \nAmerica would still have to pay its share of taxes. So if a State has a \n3-percent sales tax that a customer has to pay the State when walking \ninto a store to purchase a product, under the Internet Tax Freedom Act, \nsection 3 specifically, the State can, in fact, charge a 3-percent \nsales tax on goods ordered over the Internet.\n  I am very hopeful that there will be an opportunity to debate this \nissue on the floor of the U.S. Senate. A number of my colleagues, \nSenator Dorgan specifically, have important issues that they want to \nraise. I and other sponsors of this legislation have sought to address \nmany of them. But I believe this is one of the most important issues \nthat this Senate could be dealing with because it is going to frame the \nground work for the digital economy in\n\n[[Page S4626]]\n\nthe 21st century and it is important that all businesses are treated \nfairly.\n  It is also important that the U.S. Senate realize the damage that can \nbe done if you continue to see a growth in the kind of confusion that \nthe Vertex Company has pointed out with respect to the inability of \nbusinesses to get answers. We will damage Internet commerce if we see \nmore small businesses like the Tennessee businessman who testified \nbefore the Commerce Committee that he went out of business because of \nthe confusion on the part of his State with respect to how electronic \ncommercial transactions ought to be handled.\n  No Member of the U.S. Senate wants to see that happen. We have an \nopportunity to get this issue with respect to the digital economy \nright. We have a chance to take a timeout from discriminatory taxes, \ncome up with a policy for Internet taxation that is fair and makes \nsense. Let's not kill the Internet goose that is showing the capacity \nto lay an extraordinary number of golden eggs.\n  I hope we will have a chance to discuss this issue at great length \nthroughout the course of the week. I especially want to thank my \ncolleagues, Senator McCain, the chairman of the Senate Commerce \nCommittee, who has worked diligently with me on this legislation for \nmore than a year; my colleague, Senator Dorgan, who does have questions \nabout this legislation but has always been very fair in terms of \nraising them. I am very hopeful we will have a chance to debate and \nvote on this legislation during the course of this week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard).

Mr. President, approximately ten days ago, the Senate \nvoted to ratify the accession of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \nRepublic into the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance.\n  I joined 79 of my colleagues in supporting this historic measure.\n  This vote occurred at the end of a week of debate in the Senate on \nthis matter. But it signaled the beginning of an equally important \nprocess--that of redoubling or diplomatic efforts to build greater \ntrust and cooperation with Russia.\n  Many who argued against expanding the alliance did so on the \nassumption that such expansion would sour our relations with Russia and \nreduce the chances for progress in arms control. I believe that the \nconsequences of expanding NATO are still undetermined, and that those \nconsequences will depend largely on how we conduct our relations with \nRussia in the coming years.\n  Russia currently has 6,680 strategic nuclear warheads, thousands of \ntactical warheads, and hundreds of tons of fissile material that could \nbe used to produce additional nuclear warheads.\n  Ensuring that these weapons are properly controlled and further \nreductions in strategic warheads are made is one of the principal \nnational security interests of the United States.\n  This is why it is critical that we take greater steps to reach out to \nRussia and demonstrate our desire to work with them in a cooperative \nfashion.\n  Mr. President, in 1996, I was a member of the Commission on America's \nNational Interests. This commission, which included my colleagues \nSenator McCain, Roberts, and former Senator Nunn, as well as other \nforeign policy experts, was charged with identifying American national \ninterests in the Post-cold-war era.\n  The Commission specifically addressed the question of expanding NATO, \nsaying, ``NATO enlargement is in the U.S. interest, but it will be \nessential to manage the process in ways that take account of Russian \nconcerns.''\n  We have already taken several important steps, including the U.S.-\nRussian Founding Act, the Nunn-Lugar programs, and the Partnership for \nPeace. Indeed, U.S. and Russian forces have served side by side in \nBosnia. But there is much more to be done.\n  We must seek new ways to cooperate and build trust between our two \ngreat nations. What is needed is a sustained creative program of \noutreach to demonstrate that NATO expansion was not a hostile act \ndesigned to build a new Iron Curtain closer to Russia's borders.\n  Nor was it a signal that we have lost interest in helping Russia work \nthrough one of the most significant societal transformations in \nhistory.\n  One suggestion for creative outreach involves the Year 2000 Problem, \nwhich is sometimes referred to as Y2K.\n  We have undertaken a massive effort to deal with this issue of the \nreliability of our information systems after the year 2000. The Defense \nDepartment has alone identified 2800 critical systems that must be \n``cured'' before Y2K.\n  The Russians have not yet determined if they have a similar problem, \nnot to mention they have not commenced the process of attempting to fix \nit.\n  It is in our interests to work with Russia to help them identify the \nscope of their Y2K problem and to remedy it.\n  It would be detrimental in the extreme to our interests if the \nRussians awoke on the morning of January 1, 2000, with blank screens on \ntheir early warning radars and command and control systems. What could \nbe even worse is if their critical systems continue to operate with \nfalse and corrupted information. It is in both U.S. and Russian \ninterests for us to have the highest level of confidence in our command \nand control systems and to build confidence through transparency and \nother cooperative measures.\n  Another area that presents opportunity for sustained outreach to \nRussia is interparliamentary cooperation. Each member of Congress, \nregardless of their feelings on NATO enlargement, should make an effort \nto reach out to our counterparts in Russia to foster greater trust and \ncooperation.\n  During the Cold War, intermittent attention was paid to \ninterparliamentary relations. Unfortunately, since 1989, Russians \nbelieve that U.S. interest in such contacts has dwindled.\n  Some efforts at interparliamentary cooperation are underway. I will \nmention two of them. The Aspen Institute has held yearly meetings since \n1994 that bring together U.S. and Russian parliamentarians. Speaker \nGingrich has established an initiative, under the direction of \nCongressman Curt Weldon, to reach out to the Russian Duma. But more \nshould be done. Because of its responsibility to provide advice and \nconsent on treaties, the Senate has a special responsibility to play a \nrole in this effort.\n  We can be instrumental in creating an environment in which the \nRussian Duma will seek to cooperate with the United States. In fact, \nthe commission on America's National Interests spoke of ``direct \ncontact--engaging Russia in ways that demonstrate the benefits on \nnonaggressive behavior,'' as one of the principal ways that we can \npromote a benign Russian foreign policy. These types of contacts will \nalso serve to strengthen Russian democracy. All of these are very much \nin the United States national interest.\n  While I supported NATO expansion, I was concerned that the Senate \nentered into the debate after the United States had already committed \nto expanding the alliance.\n  The vote for NATO expansion in the Senate was bipartisan, but in my \njudgment that support was not very deep. Many senators, including \nmyself, felt we were too deeply committed to reject expansion, \ncalculating that the cost of non-action at this point would be greater \nthan the risk of action.\n\n[[Page S4627]]\n\n  Preventing a repetition of this if and when there is to be additional \nexpansion of the alliance is critical. A serious dialogue must involve \nCongress, the White House, and the American people, and must take place \nbefore commitments are made.\n  An example of this was the structured consultations that took place \nbetween a Congress which was shifting in terms of its partisan \nleadership and a Democratic President immediately following the end of \nthe Second World War.\n  In fact, Senator Tom Connelly and Arthur Vandenburg, the Chairman and \nRanking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, were \npersonally involved in negotiating many of the post-war treaties, \nspending much of 1946, for instance, not in the Senate Chambers but \noverseas involved in the detailed negotiations of what was to become \nthe framework of our cold war strategy.\n\n  President Truman used these close consultations to build a bipartisan \nconsensus that led, among other things, to the establishment of the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1949, and the strong vote of \nsupport which that treaty received from the U.S. Senate.\n  Divided government raises the level of partisanship on domestic \nissues. As a nation, we cannot accept similar destabilization of our \ninternational values, goals, and responsibilities.\n  It will be on our ability to meet those challenges that the ultimate \ntest of the wisdom of our vote to expand the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization will be predicated.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/11/senate-section/article/S4626-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n 140TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ADMISSION OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA INTO THE \n                        UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and to help \ncelebrate the 140th anniversary of Minnesota's admission into the \nUnited States of America. Let me begin, Mr. President, by quoting James \nHill, founder of the Great Northern Railroad and one of Minnesota's \ntrue pioneers. It is said that Mr. Hill proclaimed his reasons for \nliving and working in Minnesota by saying, ``You can't interest me in \nany proposition in any place where it doesn't snow.''\n  Well, Minnesota has never had a shortage of snow, which--depending on \nwho you ask and just how many months the winter has lingered--is \nconsidered either a blessing or a curse. But even Mr. Hill recognized \nthat snow is just one of Minnesota's many riches. Ever since word began \nto spread last century about a northern land of promise and prosperity, \na land with abundant natural resources and indescribable beauty, people \nhave traveled to Minnesota to live, work, and prosper. And during its \n140 years of statehood, Minnesota has produced some of the country's \nbest and brightest, making it a world leader in agriculture, \ntechnology, medicine, and business.\n  Along the way, Minnesotans have endured cold winters, hot summers, \nfloods, tornadoes, and any other natural disaster Mother Nature has \nthrown their way.\n  At no time has the resolve of our people been more tested than with \nthe natural disasters that have plagued our state during the last year. \nLast spring, the people of northwestern Minnesota were hit with the \nworst flooding in our state's history. Earlier this spring, the \nresidents of south-central Minnesota lived through one of the largest \ntornadoes ever to hit our state. Yet, in both cases, Minnesotans worked \ntogether to rebuild and recover, and Minnesota is stronger for their \nefforts. Strangers have labeled that willingness to step forward and \nhelp one another as ``Minnesota Nice.'' We think that is just the way \nthings ought to be.\n  Throughout our history, Minnesotans have understood the importance of \nfamily, hard work, and personal responsibility. It is not just talk--\nthey live it. Growing up on a Minnesota dairy farm in a small farming \ncommunity, I saw those strengths firsthand. I saw how these qualities \nhelp make Minnesota one of the world's premiere food producers.\n  Farming and farm-related businesses play a critical role in our \nstate; one of every four Minnesota jobs is tied in some way to \nagriculture, and 25% of our economy is dependent upon farmers and agri-\nbusiness. In 1996, Minnesota was ranked 15th in the country in \nagriculture exports to Asia.\n  Minnesota's world leadership is not limited only to agriculture. Our \nstate is home to some of the world's leading job providers--including \n3M, Pillsbury, Honeywell, Cargill, and a list far too long to mention \nhere. Minnesota is also known for its achievements in the area of \nhealth care. It is a leader in the medical device industry and home to \none of the world's premiere health care facilities, the Mayo Clinic in \nRochester.\n  The commitment of Minnesotans to hard work and to producing some of \nthe best products in the world has made Minnesota an active participant \nnot only in the nation's economy, but in the world economy as well.\n  Minnesotans have long understood the importance of America's role \nwithin the international community. Our residents have had the insight \nto understand that we do not live in a vacuum . . . that our economic \nprosperity depends on our ability to trade freely with the rest of the \nworld. This point was highlighted during a meeting I had last month \nwith farmers in Crookston, Minnesota. Although they asked questions \nabout issues here at home, many of their questions were about IMF, free \ntrade, and the Asian financial crisis. Our farmers and other business \npeople know that what happens in Asia or Europe today can affect \nbusiness in America and Minnesota tomorrow.\n  One Minnesotan who has helped to shape our leadership role on \ninternational issues is former Governor Harold Stassen. Governor \nStassen helped to write the charter for the United Nations and at age \n91 continues to be an outspoken proponent of free and open relations \nwith the rest of the world.\n  This coming weekend, Minnesota's international tradition will \ncontinue when Secretary General of the United Nations Kofi Annan comes \nto Minnesota to tour the Center for Victims of Torture. Many may be \nsurprised to hear that the Secretary General attended college in \nMinnesota, at Macalester College in Saint Paul.\n  For the last few minutes, I have been speaking here on the floor, \nwith great pride, about my home state. To some, I am sure it sounds a \nbit like bragging. But on this day, 140 years after Minnesota became \nthe 32nd State admitted to the Union, I want to express the honor I \nfeel in representing the people of Minnesota in the U.S. Senate--for \nMinnesota is one of the premier states in the greatest country on \nEarth.\n  I want to end today with the sentence used by Minnesota author and \nradio personality Garrison Keillor to describe the fictitious town of \nLake Woebegone, Minnesota . . . . because I think it can be applied to \nall of Minnesota. I am proud to hail from a state ``where all the women \nare strong, the men are good looking, and the children are above \naverage.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/11/senate-section/article/S4627-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

It is an essential part of our overall \neffort to strengthen public schools throughout the Nation.\n  As schools across the Nation struggle to accommodate a surge in \nenrollments, educators and parents have become increasingly concerned \nabout the impact of class size on teaching and learning, particularly \nin the critically important early grades, where students learn reading \nand other basic skills. This concern is justified: rigorous research \nconfirms what parents and teachers have long believed--that students in \nsmaller classes, especially in the early grades, make greater \neducational gains and maintain those gains over time. These gains occur \nbecause teachers in small classes can provide students with more \nindividualized attention, spend more time on instruction and less time \non discipline, and cover more material effectively. Moreover, the \nbenefits of smaller classes are greatest for poor, minority, and inner-\ncity children, the children who often face the greatest challenges in \nmeeting high educational standards.\n  Smaller classes will have the greatest impact on student learning if \nthe new teachers brought into the classroom are well qualified to teach \nreading and to take advantage of smaller learning environments. For \nthis reason, my proposal emphasizes not just class-size reduction but \nalso professional development for educators, and it will give school \ndistricts adequate time to recruit and train staff while phasing in \nsmaller classes. Furthermore, all new teachers hired under the program \nwould be required to pass a State teacher competency test and would \nalso have to be certified to teach or be making satisfactory progress \ntoward full certification.\n  We can help all of our students learn to read independently and well \nby the third grade, get a solid foundation in basic skills, and reach \nhigh educational standards if we start them off with small classes and \nwell-prepared teachers in the early grades.\n  Under my proposal, the Department of Education would provide $20.8 \nbillion in mandatory appropriations over a 10-year period (beginning \nwith $1.1 billion in fiscal year 1999) to States. The States would then \ndistribute the funds to local school districts based on their relative \nclass sizes in grades 1 through 3, as well as on their ability and \neffort to finance class-size reductions with their own resources. The \nbill would provide States with considerable flexibility in distributing \nthese funds, while ensuring that the most needy school districts \nreceive a fair share.\n  Moreover, because my proposal would actually appropriate the funds \nneeded to carry out the program, States and local communities could \ncount on these funds without the need for separate congressional \nappropriations each year. This proposal is fully paid for within my \nFiscal Year 1999 Budget, and therefore would not reduce the budget \nsurplus.\n  School districts would use these funds to reduce class sizes in \ngrades 1 through 3. Just as importantly, these funds would also be \navailable for a variety of activities to ensure that students in the \nearly grades receive sound and effective instruction, such as making \nsure that teachers know how to teach reading and other subjects \neffectively in small classes.\n  This proposal includes strong accountability for results. \nParticipating school districts would produce ``report cards'' \ndocumenting reductions in class sizes and the achievement of their \nstudents in reading, based on rigorous assessments. Schools whose \nstudents fail to make gains in reading would be required to undertake \ncorrective actions. In addition, the Department of Education would \nundertake a comprehensive national evaluation of this program and its \nimpact on reading achievement and teaching.\n  I urge the Congress to take prompt and favorable action on this \nproposal. Its enactment would help school districts reduce class sizes \nin the early grades and improve instruction and achievement in reading, \nissues that are of major importance to parents and to the Nation.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprohibit transfers or discharges of residents of nursing facilities; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  NURSING HOME PATIENT PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, along with Senators Chafee, Johnson, \nGrassley, and Harkin, I will be introducing today the Nursing Home \nPatient Protection Act. This is legislation to protect our Nation's \nseniors from indiscriminate patient dumping from nursing homes.\n  Approximately one month ago, it looked like 93-year-old Adela \nMongiovi might have to spend her 61st Mother's Day away from the \nassisted living facility that she had called home for the last four \nyears.\n  At least that's what her son Nelson and daughter-in-law Gina feared \nwhen officials at the Rehabilitation and Health Care Center of Tampa \ntold them that their Alzheimer's disease-afflicted mother would have to \nbe relocated so that the nursing home could complete ``renovations.''\n  As the Mongiovis told me when I met with them and visited their \nmother in Tampa last month, the real story far exceeded their worst \nfears. The supposedly temporary relocation was actually a permanent \neviction--a permanent eviction of all 52 residents whose housing and \ncare were paid for by the Medicaid program.\n  The nursing home chain that owns the Tampa facility, and several \nothers across the United States, wanted to purge its nursing homes of \nMedicaid residents, ostensibly to take more private insurance payers \nand Medicare beneficiaries, which pay more per resident.\n  While this may have been a good financial decision in the short run, \nits effects on our Nation's senior citizens, if practiced on a \nwidespread basis, would be nothing short of disastrous.\n  In an April 7, 1998, Wall Street Journal article, several nursing \nhome executives argued that State governments and Congress are to blame \nfor these evictions because they have set Medicaid reimbursement rates \ntoo low.\n  While Medicaid reimbursements to nursing homes may need to be \nrevisited, playing Russian roulette with elderly patients' lives is \nhardly the way to send that message to Congress or to state \nlegislatures. While I am willing to engage in a discussion as to the \nequity of nursing home reimbursement rates, I and my colleagues are not \nwilling to allow nursing homes to dump patients indiscriminately.\n  The fact that some nursing home companies are willing to sacrifice \nelderly Americans for the sake of their own economic bottom line is bad \nenough. What is even worse is their attempt to evade blame for Medicaid \nevictions.\n  The starkest evidence of this shirking of responsibility is found in \nthe shell game many companies play to justify evictions. Current law \nallows nursing homes to discharge patients for--among other reasons--\ninability to pay.\n  If a facility decreases its number of Medicaid beds, the State and \nFederal governments are no longer authorized to pay the affected \nresidents' nursing home bills. The nursing home can then conveniently, \nand unceremoniously, dump its former Medicaid patients for--you guessed \nit--their inability to pay.\n  Evictions of nursing home residents have a devastating effect on the \nhealth and well-being of some of society's most vulnerable members.\n  A recent University of Southern California study indicated that those \nwho are uprooted from their homes undergo a phenomenon known as \n``transfer trauma.'' For these seniors, the consequences of transfer \ntrauma are stark. The death rate among seniors is 2 to 3 times higher \nthan for individuals who receive continuous care.\n  Those of us who believe that our mothers, fathers, and grandparents \nare safe because Medicaid affects only low-income Americans, we need to \nthink again.\n  A three-year stay in a nursing home can cost upwards of $125,000. As \na result of this extreme cost, nearly half of all nursing home \nresidents who enter as private-paying patients exhaust their personal \nsavings, lose their health insurance coverage during their stay, and \nbecome Medicaid beneficiaries. Medicaid is, for most retirees, the last \nrefuge of financial support.\n  On April 10, the Florida Medicaid Bureau responded to evidence of \nMedicaid\n\n[[Page S4631]]\n\ndumping in Tampa by levying a steep $260,000 fine against the Tampa \nnursing home. That was strong and appropriate action, but it was only a \npartial solution. Medicaid funding is a shared responsibility--shared \nbetween the States and the Federal Government.\n  While the most egregious incident occurred in Florida, Medicaid \ndumping is not the problem of a single State. While nursing homes were \nonce locally run and family-owned, they are increasingly administered \nby multi-State, multi-facility corporations that have the power to \naffect seniors across the United States.\n  Mr. President, let me also point out that the large majority of \nnursing homes in America treat their residents well, and they are \nresponsible community citizens. Our bill is designed solely to prevent \npotential future abuses by the bad actors.\n  This bill is simple and fair. It would prohibit current Medicaid \nbeneficiaries, or those who ``spend down'' to Medicaid from being \nevicted from their homes. That is a crucial point, Mr. President.\n  Adela Mongiovi is not just a ``beneficiary''; she is a mother and she \nis a grandmother. And to Adela Mongiovi, the Rehabilitation and Health \nCare Center of Tampa is not an ``assisted living facility.'' To Adela \nMongiovi, it is home.\n  This is the place where she wants, and deserves--like all seniors--to \nlive the rest of her life with the security of knowing that she will \nnot be evicted. Through the passage of this bill, we can provide that \nsecurity to Adela Mongiovi and to all of our Nation's seniors.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article to which I \nreferred from the April 7, 1998, Wall Street Journal be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 7, 1998]\n\n                For Medicaid Patients, Doors Slam Closed\n\n                   (By Michael Moss and Chris Adams)\n\n       Indianapolis--On Monday, Jan. 26, right after lunch, Betty \n     Nelson and dozens of other residents of Wildwood Health Care \n     Center were brought into the activity room and told they were \n     being evicted.\n       Rumors about an impending change had circulated at the \n     nursing home for weeks, but the news delivered on this wintry \n     day stunned the elderly patients as they stood at their \n     walkers or sat in their wheelchairs. The facility was ending \n     its relationship with Medicaid, the state-run health subsidy \n     for the poor. Nearly 60 of its 150 residents would have to \n     find new places to live.\n       Most had worked all of their lives, and many had started \n     out paying their own way at Wildwood, which charged them \n     $3,000 or more a month. But eventually they had run through \n     their savings and had turned to Medicaid to help pay their \n     bills.\n       There among the crowd were 88-year-old Della Arthur, a \n     glove maker who later served nearly two decades as a Red \n     Cross volunteer; 73-year-old Art Biech, a former postal \n     carrier who handed out Wildwood's mail; and Gregory Dale, a \n     retired pipe fitter with Ford Motor Co. who would turn 90 in \n     two weeks. Some of the residents wept. Others, suffering from \n     dementia, couldn't comprehend what was being said. Mrs. \n     Nelson, who is 72, understood; as the news sank in, she cried \n     out from her wheelchair, ``You're kicking us out because we \n     don't have enough money.''\n       Wildwood is among the many nursing homes nationwide that \n     Vencor Inc. is emptying of Medicaid recipients. A publicly \n     traded company based in Louisville, Ky., Vencor ran hospitals \n     before buying a 310-facility nursing-home chain three years \n     ago, to become the nation's fourth largest nursing-home \n     chain. It says it now wants to attract wealthier patients who \n     can afford the higher levels of medical care it plans to \n     provide.\n       Vencor also says it fears that a growing number of \n     successful lawsuits against nursing-home owners will hold the \n     company to ever-higher standards of care that it can't \n     sustain under Medicaid rates. In Florida, where the state \n     attorney general has retained outside counsel to build a \n     sweeping Medicaid fraud and abuse case against the entire \n     industry, Vencor says it might withdraw all 21 of its homes \n     from Medicaid as a defensive move.\n       Overall, the company, which hasn't previously detailed its \n     plans publicly, says it has withdrawn or begun withdrawing 13 \n     homes in nine states from Medicaid. It says another 25 homes \n     are candidates to be withdrawn because they are in cities \n     where Vencor wants to link long-term hospitals it already \n     owns with specialized nursing homes aimed at higher-paying \n     patients. Vencor may eventually open 90 non-Medicaid, \n     specialized nursing homes, many of them built from scratch, \n     the rest transformed from existing Medicaid facilities.\n       In addition, the company says it is doing all it can to \n     maximize the number of non-Medicaid patients coming through \n     its doors--something it regularly trumpets to Wall Street. In \n     nearly all circumstances, a Vencor nursing home with an empty \n     bed will turn a Medicaid resident away in the hopes that a \n     private patient will soon come along and take the space.\n       ``We'll go out of Medicaid in all 300 buildings if we don't \n     start to see a little change in the Medicaid program,'' says \n     Michael Barr, Vencor's chief operating officer. He says \n     Vencor is losing money on its Medicaid patients--a standard \n     complaint by nursing-home owners. States say they cover all \n     ``reasonable'' costs and contend that homes can make a profit \n     from Medicaid.\n       Relinquishing the reliable income of Medicaid--which at \n     least ensures that few beds remain empty--is a gamble. But \n     with big public companies racing into the nursing-home \n     industry and pursuing more aggressive pricing strategies, \n     many other companies also are targeting the higher end of the \n     market. And industry analysts predict that some may follow \n     Vencor's lead in jettisoning Medicaid recipients.\n       Only a few states, including California and Tennessee, \n     currently bar mass evictions. These states instead require \n     companies seeking to withdraw from Medicaid to wait until \n     patients die or choose to leave. Nearly all other states \n     leave the matter entirely up to the nursing-home owner's \n     discretion.\n       Economics aside, evicting old people can create hard \n     feelings in the community, as Vencor learned at Wildwood. \n     There, little assistance or planning preceded the eviction \n     notice to the residents. Many families were informed only \n     after the residents were told. Management also kept the news \n     secret from most staff members, many of whom were distraught \n     as weeping residents wheeled or walked from the room after \n     the brief eviction meeting. ``It just broke my heart,'' says \n     Valerie Lynch, a former activities assistant who says she was \n     prompted by the evictions to find a new job.\n       Panic spread in the next few days as waiting lists sprang \n     up at other homes in the Indianapolis area. Even those who \n     found comparable surroundings say they suffered \n     disorientation and the pain of losing their closest friends. \n     Many blamed themselves, including the pipe fitter, Mr. Dale, \n     whose family waited until two days after his 90th birthday on \n     Feb. 11 to move him out. ``Dad felt he had done something \n     wrong,'' says his daughter, Jackie Vukovits. ``The day we \n     took him, he kept saying, `Why do I have to leave here. They \n     were good to me.' ''\n       Mr. Dale had just made the Wildwood newsletter, his name \n     ringed in stars. the write-up ended: ``Greg, we are very \n     happy you chose to live at Wildwood. Congratulations on being \n     chosen Resident of the Month.\n       Vencor officials stand by their decision to evict \n     Wildwood's Medicaid residents but say they have come to \n     realize that mistakes were made. ``We really are doing this \n     for what I consider to be the right reasons. Our goal is to \n     turn this into the best medical nursing facility in that \n     market,'' says Mr. Barr. ``In hindsight, we probably could \n     have done a better job of notifying residents and families.'' \n     Mr. Barr says he decided last week to send company vice \n     presidents to oversee all forthcoming evictions.\n       After meeting yesterday with Mr. Barr, local advocates for \n     the elderly and some former residents said they would seek to \n     ``increase the pressure'' on Vencor, possibly through \n     picketing and by seeking legislation to prohibit evictions. \n     ``If Vencor is allowed to get away with this, it opens the \n     floodgates not only for Vencor but other nursing-home chains \n     in this country,'' says Michelle Niemier, deputy director of \n     United Senior Action, a statewide senior advocacy \n     organization.\n       The changes were particularly wrenching, residents and \n     staff say, because Wildwood--founded by a local concern in \n     1988--had a reputation as one of the city's best homes and \n     had remained nearly full in a state with below-average \n     nursing-home occupancies. The residents were a close-knit \n     group, having decided this was where they would live the rest \n     of their lives. One year, residents sold crafts to pay for a \n     gazebo.\n       Last summer, two years after it purchased the facility, \n     Vencor hired Edward Hastings to run it. A 16-year veteran of \n     nursing-home administration, Mr. Hastings had been a regional \n     administrator for a nursing-home chain and then worked as a \n     consultant for the state of Indiana, monitoring nursing homes \n     that failed their health-care inspections.\n       In November, only weeks before the eviction announcement, \n     Wildwood residents were cheered by a makeover of the \n     facility: fresh paint, new floor tiles, sleek name plates for \n     residents' doors. Then gossip spread that this fresh look was \n     not meant to benefit everyone. It was left to Mr. Hastings to \n     break the news.\n       While a handful of nursing homes in some states have always \n     made do without Medicaid residents, the vast majority of \n     nursing homes nationwide have come to rely on the government \n     program for a good chunk of their revenue. Medicaid \n     recipients play a big role in keeping a facility's census up. \n     Even if the reimbursement is much lower than the private \n     rate, it is usually perceived by owners as superior to empty \n     beds.\n       ``It's highly unusual to pull out of Medicaid,'' says Lori \n     Owen Smetanka, an attorney for the National Citizens' \n     Coalition for Nursing Home Reform, an advocacy group in \n     Washington, D.C. Even in Kentucky, Vencor's home state, state \n     Cabinet for Health Services spokeswomen Barbara Hadley Smith \n     says nursing homes ``are fighting\n\n[[Page S4632]]\n\n     to get into Medicaid.'' Vencor has one Kentucky home, \n     Hermitage Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Owensboro, \n     that is now in the process of moving its Medicaid residents \n     out.\n       A review of U.S. Health Care Financing Administration \n     records shows that 127 homes officially pulled out of the \n     Medicaid program in the past two years--nearly all because \n     they closed their doors entirely, merged with other homes or \n     were threatened with termination because of low quality. Only \n     one home indicated to federal officials that it pulled out of \n     Medicaid because of ``dissatisfaction with reimbursement.''\n       But it is likely to happen more. In addition to Vencor, \n     other nursing home operators, both large and small, are \n     weighing whether to opt out of their state's Medicaid \n     programs. Dick Richardson, chief executive officer of \n     Renaissance Healthcare Corp., says his nursing home in \n     Holyoke, Mass., dropped out of Medicaid last year due to low \n     reimbursement.\n       Mr. Richardson says the relatively small home would lose \n     money if it filled all 61 beds with Medicaid residents. So he \n     evicted his Medicaid residents, dropping the census to five \n     non-Medicaid people. He now has 20 private-pay and Medicare \n     patients and says the home will break even at about 32 \n     private patients. ``I know there are going to be other homes \n     up here that do the same,'' he says. ``It's unfortunate for \n     Medicaid patients, but for business it might be good.''\n       Vencor, too, contends that it loses money on Medicaid, \n     which, at Wildwood, pays it $82 a day for providing the same \n     intermediate level of care for which private patients are \n     charged $125. But Vencor's average daily take from Medicaid \n     has increased 16% at Wildwood since 1995. And two months ago, \n     the state, sued by Indiana's nursing-home trade group, said \n     it would build a new rate system allowing for more generous \n     payments for sicker patients.\n       Even with the current Medicaid plan, Wildwood as a whole \n     had an operating profit of $797,410 on revenue of $7.5 \n     million in its most recent fiscal year, its filing to the \n     state shows. That 10.7% margin is higher than the average for \n     nursing homes in Indiana and nationwide. According to H-CIA \n     Inc., a Baltimore health-information concern, the national \n     average margin for nursing homes was less than 5% in 1995, \n     the most recent year for which figures are available.\n       From its base as an operator of specialty long-term \n     hospitals, Vencor rapidly expanded from 1985 to 1995. Its \n     stock, after an initial public offering in 1989, shot up \n     severalfold in a little more than two years. But regulatory \n     changes and competitive pressures have hurt. Three years ago, \n     Vencor's stock stood at $37; yesterday, it closed at $29.50 a \n     share, up 18.75 cents in composite trading on the New York \n     Stock Exchange.\n       Now it is hoping that higher fees from private patients \n     will help it make a comeback. Wildwood now charges $168 a day \n     for top-level care. And Vencor has ambitions of higher prices \n     still at Wildwood and its other homes.\n       New federal rules will help: Changes expected May 1 will \n     allow Medicare rates to go as high as $600 a day for the most \n     intensive level of care, industry analysts say.\n       What complicates the process of phasing out Medicaid \n     patients is the fact that many start out as paying residents \n     and only later switch to Medicaid. Thus, a nursing-home \n     company that bars Medicaid patients at the door could end up \n     dealing with Medicaid eventually.\n       At Wildwood, Mr. Dale's story offers an example. After \n     breaking his neck in a fall in 1992, he paid a caretaker $7 \n     an hour to watch over him at home. When he entered \n     Wildwood in 1994, Mr. Dale paid his bills with savings, \n     Social Security and a pension. His daughter, Mrs. \n     Vukovits, says the facility led them to believe that it \n     would gladly allow him to shift over to Medicaid when \n     necessary, and he did so, eventually to supplement his \n     dwindling funds. Even so, she says, he continued to cover \n     a large portion of his $80-a-day bill at Wildwood by \n     turning over his Social Security and pension income.\n       Vencor says it never really considered letting people like \n     Mr. Dale stay on. ``My philosophy is that if you have to do \n     something you're better off to face up to it and do it,'' \n     Vencor's Mr. Barr says. ``This is like having to go through \n     an amputation. If you have to cut your hand off, do you cut \n     it off a finger at a time or just cut your hand off and go \n     on?''\n       Families of Wildwood residents say they worried most about \n     the difficulties involved in relocation. Three months \n     earlier, Mr. Dale had been moved from Room 400 to Room 303 to \n     accommodate the renovations. ``It doesn't seem like a big \n     move, but it really is,'' says Mrs. Vukovits. ``He went \n     downhill. He fell going to the bathroom. It was a longer \n     distance to the dining room, so he had to start using a \n     wheelchair. He stopped going to activities.''\n       ``He was just getting over that,'' she says, when the \n     evictions were announced.\n       Mr. Hastings says the evictions were scheduled to occur \n     hallway by hallway over five months. ``We didn't want to \n     shock everybody,'' he says. But when news about waiting lists \n     got around, he says. ``People panicked a little bit and \n     left.''\n       Joining in the exodus were some residents who still paid \n     the higher private rates but who realized that they, too, \n     might eventually need Medicaid, and Wildwood's occupancy \n     plunged from 150 to 78. Mr. Hastings says it has rebounded \n     into the 90s.\n       Most who left found homes through their own searching. Many \n     sought help from Kay Mercer, a 62-year-old stroke victim who \n     had been resident council president. ``They followed me \n     here,'' she says at her new home, the Oaks Rehabilitation and \n     Health Care Center, where several Wildwood residents \n     including Mrs. Nelson and Mr. Biech moved. Mr. Dale moved to \n     another home, where he has adjusted to the new view from his \n     window. ``I don't think I bother anybody. I hope,'' he say \n     one warm spring day, eating lunch.\n       Others didn't fare so well. Two days after Wildwood \n     resident Jane Van Duyn moved into another nursing home, the \n     57-year-old woman with severe multiple sclerosis slipped into \n     a coma. She died within the week. Her husband, Ed Van Duyn, \n     says he can't blame her death on the move, since she was \n     already quite weak, but he notes that the disease leaves its \n     victims vulnerable to stress and even slight temperature \n     changes. ``Every trauma they get sets them back.'' . . .\n       Asked about the death, Mr. Barr said, ``We're dealing with \n     old people who are fragile, who already have been moved out \n     of their own home, and are in a different home, and there \n     certainly is absolutely no easy way to deal with displacing \n     them again.''\n       Residents and families say that a final insult was that \n     they had to pay expenses connected with the eviction, \n     including the $45 telephone reconnection charges. Mr. Van \n     Duyn says Vencor refused even to pay the $200 ambulance fee \n     for moving his wife. Mr. Barr says Vencor would reconsider \n     this decision.\n       Residents and their families say they were too overwhelmed \n     at first to fight back. But Lou Ann Newman, Mrs. Nelson's \n     daughter, wrote to Vencor and state agencies on Feb. 6 asking \n     for an investigation. ``This matter was handled in a most \n     cold, calloused and unprofessional way,'' she wrote. She says \n     she didn't get a response.\n       Mr. Hastings, the administrator, who was familiar with Mrs. \n     Newman's letter, says, ``If I was in her position, I'm sure \n     some people thought it was cold and callous because we were \n     throwing them out.''\n       Vencor's Mr. Barr says a regional official overseeing \n     Wildwood was reprimanded for not responding to the letter. \n     Last week, that official resigned. Mr. Barr adds: ``I don't \n     want to be defensive of a comedy of errors here because it \n     appears that there were some bad judgments made here. And I'm \n     in a situation right now where I'd like to go up and choke \n     the administrator [Mr. Hastings] and pound his head on the \n     floor a couple of times and tell him not to do it again. I \n     don't want him to use the kind of bad manners that it looks \n     like we used here by not thinking through the whole process \n     with these patients.''\n       On a recent tour of Wildwood, the upbeat Mr. Hastings \n     pointed to the renovations and said, ``What you're seeing is \n     only going to get better.'' Among his ideas, which the \n     company says are preliminary: a day-care center for the \n     elderly, a hospice for patients expected to die within six \n     months and the novel idea of overnight stays for patients who \n     usually live elsewhere. ``With the midnight care, you could \n     drop off your father at dinner and pick him up in the \n     morning,'' Mr. Hastings said. ``We're looking for a niche we \n     could fill.''\n       In Room 006, Ms. Arthur was waiting to move. Weeks ago, she \n     packed her belongings into six boxes and stacked them in the \n     bathroom. But she has no immediate family, and she says her \n     guardian had been out of town. The adjoining rooms--formerly \n     occupied by her friends, Mrs. Mercer, Mrs. Nelson, Mr. Dale, \n     Mr. Biech--were vacant.\n       Holding her big white purse, Ms. Arthur sat in a corner \n     beneath the bare walls, and said she didn't know why she had \n     to leave. ``Everyone I've talked to, they've had tears in \n     their eyes. Many here had to go and I miss them so. They were \n     wonderful,'' she says. ``If there was anything I could do to \n     turn it different, I would. I like it here very, very much. \n     It's good. Oh me, why? All these fine buildings and fine \n     furniture. Whatever the cause, I can't figure.''\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I submit the bill and ask for its \nimmediate referral.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and appropriately \nreferred.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, I rise to recognize the \ninventors, manufacturers, marketers, entrepreneurs, investors and media \nfrom across the United States and over 35 countries that are convening \nin Pittsburgh for the Invention/New Product Exposition (INPEX XIV).\n  INPEX is held in conjunction with The Business Show, the region's \nbusiness-to-business trade show, and the Global Partnership with \nPennsylvania Conference. The conference provides the opportunity for \ninternational entrepreneurs to meet with representatives from the \nregion's businesses. This conference helps to promote economic \ndevelopment and job creation in Western Pennsylvania and encourages \nparticipants to establish their operations in the region. Participants \ncan attend the educational seminars to learn how to do business in \nPennsylvania and network with Pennsylvania chambers, businesses and \nregional associations.\n  Most inventions and new products displayed at INPEX are eligible to \nbe a part of the INPEX Awards Program. Entries are judged by an \nInternational Jury, with winners determined on the basis of usefulness, \noverall appeal and creativity. Past sponsors of corporate awards \ninclude AAA, the World Trade Center Association, NASA and the \nPennsylvania Institute Of Culinary Arts.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that Pittsburgh is the site of such \ninnovation, business development and global partnership. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in extending the Senate's best wishes to \nparticipants and organizers of this conference, and in recognizing the \nweek of May 11 as Innovation Week, Business to Business Week and Global \nPartnership With Pennsylvania Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/11/senate-section/article/S4634-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    GULFSTREAM AEROSPACE CORPORATION\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nGulfstream Aerospace Corporation and the Gulfstream V industry team on \nwinning the coveted Robert J. Collier Trophy for 1997. The Gulfstream V \nis the world's first ultra-long range large cabin business jet. Both \nthe Gulfstream V and the Gulfstream IV SP are manufactured in Savannah, \nGeorgia.\n  The Collier trophy is aviation's most prestigious award. It is given \nannually by the National Aeronautics Association to recognize the top \naeronautical achievement in the United States. Gulfstream and the G-V \nIndustry team were presented the trophy at a ceremony on April 29 \nhosted by the National Aeronautical Association and the National \nAviation Club in Arlington, Virginia.\n  Gulfstream and the Gulfstream V industry team were recognized \nspecifically ``for successful application of advanced design and \nefficient manufacturing techniques, together with innovative \ninternational business partnerships, to place into service the \nGulfstream V--the world's first ultra-long range business jet.'' Past \nwinners of this prestigious award include Orville Wright, Neil \nArmstrong and the Apollo 11 flight crew, Charles E. ``Chuck'' Yeager \nand my colleague from Ohio, Senator and astronaut John Glenn.\n  Certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in April, \n1997, the Gulfstream V business jet is the first aircraft of its kind \nin the world. With unmatched performance, comfort and speed, the \nGulfstream V has a range that is 50% greater than any other business \njet currently in service. The Gulfstream V can carry eight passengers \nand a crew of four for nonstop distances of up to 6,500 nautical miles \nat speeds of up to Mach .88. It is designed to cruise routinely at an \naltitude of 51,000 feet. Last year, in the first eleven months of \nservice, the Gulfstream V set 47 world and national records, consisting \nof 22 city pair speed records and 25 performance records.\n  The Gulfstream V has made nonstop travel between cities such as Tokyo \nand Washington, London and Beijing, and Los Angeles and Moscow routine \nbusiness.\n  The Gulfstream V was recognized as one of the ``Ten Most Memorable \nFlights in 1997'' by the National Aeronautic Association for a flight \nfrom Washington, DC to Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The flight was \n6,330 nautical miles and took 12 hours and 40 minutes. It flew nonstop.\n  Mr. President, I want to salute and congratulate the 6,000 men and \nwomen of the Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation on their outstanding work \nand this extraordinary achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/11/senate-section/article/S4634-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4634-S4635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  COMMEMORATING THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE'S DIPLOMATIC SECURITY SERVICE\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as the United States observes \nNational Police Week, I believe this to be an appropriate time to \nrecognize the outstanding work performed by the men and women of the \nDepartment of State's Diplomatic Security Service (DSS).\n  As the security and law enforcement arm of the Department of State, \nthe DSS, since 1916, has protected U.S. diplomatic installations and \npersonnel around the world as well as providing critical security and \nlaw enforcement services within the United States. Presently, 260 DSS \nspecial agents are serving in over 140 of our embassies and consulates \nthroughout the world. Additionally, 500 special agents are assigned to \noffices throughout the United States and work closely with their \ncounterparts in federal, state, and municipal law enforcement \norganizations.\n  DSS special agents have been in the forefront of the fight against \ninternational terrorism and transnational crime. In 1995, DSS special \nagents assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan, working \nclosely with Pakistani Authorities, were instrumental in the \napprehension of Ramzi Yousef, a terrorist wanted in connection with the \nWorld Trade Center bombing in New York City. DSS agents had the lead \nrole in debriefing the original informant, coordinating surveillance of \nYousef's activities, and entered Yousef's room alongside Pakistani \npolice to effect his arrest. Subsequently, Yousef was convicted in New \nYork of his heinous act of terrorism and sentenced to life imprisonment \nwithout parole.\n  The DSS also runs effective Counter-Terrorism and Counter-Narcotics \nawards programs in which it offers large cash rewards of up to $4 \nmillion. In 1995, this program, along with the efforts of DSS agents \nthroughout Latin America, helped to bring about the downfall of the \nCali drug kingpins of Colombia, apprehending eight high ranking members \nof that organization. The DSS is currently playing a very key role in \nattempting to apprehend suspects involved in the Khobar Towers bombing \nin Saudi Arabia, the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie \nScotland, as well as Mexican drug trafficking.\n  The DSS also plays an important role in ensuring the security of our \nborders through investigations of falsified U.S. passports and U.S. \nvisas. In the U.S., work in this area complements the work of state and \nlocal authorities as well as other federal agencies. This role enables \nthe DSS to utilize versatile charges that enable it to apprehend \nfugitives and return them to various jurisdictions throughout the \nUnited States.\n  In my own state of California, DSS agents were instrumental in \nestablishing a verification system involving possession of U.S. visas, \nwhereby many illegal immigrants have been identified who were \npreviously, and fraudulently, claiming and receiving medical and \nwelfare benefits from the state of California. The California \nDepartment of Health Services estimates that this system saved \nCalifornia taxpayers over $2 million in 1997 alone.\n  Additionally, the DSS has conducted extensive training programs for \nforeign police officials, both in the U.S. and abroad, which over the \nlast decade have resulted in over 18,000 foreign police officers \nreceiving training in anti-terrorism and anti-crime skills. By \nenhancing the capabilities of these police elements, the DSS is \nincreasing the capacity of other countries to render assistance to the \nUnited States in our continuing struggle against international \nterrorism and crime.\n  Furthermore, the technical expertise of the DSS' security engineering \npersonnel has enabled the nation's business to be transacted safely and \nsecurely in hostile environments\n\n[[Page S4635]]\n\nthroughout the world. U.S. diplomatic installations rely on the ability \nof the DSS to provide a secure area in which to conduct sensitive \nfunctions. These programs provide the secure technical foundation in \ncomputer and information security which is so necessary in today's \ntechnological age.\n  The DSS has continually provided crucial support services for our \nforeign policy and law enforcement objectives. Their contributions have \nbeen recognized by the granting of heroism awards by organizations such \nas the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA) and the \nInternational Organization of Chiefs of Police (IACP).\n  In the first session of Congress, the Foreign Relations Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Years 1998 and 1999 (H.R. 1757), approved the inclusion \nof members of the DSS under the provisions of the Law Enforcement \nAvailability Pay (LEAP). A separate proposal, H.R. 633, would also \ninclude these personnel under the law enforcement retirement \nprovisions. These measures, which provide long overdue parity for DSS \npersonal with federal law enforcement colleagues, will be important in \ndetermining the future role of DSS agents.\n  I would like to thank the Diplomatic Security Service for the \ntireless role that they have played in combating terrorism and \ntransnational crime as well as helping to protect U.S. businesses, \nembassies, and all the branches of the U.S. government represented \nabroad. They have continually provided crucial services in support of \nour foreign policy and law enforcement objectives, often at substantial \nrisk to their own lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/11/senate-section/article/S4634-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NATIONAL PEACE OFFICERS' MEMORIAL DAY\n\n Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise in recognition of the \nNational Peace Officers' Memorial Day and to pay tribute to the 305 \nofficers of the law who lost their lives in the line of duty during the \npast year. I want to recognize specifically the six officers in North \nCarolina who put community safety ahead of their own lives. These six \nindividuals approached the job valiantly. Their courage is inspiring, \nand their commitment to duty provides the kind of example so \ndesperately needed in today's society.\n  I would, of course, be remiss if I did not mention the families of \nthe officers I now recognize. I extend my heartfelt gratitude and \ndeepest admiration for those who everyday watch and support their \nhusbands, wives, parents, and children on the front line of crime \nfighting. Their sacrifice is beyond measure, and we are forever \nindebted to these brave men and women.\n  I call to the attention of Congress the names and survivors of North \nCarolina's six fallen officers and ask that my colleagues join me in \nsaluting these courageous individuals.\n  Sergeant William Earl Godwin who served with the Morrisville Police \nDepartment. Sergeant Godwin's survivors include his wife, Allison, and \ntheir daughter, Mercedes.\n  Detective Paul Andrew Hale who served with the Raleigh Police \nDepartment. Detective Hale's survivors include his wife, Connie, and \ntheir daughters, Jessica and Stephanie.\n  Chief of Police Willard Wayne Hathaway who served with the Sharpsburg \nPolice Department Among Chief Hathaway's survivors is his son, Shaun.\n  Corporal David Walter Hathcock who served with the Cumberland County \nSheriff's Office. Corporal Hathcock's survivors include his wife, \nBarbara, and his sons, Phillip, Daniel, and Kevin.\n  Sergeant Lloyd Edward Lowry who served with the North Carolina \nHighway Patrol. Sergeant Lowry's survivors include his wife, Dixie, his \ndaughters, Lori and Melissa, and his grandchildren, Dustin, Brooke, and \nNolan.\n  Officer Mark Allen Swaney who served with the Davidson Police \nDepartment. Officer Swaney is survived by his parents, Larry and \nGlenda.\n  Mr. President, every North Carolinian mourns the loss of our six \npeace officers. I am privileged to convey the State's resounding and \nunanimous sentiment of appreciation, and our continuing respect for the \nskills, bravery, and dedication of our law enforcement \nofficers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/11/senate-section/article/S4635-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4635-S4636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  1998 JAMES FORRESTAL MEMORIAL AWARD\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on the evening of May 6th, I had \nthe honor of being in the audience to witness the presentation of the \n1998 James Forrestal Memorial Award by the National Defense Industrial \nAssociation to the distinguished senior Senator from Alaska, the \nChairman of the Appropriations Committee and Chairman of the Defense \nSubcommittee, Senator Ted Stevens. The first recipient of this \nimpressive award was President Dwight D. Eisenhower, followed by a \nnumber of most distinguished citizens who were personally involved in \nhelping our nation during difficult times, and who guided the \ndevelopment of a close working relationship between our government and \nprivate industry toward the requirements of National Security.\n  I have had the privilege of working with Senator Stevens for nearly \n30 years. It is no secret that I admire and deeply respect our \ncolleague. Our nation is truly fortunate to have as Chairman of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee, an individual as dedicated to public \nservice and to the maintenance of military strength and readiness.\n  Upon receipt of this award, Senator Stevens shared with the audience \nhis views on the status of the military and our nation's future. These, \nperhaps provocative, but, definitely profound remarks should be studied \nand restudied by all who believe in the importance of our military \nforces.\n  Mr. President, I ask that Senator Stefvens' address be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The Address follows:\n\n                     Address by Senator Ted Stevens\n\n       As one who admired Sec. James Forrestal, it is a great \n     honor to receive this award which bears his name. The name of \n     a great leader who responded with vision and insight to the \n     defense organizational, and leadership, needs of our Nation \n     after World War II.\n       Indeed, Secretary Forrestal, serving as Secretary of the \n     Navy, demonstrated great courage and wisdom as an advocate \n     for a restructuring of the Department of War and Department \n     of Navy--a restructuring we all know led to today's \n     Department of Defense.\n       The Forrestal Award is especially meaningful coming from \n     your organization--NDIA. By insuring that industry has a \n     strong, clear voice on defense issues, NDIA serves our Nation \n     well.\n       Secretary Forrestal's visionary leadership established a \n     national security structure which has seen us through over \n     fifty years of peace and war. With only modest adjustments, \n     the course he charted allowed us to navigate through the cold \n     war.\n       Some of Secretary Forrestal's observations from 1947 \n     provide a thoughtful perspective on current defense issues.\n       In testimony on the National Security Act of 1947, \n     Secretary Forrestal said the bill ``provides an organization \n     which will allow us to apply the full punitive power of the \n     United States against any future enemy. It provides for the \n     coordination of the three armed services, but what is to me \n     even more important than that, it provides for the \n     integration of foreign policy with national policy, of our \n     civilian economy with military requirements.''\n       Just as our Nation faced a ``Post World War'' environment \n     in 1947, we now prepare for the 21st century and military \n     contingencies which differ greatly from the cold war. Tonight \n     I will focus on some common themes which motivate us, like \n     Secretary Forrestal, to ponder the need for adjustments in \n     the current defense establishment.\n       After World War II, the nation had to devise a new \n     military-industrial structure to prepare us for an uncertain \n     future. In 1947 testimony, Secretary Forrestal outlined his \n     thinking--he said:\n       ``First, there is a need, apparent during and since the \n     war, for the planned integration of all of the elements, \n     energies, and forces in our Nation which have to be drawn \n     upon to wage successful war. In these categories come not \n     merely the Army and Navy and the State Department, but \n     industry, and by `industry' I mean industrial management, \n     which I regard as one of the keystones which produce success \n     in war.''\n       All these concerns are valid today, but the facts \n     underlying the need he discussed will be significantly \n     changed. DOD will be buying in a less competitive environment \n     than ever--requiring careful attention to ensure that \n     innovation and foresight are not lost.\n       Further, today's defense systems are more complex, take \n     dramatically longer to develop and build, and cost \n     significantly more to acquire, maintain and operate. In the \n     first nine months of 1945, we accepted delivery 5,111 P-51 \n     Fighters. Now, at the peak rate, we will build 36 F-22's and \n     48 F-18 E/F's, both with long lead times greater than 33 \n     months.\n       Not only are there fewer prime defense contractors, but \n     each one is moving to be more efficient; inevitably this \n     process will limit or eliminate excess production capacity. \n     The speed and success of Desert Storm demonstrated the new \n     role for industrial management in a ``come as you are'' war.\n       I remember visiting Joint Stars in Saudi Arabia--a system \n     in the demonstration/validation phase of development, but \n     being used\n\n[[Page S4636]]\n\n     in the overall Desert Storm operation--while still under \n     industry control and support.\n       Indeed, we rarely hear discussion now about raw material \n     shortages or industrial surge capacity. And we are no longer \n     an Island Nation--this Nation's military industrial base is \n     now part of a global economy. This industrial challenge has \n     parallels in our military command structure.\n       Secretary Forrestal, intimately familiar with the demands \n     of World War II, enunciated what others often think when he \n     said--``Military strength today is not merely military power \n     but its is economic and industrial strength.''\n       Today we continually find ourselves in peacekeeping and \n     other contingency missions--missions for which our soldiers \n     and leaders are not necessarily trained or equipped. \n     Instabilities are more likely to call for a response to \n     terrorism, civil war, and ethnic strife, instead of \n     territorial invasion.\n       Future battles may take place in urban environments with \n     political constraints on collateral damage, difficult \n     conflict conditions for any military commander. Deploying \n     military force should not be the solution to every regional, \n     ethnic or humanitarian crises. No forces should deploy \n     overseas unless we establish mission objectives that our \n     political and military leadership can plainly articulate.\n       A second similarity to the challenges faced by James \n     Forrestal is the confidence of the Nation in the weapon \n     systems and combat platforms within the military inventory. \n     Secretary Forrestal concisely outlined his thoughts in words \n     I believe ring true today--``Men fight not for abstractions, \n     but for the concrete things they can visualize in terms of \n     their own country.'' Following World War II, this Nation felt \n     confident in its ability and the then-existing ``Tools of \n     war''.\n       Following operation Desert Storm, the United States was \n     equally confident in our weapons. I saw first hand during the \n     gulf war the impact that ``early'' generation precision \n     guided weapons and information technologies, such as JSTARS, \n     had on our decisive victory in that conflict.\n       The entire world saw those advances also--we now need new \n     technologies to assure that our ``cutting edge'' is sharp. We \n     must implement those technologies rapidly.\n       Obviously, we also need new tactics, new systems, and a \n     modernized command, control, and communications management \n     concept. And, there are new threats--ballistic missiles, \n     cruise missiles, chemical and biological weapons, information \n     warfare, and space-based sensors and systems.\n       These resonate Secretary Forrestal's comments on the need \n     for a ``planned integration of all of the elements, energies, \n     and forces in our Nation.''\n       These new threats call into question the traditional \n     weapons of war as well as the accepted practice of splitting \n     budget resources among the military services. Just as \n     aircraft technology spawned a new military service, the new \n     technology forces which will influence future warfare demand \n     that we look at our research and development priorities and \n     the allocation of procurement funds.\n       The last parallel to 1947 I cite is one I deal with most \n     directly as Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee--\n     that is the pressure of a substantially decreased budget. As \n     each of you know, the defense budget today has reached \n     dangerously low levels. Defense spending has fallen far \n     faster than any other category of Federal spending--dropping \n     39% since 1985. In constant dollars, it is lower than \n     1939. Yet, the budget agreement, as well as current public \n     sentiment, makes it most likely that defense spending will \n     be flat through 2002.\n       The pressures on this flat budget are as great as I have \n     ever seen, and probably greater than the pressures faced by \n     our leaders in 1947. One basic fact is that neither Congress \n     nor DOD have much flexibility in the Defense budget.\n       Force structure determines the level of military personnel \n     spending--presently about one-third of our budget. Second, \n     these forces must be trained and ready which consumes roughly \n     one-third of the Defense budget devoted to operation and \n     maintenance.\n       Finally, the remaining one-third is left to modernize and \n     develop the next generation of military systems which will \n     ensure no adversary can match U.S. soldiers, sailors, marines \n     and airmen. However, this remaining ``one-third'' for \n     modernization is not what it used to be.\n       In constant 1998 dollars, procurement has declined from \n     $104 billion in FY 1988 to $49 billion in FY 1998 and R \n     declined from $48 billion to $36.5 billion. That decline is \n     exacerbated by on-going contingency operations in Bosnia and \n     Iraq.\n       The $10.5 billion committed to Bosnia alone from 1995-1999 \n     will consume all the savings achieved by tough base closure \n     and force structure decisions, while also reducing our \n     investment in modernization and R To meet these \n     challenges, we can no longer afford business as usual at DOD.\n       This brings our discussion back to my first point--future \n     conflicts will stress our current military and defense \n     industrial establishment. These entities will have to work \n     together to consolidate functions, precisely define missions, \n     eliminate redundancy and assure victory through perfection of \n     planning and execution through total use of command, control, \n     communications and intelligence functions.\n       The challenge before us today is to look towards a new \n     national defense establishment for a new century in a new \n     millennium--a structure which will allow our great Nation to \n     organize, plan, and maintain peace and security.\n       Secretary Forrestal once said, ``The greatest economy is in \n     preventing war. The best insurance against war is national \n     preparedness and an effective coordination of our foreign and \n     our military policy.'' These are the goals we continue to \n     strive to achieve.
