The Chair lays before the \nSenate, S. 4, with debate equally divided until the hour of 10 a.m. The \nclerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 4) to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 \n     to provide to private sector employees the same opportunities \n     for time-and-a-half compensatory time off, biweekly work \n     programs, and flexible credit hour programs as Federal \n     employees currently enjoy to help balance the demands and \n     needs of work and family, to clarify the provisions relating \n     to exemptions of certain professionals from the minimum wage \n     and overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act of \n     1938, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from the State of \nTexas--I am not sure how much time she needs, 15 minutes?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That will be fine. I probably will not need all of \nthat.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for up to \n15 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President, and I thank the chairman of \nthe committee.\n  We are going to vote in about an hour and a half to invoke cloture, \nwhich means we are going to vote on whether we can take up the Family \nFriendly Workplace Act. Mr. President, this act is long overdue. This \nis going to free the hourly employees of our country to have the same \nflexibility that Federal workers now have, that most State workers now \nhave, that salaried employees now have. Only hourly employees are not \nable to walk into their employer and say, ``Could I take off at 3 \no'clock Friday afternoon to go to my child's soccer game and work 2 \nextra hours on Monday?''\n  The hourly employees of this country are not allowed to walk into \ntheir employer and say, ``You know, I don't ever work overtime, but I'd \nlike to be able to work some extra hours and bank those so that when I \nam able to go on a camping trip with my child, I will have those hours \nto do it.''\n  An hourly employee is not allowed to walk in to his or her employer's \noffice and say, ``I would like to know if it would be possible for me \nto work maybe 9 hours everyday for 2 weeks and take every other Friday \noff.'' An hourly employee cannot do that. And yet this has worked so \nwell for Federal employees and salaried employees who have dealt with \nthe stresses of being a working mom or a working dad. They need to \nwork, they need the extra income, but they do not have enough time with \ntheir children. Salaried employees can do this. Federal employees can \ndo this. State employees can do this. But hourly workers cannot. Why? \nBecause the Federal Government says they cannot, because the Federal \nGovernment discriminates against employees by a bill that was passed \ninto law in 1938.\n  Mr. President, in 1938, 10 percent of the women in this country with \nchildren worked--10 percent. So it was not exactly an issue on the \nfront burner at the time that working moms had the kind of stresses \nthey do today. The ones who were working did, no question about it, but \nthere were not as many. Today, two-thirds of the working women in this \ncountry have school-age children--two-thirds.\n  I was talking to my daughter last night. I was worried because I had \nnot heard from her. I left a message for her Sunday. Ray and I were \ntrying to reach her and we left a message for her Sunday and said call \nus back. She did not call back. She called me last night about 10:30, \nand she said, ``Oh, gosh, I'm really sorry, everything is fine, but I \nhad just beem volunteering full time at the school and Travis' Little \nLeague directors meeting was tonight, I had just gotten home from the \ndirectors' meeting, and we have been working with our twin daughters \nhaving a pen pal program with another school and were planning a party \nfor the children who were coming over to meet for the first time.''\n  My gosh, I thought, how does she have enough hours in the day, and \nshe is a full-time mom. What if she were working and trying to do those \nwonderful things that she is doing to support her son's Little League, \nor our twin granddaughters' activities in Brownies, which she hosts \nevery week at her home? All the extra hours that she volunteers at \nschool, reading to all the children in school at the library, I \nthought, what if she were a working mom? And I thought to myself, two-\nthirds of the working women in this country have school-age children, \nand they would love to do what Brenda Maxon, our daughter, does \nvolunteering at school to read to the children, being on the board of \ndirectors of the Little League, working with her twin daughters' pen \npal class and having Brownie troop meetings every week. Those are such \nwonderful things, and I am so grateful that my grandchildren have such \na wonderful mom.\n  But, Mr. President, if she were working full time, she would have the \nstresses that would make it impossible. Impossible. Every mom would \nlike to be able to do those things. We are trying to relieve some of \nthat stress with this bill. We are going to try to give hourly \nemployees the ability to say, ``I would like to host a Brownie troop \nevery other Friday. Could I work 9 hours every other day of the week \nand take every other Friday off so I can host a Brownie troop for my \ndaughter?'' That is what we want for the hourly employees of our \ncountry.\n  What this bill does is allow the hourly employees to come in and say, \n``I'd like to work overtime and bank the hours to take a day off.'' Or, \nif an employer says, ``I need overtime work,'' the person can have \ntheir choice: Time-and-a-half pay or time-and-a-half hours, and, once \nagain, bank those hours for when they are needed. Or to be able to walk \nin and say, ``Can I work 9 hours a day and take every other Friday \noff?'' Or ``Can I work 10 hours 4 days a week and take Fridays off?'' \nBecause other people are able to do that. Maybe they do not have child \ncare on Fridays. They have child care 4 days a week they feel really \ncomfortable with, but not on Fridays.\n\n  You see, the difference between 1938 laws and today is that I think \nemployers realize how important it is that they have happy, productive \nemployees. And when two-thirds of the working women in this country \nhave school-aged children, they know there is stress in this life. What \ncan we do to make these employees happier, to give them a release \nvalve, to let them have that time to do something special with their \nchildren so that they do not worry that their children are going to \ngrow up without their awareness of how much their moms and dads love \nthem, cherish them, and want them to have solid values? So, Mr. \nPresident, that is what the bill is.\n  I have heard the opposition. They say, ``Oh, but this will just allow \nemployers to coerce employees. All the rights are with the employers.'' \nWell, of course the employer is running the business. Many times it is \nthe small business man or woman that has gone out and borrowed the \nmoney, that works 80 hours a week trying to make it go, to contribute \nto our economy. It is not easy being in business in America with all of \nthe taxes and regulations and litigation that a person in business must \nface.\n  So, of course, they are running the operation. But that does not mean \nthey are bad. It does not mean that they are going to say, to an \nemployee, ``Oh, no. Of course you're not going to do that. I don't want \nto pay you overtime.'' That is not the way America is. This is not \n1938. It is not 1948. It is 1997.\n  Welcome to the end of the 20th century. Employers want happy, \nproductive employees. They are going to bend over backward. And they do \nbend over backwards to make life better for their employees. And if it \nis not going to disrupt the workplace, of course they are\n\n[[Page S4509]]\n\ngoing to say, yes, they would like the flexibility to do this.\n  It has been stated on the floor, ``Oh, well, the only people \nsupporting this are employers.'' That is not true. This morning in my \noffice I met with three Federal workers. And I said, ``How do you like \nflextime?''\n  They said, ``Oh, it's wonderful, of course. We love it.''\n  And I said, ``Well, can you imagine why many of the Democrats are \nkeeping this bill from coming up so that others would be able to have \nthese same rights?''\n  And they looked at me sort of aghast--aghast--of course.\n  What in the world could be wrong with adding one more option for the \nworking moms and dads in this country that are hourly employees? We are \ntaking away no rights. We are taking nothing away.\n  In fact, the unions are opposed to this, but I do not understand it, \nbecause if there is a union contract, it does not apply. A union \ncontract overrides the ability for this employee to go outside of the \nunion contract to his or her employer. So the unions' rights are \ncertainly protected.\n  Why would the union not want other hourly employees, who do not have \nunion contracts, why would they step in and say that we should not \nallow hourly employees in this country to have the same rights as \nsalaried employees do, as Federal employees do? What could be their \nmotivation?\n  It is incomprehensible to me that adding another option to the hourly \nemployees' ability to relieve the stress in their lives would be \nopposed by anyone, by unions, by members of the Democratic side of the \nSenate. It is incomprehensible because every single Republican is \ncertainly going to vote for this bill.\n  But we need 60 votes to move forward. And I do not know if we will \nhave 60 votes. But I would like to have the explanation from someone \nwho is going to vote against this bill, why they would not allow the \nhourly employees of this country to have another option to relieve the \nstress in their lives, to spend more time with their kids, paid rather \nthan unpaid, which is what the President's plan would do.\n  This is paid. What if the hourly employee cannot afford the Family \nand Medical Leave Act, which does not have pay, because they have a \nmortgage payment and they are barely making ends meet, they have a car \npayment, they have day care payments, they just cannot quite squeeze it \nout if they cannot get paid? That is why this is so important. They \nwill continue to get paid at their regular rates. They know what their \nhourly compensation is. They know they can depend on it. They would \njust choose, if they wanted to, instead of getting extra pay, they \nwould take extra time off.\n  In a poll done by Money magazine, a survey found 64 percent of the \npublic and 68 percent of the women would choose paid time off, which \nour bill would give them, for overtime work instead of added pay \nbecause it means that it is up to them to have the extra time with \ntheir kids without in any way giving up the ability to pay the car \npayment and the mortgage payment and the day care payment.\n  So, Mr. President, this bill is so fair. It is so right. It is \nimpossible to think--if you go out and do an interview on the street, \ntalk to people who are not in Washington, DC. Talk to people who are in \nthe real world, working hard to make ends meet, running a small \nbusiness. Talk to people who are making this country tick. It is not \nthe people in the U.S. Senate that are making this country tick; it is \nthe people out there on the frontline, working to make ends meet as \nhourly employees or as small business owners or as salaried employees \nor Federal workers. They are out there trying to make ends meet. And we \nare giving them one more option to relieve the stress in their lives.\n\n  If you ask a man on the street, would they like this as an option, \nnot as a mandate, but as an option to be able to at some point attend a \nspecial football game, a special soccer game, a special Little League \nbaseball game, or to be able to host the Brownie troop every Friday, \nwould they like the option to go to their employer and say, ``Could I \nhave flexible time? Could I have compensatory time?'' I will guarantee \nyou, that 8 out of 10 people will say absolutely yes--probably 10 out \nof 10--but I know 8 out of 10 would, or 68 percent of the women or 65 \npercent of all people. An overwhelming majority would say, ``Hey, I \ndidn't know they couldn't.'' That is what most people would say. ``Are \nyou kidding me? You mean, there are people in this country who cannot \nwalk into their employer's office and say, `Could I have time off \nFriday at 3 o'clock and work Monday until 7?' Well, gosh, yeah, I think \nthey ought to have that right. I sure do.'' That is what we are trying \nto give them today.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope people will ask themselves the question--\nask yourself the question, should hourly employees have the same rights \nas everybody else that works in this country? Should they? And if you \nthink they should, then you should vote today for cloture so we can get \non with this bill.\n  I think the President would have a hard time not signing a flextime \nbill when he campaigned saying exactly that is what he wanted. He \nwanted flextime. We are going to give it to him, if the Democrats will \nlet us move forward on this bill.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time do I have, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts controls 19 \nminutes and 48 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 7 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I listened to my good friend from Texas make a very \neloquent statement and, of course, if that was the bill that we had \nbefore us, there would be an entirely different result than the vote \nthat is going to take place at a little after 10 this morning. But that \nis not the bill we have before us.\n  I'd like just to mention that on page 9 of the bill, the decision \nabout whether an employee will be permitted to take the time off will \nbe made, as line 18 says, by the employer, not by the employee.\n  If, the good Senator from Texas said wants to change that, so that \nthe employee makes the decision, instead of the employer, we have an \nentirely different bill here. If you want to give the choice to the \nworkers, so that the employee can make that judgment and decision, you \nwould have an entirely different outcome.\n  But that is not what the legislation says. This bill says the \nemployer will make the decision--the employer will make it. And as I \nhave said, if the employer decides not to grant an employee's request \nto use comptime on a particular date, because the employer makes the \ndecision that the employee has not given sufficient notice, or the use \nof the comptime would disrupt the employer's operations, the employee \nhas no ability to appeal it. Even if the employer fails to adhere to \nthis standard, the employee has no remedy. There is no remedy if the \nemployer is being unreasonable or harsh.\n  So that is really the difference. The difference between this bill \nand the Federal employee program is that the Federal employee makes the \ndecision about when to take the time off. That is the difference \nbetween this bill and the Family and Medical Leave Act, too--the \nemployee makes the decision. Under this bill, it is the employer that \nmakes the decision. And that is the major difference between this bill \nand those existing programs.\n  I would just mention to my friend again, who objects because the \nunions are opposed to this even though they are not affected by it. \nSometimes we have groups in our country that fight for the rights of \npeople who are not necessarily members of those groups. That is why \njust about every woman's group that has fought for economic justice has \nalso opposed this legislation, because they believe it is a major step \nback, particularly for lower income workers. And they know that, while \nthose lower income workers are primarily women, they are not all women.\n  It is interesting that all the organizations that supported the \nincrease in the minimum wage, all the ones who supported the Family and \nMedical Leave Act, all the ones who supported\n\n[[Page S4510]]\n\nthe WARN Act, which requires an employer to give employees 60 days' \nnotice before closing a factory--all are opposed to this bill. And all \nthe organizations that opposed all those provisions that would have \nenhanced the rights of working families are for this bill. So we ought \nto look at the bill very closely.\n  Those organizations that support this bill do so for a very \nfundamental reason.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose cloture on S. 4, which \nits supporters call the Family Friendly Workplace Act. This is a bill \nwith an appealing title but appalling substance. We should not rush to \nfinal passage.\n  This bill would make a fundamental change in the Fair Labor Standards \nAct, a law that has well served American workers and their families for \n60 years. The law requires that employees be paid no less than the \nminimum wage. Does that sound unreasonable to the American people? Have \nwe changed so much in the 60 years since that Act was passed that we do \nnot want to permit hard-working men and women to be paid the minimum \nwage? The law requires the payments of the minimum wage, currently at \n$4.75 an hour. And the law also requires that employees be paid at \nleast time-and-a-half when they work more than 40 hours a week.\n\n  Contrary to what the Senator from Texas said, if workers want to work \n10 hours a day for 4 days and have Friday off, they can do it under \nexisting law. They can do that under the existing law. If the employer \nwants to juggle work schedules so that employees can work half a day on \nFriday, and work longer days in the earlier part of the week, they can \ndo that under existing law. Only 10 percent of hourly employees are \noffered these or other flexible arrangements available under current \nlaw. Part of our complaint about this bill is, why don't employers \nfirst demonstrate that the existing law does not work for them? We do \nnot believe the law should be changed until employers show that \nexisting law does not provide adequate flexibility.\n  The Fair Labor Standards Act requires employers to pay the minimum \nwage, and to give employees time-and-a-half for hours worked over 40 in \na week. That principle is part of the fabric of the employer-employee \nrelations in this Nation. It has been so since 1938. But this bill \nwould radically change that principle.\n  Under Senator Ashcroft's proposal, employees could be required--\nlisten to this, Mr. President--could be required to work up to 80 hours \nin a single week without being paid a penny of overtime.\n  Under this bill, employers could require workers to work extra hours \nin one week, then give them an equal number of hours off at a later \ntime without paying time-and-a-half.\n  This is what it says, Mr. President. Right here on page 11: ``In \ngeneral, notwithstanding any other provision of the law''--that \neliminates the 40-hour workweek--``an employer may establish biweekly \nwork programs that allow the use of biweekly work schedules that \nconsist of a basic work requirement of not more than 80 hours over a 2-\nweek period in which more than 40 hours of the work requirement may \noccur in a week of the period.'' Well, that says it. ``More than 40 \nhours of the work requirement may occur'' in 1 of the 2 weeks.\n\n  Further: ``The employee shall be compensated for each hour in such \nbiweekly work schedule at a rate not less than the regular rate at \nwhich the employee is employed.'' That is straight time. Do we all \nunderstand that? It is left to the employer to decide whether that \nemployee will work not just 40 hours, but 50, 60, 70, or even 80 hours \na week. And every single one of those hours will be paid at straight \ntime. This is the abolition of the 40-hour workweek.\n  We hear, ``Well, times have changed. We do not want to be restricted \nby the traditions of the past.'' I agree with that. We are not \ncommitted to unnecessary programs, but we are committed to values, the \nvalues that men and women ought to work 40 hours a week, and if they \nare going to work longer than 40 hours a week, they get paid time and a \nhalf. I think that concept is as real today as it ever was--but the \nAshcroft proposal disagrees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has spoken for 7 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 3 additional minutes.\n  The Ashcroft proposal says that the idea of the 40-hour workweek is \nout; it can be 50, 60, 70 hours a week, all paid at straight time.\n  I have discussed who makes the decision under this bill--it is the \nemployer, not the employee. It is not the employee who says, ``My child \nhas a school play,'' or ``I have a meeting with the child's teacher.'' \nUnder this bill, the employee has no right to use comptime for these \nimportant purposes. The employee has no right to use any time for these \npurposes--paid or unpaid.\n  That is the Murray amendment. That amendment provides employees just \n24 hours a year to attend school conferences and participate in family \nliteracy programs. Those 24 hours are within the 12 weeks of family \nleave provided by the Family and Medical Leave Act. We will see how \nmany votes we get from the other side of the aisle when we consider the \nMurray amendment. We will see how many votes we will get on that.\n  I say to the Senator from Texas that I hope she makes that very \neloquent statement when Senator Murray offers the amendment.\n  Mr. President, we are talking about abolishing the 40-hour workweek \nand giving the employers the whip hand. The changes proposed by this \nbill go to the heart of our labor standards laws and would alter the \nbasic rules covering 65 million Americans.\n  But this has been debated on the floor for only a little over 2 \nhours. We began debate on the bill 2 days ago and spent only a morning \ndiscussing it before the Republicans filed this petition--2 hours and \nthey filed this petition. Since that time, we have not had a moment of \ndebate on the bill on the floor of the Senate. This issue deserves much \nfuller consideration than that. We should not be contemplating such \nsignificant changes with so little discussion.\n  These changes are so powerful and the debate has been so short, I \nwonder why the bill's proponents are in such a rush? What do they have \nto fear from developing or talking about or debating these issues? \nThose who support this legislation must recognize the bill cannot \nwithstand close scrutiny. They know that full and fair consideration of \nthe legislation will reveal fatal flaws. Serious defects are built into \nthe bill, and the proponents know it. That is why they want to ram this \nlegislation through without adequate opportunity for discussion.\n  That is exactly why we should oppose this petition. This bill cries \nout for a closer look. The 65 million American workers deserve no less.\n  A careful review of the bill demonstrates that it is nothing more \nthan a pay cut for those hard-working Americans. In truth, the bill \nshould be called the Paycheck Reduction Act. The bill is not designed \nto help employees juggle their work and family obligations. Instead, it \nis designed to help employers cut wages.\n\n  The bill's proponents have admitted that small businesses cannot \nafford to pay their employees overtime. That is why they support this \nbill. This statement was made by the witness from the National \nFederation of Independent Businesses who testified in support of S. 4 \nbefore the Labor Committee in February.\n  The bill has four major flaws. First, it makes good on the NFIB's \ncharacterization. It cuts workers' wages. Under the bill, an employer \ncould force an employee to take an hour off in the future for every \nhour of overtime they work. Current law requires employers to pay time \nand a half for overtime hours. Substituting time off at a straight time \nrate is a pay cut, pure and simple.\n  The bill also lets employers discriminate against workers who refuse \nto take comptime instead of overtime pay. Under S. 4, the employer is \nfree to assign overtime work only to those workers who accept comptime. \nWorkers who need the money the most, who cannot afford to take the time \noff, would be hurt the most. Their paychecks would be smaller. Giving \nthe employer that power eliminates the worker's freedom of choice. We \noffered an amendment to address that issue. It was defeated in the \nLabor Committee--on a party line vote.\n  Second, the bill cuts employees' benefits. Many industries link the \nsize of\n\n[[Page S4511]]\n\nemployees' pension and health benefits to the number of hours they \nwork. Under S. 4, when an employee uses comptime hours, they would not \ncount towards pension and health benefits. The result is a reduction in \nemployees' income after retirement and a cut in their health benefits \nwhile they are working. Once again, we offered an amendment on that \nissue in committee, and we were defeated along strict party lines.\n  The bill also permits a perverse outcome. The way the bill is \ndrafted, an employee would not be assured an increase in time off. If \nan employee takes 8 hours of comptime on Monday in order to spend time \nwith his or her family, the employer is free to force the employee to \nwork on Saturday to make up for lost time. The employer does not even \nhave to pay time and a half for the hours worked on Saturday. That is \nreally family friendly. The comptime hours used on Monday do not count \ntoward the 40-hour workweek. Is this family friendly? We offered an \namendment on this issue, too, and it was defeated along party lines in \nthe committee.\n  Third, as I mentioned, the bill abolishes the 40-hour week. The so-\ncalled biweekly work program allows employers to work employees up to \n80 hours in a single week, without paying a penny of overtime. Or, the \nemployer could impose a work schedule of 60 hours one week and 20 hours \nthe next--again, without paying any overtime premium. Making child care \narrangements for such shifting and irregular schedules wouldn't be \nfamily-friendly--it would be a nightmare.\n  Finally, and most importantly, the bill does not give employees the \nchoice about when to take comp hours that they have earned. Supporters \nof S. 4 claim that their bill is meant to give employees the option to \nuse comptime to attend a child's graduation, take an elderly parent to \nthe doctor, or deal with other family obligations. But nothing in this \nbill requires the employer to give the employee the day that he or she \nwants or needs. Instead, the bill gives the employer virtually \nunreviewable discretion to decide when the employee takes the time off.\n  If the employer gets to choose when employees can take comptime, this \nbill provides no benefit. It does not help workers to give up overtime \npay if the employer can deny their request to use comptime when they \nneed it. Instead, the system becomes nothing more than a pay cut.\n  For all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote against cloture. \nGive us the opportunity to explore and discuss what this bill does to--\nnot for--65 million working Americans. The hard-working families who \ndepend on overtime pay to make ends meet deserve no less.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. You have 23 seconds.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I was allocated 22\\1/2\\ minutes. I have used 15. I ask \nunanimous consent the Senator from Maine be allowed to speak for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will not object if we can have the same 5 minutes on \nour side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There is an additional allocation of 5 minutes on each side. The \nSenator from Maine is recognized for a period of 5 minutes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor \nof the Family Friendly Workplace Act, which will permit employers to \noffer more flexible work schedules to their employees.\n  The lifestyles of today's employees do not always match the \ntraditional 9 to 5, 5-day-a-week schedules of their parents. This \nlegislation is intended to give families greater flexibility in order \nto better balance the often competing demands of work and family.\n  The legislation will allow private sector employers to offer more \nflexible work schedules to their employees by providing additional \noptions like comptime, flextime, and biweekly schedules. The \nlegislation doesn't change to amount of compensation--simply the form \nof compensation.\n  For instance, the legislation allows employers to give their \nemployees the option of receiving overtime in the form of compensatory \ntime off instead of cash wages at a rate of not less than one and one-\nhalf hours for each hour of overtime worked.\n  The legislation also allows employers and employees--by mutual \nagreement--to set up a biweekly schedule consisting of any combination \nof 80 hours over a 2-week period. For example, an employee could work \n45 hours in week one and 35 hours in week two, which would allow them \nto work nine hours a day and take every other Friday off.\n  In response to the concerns expressed by my Democratic colleagues, I \nalso want to emphasize that participation in these programs is strictly \nvoluntary on the part of both the employee and the employer. No one can \nbe forced to participate, nor can participation be a ``condition of \nemployment.'' In fact, employers are expressly prohibited from \ncoercing, threatening, or intimidating their employees into \nparticipating against their will, and violators face a range of \nsanctions.\n  Mr. President, for many families, time is more valuable than money, \nand this bill simply extends options that have been widely available--\nand extremely popular among employees--in the public sector to the \nprivate sector.\n  I have been a manager in the public sector, and I know firsthand how \npopular and effective these options can be. As former Representative \nGeraldine Ferraro said during the House debate on the bill allowing \nFederal agencies to offer flextime and biweekly work schedules, \n``Flexible schedules have helped reduce the conflicts between work and \npersonal needs, particularly for working women and others with \nhousehold responsibilities.'' I certainly agree with former \nRepresentative Ferraro on this issue.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I bring to my colleagues' attention a very \nrecent study of over 1,100 women conducted by the Princeton Survey \nResearch. Of the mothers surveyed, 91 percent--91 percent--of those \nsurveyed said that a flexible work schedule was important to them. In \nfact, the ability to work a flexible work schedule was more important \nto these working women than the availability of workplace child care or \nthe ability to work part time.\n  Mr. President, we should listen to the women of America. We should \nlisten to the mothers of America. I urge all of my colleagues to join \nme in supporting S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act. It is \nprowomen, it is profamily, and it is proemployee.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes to Senator Murray.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I appreciate the opportunity to come to the floor today \nto talk about the comptime bill or the so-called Family Friendly \nWorkplace Act. I have listened very carefully to this bill. I serve in \nthe committee that it went through, the Labor Committee, and we went \nthrough the amendments. The Senator from Massachusetts, Senator \nKennedy, has really outlined the true effects of this bill.\n  Now, I, like everyone, like the stated purpose of this bill. As a \nmother with a daughter who is in school, working full time, I know the \npressures that every single parent faces in this country in trying to \nmanage their job and making sure that they pay the right attention to \ntheir young children as well. All of us are in that time crunch where \nwe are trying to figure out how we can do the best job possible for our \nemployer and we can do the best job possible for our children.\n  Unfortunately, the comptime bill that has been presented to us does \nnot offer that flexibility for families. In fact, it will take that \nflexibility away. Can you imagine a young mother with two young \nchildren who has them in preschool or day care, who is told by her \nemployer on Friday that next week you will work 60 hours? Now, how is \nshe going to go to her day care provider and say, excuse me, I need 20 \nadditional hours for my two young children in preschool next week or in \nday care. Day care facilities are very controlled in the amount of \nchildren they can have and the amount of hours they can have. They do \nnot have flextime to allow additional children just whenever an \nemployer says you need to work 60 hours next week.\n  It is critical that we look at this bill from the eyes of those who \nare the receivers, the employees, the people who\n\n[[Page S4512]]\n\ngo to work every day, the people who are really trying to raise their \nkids and manage their jobs at the same time. This bill does not give \nthem the flexibility. It will, instead, take that away from them and \nreally cause a lot more family stress than is already needed.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote against cloture so we can have the \nopportunity to offer amendments to this bill to really make it do what \nthe proponents want it to do, and that is to give employees time to \nparticipate with their children. I will have an amendment called the \n``time for schools'' amendment that we will offer on this bill if we \nare allowed, if cloture is defeated, so we can really give that \nflexibility back to families.\n  I have spent a great deal of time going around my State talking to \nparents who are working. Inevitably they say to me, ``You know, I could \nnot get to my child's school conference last week, I could not go \nparticipate with my young child. I feel guilty about that. But I went \nto my employer and I could not take time off.'' When you talk to young \nchildren today, far too often they say, ``My parent does not care about \nmy education. They did not come to my school conference last week. They \ndid not participate with me. They do not care whether or not I get a \ngood education. They are never here.''\n  Kids want their parents at school with them for those teacher \nconferences and those important dates. Mothers and fathers want to be \nwith their kids on those important dates.\n  My amendment, if I am allowed to offer it, will give employees 24 \nhours a year. That is 2 hours a month--simply 2 hours a month--of the \ncurrent family medical leave time; time off to go back and forth to \nschool conferences; to participate with their child in importance \nactivities.\n  What an incredible message that will give to young children across \nthis country--all of us saying to them that we feel it is so important \nthat parents participate with their children that we are willing to \ngive them time off from their jobs to go participate with those kids.\n  I want every young person in this country to say, ``My parents care \nabout my education. They came with me to school last week for an hour \nto talk with the teachers.'' I want that child to say, ``My education \nis important. I know because my mother was here yesterday. She took off \nfrom her job to be here.''\n  That is what my amendment does. That is what this bill is all about--\ngiving parents the ability to participate with their young children \nwhen it is vitally important.\n  Let's do the right thing with this bill. Let's stop cloture today and \nmove on to a mandatory process that really does what all of us want to \ndo--deal with that time that every parent feels today, and let their \nchildren know that as adults we will care for them. Let's pass the time \nfor schools amendment. Let's put some flexibility in the bill that \nreally allows employees the ability to care for their families and do \ntheir jobs right, and let's do it right.\n  So I urge my colleagues to oppose cloture today, and then help us \npass amendments that really make this a Family Friendly Workplace Act.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 seconds.\n  The amendment that has been described by the Senator from Washington \nwas offered in our committee, and was defeated. If we allow cloture on \nthis, she will be denied offering that amendment on this particular \nprogram. It is an additional reason that we should not have cloture.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Illinois, my good friend, and a \nstrong supporter of families and working families.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank Senator Kennedy very much.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I would like to join many of my colleagues in opposing \nS. 4.\n  People across the country are working hard to realize the American \nDream of economic security for their families. At the same time, it is \nincreasingly apparent that parents are having to struggle to balance \nthe competing interests of work and family. Parents are being forced to \nchoose between paying for health care and education for their children, \nfor instance, and spending quality time with them so they can be happy \nand succeed. The Federal Government's policies need to support efforts \nto strengthen families as well as efforts to realize the American \nDream.\n  I do not believe, however, that S. 4, the so-called ``Family Friendly \nWorkplace Act,'' is an appropriate response to the problems facing \nworking families. While the title of the bill sounds benign enough, the \nconsequences will be detrimental to all working people and to working \nparents in particular. Parents could end up with less control over \ntheir work schedule and less money to pay for raising their families. \nThe paycheck reduction act might be a more appropriate name.\n  This legislation purports to allow working people the flexibility to \nchoose between overtime pay and compensatory time off or flexible \ncredit hours and replaces the 40-hour work week with an 80-hour 2 week \nwork period, with hours to be agreed upon by the employers and the \nemployees. Each of these provisions will have serious adverse \nconsequences for working families.\n  The most serious concern is that employees would not, in fact, be \ngiven a choice. Employers would favor an employee who consistently \nchose comptime over overtime when assigning overtime hours. The \natmosphere in the workplace might lead employees to believe that their \njobs depended on their choosing comptime instead of overtime, or to \nwork 60 hours in a busy week and 20 hours in a slow week regardless of \nthe needs of the family.\n  Overtime pay is a significant source of income for many American \nfamilies. Thousands of families pay for food, shelter, education and \nretirement by earning overtime at time-and-a-half. With the growing \nincome gap between the rich and poor, and with the middle class working \nharder than ever working Americans have little room to give on wages. \nIf S. 4 results in the end of overtime, it will mark the end of many \npeople's ability to provide for their children and to remain part of \nthe American middle class.\n  The 40-hour work week is a basic protection for workers. We talk \nabout wanting to strengthen the family unit, eliminate single parent \nfamilies, and provide important parental supports so that parents can \ncare for their children.\n  If an employee has to work 65 hours one week and 15 hours the next, \ntheir schedule is going to dictate chaos for the whole family. Imagine \nif your mom was home early one week and then not home for dinner at all \nthe next. Obtaining decent child care, already difficult for many \nparents, could become even harder due to the erratic work schedule and \nodd hours of a mother or father working 80 hours in two weeks. Without \nreal employee choice, the 80-hour work week could spell disaster for a \nfamily.\n  While there are some provisions in the legislation to prevent \nemployers from forcing employees to choose compensatory time instead of \novertime or to work excessive hours one week, these provisions are weak \nand insufficient to protect employees. I and my staff have met with \nmany employers from Illinois who are good employers, just trying to \nmake their businesses work better and their employee's lives better. I \npoint out, however, that while Illinois may have many ideal employers, \nthere are currently overtime abuses across the country. Abuses that the \nLabor Department is unable to enforce due to the sheer number of them \nand the lack of resources in the Department.\n  A Wall Street Journal article from June of last year cites as \nconservative a study that estimates workers are cheated out of $19 \nbillion a year in overtime pay. If employers are not paying their \nworkers earned overtime, why should we believe that they will allow \nthem to freely choose between comptime and overtime. Expanding the \nopportunities for abuse does not seem prudent.\n  There are additional concerns that even where comptime is freely \nchosen, employees will be able to take their compensatory time off when \nthey need it. Under the current language, a company who found it \ninconvenient to give comptime when a parent requested\n\n[[Page S4513]]\n\ntime off, could refuse the comptime request. There is also concern that \nfor the purposes of unemployment and pension compensation, comptime \nwill not be counted in the same manner as overtime pay, thus leaving \nthe employee with less lifetime benefits. This means that as parents \nand grandparents retire, they are less likely to be self sufficient and \nmore likely to rely on their families.\n  There are many options available to employers wishing to create \nfamily friendly flexibility in their workplaces, including the \nflexibility to create both flextime and compressed work schedules \nprograms that allow workers and employers to create family friendly \nschedules. There are many legislative options as well, including \nexpansion of the Family and Medical Leave Act. These are initiatives \nthat provide flexibility without opening the door to abuses.\n  The 40-hour work week and the right to overtime were not instituted \nat the whim of Congress. These are rights that the working people of \nAmerica fought for for over 100 years. Blood was shed and people died \nin the struggle to create a work week in which people could see \ndaylight, see their children, and build their communities. We should \nnot take lightly efforts to eradicate the victories of America's \nworking men and women, victories that have strengthened America's \nfamilies. I urge my colleagues to support America's working families by \nvoting no on S. 4 and no on cloture.\n  Mr. President, this legislation reduces pay, cuts benefits, and \neliminates worker options all under the guise of flexibility.\n  If you think about it for a minute, when you have a choice that only \ngoes in one direction, that is not flexibility. That is coercion. And \nthat is what this legislation allows.\n  Employees will not be able to freely choose whether or not they want \nto take overtime, or to take comptime. That will be up to the employer.\n  Under this legislation, the employer gets to choose not only when an \nemployee can use comptime but who gets to use comptime. So an employer \ncould theoretically choose to give favored employees the benefits of \nthe flexibility they need and not offer the same options to someone \nthey didn't like quite as much.\n  Add to that the fact that the benefits that employees receive with \nregard to their pensions and other retirement benefits are calculated \nbased on hours worked and it is possible that under this legislation \nretirement benefits would wind up being cut. This is another flaw of \nthis legislation that is hidden under the guise of flexibility.\n  Add to that also the fact that S. 4 is the Paycheck Reduction Act. \nClearly an employer could decide that an employee will not have \novertime, and many people--15 percent of manufacturing workers in this \ncountry for instance--right now depend on overtime in order to meet the \nfamily bills, in order to provide for their children. That option would \nbe gone for many working families under this legislation. Employees \ncould wind up having their overtime pay cut in favor of what is called \ncomptime or flexible credit hours.\n  Again, choice going in one direction is coercion.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this legislation fails, I think, the test of \ngood legislation because it does not give employees the ability to \nplan. The sponsors say this legislation is intended to give workers the \nflexibility to plan their lives, and the like.\n  In fact, under this legislation the employer could say to a given \nworker, ``This week you work 50 hours, and next week you work 30 hours. \nAnd that makes up the 80 hours, and I don't have to do anything else \nfor you.'' If that person has a child in day care, or if that person \ndoesn't want to split up their work week so they can plan their \nactivities they are out of luck. If they wind up putting in 50 or 60 \nhours in 1 week and only 20 or 30 the next, if an individual is \ndisrupted by this schedule, if their personal life is disrupted, this \nlegislation does not provide any protections for them. It only provides \nfor protections against disruption for the employer.\n  So, if this legislation wants to be called the Family Friendly \nWorkplace Act, I would actually suggest it be amended to be called the \nAdams Family Friendly Workplace Act because that is the only family \nthat this legislation is friendly to.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation, and I oppose \ncloture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today because yesterday I \nintroduced the Baucus-Kerrey-Landrieu substitute amendment to the \ncomptime bill. This amendment will give working men and women the \nchoice between earning overtime pay or taking that time off to spend \nwith their families.\n  As I travel around my State, I get the chance to meet with a lot of \ndecent, hard-working people. In Montana, we know how to put in an \nhonest day's work. And in exchange for that work, we ask only for an \nhonest day's pay.\n  But lately, that pay isn't stretching as far as it used to. That \nmeans working longer hours, and sometimes holding down two jobs. \nWhether it is a single-parent household, or a home where both parents \nhave to work, people are finding less and less time for their families.\n  Mothers and fathers are finding themselves caught in a costly \njuggling act, where they are trying to balance the demands of their \nwork with the needs of their families.\n  I believe that this trend has very serious consequences on our \nfamilies and our society as a whole. I know most of the Senators in \nthis body agree with me.\n  As our society changes, so must our labor laws. They must reflect the \nneeds of our current work force.\n  And that is why I offered this amendment. Because America's working \nmen and women need flexibility in their jobs--so they can spend more \ntime with their families.\n  And that is what S. 4, in its current form, proposes to do. \nRegrettably, I believe this legislation takes the wrong approach.\n  Under the current bill, mothers and fathers do not have the final say \nin how their overtime will be used. Their hands are tied by the \ndecisions of their employer.\n  Under my amendment, if a worker puts in overtime, he or she can be \npaid time and a half, just as the law stands now. Or if that person \nwants, he or she can take that payment in the form of vacation--an hour \nand a half for every hour of overtime. Quite simply, workers can choose \nmoney or time, and not be penalized for their choice.\n  This choice would allow a parent the flexibility to attend their \nchild's soccer game. Or it would let that worker earn a little extra \nmoney for Christmas presents.\n  Under the changes proposed in Senator Ashcroft's bill, the employer \nhas the last word. Mothers and fathers could find their employer \ndeciding whether they get time off or whether they get overtime pay. \nAnd I believe that is wrong.\n  It is our duty to protect America's workers. When it comes to the \nchoice between comptime and time off, we need to make sure the employee \nhas the last choice.\n  We have a tremendous opportunity to do something great for America's \nworking men and women. We have a chance to give our families a powerful \ntool in the struggle to find balance between work and family.\n  They're not asking for much. They simply want an honest day's pay for \nan honest day's work. They also want a little time to spend with their \nfamilies.\n  The American people have made it clear to us that flexibility and \nchoice are what they need. Under my amendment, that flexibility, and \nthat choice, are what they will get.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me, and vote in favor of this amendment \nwhen it comes to the Senate floor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am voting for cloture for the Family-\nFriendly Workplace Act because I believe that it has the potential to \nallow workers around the country the flexibility to spend more time \nwith their families. This legislation will give employees the \nflexibility of taking time-and-a-half off in lieu of receiving time-\nand-a-half pay for any overtime hours worked. In addition, the employee \nwill also have the option of working out a biweekly work program with \nhis or her employer or using flexible credit hours. All of these \noptions are currently available to Federal employees and receive high \npraise from the employees who choose to participate.\n  While I think the principles behind this bill are sound and important \nfor\n\n[[Page S4514]]\n\nthe American worker, I also believe it is important to ensure that the \nchoice to participate in the program is left to the employee. Without \nthis assurance, the employee will have gained nothing.\n  For this reason, I have expressed my concern that the coercion \nlanguage contained in this bill be strong enough to deter potential \nabuses of the law. I am supportive of the managers' amendment which \nestablishes a similar level of penalties for employers who coerce \nemployees to accept the compensatory time, biweekly work program, or \nflexible credit hours. This amendment, would essentially double the \npenalties for an employer who coerced an employee to take any of these \noptions.\n  In addition to this change, I have filed two amendments Nos. 254 and \n255, that would establish additional penalties for employers who \ncontinue to abuse the intent of this law. If an employer is found \nguilty of a second offense of coercion, my amendment would triple the \npenalties for that employer. While I believe that most employers will \nwork with their employees to establish mutually beneficial work \nprograms, I believe it is important to establish strong penalties for \nthose employers who may abuse the system.\n  With appropriate protections for the employee, I believe the Family-\nFriendly Workplace Act will benefit hundreds of workers and families \naround the country.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains? We are prepared to \nyield back. I think we have had excellent statements that have been \nmade by our two colleagues and friends.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes and ten seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will withhold the time, if the proponents of \nlegislation want to yield back.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I think I have the right to close.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield back our time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will very brief.\n  All of the arguments that have been given here against the Family \nFriendly Workplace Act are based on one fact: that an employer who is a \nreal SOB is not going to give his or her employees the rights created \nin this bill.\n  Why deny the 99.9 percent of the employees in this Nation who have \ngood employers the ability to work these things out with their \nemployers?\n  So all of the arguments against S. 4 are based on one thing; that \nemployers will not follow the provisions contained in the bill. The \npoint is, Mr. President, that S. 4 contains provisions that will \nprotect American workers. Since the bill does contain these \nprotections, and 99.9 percent of employees work for good employers, it \nis completely unfair to deny all of the rest of the employees in the \ncountry the ability to participate in comptime, flex-time and bi-weekly \nwork schedules.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the committee \n     amendment to Calendar No. 32, S. 4, the Family Friendly \n     Workplace Act of 1997:\n         Trent Lott, John Ashcroft, Susan M.

On this vote, the yeas \nare 53, the nays are 47. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and \nsworn not having voted in the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, might we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If I can have the attention of the Senators in \nthe Chamber, if will they take their conversations outside, I would \nappreciate it. The Senator from Georgia has the floor. He is due your \nattention.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I make the \nfollowing remarks.\n  The people of America want flextime. Working women, mothers and \nfathers need the same flexible work schedules and comptime choices that \nGovernment workers, salaried workers, bosses and boardroom executives \nhave enjoyed for decades. I am particularly struck that, since 1978, \nGovernment workers have enjoyed what this legislation would provide \nother workers in the private sector.\n  I remember when I came here it was important that there be \ncongressional accountability, that the Congress operate under the same \nlaws as the businesses and people of the country. I think that is \napplicable here, too. If Government workers can enjoy these benefits, \nthen private sector employees ought to as well.\n  The Family Friendly Workplace Act is a matter of fairness to the \nworkers of America. It is a high priority of the Republican leadership, \nand we intend to continue to press this case both here in the Senate \nand before the American people. A number of people on the other side, \nincluding the White House, have said both publicly and privately they \nwant to get a bill. An op-ed, or editorial, in today's Wall Street \nJournal by the executive director of the Democratic Leadership Council \nurges passage of the bill. That appeared Thursday, May 15, 1997: \n``Comptime's Time Has Come.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 15, 1997]\n\n                       Comp Time's Time Has Come\n\n                           (By Chuck Alston)\n\n       For a fresh example of why voters think Washington doesn't \n     get it, look no further than the partisan standoff over \n     overtime compensation.\n       Federal law now requires employers to pay most hourly \n     workers time-and-a-half for all work beyond 40 hours a week. \n     The Senate, following the House's lead, is now debating \n     legislation that would permit employers to give workers the \n     choice of taking so-called compensatory time off (at the \n     time-and-a-half rate) instead of overtime pay.\n       The concept is enormously popular, and for good reason. The \n     Fair Labor Standards Act which must be amended to allow comp \n     time, was designed in 1938 for the male manufacturing work \n     force of the Depression era. Today, both parents generally \n     must work to keep their family in the middle class. Even with \n     squeezed family budgets, some workers would welcome extra \n     time off to take care of a sick child or parent, attend a \n     Little League game or just catch up with home life. According \n     to the independent Families and Work Institute, 40% of \n     workers say they can't get their chores done because of their \n     job; 35% complain of a lack of personal time; 24% complain \n     they lack time for their families. No wonder a 1995 Penn, \n     Schoen & Berland poll for the business-backed Labor Policy \n     Association found that three-fourths of all Americans favor \n     giving employees a choice between overtime pay and comp time.\n\n[[Page S4515]]\n\n       Unfortunately, politics as usual could kill this attempt to \n     help harried families. President Clinton has called for comp-\n     time legislation, but has threatened to veto the bill the \n     House has passed, largely on the grounds that it does not go \n     far enough to protect workers' interests. Unions have made \n     opposition a litmus test for Democrats, making a yes vote \n     suicidal for members who want to protect their labor PAC \n     donations (a big reason only 13 House Democrats voted yes). \n     Democratic opponents have cast the House bill as the \n     ``paycheck reduction act.'' And Republicans have appeared \n     gleeful at the thought of jamming legislation down labor's \n     throat, a payback for unions $35 million soft money campaign \n     last year for Democrats. In sum, hardly the atmospherics for \n     compromise.\n       Nonetheless, this effort to modernize labor law shouldn't \n     be allowed to run aground on partisan shoals. The tools and \n     protection workers need in the new economy are different from \n     those of the Industrial Era. Employers and employees alike \n     will benefit from public policy that supports two-parent \n     families by giving them the flexibility to balance family and \n     income needs.\n       The legislation has won wide backing from business groups: \n     not only because it could lower labor costs by cutting cash \n     out the door for payroll and payroll taxes, but also because \n     smart companies understand how flexibility can help their \n     efforts to recruit and retain top-notch employees. As a \n     recent Working Woman article on workplace flexibility \n     programs at Xerox Corp. noted, ``In the end, researchers \n     found that work/life initiatives were not just a feelgood \n     answer to personal time conflicts, but a solution to business \n     problems--and one that could provide companies with a \n     competitive edge.'' A comp-time law would give companies yet \n     another flexibility option to offer employees, but without \n     mandating it.\n       At the same time, we must also make sure workers' interests \n     are protected. In the real world, some companies will \n     certainly try to maneuver workers into taking comp time \n     instead of overtime, or start offering overtime work only to \n     people who will take comp time instead of pay. As a former \n     newspaper reporter, I'm well aware of the lengths to which \n     managers will go to avoid paying overtime. That is why any \n     legislation must ensure that comp time is truly voluntary. It \n     should bar employers from coercing employees to take comp \n     time, give employees reasonable latitude over when they can \n     take the time off or cash out their accumulated hours, \n     protect part-time, seasonal and other especially vulnerable \n     employees, and prevent employers from discriminating unfairly \n     in determining who gets comp time.\n       The House bill's five-year sunset provision was a good \n     compromise. If employers aren't honoring these protections, \n     or the law proves so overly complex that employers don't take \n     advantage of it, we can always revise it or return to the \n     status quo ante.\n       The president and House Republicans aren't that far apart \n     on comp-time legislation. The Senate could point the way \n     toward compromise, based on this foundation: Republicans must \n     understand that tinkering with one of the labor movement's \n     greatest accomplishments--the 40-hour work week--naturally \n     generates suspicion in Democratic quarters. And they \n     shouldn't automatically resist every attempt to bolster \n     worker protection. Meanwhile, Democrats who rightly seek to \n     protect workers must understand that they can, and may well, \n     doom comp time with overly complex conditions. In the end, \n     the last thing anyone should want is a law so complicated \n     that employers, especially in small businesses, choose not to \n     offer employees any option at all for fear of being sued.\n       The irony of the debate is that the comp-time option has \n     been available in the public sector since 1985. To be sure, \n     it won't work everywhere in the private sector, but it's time \n     go give companies--and their workers--the choice.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, now is the time to get serious about \nthis, but it is your move. I urge the White House to get with the \nsponsor of S. 4, and let us find out where the common ground is. \nSenators Jeffords, DeWine, and Ashcroft are ready to work with you, Mr. \nPresident, as they always have been. It is your move.\n  I hope Senators who voted against cloture, cutting off debate, will \nthink about whose side they are on. Are you on the side of those who \nalready have flextime but want to deny others the same rights? Or are \nyou on the side of the working women and men who do not have these \noptions? The only workers who are denied flextime today are hourly \nworkers: the secretaries, sales clerks, mechanics, factory workers in \nour country. They are the folks who get up early, punch in the time \nclock, and work hard to make ends meet. It is time that we were on the \nside of the millions of working class people in America who are denied \nthese choices. I repeat these choices that Federal workers already \nhave. Single moms, two-paycheck families need flextime. Just ask them \nand they will tell you. Let us give working parents a helping hand in \nthe vital job they are doing.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, will the Senator withhold that request \nfor a moment?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I withhold my request for a moment.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Parliamentary inquiry. What is the time situation \nbetween now and the time we go to the Feinstein amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have morning business until 11. We have \nalready cut into that substantially. About half of it is remaining.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. How much time remains and who is supposed to receive it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic side--the Democratic leader has \n12 minutes, the Senator from Wyoming has 8 minutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. COVERDELL.

Mr. President, I am sorry we have moved into some of our \ntime, but I will be very brief and cover the points I want to make. I \nam real pleased today to be joined by three of my associates in support \nof H.R. 1122, the Partial-Birth Abortion Act. I am going to be very \nbrief. It has been talked about to a great extent. Everything, \nprobably, has been said. But there is one thing that sticks in my mind \nthat I think is important about this discussion and this vote that will \ncome up.\n  We did this last year, you will recall. It passed by significant \nnumbers in the Senate. President Clinton vetoed the bill that was \npassed in the 104th Congress. I just want to mention the reasons that \nhe gave for vetoing the bill.\n  First, he said it was only necessary in ``a small number of \ncompelling cases.'' The fact is that is not factual. The fact is that \nhas changed. The fact is, there are facts that show, for instance, in \nNew Jersey, that there were more than 1,500, just in the one State. So \nthat reason for vetoing is not true. It is not true.\n  The second one was to protect the mother from ``serious injury to her \nhealth.'' The fact is, in the vast majority of cases when the partial-\nbirth technique is used, it is for elective purposes, and that, also, \nhas been shown to be true.\n  Third, the President said, to avoid the mother ``losing the ability \nto ever bear further children.'' The facts have now shown it is never \nnecessary to safeguard the mother's health or fertility; that there are \nother procedures that are available. I think these are compelling, \ncompelling arguments. These are the reasons the President vetoed the \nbill that have subsequently been found not to be factual.\n  I yield time to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my full support for \nthe Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. I am proud to be an original \ncosponsor of this important legislation.\n  I thank my distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator \nSantorum, for his leadership on this issue.\n  This debate, of course, is about abortion, which I strongly oppose. \nBut it is about much more than that. It is about doing what is right. \nIt is about values.\n  And it is about a civilized society standing against a heinous \nprocedure that is used to kill a mostly born child--a procedure that, \nas even some advocates of abortion rights have conceded, comes \ndangerously close to murder.\n  The debate about abortion raged in America long before I began my \nservice in the Senate. It will continue long after the Senate votes on \nthis bill to ban one specific abortion procedure.\n  It will continue until America comes to grips with the moral crisis \nthat\n\n[[Page S4516]]\n\nmakes abortion just another sign of the times.\n  This debate itself may rise and fall, but my view on this matter is \nstraightforward--I believe America should ban partial-birth abortion \nbecause it is wrong.\n  For too long, our society has drifted too far from that simple \nconclusion. In this body--as in this country--we are adept at weighing \nand debating the pros and cons. We know how to balance competing \ninterests. We know how to strike compromises. But do we think often \nenough about the consequences of our actions?\n  I fear we have strayed from seeking straightforward answers to tough \nquestions. We have too often strayed from making public policy based \nsolely on what is right.\n  The vote we are about to cast is about banning a specific method of \nabortion. But the debate in which we are engaged is about larger \nquestions.\n  Have we become coarsened by a society that cheapens life--from our \nfailure to stop violence in our streets to our unwillingness to keep \nviolence from our television screens?\n  Have we come to accept what should never be acceptable--a society \nwhere drug use is termed recreational, and irresponsible behavior is \njust a sign of the times?\n  Have we lost the basis of a civil society? Are we no longer willing \nto stand up and say enough is enough?\n  Mr. President, I came to this Senate with a firm belief that we can \nmake a real difference for America's future. I have no doubt we can put \nour financial books in order--by cutting spending, cutting taxes, \ncutting regulations, and balancing the budget.\n  But can we put our values in order? If we, as leaders, fail to do \nwhat is right and fail to stop what is wrong, will we really have left \na better America for our children and our grandchildren?\n  I think not.\n  For two centuries, America has rested on a value system anchored by \npersonal responsibility. Our society has always been underpinned by \nrespect for others, respect for self, faith in God and family, and \nhelping those in need. We have always held these values important--\nworth struggling for and worth fighting for.\n  People of good character stood up for these values in their own \nlives, and in their communities. They expected their leaders to stand \nup for them as well.\n  Mr. President, I have every confidence that this body will vote to \noutlaw this gruesome procedure because the goodness of our people will \ndemand it. Just as families across America wake up every day and try to \ndo the right thing, so they are expecting their leaders to do the same.\n  The vote we will cast on this issue is important. It goes to the \nheart of who we are as a people and who we want to be as a Nation.\n  I hope we will all take pause, in this body and throughout America, \nto reflect on what type of society we have become and what type of \nsociety we want to leave for our children and grandchildren.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the 12 minutes \nremaining for the Democratic side be divided 5 minutes to Senator \nBingaman and 5 minutes to the Senator from Arkansas, who will share it \nwith the Senator from Georgia, Senator Cleland, and 2 minutes to the \nSenator from Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Reserving the right to object, is there time left on our \noriginal 10 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes and 42 seconds.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I wonder if it would be possible for us to go ahead and \nfinish and then do it as the Senator described?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Is the Senator objecting to the request?\n  Mr. THOMAS. No, sir, I am asking that we finish the 10 minutes we \nwere allocated and then transfer to you to do it in the method that you \nasked.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, in that I only have 3 minutes \nremaining, I am going to put aside my written remarks and, frankly, \nspeak from the heart.\n  I rise today, first, to thank Senator Santorum for his leadership on \nthis issue but, more important, to stand with those who stand for the \nprinciple of life today on this very important bill. I have \nconsistently supported this principle and have tried to listen with \nsome care and compassion to those who advocate the other view. I heard \nthem say things like, ``Let's make abortion safe, legal, and rare,'' \nexcept for the fact that when it comes to doing anything to make it \nrare, I seldom see them helping us in this endeavor. Conversely, I have \ntried very hard to reach out on issues of education and prevention to \ntry to make abortion rare.\n  Today presents us with an opportunity not to end abortion but simply \nto ban one incredibly gruesome procedure and to make all unborn \nAmerican children safe from this procedure.\n  It is clear, because of testimony that has come out, that the \npartial-birth abortion is anything but rare in this country, and today \nwe need to make it impossible.\n  I refer to the statement by the Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, a \nman much admired for his service in health care in this country, who \nsaid:\n\n       Partial-birth abortion is never medically necessary to \n     protect the mother's health or her future fertility. On the \n     contrary, this procedure can pose a significant threat to \n     both.\n\n  As I ponder partial-birth abortion, I come to the conclusion that \nAmericans must be bigger than this procedure performed on the most \ninnocent among us. We are bigger than this, and I believe that \nAmericans today in the United States will rise above this procedure to \nmake it unlawful and to contribute towards the common desire of those \nwho are pro-life and pro-choice to make abortion rare.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bingaman pertaining to the introduction of S. 748 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SMITH of Oregon).

Mr. President, yesterday Mr. Leahy and several of my \ncolleagues spoke about judicial confirmations. Let me make a few \nadditional points. First, we are experiencing a record slowdown in \nconfirming judges. Last year, only 17 Federal judges were confirmed, \nand not a single judge for a court of appeals. This year, the process \nhas gotten even worse--only two judges have been confirmed, and the \nyear is almost half over. Indeed, at our current pace, with only 5 \njudges likely to be confirmed a year, and an average of more than 50 \nretiring, we would have no federal judges at all in 20 years. \nLiterally, an empty bench.\n  Second, we need these judges, both to prosecute and sentence violent \ncriminals and to prevent more backlogs in civil cases. This is about \njustice--it shouldn't be about politics. Don't take my word on this, \nask Chief Justice Rehnquist. He says ``filling judicial vacancies is \ncrucial to the fair and effective administration of justice.'' Chief \nJustice Rehnquist is right.\n  Or ask Judge George Kazen from the Southern District of Texas. He is \nthe subject of a front page article in today's Washington Post with the \nheadline ``Cases Pile Up as Judgeships Remain Vacant.'' He is hearing a \ndramatic increase in criminal cases now\n\n[[Page S4517]]\n\nbecause we're cracking down on illegal immigration and drug smuggling \nin his border district. He desperately wants and needs help. But we \nhaven't helped. Instead, the Senate has held up a nominee for his \ndistrict for almost 2 years. I ask unanimous consent to print this \narticle in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (see exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. President, third, inaction now can only make matters worse. If we \ndon't start moving judges, some Senators might feel compelled to put a \nhold on all other legislative business. Or the President could be \nforced to make recess appointments to the Federal bench. Of course, no \none wants either of these things, including me. But if we don't confirm \nnominees through the normal process, I am afraid this is what could \nhappen.\n  Mr. President, let's breathe life back into the confirmation process. \nLet's vote on the nominees who already have been approved by the \nJudiciary Committee, and let's set a timetable for future hearings on \npending judges. Let's fulfill our constitutional responsibilities; \njustice demands that at a minimum. I thank you, and I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 15, 1997]\n\n               Cases Pile Up as Judgeships Remain Vacant\n\n                         (By Sue Anne Pressley)\n\n       Laredo, TX.--The drug and illegal immigrant cases keep \n     coming. No sooner does Chief U.S. District Judge George Kazen \n     clear one case than a stack of new cases piles up. He takes \n     work home at night, on weekends.\n       ``It's like a tidal wave,'' Kazen said recently. ``As soon \n     as I finish 25 cases per month, the next 25 are on top of me \n     and then you've got the sentence reports you did two months \n     before. There is no stop, no break at all, year in and year \n     out, here they come.\n       ``We've already got more than we can say grace over down \n     here,'' he said.\n       This is what happens to a federal judge on the southern \n     border of the United States when Washington cracks down on \n     illegal immigration and drug smuggling. It is a situation \n     much aggravated by the fact that the Senate in Washington has \n     left another federal judgeship in this district vacant for \n     two years, one of 72 vacancies on federal district courts \n     around the country.\n       As Border Patrol officers and other federal agents swarm \n     this southernmost region of Texas along the Mexican border in \n     ever-increasing numbers, Judge Kazen's docket has grown and \n     grown. He has suggested, so far unsuccessfully, that a \n     judgeship in Houston be reassigned to the Rio Grande Valley \n     to help cope.\n       In Washington, where the laws and policies were adopted \n     that has made Kazen's life so difficult, the Senate has made \n     confirmation of federal judges a tedious process, often \n     fraught with partisan politics. In addition to the 72 federal \n     district court vacancies (the trial level), there are 25 \n     circuit court vacancies (the appellate level) and two vacant \n     international trade court judgeships across the country, \n     leaving unfilled 99 positions, or 11 percent of the federal \n     judiciary. Twenty-six nominations from President Clinton are \n     pending, according to Jeanne Lopatto, spokeswoman for the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee, which considers nominations for \n     recommendation to the full Senate for confirmation.\n       Of those 99 vacancies, 24 qualify as judicial emergencies, \n     meaning the positions have been vacant more than 18 months, \n     according to David Sellers of the Administrative Office of \n     the U.S. Courts. Two of the emergencies exit in Texas, \n     including the one in Kazen's southern district.\n       Lopatto said the thorough investigation of each nominee is \n     a time-consuming process. But political observes say \n     Republicans, who run the Senate, are in no hurry to approve \n     candidates submitted by a Democratic president. The pinch is \n     particularly painful here in border towns. The nominee for \n     Brownsville, in Kazen's district, has been awaiting approval \n     since 1995. Here in Laredo, Kazen's criminal docket has \n     increased more than 20 percent over last year.\n       ``We have a docket,'' he said, ``that can be tripled \n     probably at the drop of a hat. * * * The Border Patrol \n     people, the Customs people at the [international] bridges \n     will tell you, they don't catch a tenth of who is going \n     through. The more checkpoints you man, the more troops you \n     have at the bridges, will necessarily mean more stops and \n     more busts.''\n       And many more arrests are expected, the result of an \n     unprecedented focus on policing the U.S.-Mexico border. \n     Earlier this year, Clinton unveiled a $367 million program \n     for the Southwest for fiscal 1998, beginning Oct. 1, that \n     includes hiring 500 new Border Patrol agents, 277 inspectors \n     for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, 96 Drug \n     Enforcement Administration agents and 70 FBI agents.\n       In Kazen's territory, the number of Border Patrol agents \n     already has swollen dramatically, from 347 officers assigned \n     to the Laredo area in fiscal 1993 to 411 officers in \n     fiscal 1996. More tellingly, in 1993, agents in the Laredo \n     sector arrested more than 82,000 people on cocaine, \n     marijuana and illegal immigration charges. By 1996, \n     arrests had soared to nearly 132,000, according to data \n     supplied by the INS.\n       All of which is keeping Kazen and the other judges here \n     hopping. ``I don't know what the answer is,'' said U.S. \n     District Judge John Rainey, who has been acting as ``a \n     circuit rider'' as he tries to keep Kazen out in Laredo from \n     his post in Victoria, Tex. ``I certainly don't see it easing \n     up anytime soon. There still seems to be such a demand for \n     drugs in this country, and that's what causes people to bring \n     them in. Until society changes, we won't see any changes down \n     here.''\n       In a letter to Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) in February, \n     Kazen outlined the need for a new judge in the Laredo or \n     McAllen division, rather than in Houston, where a vacancy was \n     recently created when then-Chief Judge Norman Black assumed \n     senior status. ``The `border' divisions of our court--\n     Brownsville, McAllen and Laredo--have long borne the burden \n     of one of the heaviest criminal dockets in the country, and \n     the processing of criminal cases involves special pressures, \n     including those generated by the Speedy Trial Act,'' he \n     wrote.\n       On a recent typical day, Kazen said, he sentenced six \n     people on drug charges and listened to an immigration case. \n     His cases tend to involve marijuana more often than cocaine, \n     he said.\n       ``The border is a transshipment area,'' he said. ``The fact \n     is, a huge amount of contraband somehow crosses the Texas-\n     Mexican border, people walking through where the river is \n     low, and there are hundreds and hundreds of miles of \n     unpatrolled ranchland.\n       ``In some cases,'' Kazen continued, ``we're seeing a \n     difference in the kind of defendant. We're almost never \n     seeing the big shots--we're seeing the soldiers. Once in a \n     while, we'll see a little bigger fish, but we're dealing with \n     very, very smart people. We see some mom-and-pop stuff, too. \n     There was a guy who came before me who had been in the Army \n     umpteen years, and he needed the money, he was going \n     bankrupt, so he did this 600-pound marijuana deal. He said he \n     stood to pick up $50,000, and now he's facing five to 40 \n     years.\n       ``We see kids 18 and 19 years old,'' Kazen said. ``We see \n     pregnant women. We see disabled people in wheel-chairs. This \n     is very, very tempting stuff.'' In Washington, the argument \n     over court vacancies continues. On April 30, Attorney General \n     Janet Reno told the Judiciary Committee, ``Chief judges are \n     calling my staff to report the prospect of canceling court \n     sittings and suspending civil calendars for lack of judges, \n     and to ask when they can expect help. This committee must act \n     now to send this desperately needed help.''\n       In remarks yesterday to the Federal Judges Association \n     meeting in Washington, Reno warned that ``the number [of \n     vacancies] is growing.''\n       ``As you are no doubt aware,'' Reno told the judges, ``the \n     level of contentiousness on the issue of filling judicial \n     vacancies has unfortunately increased in recent times.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/15/senate-section/article/S4516-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4517-S4575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION BAN ACT OF 1997\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to offer a substitute amendment \nto H.R. 1122, which, as I said, is cosponsored by Senators Boxer and \nMoseley-Braun. The amendment we offer is presented as an alternative to \nthe House-passed bill on so-called partial-birth abortions and as an \nalternative to the Daschle substitute as well.\n  My colleagues and I offer this amendment for one reason: We very much \nbelieve that any legislation put forward by Congress that restricts \naccess to abortions or to a particular medical procedure must be \nconstitutional and must contain sufficient protections for a woman's \nhealth. The Feinstein-Boxer-Moseley-Braun bill provides that protection \nwhile instituting a ban on post-viability abortions similar to that in \nthe Daschle bill.\n  Our bill does three things.\n  First, it prohibits all abortions after a fetus has become viable or \nable to live independently outside of the mother's womb.\n  Second, it provides an exception for cases where, in the medical \njudgment of a physician, an abortion is necessary to preserve the life \nof the mother or to prevent serious adverse health consequences to the \nmother.\n  And third, it provides stringent civil penalties for physicians \nperforming post-viability abortions in the absence of compelling \nmedical reasons.\n  The penalties are limited to the physician and include for the first \noffense a fine of $100,000, and referral to a State licensing board for \npossible suspension of the medical license.\n  For the second offense, the fine would be up to $250,000, with \nreferral to the State licensing board for possible revocation of \nlicense.\n  There is no health exception in H.R. 1122, known as the Santorum \nbill. And we do not believe that the health exception provided in the \nDaschle bill is sufficient, nor do we believe that it will meet the \nconstitutional test.\n  Let me begin by speaking of my opposition to the House bill. And let \nme begin by pleading with anyone listening to this debate to read the \nbill--read H.R. 1122. It is short. It is easy to read. I want to quote \nfrom page 2 of that bill to illustrate what this bill does.\n  Let me begin on line 9:\n\n       Any physician who, in or affecting interstate or foreign \n     commerce, knowingly performs a partial-birth abortion and \n     thereby kills a human fetus shall be fined under this title \n     or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.\n\n  The bill refers to a ``partial-birth abortion,'' which is a term not \nexisting in medical literature or medical texts. So let us find out \nwhat a partial-birth abortion is. And we turn to line 19 of page 2 for \nthat description:\n\n       As used in this section, the term ``partial-birth \n     abortion'' means an abortion in which the person performing \n     the abortion partially vaginally delivers a living fetus \n     before killing the fetus and completing the delivery.\n\n  The issue here is clear. We heard yesterday on this floor a vivid \ndescription of a procedure, a procedure known as ``intact D'' \nNowhere in House Resolution 1122 are ``intact D'' or ``intact D'' \nor any medical procedure referred to. Instead, we have a term not \nexistent in medical science anywhere called ``partial-birth abortion.''\n  Now, anyone who is familiar with a woman's physiology knows that this \nterm can be used to deny second-trimester and third-trimester \nabortions--virtually, I believe, all of them.\n  If the concern of the authors of this legislation were truly in fact \nto prohibit or ban one specific procedure, why would they not spell out \nwhat the procedure is in legislative language just as they have \ngraphically spelled out the procedure on the Senate floor? Why? Why not \ndo that?\n  I believe there is a reason why they did not do that. And the reason \nis, that I sincerely believe that this bill is meant to do much more, \nmuch more than simply ban a procedure known as intact D or intact \nD I believe that this bill is essentially a Trojan horse, a Trojan \nhorse in the sense that it is not at all what it seems to be on the \noutside.\n\n  If you look on the inside, which means opening the page of the bill, \nyou will see that this bill is the first major legislative thrust to \nmake abortion in the United States of America illegal.\n  I stated yesterday on the floor that we are really a product of our \nlive's experiences. And my life's experiences that have caused me to be \nessentially pro-choice are essentially threefold.\n  The first, my days in college at Stanford University, days when I \nremember a bright young woman who committed suicide because she was \npregnant and abortion was illegal in the United States. And I also \nremember the passing of a plate in a college dormitory so that another \nfriend could go to Mexico for an abortion. I remember that well.\n  My second life experience was in the early 1960's at the California \nInstitution for Women, the women's prison in California for women \nconvicted of felonies, where I set sentences and granted paroles to \nwomen convicted of providing abortions. I remember this well because \nthe only way a case really came to the attention of the authorities was \neither through the morbidity or the mortality of the patient.\n  And I remember the graphic stories in those cumulative summaries that \nwere given to us prior to term setting, of what happened to women who \nwere victims of illegal abortions. And I remember that the women who \nprovided the abortions would leave and come back and commit the same \ncrime again because of the importunings of other women.\n  And the third graphic experience for me was becoming a grandmother \nand finding out that my daughter in her pregnancy had an unexpected, \nvery serious, potentially life-threatening problem, and realizing how \nsurprised I was not to know that this could happen in this day and age. \nBut it did happen.\n\n[[Page S4519]]\n\n  My story--my daughter's story--came out fine because today I have a \nbright-eyed and bushy-tailed and wonderful, light of my life, in the \nform of a 4\\1/2\\-year-old granddaughter by the name of Eileen.\n  But I learned that there can be unpredictable occurrences, and that \nwhen we legislate--in a piece of paper that becomes an abiding law \nenforced everywhere throughout the United States of America--we ought \nto legislate with the knowledge that human life and human experience \nhas many permutations that are unexpected and unanticipated.\n  I view H.R. 1122 as doing much, much more than banning a simple \nprocedure. That procedure is not mentioned anywhere in this piece of \nlegislation. But it does set up the basis for lawsuit after lawsuit \nagainst any physician that might practice and might perform a second-\ntrimester abortion. Every other type of abortion in some way has the \nhead of the fetus coming through the birth canal. And then the case is, \nat what point is that fetus still living or not living? And so I think \nit is a potentially very dangerous piece of legislation in that regard.\n  I mentioned yesterday that I basically do not believe that intact D \nor intact D should be used, that there are other forms of abortion. \nThat is my personal belief. And I believe that the AMA is on its way in \na medical venue of taking some steps to limit it. We all know we are \ntalking about less than 1 percent of all of the abortions that take \nplace in this country, in any event.\n  So the question is, what do we do? What kind of legislation do we \npresent that recognizes the exigencies, the human trials, the \ndifficulties that a woman can have?\n  Yesterday, I mentioned a young nurse; her name is Viki Wilson. When I \nwas a county supervisor and mayor, I worked with her mother, Susan \nWilson, who was a supervisor from Santa Clara County. Viki Wilson is a \nnurse, married to a doctor. In her 36th week she had a sonogram and she \nfound out she had a severely deformed baby with its brain outside its \nskull. She learned that the contractions she was having were actually \nseizures that the child was having and that the child was incompatible \nof sustaining life outside of the womb.\n  She went to a doctor and her doctor recommended the particular \nprocedure that is under siege here today, as the procedure, at that \nstage of her pregnancy, that would be most protective of her health. I \ncannot tell you whether it was or not. I am not a physician. There is \nonly one physician in this body who might know. Yet, we are going to \nlegislate, in a bill that is drafted to be so broad, that it can impact \nmuch more than one procedure.\n  The amendment that the three of us present to this body today, we \nbelieve, comports with Roe versus Wade. We believe it would not put in \njeopardy every second- and third-trimester abortion. We believe it \nwould prohibit every third-trimester abortion unless the life and the \nhealth, as defined by serious adverse health consequences to the \nmother, were at risk, and that this decision would be made by the \nphysician and the woman, which I think is the appropriate remedy for \nthis issue.\n  I think this is a very difficult debate because most people have not \nread the bill before the Senate, H.R. 1122. Most people really do not \nunderstand the whole panoply of human ills that can take place in a \npregnancy.\n  I believe the AMA, in the recent paper they have put forward, very \nclearly indicates they believe that, with few exceptions, this \nprocedure that is at question should not be used. However, they are \nnot--and I think rightly so--not ready to sacrifice the integrity of \nthe medical profession to say that no doctor, no matter what the \nsituation is, no matter what the physiology of the woman may be, no \nmatter that she may not be able to have another procedure, that she \nmight be adversely impacted healthwise, cannot, no matter what the \nsituation is, have this procedure as a remedy.\n  Mr. President, we present to you a bill that we believe is \nconstitutional, a bill that would ban all third-trimester abortions, \nunless the life and health of the woman, as defined as serious adverse \nhealth consequences, were threatened. The bill includes very strong \ncivil penalties, which we believe would be a substantial deterrent to \nthe performance of any third-trimester abortions unless there is a very \nserious medical need.\n  Mr. President, I notice my distinguished colleague, and I ask the \nSenator from Massachusetts how much time he desires.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would like 10 minutes, and I appreciate the courtesy, \nbut I expect, Mr. President, that we are perhaps alternating back and \nforth.\n  I see Senator DeWine, as well as Senator Santorum.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will do a unanimous-consent request and then be happy \nto let the Senator from Massachusetts speak.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Steven \nSchlesinger, a detailee on the Judiciary Committee, and Michelle \nKitchen, a member of my staff, be permitted privileges of the floor for \nthe duration of the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is unfortunate that the Republican \nleadership has chosen to force this debate on the same confrontational \nand unconstitutional legislation that President Clinton vetoed last \nyear, when reasonable and constitutional alternatives are so obviously \navailable. It is clear that the primary purpose of the Republican \nleaders is not to regulate late-term abortions, but to roll back the \nprotections for women guaranteed by the Supreme Court.\n  If the goal is to pass effective legislation, the sponsors of the \nSantorum bill know they must meet the constitutional requirments for \nprotecting of a woman's right to choose. President Clinton has made \nclear that he cannot and will not accept a ban on any procedure that \nrepresents the best hope for a woman to avoid serious risks to her \nhealth. The bill vetoed last year and the bill before us today are \nidentical, and they clearly fail to provide these needed protections \nfor women.\n  The Supreme Court rulings in the Roe and Casey decisions prohibit \nCongress and the States from imposing an ``undue burden'' on a woman's \nright to choose to have an abortion at any time up to the point where \nthe developing fetus reaches the stage of viability.\n  Governments can constitutionally limit abortions after the stage of \nviability, as long as the limitations contain exceptions to protect the \nlife and the health of the woman.\n  This bill flunks that clear constitutional test in two ways. It \nimposes an undue burden--a flat prohibition--on a woman's \nconstitutional right to an abortion before fetal viability. And it \nimpermissibly limits the right to an abortion after fetal viability, by \nexcluding any protection whatsoever for the woman's health.\n  Given the clear constitutional problems with this bill, it is fair to \nask, why do Republicans insist that we send it to the President, for \nanother certain veto, when reasonable alternatives are available.\n  In fact, there is little need for any Federal legislation in this \narea because 41 States already ban late-term abortions. Massachusetts \nhas prohibited these abortions except when the woman's life is in \ndanger or ``the continuation of the pregnancy would impose a \nsubstantial risk of grave impairment to the woman's physical or mental \nhealth.'' Many other States have similar restrictions. There is no \nevidence that the States are not enforcing their laws.\n  Supporters of the Republican bill also claim that the public and \nCongress were misled about the actual number of abortions performed by \nthe procedure that would be banned by their bill. But very few, if any, \nof us in the last Congress were misled about the facts. Only a few \nhundred of these procedures are performed after viability, and they are \nperformed in cases where the fetus cannot survive because of a severe \nmedical abnormality, or where there is a serious threat to the life or \nthe health of the woman.\n  It was clearly reported during last year's debate that the procedure \nwas also used before the stage of viability, and that the number of \nsuch cases was larger, probably amounting to several thousand a year. \nBut all of us were also\n\n[[Page S4520]]\n\naware that Congress cannot constitutionally ban the procedure at that \nstage.\n  We know that some doctors begin to use the particular procedure that \nwould be banned by the Republican bill at about 20 weeks of gestation, \nwhich is well before the time when a fetus has the capacity for \nsurvival outside the womb. Most authorities place the time of viability \nat 24 to 26 weeks in a normal pregnancy. According to the best \navailable statistics, 99 percent of all abortions are performed before \n20 weeks. Only about 1 percent of all abortions are performed after \nthat time, and two-thirds of those abortions are performed before the \n23d week.\n  This information is provided by the Alan Guttmacher Institute and \nused by the National Center for Health Statistics. It is the most \naccurate information available.\n  Even so, it is difficult to draw a sharp dividing line on the \nviability of a particular pregnancy. A great deal depends on the \nprenatel care the woman is receiving. Low-birth weight babies reach \nviability at later stages of pregnancy.\n  A further problem is that viability is to some extent a statistical \nconcept. At 21 weeks of a normal pregnancy, few if any fetuses can \nsurvive. At 23 weeks about 25 percent survive. At 26 weeks about 50 \npercent survive.\n  A physician's decision relies on best medical judgment, but it is \nhardly precise for a particular case. The real issue involves lives and \nthe health of women. The so-called partial-birth abortion bill would \nnot stop a single abortion. Instead, it would force women to use \nanother, possibly more dangerous procedure if they must terminate their \npregnancy to preserve their health.\n  Of course, the sponsors of this bill continue to argue that there are \nno circumstances in which a procedure banned by the bill is necessary \nto preserve a woman's health. And, even worse, some supporters don't \nseem to care. Mark Crutcher, president of Life Dynamics, an \nantiabortion organization based in Denton TX, told the Detroit Free \nPress that the bill is ``a scam being perpetrated by people on our side \nof the issue * * * for fund-raising purposes.''\n  It doesn't seem to matter to the proponents of this defective \nRepublican bill that women like Maureen Britell, Eileen Sullivan, \nCoreen Costello, Erica Fox, Vikki Stella, Tammy Watts, Viki Wilson, and \nothers will be forced to risk serious health consequences if this bill \nbecomes law.\n  Doctor after doctor has told us that this procedure may be necessary \nto preserve a woman's health. The American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists has said:\n\n       An intact D may be the best or most appropriate procedure \n     in a particular circumstance to save the life or preserve the \n     health of a woman, and only the doctor, in consultation with \n     the patient, based upon the woman's particular circumstances \n     can make this decision. The intervention of legislative \n     bodies into medical decisionmaking is inappropriate, ill-\n     advised, and dangerous.\n\n  Perhaps if the Republican men in Congress were the ones to get \npregnant, they would show more compassion for the women who find \nthemselves in these tragic circumstances.\n  Take the case of Coreen Costello. After consulting numerous medical \nexperts and doing everything possible to save her child, Coreen had the \nprocedure that would be banned by this legislation. Based on that \nexperience, she gave the following testimony to the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee last year:\n\n       I hope you can put aside your political differences, your \n     positions on abortion, and your party affiliations and just \n     try to remember us. We are the ones who know. We are the \n     families that ache to hold our babies, to love them, to \n     nurture them. We are the families who will forever have a \n     hole in our hearts. We are the families that had to choose \n     how our babies would die * * * please put a stop to this \n     terrible bill. Families like mine are counting on you.\n\n  I oppose this legislation. Instead, I stand with Coreen Costello and \nothers whose lives and health must be protected. The alternative \nproposed by Senator Snowe and Senator Daschle provides that protection, \nand so does the alternative proposed by Senator Feinstein, Senator \nBoxer and Senator Moseley-Braun. I intend to vote for these \nalternatives, because they respect the Constitution, and above all they \nrespect the right of women and their doctors to make these difficult \nand tragic decisions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. How much time is the Senator requesting?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for 15 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am happy to yield 15 minutes to the \nSenator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, let me say how proud I am to stand with my \ncolleague, my senior Senator from California, Senator Feinstein, and \nthe senior Senator from Illinois, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, who has \njust arrived on the floor, to speak in favor of the bill which really \naddresses an issue that the American people want addressed. It does so \nin a way that is constitutional. It does so in a way that is respectful \nof women and their families.\n\n  When we approach this issue, we have very strong feelings in the \napproach that is taken, in a sensitive way.\n  It is harmful legislation. It will harm women, will hurt women, will \nlead to women dying, will lead to women suffering infertility, \nsuffering paralysis, and all needlessly.\n  So what we have done in this legislation, which I am very proud of, \nis to basically codify Roe versus Wade. In other words, we support a \nwoman's right to choose with the understanding that after viability, \nwhen the fetus can live outside the womb with or without life support, \nwe want to be very careful that there should be no abortion at all \nunless the woman's life is threatened, or her health is threatened, and \nin those cases where a doctor so determines and the woman's family so \nagrees, that that woman will be able to terminate that pregnancy in a \nway that protects her life and her health.\n  What we are attempting to do in the course of this debate is to put a \nwoman's face back on this issue because, when you listen to the other \nside, the woman is completely forgotten. As I said yesterday, the day \nwe pass legislation that harms more than half of our population is the \nday that I wonder what we are doing as a country.\n  I hope that the other side on this issue would join hands with us and \nget this passed. We know the President would sign this bill. Then we \ncan tell the American people together that the only cases of late-term \nabortion in this Nation that would be allowed is when the woman faces a \nlife-threatening situation, if the pregnancy continues, or one that is \nso serious that action must be taken to terminate the pregnancy.\n  Senator Santorum would outlaw a particular procedure and not allow it \nbe used except in the most narrow circumstance.\n  I want to tell you what some doctors have said about this procedure \nthat Senator Santorum would ban.\n  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists is an \norganization representing 37,000 physicians. As I have said in the \npast, I know those of us who come to the U.S. Senate are pretty strong \npeople who believe in our views, who believe in ourselves, but we ought \nto leave our egos at the door when it comes to protecting lives.\n  When it comes to medical emergencies, we do not have the capability \nof deciding what procedure ought to be used in a hospital room. If you \nwere to ask your constituents, I don't care what party, or whether they \nare Independent, Republican, Democratic, or whatever party they are \nfor, who would you rather have in the emergency room with you, Senator \nSantorum, Senator Boxer, or the family doctor who is trained, who \nunderstands the issue? I think they would say, ``I don't want any \npoliticians in the hospital room with me. I want the best physician \nthat I can find for my wife or for my daughter or for my niece. And I \nwant that doctor to have the full range of options,'' knowing that \nthere will never be an abortion in the late term unless the life or \nhealth of the mother is at stake.\n  That is a pretty moderate course, it seems to me, a pretty reasonable \ncourse. And that is the course of the Feinstein-Boxer-Moseley-Braun \nbill.\n  Let me repeat, under our bill, there will be no late-term abortion, \nno post-viability abortion unless the doctor determines that to protect \nthe woman's life and health he or she must terminate the pregnancy.\n\n[[Page S4521]]\n\n  Senator Feinstein talked about Viki Wilson. I have her picture up \nhere behind me with her loving family. And I think it is worth \nrepeating the story.\n  In her 36th week of the pregnancy, the nursery was ready, the family \nwas anticipating the arrival of their new family member. Viki's doctor \nordered an ultrasound which detected something that all of her prenatal \ntesting had failed to detect. As Senator Feinstein told you, two-thirds \nof her daughter's brain had formed outside the skull, and the doctors \nfeared that Viki's uterus would rupture in the birthing process leaving \nViki sterile. After consulting with other physicians, with their \nclergy, with their God, in order to preserve Viki's fertility, they \nmade the painful choice to have this procedure that would be outlawed \nunder the Santorum bill.\n\n  Now you see Viki, who has protected her fertility, a decision made \nwith her doctor and her God. This procedure would be outlawed by the \nSantorum bill.\n  The 37,000 gynecologists and obstetricians stated that this procedure \nthat would be outlawed under the Santorum bill ``may be the best or \nmost appropriate procedure in a particular circumstance to save the \nlife or preserve the health of a woman, and only the doctor, in \nconsultation with the patient, based upon the woman's particular \ncircumstances, can make this decision. . .''\n  Today I received an additional letter that I want to share with my \ncolleagues from David Grimes, a physician in San Francisco, CA. He \ntells the story--that he had never used this procedure that Senator \nSantorum wants to outlaw. But he talks about it this way, and the time \nthat he did use it recently.\n  He says:\n\n       A woman in the Bay Area became seriously ill with \n     preeclampsia (which is toxemia of pregnancy) at 24 weeks' \n     gestation. She had a dangerous and extreme form of disease, \n     called HELLP syndrome . . . she had liver failure and \n     abnormal blood-clotting ability. The pregnancy had to be \n     terminated to save her life.\n       During several days spent unsuccessfully in attempts to \n     induce labor, her medical condition continued to deteriorate. \n     Finally, in desperation, the attending physician called me to \n     assist . . .\n\n  He said he accomplished the procedure in a manner of minutes with \nvery little blood loss.\n\n       She recovered quickly thereafter, and her physician \n     discharged her home in good condition after a few weeks.\n\n  He said:\n\n       . . . I received a lovely thank you note from her husband.\n\n  You know, this isn't only about women. It is about their loving \nhusbands and their loving fathers.\n  He ``received a . . . note from her husband thanking me for saving \nhis wife's life.''\n  And the doctor said:\n\n       In this instance, an intact D was the fastest and safest \n     option available to me and to the patient. Congress must not \n     take this option away.\n\n  So, yet--and I have many other letters from physicians--that is \nexactly what this Congress is set to do. With the exception of 1 \nphysician, who I don't believe is an OB-GYN, we have 99 people in here \nwho do not know a whit about being an obstetrician or gynecologist. \nThey don't have any training, at least that I know of.\n  I find it the height of--I don't even know the right word to use--the \n``height of ego,'' I guess, to think that we would know more than a \nphysician, we would pass legislation that would take an option away \nfrom a physician. I can't believe that we would be doing this.\n  I can tell you, I just had a community meeting in California. Maybe I \nknew 2 people out of 700 people that came out to the community meeting. \nThe floor was open. It was their meeting. And not one of them stood up \nin that meeting and said, ``Senator Boxer, you ought to go there and \noutlaw medical procedures.''\n  What they told me is go back there and get that budget balanced, \neducate our children, and preserve our freedoms.\n  So I have to say this is now the third time we have taken up this \ndebate. It is the third time. It is painful. It is difficult. The \nreason I find it so painful is because in the name of saving pain, this \nCongress is going to vote for a bill that is going to cause families \npain, and not just momentary pain, but long-lasting pain, because when \na woman loses her fertility it is long-lasting pain, or if a woman gets \nparalyzed it is long-lasting pain.\n\n  I want to talk to you about a couple of other women:\n  Maureen Britell, a 30-year-old, Irish-Catholic mother of two, who \nlives in Massachusetts. On February 17, Maureen and her husband were \nawaiting--this is in 1994--joyously awaiting the birth of their second \nchild. On that date, when she was 5 months pregnant, a sonogram \ndetermined that her daughter had no brain and could not live outside \nthe womb. Her doctor recommended termination of the pregnancy. The next \nday a third-degree sonogram at the New England Medical Center in Boston \nconfirmed the diagnosis that the baby had no brain and was not viable.\n  Maureen and her family sought counsel from their parish priest, \nFather Greg, who supported the decision to terminate the pregnancy. Let \nme repeat that. Maureen and her family sought counsel from their parish \npriest, Father Greg, who supported the decision to terminate the \npregnancy. They named their daughter Dahlia. She had a Catholic \nfuneral, and was buried at Otis Air Force Base in Cape Cod.\n  So Senators are going to interfere with the decision made by a \nfamily, its doctor, and their God. And by the passage of the Santorum \nlegislation, if in fact it is going to pass, which indications are it \nwill, that is just what we are doing--the height of ego. ``We know \nbetter than a doctor. We know better than a priest. We know better than \na rabbi. We are going to be in the hospital room. We are going to say \nwhat medical procedures can't be performed.''\n  What is the next one? There are no pretty medical procedures, period. \nWhat is the next one that we are going to stand up here and outlaw?\n  I want you to meet Eileen Sullivan.\n  Eileen Sullivan, with 10 brothers and sisters, runs a nursery school \nin southern California. And she is an Irish-Catholic woman.\n  Eileen writes, ``For as long as I can remember, being in the company \nof children was when I was happiest. So when my husband and I watched \nthe home pregnancy test slowly show a positive result, we were \necstatic. After three years of trying to conceive a baby, I didn't \nbelieve it. So I kept checking the test against the diagram on the \npackage. Sure enough, we had done it. We were going to have a baby.''\n  Eileen continues:\n\n       My long awaited pregnancy was easy and blissful. As I \n     charted my baby's growth week by week, the bond grew stronger \n     between us. Many nights I spoke to my baby, saying that I \n     accepted it just as it was, boy or girl, with dark eyes like \n     mine or blue like my husband's. I didn't care--I was just so \n     happy that we would finally be parents.\n\n  At 26 weeks, Eileen went to her obstetrician for a routine \nultrasound. After a few moments, her doctor got quiet and began to \nfocus intently on the monitor. The doctor confirmed that there was a \nproblem and sent Eileen and her husband to have tests immediately.\n  The Sullivans went to a genetic specialist for another ultrasound. \nThe doctor concluded that among other things: the baby's brain was \nimproperly formed and being pressured by a back-up of fluid. His head \nwas enlarged, his heart was malformed, his liver was malfunctioning, \nand there was a dangerously low amount of amniotic fluid.\n\n  According to Eileen, for 2 hours the specialist detailed the baby's \nanomalies. Eileen writes, ``My husband and I held one another and tried \nto understand what was happening. This was a nightmare. We spoke to a \ngenetics counselor and had a battery of additional tests including an \namniocentesis and a placenta biopsy.''\n  She continues: ``When the tests came back, the prognosis was the \nsame--the anomalies were incompatible with life.''\n  ``Not wanting to accept this,'' she writes, ``we went to another \nspecialist--a pediatric cardiologist. His prognosis was no better. \nAccording to the cardiologist, our baby's heart condition was lethal \nand he would not live.''\n  She continues: ``We wept. We discussed what we should do, what was \nbest and safest for myself and the baby. After all the talking was \nover, we were faced with the hardest decision of our\n\n[[Page S4522]]\n\nlives, and we opted to do what we thought was right. We opted to \nundergo a late-term abortion. Our long awaited, much anticipated baby \nwas not going to make it, and there was nothing we could do to change \nthat.''\n  Eileen continues: ``What we could do is choose the best way to end \nour pregnancy and help improve our chances of future pregnancy. I had \nhad cervical cancer.''\n  She goes into all the problems and all the reasons why she had to \nmake this choice. She said, ``We chose * * * a safe, surgical procedure \nthat protected my health, spared my baby needless suffering and allowed \nus to hold our child and say our goodbyes. This is the procedure that \nwould be banned by the legislation you are considering today.'' And she \nsays, ``Please leave these difficult medical decisions where they \nbelong--between women, their families and their doctors.''\n  So I think you have seen, Mr. President, that the women who have \nundergone these surgeries wanted these children desperately. Their \nhusbands wanted these children desperately. They were religious, they \nare religious women. Many of them say they do not consider themselves \npro-choice. But what we would do with the Santorum legislation is to \ntake away an option that saved their fertility, saved their health, and \nperhaps even saved their lives.\n  Why on Earth would we do this? I believe the Feinstein-Boxer-Moseley-\nBraun alternative is the sane way to go, the appropriate way to go. It \nkeeps these decisions where they belong, and yet it says the only time \nthat an abortion in the late term will be allowed would be when the \nwoman's life is in danger or her health is in danger. So I proudly \nstand with my colleagues, and I urge my colleagues to be strong, to be \ncourageous. I listen to these ads. I read these ads. They are \nmisleading. They use hot button words, and I have to tell you, if you \nlook at this and you look at these women, this, my friends, is the \ntruth. These women stand and tell the truth. Let us stand with them.\n  I thank you, I say to my friend and colleague, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use.\n  Mr. President, there are so many things I would like to say, but let \nme just start with one at a time, and that is the pictures the Senator \nfrom California put up here of women who have been in situations where \nthey were faced with a fetal abnormality and were convinced, \nunfortunately, by some genetics counselors and others to have an \nabortion as their option.\n  Let me show you a picture of someone who wasn't convinced by genetics \ncounselors that that was her only option. That is Donna Joy Watts. I \ntalked about her yesterday. She had the same condition as two of the \nwomen that Senator Boxer just described--same condition. Her mother had \nto go to four hospitals to find someone who would not do what the \npeople that Senator Boxer just talked about did, which is terminate the \npregnancy, abort the child. She said no. She says, I'm going to let my \nchild live in the fullness of what God has planned for her. I am not \ngoing to end her life. I am not going to make the decision to end her \nlife, like any other mother or father would not, if they were faced \nwith a sick child, kill them. Why would you kill your child? Because \nyour child is sick? Because your child might not live long? Why kill \nyour child?\n  Lori Watts and Donny Watts said, no, we are not going to kill our \nchild. We are going to do what we can. We are going to treat her with \ndignity and respect like any other member of our family. We are going \nto love her and do everything we can to support her.\n  So they delivered Donna Joy Watts. The doctors would not treat her. \nThey said she was going to die. They would not even feed her for 3 \ndays. You want to talk about all these doctors who are so concerned \nabout saving lives. Then why are we debating physician-assisted suicide \nif all these doctors are so concerned about saving lives? People who \nperform abortions are not principally concerned about saving lives. \nThey are worried about malpractice concerns, particularly if you have a \ndifficult pregnancy. They are worried about a whole lot of other \nthings. But I would suggest, unfortunately, there are too many--if \nthere is one, there is too many--doctors out there who--after she was \nborn, doctors were referring to Donna Joy as a fetus laying there \nalive, breathing--a fetus.\n  So do not tell me, do not tell me that all these caring, \ncompassionate doctors would, of course, do everything to save a child's \nlife. It is not true. God, I wish it were true. And, unfortunately, bad \nadvice is given out by people who either do not know, have not taken \nthe time to understand what options are available, what technology has \nbeen developed, or do not care or just are afraid to deal with the \nproblem.\n  Mr. and Mrs. Watts had to go to four hospitals just to find a place \nto have her delivered. They would not deliver her. They would abort \nher. They would do a partial-birth abortion. In fact, they offered a \npartial-birth abortion, but they would not deliver her.\n  So do not bring your pictures up here and claim that is the only \nchoice. This is not a choice. These are little babies. And they are \nasking us to help them now. This is not Senator Rick Santorum, \nnonphysician, speaking. Over 400 obstetricians and gynecologists--and \nby the way, the person who designed this barbaric procedure that we are \ndebating was not an obstetrician. You hear so much about all these \nexperts. He was not an expert. He is a family practitioner who does \nabortions, and you can only question as to why he spends all his time \ndoing abortions instead of taking care of families. But that is what he \ndoes. He does abortions.\n  This is not taught in any medical school. It is not in any peer \nreview literature. It is not done anywhere but abortion places. It is \nnot done in hospitals that deal with high-risk pregnancies. Ask the \nquestion. I will ask it. Can you find a place that deals with high-risk \npregnancies that has perinatologists at their unit that does partial-\nbirth abortions?\n  The answer is no, zero. No hospitals do this procedure. If this is a \nprocedure that was so important to be kept alive and so important to be \nan option, then why don't the experts, the people who study high-risk \npregnancies, perform this? If this was the best choice--and the Senator \nfrom California suggested that in fact would be the only choice in \ncertain cases. Yesterday, she listed five conditions in which this \nwould be the only choice. Now, if you are a perinatologist, someone who \ndeals in late-term pregnancies, and you are not performing this--you \nare basically telling the perinatologists that they are doing \nmalpractice because they are not doing this procedure.\n  Let me talk to you about one perinatologist who wrote to me. This is \nDr. Steve Calvin, assistant professor, Division of Maternal-Fetal \nMedicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of \nMinnesota in Minneapolis:\n\n       As a specialist in Maternal-Fetal Medicine, I practice with \n     the busiest group of perinatologists--\n\n  That is obstetricians who work on high-risk pregnancies and deal with \nthese fetal problems--\n\n     in the upper midwest.\n\n  The busiest group of perinatologists in the upper Midwest.\n\n       I also teach obstetrics to medical students and residents. \n     I know of no instances when the killing of a partially born \n     baby was necessary to accomplish delivery in any of the five \n     medical situations listed by Senator Feinstein.\n       Senator Feinstein claims that partial-birth abortion is \n     necessary to end a pregnancy in the following five \n     situations: Fetal hydrocephaly, fetal arthrogryposis, \n     maternal cardiac problems (including congestive heart \n     failure), maternal kidney disease and severe maternal \n     hypertension.\n       The first two conditions are significant fetal problems. \n     Hydrocephalus--\n\n  And that is exactly, by the way, what Donna Joy Watts had--\n\n     is an increased amount of cerebrospinal fluid that can cause \n     enlargement of the head and arthrogryposis includes \n     deformities of the fetal limbs and spine. Significant as \n     these abnormalities may be, they do not require the killing \n     of a partially born fetus. Delivery can be accomplished by \n     other means that are safer for the mother--\n\n  I repeat, ``safer for the mother''--\n\n     and give the fetus at least a chance of survival.\n\n  And, I might add, apart from this, some dignity, some dignity to one \nof our children, one of our humankind, in the case of the family, one \nof their family.\n\n\n[[Page S4523]]\n\n\n       The other three conditions are maternal illnesses that may \n     indeed require ending the pregnancy. But, as with the fetal \n     problems, there is no reason that the treatment must include \n     suctioning out the brain of a partially born baby.\n       One of my biggest concerns is that the opponents of this \n     ban are claiming that this destructive procedure is the only \n     method of ending a pregnancy. Abortion supporters have \n     previously acknowledged that surgical mid-trimester and late- \n     term abortions are more dangerous to a woman's health than \n     induction of labor.\n\n  Let me read this again.\n\n       Abortion supporters have previously acknowledged that \n     surgical mid-trimester and late-term abortions are more \n     dangerous to a woman's health than induction of labor. Their \n     concern for women's health and safety apparently ends when \n     there is any threat to unrestricted abortion.\n\n  Signed Steve Calvin, MD.\n  And I will put up this quote from 400 doctors, over 400 doctors, \nincluding the former Surgeon General, C. Everett Koop. I suggest these \nover 400 doctors, many of them members of ACOG, which is American \nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, also are concerned about \nmaternal health. Many of these are perinatologists, people who \nspecialize in high-risk pregnancies. I would think they would be \nconcerned about maternal health. Many of these doctors are pro-choice \nand they said the following clearly.\n\n       While it may become necessary, in the second or third \n     trimester, to end a pregnancy in order to protect the \n     mother's life or health, abortion is never required.\n\n  Now, they did not say it should be an option. They said never. These \nare experts. Senator Boxer says, well, Rick Santorum should not be in \nthe operating room. I would not want to be in the operating room. I \nwould pass out if I was in the operating room. The fact of the matter \nis I am not going to be in the operating room. These folks are. This is \nwhat they say. ``Never,'' not sometimes, ``never required.''\n\n       It is never medically necessary, in order to preserve a \n     woman's life, health or future fertility, to deliberately \n     kill an unborn child in the second or third trimester, and \n     certainly--\n\n  Underline certainly--\n\n     not by mostly delivering the child before putting him or her \n     to death.\n\n  This last line is very important.\n\n       What is required in the circumstances specified by Senator \n     Daschle [Senator Boxer, Senator Feinstein] is separation of \n     the child from the mother, not the death of the child.\n\n  In other words, there may be cases where you must separate the child \nfrom the mother, you must deliver the baby, either by induction and \ndelivery, vaginally or by cesarean section, but in no case, according \nto a doctor--and I ask if you can produce one perinatologist who would \nsay that it is necessary, absolutely necessary, to kill the child in \norder to protect the life and the health of the mother, because I have \nhundreds who say it is not, hundreds from the finest universities and \nthe finest medical schools all over this country who say absolutely, \ndefinitively--and the former Surgeon General of the United States, C. \nEverett Koop--never necessary, never necessary.\n  Now, we also have to talk about all these cases that we are concerned \nabout the mother's health. We make the assumption that abortion is an \noption to preserve the mother's health or life. I heard that over and \nover again. It has to be out there in late trimesters, after 20 weeks. \nLet me share a couple of statistics that shed some light on this.\n\n  This was referred to by Dr. Calvin. I want to back it up by the \nstatistics. This is from the Alan Guttmacher Institute. Who are they? \nThey signed letters with NARAL and Planned Parenthood and all these \nother abortion groups, in support of this procedure, in support of \nevery liberalization you can possibly imagine. They are a pro-choice, \nsome would even suggest pro-abortion group. Here is what they say.\n\n       The risk of death associated with abortion increases with \n     the length of pregnancy, from 1 death in every 600,000 \n     abortions at 8 or fewer weeks to 1 per 17,000 at 16-20 weeks, \n     and [after 20 weeks, when partial-birth abortions are \n     performed, they are considered late-term abortions after 20 \n     weeks] 1 per 6,000 at 21 or more weeks.\n\n  It is 100 times more likely that a mother will die than if the \nabortion were performed in the first 8 weeks. It is 100 times more \nlikely.\n  This is what these people are advocating, performing abortions. Let \nme throw one statistic on top of that. I will show it. I will read it. \n``It should be noted that at 21 weeks and after, abortion is twice as \nrisky for women as childbirth: The risk of maternal death is 1 in 6,000 \nfor abortion and 1 in 13,000 for childbirth.''\n  So, aborting a child through partial-birth abortion, late in term, is \nstatistically more dangerous to the life of the woman than inducing \nlabor. In other words, not only is it preferential for our society not \nto kill children who should be given a chance at birth, late, when \nthere may be a chance of viability or just when they should have at \nleast some dignity attached to their life, but it is more dangerous to \nabort than it is to induce labor or to have a cesarean section. It is \nmore dangerous.\n  The folks who say they are protecting a woman's health and life are \narguing for procedures that do the exact opposite. Facts: I know we do \nnot like to talk about facts when it comes to abortion. We like to put \nup pictures of nice families and warm little babies, that somehow or \nanother, this family is better off because of an abortion. The fact is \nby having an abortion she was twice as likely to die and not be in that \npicture. That is the fact. We do not want to talk about that. We want \nto make sure the right of abortion is paramount among all rights. \nBecause that is what this amendment does--nothing. It lets there be \nabortion on demand, anytime, anywhere, on anybody. That is what this \namendment does. It has no restrictions. It is an exception that is not \nan exception.\n  It is an exception that says that, while we cannot have postviability \nabortions except for the health of the mother-- let me tell you what \nDr. Warren Hern, who wrote the definitive textbook on abortion, called \n``Abortion Practice,'' said. Here it is: ``Abortion Practice,'' Warren \nM. Hern, from Colorado. My understanding is this is sort of the \ndefinitive textbook on teaching abortions. He does second- and third-\ntrimester abortions and is very outspoken on this subject. He does not \nuse partial-birth abortion, I might add; does not see it as a \nrecognized procedure. But this is what an abortionist who does late-\nterm abortions--in fact, has people come from all over the world to \nhave abortions done by him--this is what he said about, not the Boxer-\nFeinstein amendment but the Daschle amendment, which we are going to \ndebate next:\n\n       I will certify that any pregnancy is a threat to a woman's \n     life and could cause grievous injury to her physical health.\n\n  In other words, abortion on demand, anytime during pregnancy. And he \nbelieves this. Some would say you are relying on the doctor's bad \nfaith--no. He believes this. And he has a right to believe it. If you \nlook at the statistics, I mean, you know, unfortunately some women do \ndie as a result of pregnancy and, therefore, he could say legitimately \nthere is a risk. Any pregnancy is a risk. It may be a small risk, but \nit is a risk. And all these bills require, that we are going to hear \ntoday, is just a risk. Not a big risk, a risk.\n  So what we have are limitations without limits. What we have is a \nfarce, to try to fool all of you, to try to fool the press. It has done \na very good job fooling the press. We have wonderful headlines about \nhow we are trying to step forward and do something dramatic on limiting \nlate-term abortions. Phooey, we have a step forward into the realm of \npolitical chicanery, of sham, of obfuscation, illusion, that does \nnothing but protect the politician at the risk of the baby. That is \nwhat is going on here. That is what is going on all day. You are going \nto hear a lot of it. You are going to hear, ``Oh, we need to do this, \nwe need to protect this.'' Here are the facts as pointed out by their \nside. I am using their facts. The Alan Guttmacher Institute--their \nnumbers.\n  Even when we debate with their information they cannot refute it. The \nfact of the matter is, there is no reason to do a partial-birth \nabortion and there is every reason in the world to stop it. It is a \ndehumanizing procedure. You wonder why we have a society that just is \nbecoming adrift, that does not know right from wrong, that does not \nhave any sense of justice, that does not have--we do not have any \ncompassion for each other? I will give you a good example why that \nhappens. Because on the floor of the U.S. Senate we are debating a \nprocedure where we can kill a\n\n[[Page S4524]]\n\nlittle innocent baby that is completely delivered from the mother \nexcept for the head. It is moving outside of the mother, a little baby \nwho has done nothing wrong to anybody, and we are saying, ``You don't \ndeserve to live.''\n\n  Give people like Donna Joy Watts a fighting chance. It will ennoble \nus all. We can look to Donna Joy and her family and say there are \nparents who showed the best, who showed the best in our hearts, who \nshowed the willingness to fight for life, for things that are at the \ncore of who we are as humanity. Let that spirit come back into American \nculture. Stop this culture of death and self-centeredness and focus in \non life and dignity. What about poking scissors in the base of a little \nbaby's skull and suctioning its brains out is dignifying the human \nbeing? You would not do that to a dog or an old cat that you wanted to \nput to sleep. You would not do it to a criminal who has killed 30 or 40 \npeople. And you do it to a little baby who has done nothing wrong and \njust wants a chance, for however long it may be--and it may not be \nlong--but, for however long, the dignity of life.\n  The Senator from California talks about the long-lasting pain to the \nfamily that we would be imposing on them. What is so painful about \nlooking at yourself in the mirror and saying: ``I have done everything \nI can to help my little girl or my little boy have a chance at life. I \ngave them every chance. I loved them as much as I possibly could in the \ntime that God gave us.'' What is so painful about that?\n  I will tell you pain. Facing, every day, that you killed your son or \ndaughter for no reason, that is a pain I would not want to live with.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield to me for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Not yet.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me know. I will be happy to wait until you are ready. \nThank you.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. There are great pains out there when you are dealing \nwith a child that is not going to live. It hurts. And it is troubling. \nBut you will find, not only from my experience but from the experience \nof doctors who deal with this all the time, that treating your son or \ndaughter with dignity, loving them as much as you can for as long as \nyou can--does not make the pain go away. It never goes away. When you \nlose a child it never, ever goes away. But it helps you live with it.\n  What we are doing today is, hopefully, banning a procedure and \nexplaining to all of those unfortunate people who may be dealing today, \nright now, with this situation, that there is a better way for \neveryone. Let us do the better way. Let us do the right thing. Let us \ndo the just thing for everyone.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me just make a couple of comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has the time. \nDoes the Senator from Pennsylvania yield time to the Senator from \nOklahoma?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for yielding time. \nI think he made one of the best presentations I have heard on the floor \nof this body. I want to say that, when he deals with the facts, he is \ndealing with the facts but, you know, we are also dealing today with \nperceptions. I tried to make a list of those things I have heard over \nand over. There is a lot of redundancy on this floor but there are some \nthings that have not been stated. I would like to share a couple of \nthose with you.\n  I am going to do something that is a little unusual, because I am \ngoing to read some Scriptures to you. It is not totally unprecedented \nin this body. In fact, the distinguished senior Senator from West \nVirginia does it quite often. So I would like to read a couple of \nScriptures, just for those who care. Anyone who does not, don't listen.\n  First of all, I have used this a number of times, Jeremiah 1:35 says, \n``Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; Before you were born I \nsanctified you.''\n  Or the 139th Psalm, no matter which interpretation you use, it makes \nit very clear when life begins.\n  Then, I was, not too long ago, at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. \nI had been to the museum in Jerusalem, and I found the same thing was \nprinted on the last brick as you are going through. This is Deuteronomy \n30, verse 19. It said: ``I call heaven and earth as witnesses today \nagainst you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and \ncursing; therefore choose life, that both you and your descendants may \nlive.''\n  And, last, I am always concerned that something that is as dramatic \nand is as significant as this issue is going to go unnoticed; that \nmaybe there are Senators out there who are not really into this issue \nand they might want to vote the party line, or they might want to say, \nwell, maybe there aren't as many of these procedures out there, so they \njust really are not knowledgeable of the subject. So, I will read \nProverbs 24, 11 and 12:\n       Rescue those who are unjustly sentenced to death. Don't \n     stand back and let them die. Don't try to disclaim \n     responsibility by saying you didn't know about it, for God \n     knows. Who knows all hearts knows yours, and He knew that you \n     know.\n\n  Mr. President, I was listening to the Senator from Massachusetts who \nsaid it does not do any good if we pass this because the President is \ngoing to veto it anyway. But I suggest to you that the President may \nnot veto it, and if he does veto it, maybe some people will come over \nwho were not here a year ago on this side of the aisle.\n  Ron Fitzsimmons who just last year insisted that the number of \npartial birth abortions were a relative handful now admits ``I lied \nthrough my teeth.''\n  He was lying. So if the President is predicating his decision to veto \nthis ban on the basis of what was told to him by Ron Fitzsimmons, there \nis every reason he could turn around on the issue. I suggest also that \nwe are talking now not just about a procedure, but a culture.\n  I have a very good friend by the name of Charles W. Colson who gave \nthese remarks upon winning the prestigious Templeton Prize for \ncontribution to religion. Listen very carefully. He puts it all \ntogether, not isolating one procedure or one issue:\n\n       Courts strike down even perfunctory prayers, and we are \n     surprised that schools, bristling with barbed wire, look more \n     like prisons than prisons do. Universities reject the very \n     idea of truth, and we are shocked when their best and \n     brightest loot and betray. Celebrities mock the traditional \n     family, even revile it as a form of slavery, and we are \n     appalled at the tragedy of broken homes and millions of unwed \n     mothers. The media celebrate sex without responsibility, and \n     we are horrified by plagues. Our lawmakers justify the taking \n     of innocent lives in sterile clinics, and we are terrorized \n     by the disregard for life in blood-soaked streets.\n\n  I think that kind of puts it into a context, which we are now \napproaching, that this is not just a normal type of an abortion.\n  I have a great deal of respect for one of the most intellectual \nMembers of this body. It is Senator Patrick Moynihan from New York, who \nis a self-proclaimed pro-choice Senator. He said:\n\n       And now we have testimony that it is not just too close to \n     infanticide, it is infanticide, and one would be too many.\n\n  This is where we get into the numbers game. I heard it said on this \nfloor many times that we are talking about maybe 1 percent or maybe \ntalking about those that are in the ninth month may be an infinitesimal \nnumber. But, in fact, one is too many. It was said on the floor that we \nmay be only talking about 200 lives being taken during the normal \ndelivery process. That is when a baby is given a natural birth and, \nyet, they take the life by using this barbaric procedure. We have all \nkinds of documentation that it is being done in the ninth month and \nduring the normal birth process. They say only 200.\n  Mr. President, I am from Oklahoma, and we lost 168 lives in the \nMurrah Federal Office Building bombing. This was the largest domestic \nterrorist attack in American history. Did anybody say that is only 168 \nlives that were lost in Oklahoma City? No, the entire Nation came with \ncompassion and mourned with us. One life, I agree with Senator \nMoynihan, is too many.\n\n[[Page S4525]]\n\n  One other issue that has not been discussed in this debate this year \nis that of pain, and rather than go into it, I do not think anyone \nrefutes the fact that a small baby, if that baby is certainly past the \nsecond trimester, feels pain every bit as much as anybody who is in \nhere, as any Member of the U.S. Senate would feel pain. There was a \nstudy conducted in London, and I have the results here, but I think \neveryone understands that this is something that is very real, that \nthese babies do feel pain.\n  I have a picture of a good friend of mine with me. His name is \nJason--James Edward Rapert. Back when people our age were having \nbabies, they would not even let you in the hospital, let alone the \ndelivery room. When my daughter, Molly, called up and said, ``Daddy, \nthe time is here, could you come over,'' and I went over to the \nhospital, she said, ``Would you like to come into the delivery room?\"\n\n  ``Wow, yes, I would.''\n  So I saw for the first time what many of you in this room have seen, \nand many of the women have experienced personally, but I was there when \nthis little guy was born. It is hard to describe to some of the men \nhere who have not been through that experience of seeing this wonderful \nlife begin, and I can remember when, in that room where the delivery \ntook place, it occurred to me that when Baby Jase, my grandson, was \nborn, that that is at a moment when they could have used this procedure \ninflicting all of the pain you have heard described so many times: \nGoing into the cranium with the scissors, opening up the scissors, suck \nthe brains out, the skull collapses. Awful. And there are individuals \nwho want to keep a procedure like this legal. If you did that to a dog, \nthey would picket in front of your office. Somehow we have developed a \nculture that puts a greater value on the lives of critters than human \nlife.\n  So I watched Baby Jase being born, and I suggest to those of you who \nare concerned about choice that this is really the choice. It is either \nthat choice or this choice. Those are the choices we are faced with \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, this is something on which I agree with the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania. We should not be having to talk about it. To think \n100 years from now they may look back and talk about that barbaric \nsociety that killed their own young, and here we are just trying to \nsave a few lives from a very painful death. But nonetheless, that is \nthe issue we are faced with today. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \npartial-birth abortion ban. I applaud the bipartisan effort taking \nplace to bring this bill to the floor. Most importantly, I applaud the \nefforts of my good friend, Senator Santorum from Pennsylvania, who has \neffectively and courageously articulated many of the reasons that this \nprocedure should not be accepted in America today.\n  People in this country are concerned about our Nation. They are \nconcerned about its moral values; they are concerned about its \ngoodness. What do we value, what do we cherish, what do we respect and \nhow do we live? Mr. President, I think it is time for all of us to \nthink about that.\n  I am a lawyer. I served for quite a number of years as a Federal U.S. \nattorney charged with enforcing laws, and I have been thinking about \nthis both as a lawyer, and as a person who wants to decide what kind of \nlaws we ought to have. I do believe that laws do affect and reflect the \ncharacter and the values that the people of this Nation hold dear.\n  I say to you, Mr. President, that we need clarity in our law. No \nmatter how we debate or what we feel about the overall question of \nabortion, this procedure, in which a child is partially removed from \nthe womb of the mother, is partially born, to then have its life \nexterminated, is a standard that we ought not to allow. We should not \nallow children who are partially born to be murdered. I think that is \nan area in which it is appropriate for the law to have a clear \ndistinction.\n  Some have said the President will not sign this bill, that he will \nveto it again. But I remember what the President said his reasons for \nthe last veto were. He said these procedures were rare, and that they \nwere performed only to preserve the life or the health of the mother or \nto preserve the reproductive right of the mother because of the most \nsevere abnormalities in the infant. Those are the reasons he gave; \nthose are the reasons American citizens were told from this very floor \nby many of the people who are arguing today in support of this \nprocedure. That is what they were told.\n\n  Mr. Ron Fitzsimmons, the executive director of the National Coalition \nof Abortion Providers--that means the national group of abortionists--\nadmitted publicly that he had lied through his teeth, that the false \ninformation he had displayed made him sick to his stomach.\n  So I will just say to you, Mr. President, that I do not believe \nPresident Clinton has made up his mind on this matter. The reasons he \ngave when he struck down this bill last time are not present today. I \nbelieve that with the election behind him he has an opportunity now to \nabide by his conscience and to abide by the facts which have been \nproven repeatedly to be true, and I believe that when this bill is \npassed, it will be signed by the President. I certainly hope so. I \nthink he certainly needs that opportunity, because the circumstances \nhave greatly changed.\n  So I will say again how much I appreciate the work of the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, how much I respect his commitment, \nlove and capacity for all humankind. I think it is an important \nquestion for this country because it sets a standard about who we are, \nwhat we will accept in our community, what kind of laws we ought to \nhave, and based on that, I support this bill, and I urge my colleagues \nto do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  There really is no more important value than life. The only question \nthat is raised today with this debate is, whose life?\n  This debate is about women's health, women's rights, women's choices, \nand their stories, but, most importantly, this debate is about women's \nlives. This is not a place for the kind of screaming, fiery rhetoric we \nhave heard here. If anything, we need to listen to each other, we need \nto hear the voices of people, of women who have been faced with the \nchoices and the issues, who have been faced with troubled pregnancies \nand understand that somewhere in this very controversial area, there is \nguidance for us and there are answers for us.\n  This debate is about whether or not women are going to have the \nability to make decisions regarding their own reproductive health, \nwhether women will have and be able to exercise their constitutional \nrights to privacy, whether women will be able to make decisions \nregarding their own pregnancies, and this debate, in the final \nanalysis, is about whether women are going to be heard.\n  Women's health is at stake with this legislation. We cannot afford to \nhave women suffer irrevocable and irreparable harm due to pregnancy \nwhere we have the medical ability to prevent that harm and save the \nwoman's life. We should not dictate that an unborn fetus is more \nprecious to us than the life or the health of its mother.\n  In 1900, some 600 women died in childbirth in the United States for \nevery 100,000 live births. Death in childbirth was a regular tragic \noccurrence. But by 1970, 21.5 women died in childbirth for every \n100,000 live births. Today, that number has dropped to less than 10. \nWomen are surviving in childbirth because of advances in medicine.\n  These figures show us that the maternal death rate has dropped by \nsome two-thirds since the Supreme Court affirmed the right of a woman \nto obtain a safe and legal abortion. This is an important reduction in \nmaternal mortality and one which I know we are all thankful for. But it \nseems to matter\n\n[[Page S4526]]\n\nless to some in this debate that some women may well die if the right \nto make choices about their own health is taken away from them. \nAbortion should be safe, it should be legal, and it should be rare.\n  Mr. President, it seems to me that legislation that we are debating \nright now to ban certain specific abortion procedures would turn back \nthe advances that have been made in medical science and have been made \nwith regard to maternal health and maternal death rates, and it would \ndictate to doctors what procedures they can and cannot use to protect \nthe life and health of their patients.\n  One of the Senators who spoke on the floor today talked about \nprotecting politicians versus protecting babies. Well, the point is \nthat the politicians should have nothing to do with this. This is a \nquestion for the mother, the child, the family, and their God.\n  Mr. President, in this legislation there is no exception, none, to \nprotect the health of the mother. And so this legislation, H.R. 1122, \nthe underlying bill, lays aside altogether the advances in medical \nscience. The training of doctors is disregarded altogether. Women's \nhealth is ignored. And so essentially it would send us back to the \nstatus of the law that existed before Roe versus Wade was decided by \nthe U.S. Supreme Court and when we had such a prevalence of maternal \ndeaths.\n  Some have argued that the procedure being banned in this legislation \nis being banned because it is medically dangerous. Well, Mr. President, \nif it is dangerous then doctors should make that determination, not \nSenators. That is their job; it is not ours.\n  Some have argued the procedure is unnecessary. And yet the \nlegislation contains a narrow life exception to the ban. If that \nexception is needed, that is because in some circumstances the \nprocedure that is involved here is needed. Physicians have said this \nand have written to us about this. And so you really have to take a \nchance that you might not force a woman to die because of the \ndecisionmaking that will be made in this Chamber. But again, this is \nessentially a medical decision, what procedure to use in the case of a \ntroubled pregnancy.\n  Mr. President, women's rights also are at stake. And this is a very \nimportant point. Women's rights as equal citizens under the law are at \nstake in this debate. Women fought for generations for full protections \nunder the law in our Constitution. And this legislation rolls back the \nclock. I would point out, women were not even citizens in this country \nuntil 75 years ago. We just then got the right to vote in this country.\n  This legislation unfortunately, in my opinion, assumes that female \ncitizens do not have rights which the unborn are bound to have. The \ndebate that we are now engaged in has turned the notion of entitlement \nof citizenship right on its head by giving the unborn equal or even \ngreater status than their mother, as I believe this legislation does. \nLegal conclusions may be reached that reduce women to second-class \ncitizenship.\n  And so the legislation reduces the status of all women as citizens, \nbut even more tragically, it could very well result in a death sentence \nfor some women by forcing a choice between the life of the mother and \nthe life of the fetus, particularly in cases of poor women or rural \nwomen who do not have easy access to the top-quality health care, the \nhealth care that could save the life of someone if they were fortunate \nenough to be able to access it.\n  So we are essentially debating whether or not we are going to \nsentence some women who have difficult pregnancies to a death sentence \nwith this legislation.\n  The Supreme Court had ruled in Roe, States cannot restrict a woman's \naccess to abortion in the first or second trimesters. The Court has \nsaid that the interests of the potential citizen, that is not yet a \ncitizen, that is not yet viable, cannot be placed in front of the \nrights of a woman who is currently a full citizen.\n  In addition, the Court has ruled that while the States may have a \ncompelling interest to legislate restrictions on postviability \nabortions, there must be an exemption for the life and health of the \nmother. That basic exemption for life and health is missing from the \nunderlying legislation that we are debating today. And so I submit that \nthe legislation fails to protect fundamental rights of female citizens.\n\n  Mr. President, women's choices are at stake in this legislation. \nChoosing to terminate a pregnancy is the most personal and private and \nfundamental decision that a woman can make about her own health--about \nher own health and her own life.\n  Choice is, when boiled down to its essentials, a matter of freedom. \nIt is a fundamental issue of the relationship of a female citizen, a \nwoman citizen to her Government. Choice is a barometer of equality and \na measure of fairness. And it is, I believe, central to our liberty.\n  I do not personally favor abortion as a method of birth control. My \nown religious beliefs hold life dear. And I would prefer that every \npotential child have a chance to be born. But whether or not that child \nwill be born must be a mother's personal decision, a woman's personal \ndecision.\n  I fully support the choice of those women who carry their pregnancies \nto term no matter what the circumstances. But I also respect the choice \nof those women who, under difficult circumstances where their life and \nhealth may be endangered, choose not to go forward with that pregnancy.\n  I also believe, Mr. President, this is a choice that can only be made \nby a woman in consultation with her doctor, her family, and her God. \nPoliticians should have no role to play in making so basic a decision.\n  I recognize that the American people are deeply divided on this \nissue. People of goodwill will hold greatly differing opinions on the \nissues we are debating today. And I respect those differences as well.\n  I have joined my colleagues, Senators Feinstein and Boxer in \nintroducing a substitute amendment banning postviability abortions \nexcept in the cases where the life or the health of the mother is \nthreatened. I ask the Senator from California to yield me as much time \nas I need. I need a few more minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. President, I yield as much time as the Senator from Illinois will \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I want to talk about the substitute amendment, the Feinstein-Boxer-\nMoseley-Braun substitute, because it is really very straightforward.\n\n       It shall be unlawful, in or affecting interstate or foreign \n     commerce, for a physician knowingly to perform an abortion \n     after the fetus has become viable.\n\n  Why is this opposed?\n  It is opposed because the second section says that:\n\n       * * * if, in the medical judgment of the attending \n     physician, the abortion is necessary to preserve the life of \n     the woman or to avert serious adverse health consequences to \n     the woman [this absolute ban does not apply].\n\n  So what this says is that women's lives, women's health, women's \nchoices are respected by the substitute amendment, but not by the \nunderlying legislation. I believe that this substitute amendment is \nclearly constitutional, that it is far-reaching, that it does not \ndirect a doctor to choose one medical procedure over another, that it \nprotects future citizens but it also insures, Mr. President, that under \nno circumstances will women be prevented from accessing the best \nmedical care possible to save their lives or to prevent serious adverse \nhealth consequences, such as the loss of their fertility.\n  When I started, I mentioned that women's stories are being ignored in \nthis debate with this legislation. And I cannot recount the story of \nVikki Stella, Vikki Stella from Naperville, IL, without being reminded \njust how important this fight is for families everywhere.\n  Our provision, the provision introduced by Senator Feinstein, would \nprotect women like Vikki Stella from Naperville, IL. There can be no \ngreater argument against the underlying bill, H.R. 1122, than this \nstory, in my opinion.\n\n  Vikki Stella and her husband were expecting their third child, \nAnthony. At 20 weeks, she went for a sonogram and was told that she and \nher child were healthy.\n\n[[Page S4527]]\n\n  At 32 weeks, that is to say in the last trimester of her pregnancy, 8 \nmonths pregnant, Vikki took her two daughters with her to watch their \nbrother on the sonogram.\n  But the technician that was administering the sonogram was quiet and \ndid not really respond, and asked Vikki if she would come upstairs to \ntalk to the doctor. Vikki thought perhaps that the baby might be \nbreach. As a diabetic she knew that any complications in her pregnancy \ncould be very serious.\n  Well, the doctor was too busy to see her that day but called at 7 \no'clock the next morning, called to say that the leg bones, the femurs \non the fetus, seemed a little short, but would she come back in. He \nassured her there was a 99-percent chance that nothing was wrong, but \nshe should still come in for a level 2 ultrasound.\n  Well, Mr. President, after that second ultrasound Vikki and her \nhusband and her family were told that the child she was carrying had no \nbrain. It was an abnormality incompatible with life. And Vikki then had \nto make the hardest decision that she says she had ever made. I want to \nuse her words. She said, ``I had to remove my son from life support--\nthat was me.''\n  Now, Vikki's decision would be illegal under the underlying bill, \nH.R. 1122, that we are debating right now. Vikki's doctor could have \ngone to jail under the Senator's legislation. And Vikki's family would \nhave suffered a tragedy, perhaps in the loss of her life or the loss of \nher ability to have other children. All of those implications would \nhave been a tragedy for this family from my State of Illinois.\n  As it turns out, the story had a better ending because the procedure \nwas performed. Vikki's fertility was maintained. She did not die, and \nshe is now the proud parent of, in her own words, ``a beautiful baby \nboy named Nicholas Archer.''\n  Nicholas Archer was able to be born because H.R. 1122 was not law, \nMr. President, because Vikki was able to obtain the procedure that \nwould be banned by this bill. She was able to consider the possible \noptions with her doctor, her family, and her God in private without the \ninterference of politicians. She was able to make a choice that was \nbest for her and best for her family. And she was able to give birth to \nNicholas Archer.\n  Vikki's story, Mr. President, is why we must not support the \nunderlying bill here.\n  I am going to make another point that I have made before, and it is a \ndifficult one. And I mean no disrespect by it, but I think it is \nparticularly important for Senators to listen to, not just hear but to \nlisten to Vikki's story, because, frankly, over 90 percent of the \nMembers of this U.S. Senate are about to legislate on something that \nthey could never experience.\n  Now, that is not to say that men do not have an interest in this. \nThey do. But they cannot know--and again I mean no disrespect--cannot \nknow how it feels to be pregnant, cannot know how it feels to carry a \ntroubled pregnancy, cannot know how central to one's life reproductive \nhealth is. So what we are talking about is legislation based on second-\nhand intelligence and hypothetical experience.\n  One of the reasons this debate sounds so awkward with descriptions of \nthe female reproductive organs and ``carrying to term'' is that it is \nbeing talked about by people who cannot, as a matter of personal \nexperience, know what is involved, have never themselves had a \npregnancy, have never themselves had to go to an obstetrician and be \nexamined and told your health is going to be affected one way or the \nother.\n  And can you imagine how Vikki Stella felt at 8 months? I know what \nbeing 8 months pregnant is like. How many other Members of the Senate \nknow how it feels to be 8 months in that condition, and then to find \nout that the baby that you are carrying has no brain? And then to be \ntold you cannot choose what kind of decisions to make about your \nhealth. Your doctor has nothing to say about the procedures to save \nyour life because of legislation that the U.S. Senate took up.\n  Mr. President, there is an editorial in the St. Louis Post Dispatch. \nAnd I just want to read the middle part here:\n\n       Certainly, most people are repelled by the idea of a third-\n     trimester abortion and rightly so. But they should also \n     realize that most women who have late-term abortions never \n     wanted to end their pregnancies; they expected to have their \n     babies but something drastic or unpredictable happened.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the St. Louis Post, May 14, 1997]\n\n                   Reasonable Compromise on Abortion\n\n       The battle against ``partial-birth'' abortion has always \n     been political, to chip away at abortion rights. The intent \n     of this anti-abortion strategy is to ban one abortion \n     procedure after the next--with the ultimate goal of banning \n     them entirely.\n       Organized opponents don't differentiate among one type or \n     another. In their view, ``partial-birth'' abortions are as \n     egregious as abortions induced by RU-486, the drug that can \n     only be used in the earliest weeks of pregnancy, and birth \n     control pills used as ``morning after'' pills to prevent \n     implantation. The issue is not the method but abortion \n     itself.\n       Certainly, most people are repelled by the idea of a third-\n     trimester abortion and rightly so. But they should also \n     realize that most women who have late-term abortions never \n     wanted to end their pregnancies; they expected to have their \n     babies but something drastic or unpredictable happened.\n       Roe vs. Wade embodies this concern by permitting states to \n     outlaw third-trimester abortions except when the life or \n     health of the mother is at stake. Forty-one states, including \n     Missouri and Illinois, already have such laws in place. \n     That's one reason Gov. Mel Carnahan says that Missouri \n     doesn't need a new law on ``partial-birth'' abortion. In \n     Illinois, the Legislature sent to Gov. Jim Edgar on Tuesday a \n     bill banning the procedure. Without a health exception, any \n     ban on abortion in the third trimester would not pass \n     constitutional muster.\n       Third-trimester abortions are relatively uncommon. About \n     600 abortions, or 0.04 percent of 1.5 million annual \n     abortions, are preformed after fetal viability. No one knows \n     how many are performed by intact dilation and extraction, or \n     D, the medical name for the targeted procedure. Contrary to \n     anti-abortion rhetoric, there's no epidemic of infanticide, \n     with full-term fetuses being aborted so girls can fit into \n     their prom dresses.\n       While anti-abortion rhetoric focuses on infanticide, the \n     issue is really second-trimester abortions, before the fetus \n     can survive on its own. That's when most intact D abortions \n     are performed. The ``partial-birth'' ban makes no distinction \n     between viability and non-viability; it prohibits the \n     procedure itself. Their bill also imposes criminal \n     penalties on doctors who perform the procedure.\n       The issue of second-trimester abortions is where the \n     trickiest constitutional issues are raised. The Supreme Court \n     will have to determine whether outlawing a medical procedure \n     presents an undue burden for a woman seeking an abortion. The \n     answer is not clear because a ban on ``partial-birth'' \n     abortions would not necessarily eliminate any abortions. \n     Other methods could still be used, although they might be \n     more dangerous to the mother.\n       In the U.S. Senate, set to debate the issue this week, \n     abortion foes have the votes to pass the bill, but they \n     apparently lack the votes to override a promised presidential \n     veto. Legislators who want to express their concern, without \n     risking a veto, do have options. Pro-choice senators have \n     their own bills, which essentially seek to codify Roe vs. \n     Wade. They ban all abortions involving viable fetuses, but \n     they include an exception for both the life and health of the \n     mother. President Bill Clinton indicates he may accept these \n     alternatives.\n       The bill proposed by Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of \n     South Dakota would tighten the health exception to ``grievous \n     injury'' to physical health. He defines ``grievous injury'' \n     as a ``severely debilitating disease or impairment \n     specifically caused by the pregnancy or an inability to \n     provide necessary treatment for a life-threatening condition. \n     Grievous injury does not include any condition that is not \n     medically diagnosable.''\n       Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois and California Sens. \n     Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, all Democrats, have a \n     version with a looser, more Roe-friendly health exception--to \n     prevent adverse health consequences. Senators who want to \n     codify support for the availability of abortion in the first \n     and second trimesters and for the third-trimester \n     restrictions set by Roe should support these bills.\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Well, we are about to say--predictable, \nunpredictable, drastic circumstances, viability notwithstanding--no \nwoman has that choice about her own body, about her own life, about her \nown baby, about her own family. That is what the underlying legislation \nwould do.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose the underlying \nlegislation. We must protect the health, the rights, the reproductive \nchoice of women. If we would just listen to the tragic stories of the \nwomen who have fought to recover from the loss of a child, to keep \ntheir families together, and to tell us\n\n[[Page S4528]]\n\ntheir stories, we can make a better decision here. And I hope that the \nrhetoric will tone down.\n  I hope that the rhetoric will tone down and we will focus on the fact \nthat this is not a hypothetical. This is not just legislating in a \nvacuum. We are really talking about something as central as one's \npersonal ability to make decisions about one's own body, about one's \nown health. That is an issue for women that transcends the second-hand \nintelligence of those standing on the side who would make choices about \nus, make choices that would reduce our citizenship to something that \ncould be legislated from afar.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the alternative that Senator \nFeinstein has filed. This alternative will ban all postviability \nabortions, but it will make an exception for the life and for the \nhealth of the mother, and preserve women's rights to choose with regard \nto their own reproductive health.\n  I thank my colleagues. I yield back to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I believe Senator Dorgan would like to \nbe recognized for the purpose of a unanimous-consent agreement. I have \nno objection, if there is no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Petrea \nKaldahl, Jeremy Johnson, Brian Underdahl, Susan Webb, and Jessica \nBraeger be permitted privileges of the floor for the duration of the \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, before I yield to the Senator from Iowa, \nI have a question for the Senator from Illinois, a question I asked in \nprevious debate, and I will ask again. That is, during the process of \npartial-birth abortions, if the baby that is being brought out in this \nfashion would for some reason have its head slip out because all that \nis left inside of the mother is a very small head, if that head would \nslip out, would it still be up to the doctor and the mother to kill the \nchild?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. If the baby is born, Senator, it is a birth.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. So you are saying the difference between being able to \nkill a child and not kill a child is the distance of the child's head? \nThat is the difference?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Senator, I think I started off saying that, again, \nthe inflammatory kind of--that is----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the Senator----\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. First, let me say with regard to the picture--may \nI please respond? You asked me a question and I would like to respond.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. This is something that can----\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. What you have is a cartoon. It does not begin to \ndescribe accurately what is involved with a physician putting his hand \nin between somebody's legs to deliver a baby. Start with that.\n  The second point is, it is impossible----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, reclaiming my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Regular order. The Senator from Pennsylvania \nhas the time. The Chair would observe that he will insist upon regular \norder. The Chair would observe this is an emotional debate. The Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania has the time. The Chair would also observe that if \nthe Senator wishes another Senator to respond and to yield, certainly \nwe want respect given to that Senator.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I want to clarify a point. Dr. Haskell, who developed \nthis procedure, testified that the drawings were accurate, and I am \nquoting him, ``from a technical point of view.'' So these drawings are \nnot cartoons. They are accurate drawings of a procedure that Dr. \nHaskell has invented.\n  The point I am trying to make, and I think she answered the question, \nand I think she answered it correctly, and that is if the child was \ndelivered, completely delivered, you would not be able to kill the \nchild.\n\n  The point I am trying to make, look how close we are drawing this \nline, a matter of a few inches of a baby's skull. Those 3 inches \ndetermine whether you can live or die. Is that really what we want in \nour society? Is that really the standard that we want to develop as to \nwhen life is worth living, or life should or should not be protected?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I respond by saying to my colleague from \nPennsylvania that, again, you did not really ask a question. You were \nmaking a statement, but it is very difficult to make a statement like \nthat.\n  I used a picture of Vikki Stella. That is a real person, a real \nwoman, who had a troubled pregnancy that had to be ended in a late-term \nabortion.\n  You are using a cartoon, a cartoon that is a child. The question you \nasked had to do with the cartoon you had. Now, if your point is that \nthis child, there was a decision about this child's health or her \nmother's health at the time of the delivery, that is another story, but \nthat is not the question you asked. That is not the question you put.\n  The only point I say is, if you are going to talk about these issues, \nthen it really should be based on reality and not just posturing and \nnot just politics. I am afraid this debate, frankly, has degenerated to \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would observe the regular order, \nunder rule XIX:\n\n       A Senator can yield only for a question. He has a right to \n     yield to another Senator to propound a question. He cannot \n     interrogate or propound an inquiry of another Senator, except \n     by unanimous consent, in which case the latter Senator may be \n     allowed to answer such questions, with the right of the \n     Senator having the floor being reserved in the meantime.\n\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania has the time and is now recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I have shown this picture. This is a \nreal picture, a real person, and there are other real persons who have \nbeen through this threat of partial-birth abortion and survived it and \nmade the choice of life. This is not a hypothetical situation; it is a \nreal situation.\n  I suggest to the Senator from Illinois that the question I ask--I \nasked a question. I asked a question. I did not make a statement. I \nasked whether a child, to be delivered, would it be up to the doctor \nand mother to kill the child? The difference is a matter of 3 inches, \nand you have affirmed that 3 inches makes the difference as to whether \nthat child is protected or not protected, and I think that is a very, \nvery close line that you are drawing, one that is, I think, very \ndestructive of our culture.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we have all heard by now that Ron \nFitzsimmons, the executive director of the National Coalition of \nAbortion Providers, admitted that many pro-abortion groups agreed to a \nparty line to say that partial birth abortions are very rare and \nperformed only in extreme medical circumstances. Mr. Fitzsimmons has \nnow admitted that this party line was a lie.\n  Recent witness before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Renee Chelian, \nthe president of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, was \nquoted in a news article as saying, ``The spin out of Washington was \nthat it was only done for medical necessity, even though we knew it \nwasn't so.''\n  She openly admitted that she kept waiting for the National Abortion \nFederation to clarify it and they never did it. She said, ``I got \ncaught up: What do we do about this secret? Who do we tell and what \nhappens when we tell? But frankly no one was asking me, so I didn't \nhave to worry.''\n  But the truth came out. Now we know that many, who so desperately \nwere trying to tell us the truth, were right when they declared that \nthis procedure is done thousands of times a year and the majority is \ndone for elective purposes.\n  I'm saddened to see that a new wave of behavior has begun to permeate \nour legislative process and for that matter political behavior. What \nappears to be commonplace is that now the end justifies the means. \nWe've seen the administration use that excuse most recently when they \nopenly admitted that it was necessary to do what it took to raise \ncampaign funds in order to win the Presidency. And now, in this \npartial-birth abortion debate we have people\n\n[[Page S4529]]\n\nwho admitted they deliberately lied to Members of Congress and more \nimportant to the public about the partial-birth abortion procedure to \njustify a defeat of legislation banning it.\n  The partial-birth abortion procedure is an assault on women and \nchildren. It is more than abortion on demand--it's abortion out-of-\ncontrol.\n  This is more than a debate about a woman's right to choose. This is \nabout whether doctors, under the guise of health care, should be \nallowed to take the life of a child in such a barbarous way.\n  I plan to support the measure before us, without amendment, which \nwould end this procedure. This form of abortion is senseless, \ndangerous, and is clear-cut infanticide.\n  My colleagues have discussed what happens to the mother and child \nduring this type of abortion in graphic detail. Unfortunately, this \nprocedure cannot be sugarcoated. It is a procedure which doctors use to \nkill unborn babies who in many cases have developed enough to live \noutside of the womb.\n  I have been contacted by thousands of people in my State imploring me \nto support legislation to ban this procedure. Several hospitals from my \nState and their staffs have urged me to ban this procedure.\n  Last year, President Clinton stated before he vetoed the original \nlegislative ban on partial-birth abortion, ``I have studied and prayed \nabout this issue, and about the families who must face this awful \nchoice, for many months. I believe that we have a duty to try to find \ncommon ground: a resolution to this issue that respects the views of \nthose--including myself--who object to this particular procedure, but \nalso upholds the Supreme Court's requirement that laws regulating \nabortion protect both the life and the health of American women.''\n  Although it appears the President and many of my colleagues are \nconcerned about the life and health of the mother, I must question \ntheir judgment. This bill would ban partial-birth abortions unless the \nlife of the mother would be endangered. Medical experts have said that \nthis 3-day procedure would not be necessary even then.\n  Many say that this procedure must be allowed in cases where the \nhealth of the mother is at risk. Even that logic has been challenged. \nWe know the Doe versus Bolton case interpreted health very broadly to \nmean almost anything, including if the mother is a minor or if the \nmother has depression and so forth. So, what that means in real terms \nis if the mother doesn't want the child--having the child will \ndetrimentally affect her health and so on--abortion can take place in \nthe third trimester.\n  Many have testified that partial-birth abortion is almost never the \nsafest procedure to save a woman's life or even her health.\n  Former Surgeon General, Doctor C. Everett Koop has stated, ``Contrary \nto what abortion activists would have us believe, partial-birth \nabortion is never medically indicated to protect a woman's health or \nher fertility. In fact, the opposite is true: The procedure can pose a \nsignificant and immediate threat to both the pregnant woman's health \nand fertility.''\n  In the American Medical News, Dr. Warren Hern, who authored a widely \nused abortion manual, stated, ``I would dispute any statement that this \nis the safest procedure to use.''\n  Opponents talk about reproductive rights, but women have been \ndeceived to think if an abortion procedure is legal then it is \nautomatically safe. And I believe many women and men who support \nabortion in general do so on the basis of this reproductive safety \njargon.\n  Some have accused pro-life individuals of only being concerned about \nthe baby and accused pro-choice individuals of only being concerned \nabout the woman. I am seriously concerned about both the woman and the \nchild. Babies are being victimized and women are being exploited. What \nkind of Federal or State regulations exist to make sure these abortions \nare safe? And I ask this question about abortions in general. A person \ndoesn't even have to have a health care license of any kind to assist \nin the execution of an abortion.\n  Do we have any uniform health and safety regulations that make sure \nabortion clinics are safe? I know there aren't Federal ones, because \nthe pro-abortion forces have blocked any attempt to set safety \nstandards and State regulations vary greatly. We saw the ``60 Minutes'' \nexpose on the lack of safety regulations in Maryland that led to the \nabortion clinic death of at least one woman.\n  I am concerned about women's health. And although some would say \nbecause I am pro-life, I do not care about the reproductive rights of \nwomen. That deduction is not accurate. And it exasperates me that women \nacross our country have been led to believe that legality is synonymous \nwith safety.\n  Women should be outraged that this procedure has been designed and is \nbeing performed on them and healthy babies. This particular abortion \ntechnique is one of the most dangerous to their reproductive health and \nruns the great risk of jeopardizing their chances to ever carry a child \nto full term. As far as being out of touch, the other side is out of \ntouch with protecting these children, many of whom could be the future \nwomen and men of America.\n  And if those in opposition are really interested in protecting \nwomen's lives, why can't we enact Federal safety and health standards \nfor abortion clinics? We can't because supporters of abortion don't \nwant even minimum standards. How many women have been killed or maimed \ngetting these so-called legal abortions?\n  We always hear the mantra that the pro-life side is somehow out of \ntouch and trying to turn the clock back on women. Well, the problem \nwith the other side is they totally disregard the children and the \nwomen that are involved in these difficult cases. I'd like to move the \nclock forward for these children, not back, like the other side would \nlike to do.\n  Doctors that perform abortions are not required to inform the patient \nabout any of the risks she faces with each specific abortion procedure. \nDoctors that perform abortions are not required to offer decision-based \ncounseling to their patients. Doctors and those that assist the \ndoctors, such as anesthesiologists, are not required to have an \nabortion-specific license.\n  Abortionists can even ask their patients to sign statements saying \nthat they will not sue if injured. Again, this is not a so-called anti-\nchoice issue. Even pro-choice members have voted against this. Many \nhave reiterated my colleague from New York's statement which said it \naccurately, ``I think this is just too close to infanticide. A child \nhas been born and it has exited the uterus and, what on Earth is this \nprocedure?''\n\n  I want to submit for the record a copy of an article from the Argus \nLeader. It features a family from Hull, IA. At 23 weeks into her \npregnancy, Sarah Bartels went into premature labor. Her daughter \nStephanie was born at 1 pound, 2 ounces. The doctor who was working the \nnight Stephanie was born said she was small and yet very vigorous, \nwiggling her arms. Three-months later, her twin sister, Sandra, was \nborn. Each of these were miraculous births.\n  However, it becomes completely clear that because of location, one \nsister's life was protected and the other's was not. Over the 88-day \nperiod before her twin sister was born, Stephanie's life was protected \nby law because she was living in an intensive-care nursery. Over the \nsame 88-day period, Sandra was not protected by law because she was \nliving in her mother's womb. George Will pointed out in his column that \nunless she is completely outside the mother, she is fair game for the \nabortionist.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have these articles printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 24, 1997]\n\n                          The Abortion Coverup\n\n                          (By George F. Will)\n\n       The accusation that President Clinton cares deeply about \n     nothing is refuted by his tenacious and guileful battle to \n     prevent any meaningful limits on the form of infanticide \n     known as partial-birth abortion. However, that battle proves \n     that his professed desire to make abortion ``rare'' applies \n     only to the fourth trimester of pregnancies.\n       Soon--probably in the first half of May--the battle will be \n     rejoined in the Senate, where the minority leader, South \n     Dakota's Tom Daschle, will offer what he will advertise as a \n     compromise. Truth-in-advertising laws do not apply to \n     legislators.\n\n[[Page S4530]]\n\n       Daschle has not published his language yet, but presumably \n     it will be congruent with Clinton's real, as distinct from \n     his rhetorical, position. And judging by previous legislative \n     maneuverings, a ``compromise'' measure will be craftily \n     designed for the convenience of ``pro-choice'' legislators \n     who are kept on a short leash by the abortion-maximizing \n     lobby.\n       The aim will be to enable such legislators to adhere to \n     that lobby's agenda while casting a cosmetic vote that will \n     mollify a public repelled by partial-birth abortion, the \n     practice of sucking the brains from the skull of a baby \n     delivered feet first and killed while only the head remains \n     in the mother's uterus. Senators should consider this issue \n     in the light cast by the case of Stephanie and Sandra Bartels \n     of Hull, Iowa.\n       They are twins born in a South Dakota hospital 88 days \n     apart by what is called ``delayed-interval delivery.'' \n     Stephanie, born Jan. 5 when her mother went into premature \n     labor in the 23rd week of her pregnancy, weighed 1 pound, 2 \n     ounces. Sandra, weighing 7 pounds, 10 ounces, was born April \n     2, by which time Stephanie weighed 4 pounds, 10 ounces.\n       For 88 days, while her twin sister's life was protected by \n     the law, Sandra could have been, under the probable terms of \n     the Daschle ``compromise,'' aborted by any abortionist. This \n     is because under any language acceptable to the abortion \n     movement and hence to Clinton and Daschle, a baby does not \n     warrant legal protection merely because she is medically \n     ``viable,'' referring to the point at which she can survive \n     with good medical assistance, a point that now begins at \n     about 23 weeks. Location is the key factor: Unless she is \n     completely outside the mother, she is fair game for the \n     abortionist.\n       Daschle has at times said his measure will not put any \n     restrictions on abortions in the second trimester of \n     pregnancy, when about 90 percent of partial-birth abortions \n     occur, involving thousands of babies a year, many of them \n     potentially less precariously viable than Stephanie was. And \n     Daschle's language will contain a provision pertaining to \n     ``health,'' perhaps even an apparent limitation to \n     considerations of ``physical'' health. However, this will be \n     meaningless if the language grants the abortionist an \n     unreviewable right to determine when the exception applies.\n       During the 1996 campaign, Clinton, who had vetoed a ban on \n     partial-birth abortions, said he would support the ban if \n     there were a ``minor'' amendment creating only a ``very \n     stringent'' exception. It would allow such abortions to \n     prevent ``severe physical damage'' to the mother. Note the \n     word ``physical.''\n       However, the White House reportedly has told congressional \n     Democrats that Clinton's views are compatible with \n     ``compromise'' language proposed last month by Maryland Rep. \n     Steny Hoyer, co-chairman of the House Democratic Steering \n     Committee. Hoyer's language would permit post-viability \n     abortions whenever, ``in the medical judgment of the \n     attending physician'' (the abortionist), not performing the \n     abortion would have ``serious adverse health consequences.''\n       Does that include ``mental health'' consequences? Said \n     Hoyer, ``Yes, it does.''\n       To allay suspicions that this might be an infinitely \n     elastic loophole, he said, ``We're not talking about a \n     hangnail, we're not talking about a headache.'' However, a \n     suspicion unallayed by such flippancy is this: The \n     abortionist will be free to decide that not performing an \n     abortion will cause, say distress and depression sufficient \n     to constitute serious health consequences.\n       Daschle, following Hoyer's precedent, may leave the \n     definitions of ``viability'' and ``health'' up to the \n     abortionist. If so, this will be, says Douglas Johnson of the \n     National Right to Life Committee, akin to a law that \n     ostensibly bans ``assault weapons'' but empowers any gun \n     dealer to define an assault weapon.\n       So the Daschle ``compromise'' probably will aim to confer \n     on the supposedly restricted person, the abortionist, an \n     uncircumscribed right to define the critical terms of the \n     supposed restrictions. If enacted, such a ``compromise'' \n     would be a remarkable confection, a law that is impossible to \n     violate.\n                                  ____\n\n\n         [From the Argus Leader, Sioux Falls, SD, Apr. 2, 1997]\n\n      88-Day-Old Girl Awaits the Expected Birth Today of Her Twin\n\n                           (By Joyce Terveen)\n\n       Three-month-old Stephanie Bartels is expecting a twin baby \n     brother or sister any day now.\n       At 23 weeks into her pregnancy, Sarah Bartels, 23, of Hull, \n     Iowa, went into premature labor. Stephanie was born Jan. 5 at \n     Sioux Valley Hospital, fighting for life at 1 pound, 2 \n     ounces.\n       While doctors were unable to stop Stephanie's birth, they \n     have been successful in holding off the second birth.\n       The world record for what's called a delayed-interval \n     delivery is 92 days. Bartels is on day 88.\n       Her home since Stephanie's birth has been a hospital room. \n     But those days have been bearable, she said, because she can \n     go to the intensive-care nursery to help care for 4\\1/2\\-\n     pound Stephanie.\n       ``When I first saw Stephanie, she was skin and bones. Now \n     she's really a little chunk,'' said Bartels as she rested in \n     her hospital bed Tuesday.\n       Babies born at 23 weeks are on the statistical edge of \n     life, with one out of five making it. Forty weeks is \n     considered full term.\n       ``I remember that delivery vividly,'' said Dr. Martin \n     Vincent, the neonatologist who was working the night \n     Stephanie was born. ``The baby came out small and yet very \n     vigorous, wiggling her arms.''\n       The Bartels say it was difficult not being able to hold \n     their first-born for the first six weeks while she was on a \n     ventilator.\n       ``The first time I held her, it made me feel like a natural \n     dad,'' said David Bartels, a draftsman for an electrical \n     engineering firm in Sioux Center, Iowa. ``Before, she didn't \n     feel like she was mine.''\n       Stephanie is doing well and gaining weight. So is the \n     second twin, who is estimated to weigh 7 pounds, 13 ounces.\n       ``Since it was at the extreme of life, we tried to do what \n     we could to keep the second baby inside,'' said Dr. William \n     J. Watson, a perinatologist who handled Sarah's case because \n     her diabetes made her a high-risk patient. ``We've tried this \n     a number of times and have been unsuccessful.''\n       To delay the second birth, Watson stitched Bartels' cervix \n     to keep it closed. She was given antibiotics to fight off the \n     infection that had infected the membrane of the first twin. \n     She also took medications to prevent contractions.\n       The Bartels don't care if they break any records.\n       ``I just want to have my baby and go home,'' Bartels said.\n       They haven't worried yet about dealing with the question, \n     ``Why are we twins and born three months apart?''\n       ``We're just hoping the kids won't ask us that,'' Bartels \n     said.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    [From Roll Call, Feb. 27, 1997]\n\n   Partial-Birth Betrayal: Democrats Seething As Activist Admits Lie\n\n                          (By Charles E. Cook)\n\n       A quiet fight within the Democratic party went public \n     earlier this week with the statement by the leader of a major \n     pro-choice organization that he ``lied through [his] teeth'' \n     about the frequency and circumstances of the ``partial \n     birth'' abortion procedure during the 1995 debate on the \n     issue.\n       In an American Medical News article to be published March 3 \n     and quoted in Wednesday's New York Times, Ron Fitzsimmons, \n     executive director of the National Association of Abortion \n     Providers, said the procedure is performed far more often \n     than he and other pro-choice leaders had told the public and \n     Congress. His previous assurances had encouraged \n     Congressional Democrats to oppose a ban on the procedure, \n     which President Clinton vetoed.\n       The National Association of Abortion Providers is an \n     organization of more than 200 independent abortion clinics. \n     Fitzsimmons told the Times that he remains pro-choice and \n     still opposes a ban on the procedure, but was quoted as \n     saying that the lying, particularly in an appearance on ABC's \n     ``Nightline,'' ``made me physically ill.''\n       He said he told his wife the next day, ``I can't do it \n     again.''\n       Privately. Congressional Democrats and their strategists \n     have been seething for some time, feeling that they had been \n     set up by the pro-choice community. They say they were led to \n     believe that the procedure--in which a fetus is partially \n     delivered and then its skull is crushed before removal from \n     the birth canal--is quite rare and only used under \n     extraordinary circumstances, such as to save the life or \n     preserve the health of the mother, or when the fetus is \n     severely deformed.\n       The partial-birth abortion issue, though not widely used in \n     the 1996 elections, was extremely potent where it did come \n     up. It almost cost Democrats two Senate seats: in Iowa, where \n     Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin saw a comfortable lead evaporate \n     in a matter of days; and in Louisiana where it cost Democrat \n     Mary Landrieu 4 or 5 points, turning the race into the \n     closest Senate contest in Louisiana history.\n       Just a couple of days before the Fitzsimmons statement, a \n     Democratic strategist told me to expect Senate Democrats to \n     bring the issue back up to allow their Members to get on the \n     record against this procedure. They are bitter that they were \n     misled by pro-choice lobbyists--and that it almost cost them \n     dearly on Election Day.\n       To be sure, Democrats are not having second thoughts about \n     the abortion issue in general, but they now see that this \n     aspect of the debate is a certain political loser. They \n     concede that even many voters who otherwise are adamantly \n     pro-choice are squeamish about this particularly gruesome \n     procedure.\n       There is some evidence that the percentage of Americans who \n     are pro-choice under all circumstances has declined a few \n     points in the last couple of years. It's possible that \n     corresponds to the rise of this partial birth issue, which \n     until recently was unknown to the general public.\n       Should Democrats decide to backtrack on the partial-birth \n     issue, there is some question as to whether it will be a \n     meaningful retreat. The National Right to Life Committee \n     argues that while Clinton and Senate Minority Leader Tom \n     Daschle (D-SD) have ``indicated a willingness to accept a ban \n     on partial birth abortions if a `narrow' exception were added \n     for various serious health circumstances,'' the exceptions \n     amount to little, if any, change.\n\n[[Page S4531]]\n\n       The pro-life forces maintain that the Clinton-Daschle \n     proposal would only apply from the seventh month of pregnancy \n     onward, while most partial-birth abortions occur they say, \n     during the fifth and sixth months.\n       Furthermore, the NRLC opposes an exemption that would allow \n     the procedure to be performed to ``Protect a mother's future \n     fertility.'' They point to a statement former Surgeon General \n     C. Everett Koop and 400 other physicians that ``partial-birth \n     abortion is never medically necessary to protect a mother's \n     health or future fertility,'' and that it ``can pose a \n     significant threat to both her immediate health and future \n     fertility.''\n       Interestingly, this all comes on the heels of Congress \n     voting to release family planning funding for international \n     organizations. While that money technically isn't supposed to \n     be used to fund abortions, it has the effect of freeing up \n     other funds that can.\n       The pro-choice cause, in general, has not lost ground. But \n     this one extreme position has caused it significant harm--\n     especially in terms of credibility. Some of the movement's \n     best friends on Capitol Hill feel betrayed.\n       One of the most basic rules of lobbying is, ``Never lie to \n     a Member of Congress, particularly one of your friends.'' \n     Another is, ``Never ask a Member to do something that will \n     later jeopardize his seat.''\n       The pro-choice movement did both and will pay a price for \n     it.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Washington 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of the pending Feinstein \namendment. This amendment is not a creative or imaginative approach, \nthat has been implied but rather conforms to the law of the land. It is \nan amendment that simply says that the health and life protections \nextended to all women in Roe versus Wade will not be infringed upon. It \ngoes to the heart of this debate; will we act today to limit the rights \nand protections afforded all women by the U.S. Supreme Court or will we \nreaffirm that the life and health of a woman in this country must \nremain a priority.\n  There seems to be some confusion as to what Roe versus Wade and other \ncourts decisions say and do. When you carefully read the majority \nopinion issued by the Justices in the Roe versus Wade decision, the \nlimitations are quite clearly spelled out by the Court. The Justices \nspent a great deal of time and effort making the clear distinction \nbetween the rights of the women during the first two trimesters and the \nrights of the women in the last trimester once the fetus is viable. The \ncourts drew this line and made it clear that the State had an \noverriding interest in restricting and regulating post viability \nabortions. As a result, post viability abortions are prohibited, except \nwhen necessary to protect the life and health of the mother. The \nJustices recognized the importance of a woman's health and life and had \nevery confidence that women could make reasonable decisions. I simply \ndo not understand why many of my colleagues refuse to accept the courts \ndecisions and refuse to understand that late term, post viability \nabortions are only necessary when the life and health of the mother are \nin serious jeopardy.\n  While the language in this amendment simply reiterates what the \ncourts have said and what many States have enacted because many on the \nother side have distorted the facts and have waged a public relations \ncampaign against women and against doctors, I felt it was necessary to \nwork on language that will address some of the allegations that have \nbeen made. That is why I have worked with the minority leader on his \namendment that limits the scope of the health exemption without \njeopardizing the guarantees and protections of women in this country. I \nwould argue that this was not necessary, as I have full faith in women \nto make the right decision, but because of the allegations and \nmisconceptions that have we have heard and seen, I recognize that it is \nthe reasonable course of action.\n\n  I support the Feinstein amendment as it is consistent with what the \nStates have done and it ensures that women will not be subjected to \nserious threats to their health and life because some people simply \nwant to turn back the clock. I support this amendment because it goes \nbeyond the pending bill in that it will prohibit all post viability \nabortions, not just a procedure. As supporters of this amendment, we do \nnot claim to have the medical expertise to pick what procedures \nphysicians are allowed to utilize. Further, we recognize the fact that \nthe U.S. Senate should not be in the room with the physician and his or \nher patient.\n  I will also be a cosponsor of the Daschle language as I believe that \na responsible legislator, I must do everything I can to ensure that the \nlegisation we enact is constitutional and protects all citizens.\n  The Feinstein amendment does not and will not allow a healthy women \nto terminate a healthy pregnancy simply because she decides she no \nlonger wants to be a mother. That is illegal and will continue to be \nillegal for a physician to perform any abortion after viability unless \nthe women's health and life are in serious jeopardy. I ask my \ncolleagues to carefully read the language in this amendment and \nremember that women and doctors know the definition of serious health \nconsequences and to defeat the underlying legislation.\n  I would like to thank the sponsor of the amendment, Senator \nFeinstein. I know that Senator Feinstein has spent a great deal of time \nstudying this issue and working to ensure that we did not unduly burden \nphysicians and women.\n  I support her with this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to defeat \nthe underlying bill that is before us today.\n  I yield my time to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I see Senator Frist is to be \nrecognized.\n  I yield to him, and then I will wrap up, if that is agreeable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield myself approximately 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Feinstein-Boxer substitute \namendment in large part because the substitute amendment fails to \naddress what is the underlying bill on the floor; that is, to ban the \npartial-birth abortion procedure, a procedure that we all recognize to \nbe one that is brutal, that is unnecessary, and that is repulsive to \nour civilization today.\n  I feel that is what we need to ban, that specific procedure which has \nbeen described on this floor again and again in detail, that is \nshocking to us each time we hear it, as well as shocking to America.\n  The Feinstein-Boxer amendment shifts the focus away from that \nprocedure which we are attempting to ban and to prohibit, and enters \nanother area, another region, that I think needs to be debated. I \nappreciate the fact that Members on both sides of the aisle say that \ndebate deserves our attention and our discussion. But the problems I \nhave using this as a substitution amendment is twofold.\n  No. 1, the substitution amendment really does--this is my opinion--\nnothing to decrease the number of abortions that are being performed in \nthis country. I will come back to that and explain why.\n  No. 2, to use it as a substitution, I think, we cannot do, and, \ntherefore, I oppose the amendment, because it still allows the \nunderlying procedure of the partial-birth abortion, which, again, \ngraphically has been described as a fetus, a viable fetus, with \notherwise normal life to be delivered shortly, be delivered partially, \nand then killed. It is still allowed under the Feinstein-Boxer \nsubstitution amendment.\n  I will speak to the first point, because a lot of people will assume \nthat the Feinstein-Boxer substitution amendment encompasses a much \nbroader bill, and I think that is the way it is intended.\n  Let me go back to the amendment as written. This is the Feinstein-\nBoxer amendment. ``It shall be unlawful for a physician knowingly to \nperform an abortion after the fetus has become viable.''\n  I agree with that and wholeheartedly support that, and I agree with \nthe sponsors. I think the majority of people in this body think that is \ngood, that that is the right direction. But where I have a very \nsignificant problem, and a problem that has not been\n\n[[Page S4532]]\n\ntalked very much about on the floor but I think that we must address if \nwe are to consider this amendment in its entirety, is the exception \nclause. The exception law says what I just said--it does not apply if, \nin the medical judgment of the attending physician, the abortion is \nnecessary to preserve the life of the woman.\n  Again, I think most of us would agree with that wholeheartedly. But \nconcerning the part of the exception that says, ``or to avert serious \nadverse health consequences to the woman.''\n  Again, let me say my sensitivities to the health consequences are as \nstrong as everyone. I have taken a Hippocratic oath where I am totally \ndedicated as a physician to the health of the patient before me.\n  But, from the practical standpoint, ``serious adverse health \nconsequences'' is a huge exception that people will drive through to \npotentially perform more abortions than we see today. On the surface, \nit sounds so right, but, in truth, when you say ``health \nconsequences,'' to lay people it may seem something else. But it is \nalso such a loophole, such an exception, that people can take advantage \nof it. There are people out there who do.\n  Yesterday, I cited on the floor Dr. McMahon of California, who is \ndeceased, but who testified before committees in this body that he \nperformed 39 abortions for depression; a mother's depression. Does that \ndepression mean that she felt bad for a few days, or a few weeks and, \ntherefore, this fetus was killed; this viable fetus who would otherwise \nbe alive today was killed? I cited 9 cases where the infant's cleft lip \nwas cited to be the indication and, therefore, yes. A mother could say \nthat, ``I am depressed because my child will have a cleft lip.'' But \ndoes that justify killing an otherwise viable fetus? The whole issue of \nhealth is complicated. I have gone back to my colleagues again and \nagain saying, can you give me a good definition of health that we could \nwrite down, that we could put in statute and that people would agree \nwith?\n\n  Well, we all turn back to Doe versus Bolton and the definition of \nhealth as defined by Doe versus Bolton in 1973 in the Supreme Court \ndecision, and there health is defined as ``all factors, physical, \nemotional, psychological, familial, and the woman's age, relevant to \nthe well-being of the patient.''\n  As a physician, those are the sort of factors that you have to \nconsider when you are talking to a patient--their overall well-being. \nBut does it justify killing a viable fetus, a fetus that by definition \nof viability is alive, once taken out at that point in time, if taken \nout of the womb, will survive, will live? You are saying that some of \nthese factors, the overall well-being, the psychological factors at \nthat point in time, can be used to justify killing that otherwise \nviable fetus. I say no, and most people say ``no''. Yet we know, and it \nhas been cited in the Chamber, that people use that definition of \nhealth to perform, in the third trimester, procedures broadly--\nabortions, including a specific procedure we should outlaw under all \nconditions, the partial-birth abortion procedure.\n  What I have done is really gone back to talk to my colleagues to ask \nthem, and I have asked them point blank, is there a time when it is \nnecessary to destroy a viable fetus--remember, a viable fetus. And the \ndefinition I looked up in my old Steadman's Medical Dictionary, the \nclassic dictionary that we use as physicians. ``Viable'' is defined as \n``denoting a fetus sufficiently developed to live outside the uterus.'' \nA viable fetus, the fetus that is taken out of the womb at that point \nin time is alive, is a baby, will grow up to live a full life.\n  Thus, are there really any situations where we can kill that \notherwise viable fetus, full of life? And you say, well, life of the \nmother. There is general agreement that that may be--may be--may be a \nconsideration. That is put in the statute. But what about health \nconsequences, adverse health consequences which have been defined in \nDoe versus Bolton to use the emotional factors and psychological \nfactors? It says in here that an individual physician determines \nwhether or not those health consequences are adverse or not.\n  Well, that goes all over, all over the field. As a physician who \ndeals in end-of-life issues myself, I transplant hearts, so an adverse \nhealth condition to me might mean something very different than to a \ncardiologist who does not do heart surgery or transplant hearts. The \nsame is true of physicians. Adverse health consequence is going to vary \nfrom physician to physician.\n  We have seen in a report, as I have said, Dr. McMahan in California \ndoing 39 abortions for depression itself--again, depression. Is that \ntreatable? Would it have been gone in 1 week or 2 weeks? Or that cleft \nlip, which is disturbing--it would be disturbing to many of us as \nparents--is that justification for allowing an exception in an \namendment to abort fetuses in that third trimester, or viable fetuses? \nThat viability, I think, is a good definition in many ways because, \nremember, that child would live just taken out of the womb. Why kill a \nviable fetus under any situation? It really seems that this amendment \nshould rise or fall on this whole concept of serious adverse health \nconsequences.\n  I have a friend whom I turn to frequently. I would like to submit for \nthe Record an article that he had in the Nashville Tennessean on May \n13, 1997. It is by Dr. Frank Boehm. Dr. Boehm is professor of \nobstetrics and gynecology and director of obstetrics at Vanderbilt \nUniversity, highly regarded in his field. The editorial basically \naddresses the issue, is there ever a reason to abort a viable fetus? \nLet me quote one paragraph.\n\n       Pro-choice activists claim that abortion should \n     be available even at these later gestational stages in \n     order to save the life or health of a woman or if the \n     fetus is seriously malformed.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 10 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 more minutes.\n\n       While that may sound reasonable to some, it misses the \n     point. In the case when the life or health of a mother is in \n     jeopardy and her fetus has reached a chance of survival \n     outside the womb--\n\n  As an aside, that is viability--\n\n     (currently 24 weeks), physicians can deliver that child by \n     either cesarean section or induction of labor without \n     compromising the mother.\n\n  Dr. Frank Boehm, the Nashville Tennessean May 13, 1997.\n  Adverse health consequences, a huge door, a huge door that the \nmedical profession is not going to agree on from one person to another.\n  Well, what this amendment, unfortunately, does, by putting this \nexception in there, it says that, no, you do not do abortions after the \nfetus has become viable except under adverse health conditions, which \nmeans, as a physician, if you say there is an adverse health condition, \ngo do the abortion, go kill a viable fetus, an individual who by \ndefinition will grow up and live a full life, a viable fetus.\n  Mr. President, let me just go back and say I oppose the amendment on \nsubstance itself, but even that aside, I would argue that it does not \ndo what the intent of the underlying bill does, and that is to outlaw a \nbrutal and unnecessary, a malicious procedure which destroys life, and \nthat is the partial-birth abortion procedure. It should be banned.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 18\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. And how much time resides with the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. About 19\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I see the Senator on his feet. Perhaps \nI will yield at this time and reserve the remainder of my time for a \nwrap-up comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania.\n  We are discussing the partial-birth abortion ban, a horrible \nprocedure likened to infanticide--late-term abortions as our \ndistinguished and knowledgeable colleague from Tennessee has described \nto us.\n  Normally, when we come to the floor, we talk about subjects about \nwhich we have read in books or what we have\n\n[[Page S4533]]\n\nlearned from briefings, but we have just heard the Senator from \nTennessee, who is an accomplished and distinguished surgeon, describe \nas best one can describe why this is an objectionable, totally \nunnecessary and unwarranted procedure--a fully developed fetus, viable, \nbrought down the birth canal feet first, and then delivered all but the \nhead. Then the abortionist takes a pair of scissors, inserts them in \nthe back of the baby's neck, collapses the brain and the baby is \ndelivered dead.\n  The overwhelming majority of people in America and Missourians will \nvote against this. Last night, the Missouri General Assembly passed a \nban by veto majority. When we debated the issue last summer and fall, I \nreceived over 50,000 letters and post cards supporting the ban. No \nother issue has generated that amount of mail.\n  The issue would be settled if President Clinton had not vetoed the \nbill last year against the wishes of an overwhelming number of \nAmericans.\n  A word about the amendments now before us. These amendments were \nwritten by opponents of the ban, supporters of the procedure. They \ncontain loopholes big enough to drive a truck through. The Feinstein \namendment contains a loophole big enough to drive a train through. The \namendments we are considering will do nothing to stop partial-birth \nabortions or other forms of late-term abortions, as Senator Frist has \nso eloquently noted. I hope the Senate will reject the Feinstein and \nDaschle amendments and pass the partial-birth abortion ban today.\n  I yield the floor. I thank my colleague for the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to wrap up, if I might. \nLet me begin by saying that you have just heard on our side from four \nwomen Senators and the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, who is \nnot lucky enough to be a woman, but from four women. All of us have \nbeen pregnant; all of us have given birth to a child; two of us are \ngrandparents. And I think among the four of us there is an \nunderstanding of the vicissitudes and the problems that are inherent \nboth in our physiology as well as in a pregnancy. It is my contention \nthat the bill before us, H.R. 1122, is about much more than one \nprocedure.\n  Let me quote from the only Member among us who is a physician in his \ncomments yesterday on this floor. I am reading from the Congressional \nRecord.\n\n       From the outset, I will admit that it has been difficult \n     for me to imagine how a procedure that is not taught in \n     residency programs where obstetricians are trained--it is not \n     taught today; it is not referenced in our peer-reviewed \n     journals, which is really the substance, the literature \n     through which we teach each other and share information; it \n     is not in peer-reviewed journals--it is a little bit hard for \n     me to understand how people could argue that this is the best \n     procedure available. Really until the recent controversy, \n     many practitioners who you talk to had never heard of this \n     particular procedure.\n\n  In fact, that is the case. I would now like to quote from the AMA \nreport of the board of trustees dated yesterday:\n\n       From a medical perspective the language used in the \n     proposed legislation--H.R. 1122--``partially vaginally \n     deliver a living fetus before killing the fetus and \n     completing the delivery'' does not refer to a specific \n     obstetrical/surgical technique, nor does it refer to a \n     specific stage of gestation (i.e., pre- or post-viability). \n     In fact, the description in the proposed legislation could be \n     interpreted to include many recognized abortion and obstetric \n     techniques (such as those used during dilation and evacuation \n     (D & E)) or other procedures used to induce abortion.\n\n  This is exactly my concern about H.R. 1122. I think H.R. 1122, as I \ndescribed earlier, is in fact a Trojan horse. It is not what it seems \nto be. Not one medical procedure is referenced in H.R. 1122. Rather, a \nvague definition of what is called partial-birth abortion. Partial-\nbirth abortion is referred to nowhere in any of the medical literature. \nI believe the reason this bill is drafted that way is because it is \nmuch broader in what it intends to do. I believe what it intends to do \nis essentially stop second- and third-trimester abortions with no \nconsideration for the woman's health.\n  Now, you have heard here today, you have heard descriptions by my \ncolleague, Senator Boxer, and by myself, and by the other women, of \ninstances of malformed, seriously malformed, fetuses which cannot \nsustain life outside the womb. Yet, leaving a woman to have to deliver \nthese babies could present a considerable risk to her health.\n  Now, what we are struggling to do is find a way to say we agree there \nshould not be third-trimester abortions, except--except when the life \nor the health of the mother is at risk. And then we are trying to set a \ndefinition of health that will meet the constitutional test of Roe \nversus Wade.\n  What is clear to me is that restrictive definitions of health will \nnot meet the constitutional test of Roe versus Wade. So we have taken \nthe definition that we believe will stand the test of \nconstitutionality, ``serious, adverse health consequences for the \nwoman,'' and we, more fundamentally in the regulations we prescribe in \nsection 4 of our bill, say, ``We are requiring an attending physician, \ndescribed in section 2(b), to certify to the Department of Health and \nHuman Services that, in the best medical judgment of the physician, the \nabortion described was medically necessary to preserve the life or to \navert serious adverse health consequences to the woman involved.'' And \nthen--this is the important language--``and to describe the medical \nindications supporting the judgment.'' So that the physician who makes \nthe decision that the life or health of the mother is dependent on an \nabortion must support that, must indicate what his medical judgments \nwere, must indicate what the condition of the fetus was.\n  One of the big problems in this debate--and I say this respectfully \nto the Senator from Pennsylvania, because reasonable people can \ndiffer--is that conditions of the health of the mother and conditions \nof the fetus can also vary. We all know there are medical diagnoses. We \nknow that within these medical diagnoses the severity can differ. \nConditions have different degrees of seriousness. Severe, serious \nabnormalities incompatible with life--that is also what we are talking \nabout in this bill. I believe that within the confines of Roe versus \nWade, we have developed a constitutional measure which prohibits third-\ntrimester abortions, provides a health and life exception that is \nconstitutional, provides that the medical doctor must give his reasons \nand his findings as to why, if he does perform a third-trimester \nabortion, he or she is performing it, and outline these conditions. And \nwe also provide substantial penalties--$100,000 on the first offense \nplus referral to the State Board of Medical Examiners for possible \nsuspension of the medical license; and on a second offense, up to \n$250,000 and referral to the State Board of Medical Examiners for \npossible revocation of licensing.\n  These are very hefty sums. I believe they provide a sufficient \ndeterrent to the practice of third-trimester abortions unless the most \nserious situation is present.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield for a moment?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Can I finish my thought?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely. When my friend is ready, I have a question to \nask her.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. In the findings of this same AMA paper, the American \nMedical Association board goes on to make this statement:\n\n       The partial-birth abortion is not a medical term. The \n     American Medical Association will use the term, `intact \n     dilation and extraction,' to refer to a specific procedure \n     comprised of the following elements:\n\n  And then they describe the elements:\n\n       This procedure is distinct from dilation and evacuation \n     procedures more commonly used to induce abortion after the \n     first trimester. Because partial-birth abortion is not a \n     medical term, it will not be used by the American Medical \n     Association. [And then it goes on.] According to the \n     scientific literature, there does not appear to be any \n     identified situation in which intact D is the only \n     appropriate procedure to induce abortion, and ethical \n     concerns have been raised about intact D We have heard \n     these concerns. The American Medical Association recommends \n     that the procedure not be used unless alternative procedures \n     pose materially greater risk to the women. The physician \n     must, however, retain the discretion to make that judgment, \n     acting within standards of good medical practice and in the \n     best interests of the patient.\n\n  I happen to believe that is a correct judgment. I happen to believe \nthat the physician must retain the discretion.\n\n[[Page S4534]]\n\n And I must tell you, it scares me when this body is prepared to write \nin the concrete of a law that every State in this Union must abide by \ntheir judgments, untrained, unskilled, never, for the most part, having \ngiven birth to a child, never, for the most part, being intimately \nfamiliar with the physiology of a woman, and, yet, has the gumption to \nsay: We are going to write laws. We are not going to have a health \nexception. And everybody in the United States is going to have to \ncomply with this.\n  I find that somewhat scary, because conditions do vary. Health \ncircumstances do vary. We all know we can have a certain condition, and \nfor some people it will be benign; for others, it can be terminal. And \nit can be the same condition. In terms of abnormalities, hydrocephalus \nhas been mentioned on this floor. I have visited, in the old days, \ninstitutions where children walked around with their head on a crib \nbecause the head was so big they could not lift it off the crib.\n  Medical science is wonderful. Now hydrocephalus, in many cases--not \nall--can be handled. So you can't say all hydrocephalics have the same \nproblem. But it is conceivable, and it does happen, that there are \nserious hydrocephalic implications in some fetuses which make it \nimpossible for them to sustain life on the outside, past any amount of \ntime, or to be delivered in a way that they will not irreparably damage \nthe health of the mother. This is also true.\n  But there are variations and there are gradations. This legislation, \nH.R. 1122, does not take that into consideration. Rather, it says that, \nwholesale, anything that can come under the rubric of partial-birth \nabortion is hitherto prohibited. And if you commit it--we do not know \nwhat it is, the medical literature does not know what it is--but if you \ncommit it, doctor, M.D., you are guilty of a crime. Can you imagine \nwhat this is going to do throughout the United States of America? It is \ngoing to have a chilling effect. Not only that. In addition to that, \neverybody out there can sue.\n  I am perplexed why, if one wants to outlaw a particular procedure, \nwhy that procedure is not written up. It has been spoken about. It has \nbeen described. It is contained in specificity in this Record. But it \nis not in the legislation. Instead, the legislation has a much more \nsweeping impact. All one has to do, in my view, is read that \nlegislation.\n  Senator Boxer, Senator Moseley-Braun, and I have tried to write a \npiece of legislation which is very strong, which prohibits as a matter \nof law third-trimester abortions except when the life and the health of \nthe mother are at stake, and which defines health in a way that it will \nmeet a constitutional test.\n  I believe we have done it. And it provides civil penalties that will \ndeter and also say to the physician, as an additional test, if you \nperform one of these third-trimester abortions, know that you have to \nput in writing, subject to investigation, and send to the Federal \nDepartment of Health and Human Services the conditions, the reasons to \njustify that abortion. I think that is a sound piece of legislation.\n  I do not think we will win because I think, unfortunately, this \ndebate has been so characterized by egregious situations that \neverything other than the egregious situation has suddenly been washed \naway. Yet everything other than the egregious situation is out there in \nAmerica every single day. I submit that, if legislation does not cover \nwhat is the real life of people, and the many different things to which \nthey are subjected, you are going to have a much higher rate of both \nmorbidity, which is physical harm to women, and mortality, which is \ndeath to women. That is the way it was before, and that is the way it \nwill be again if we set the clock back.\n  So I must--I know my colleague from California would like to make \nsome comments--I would like to yield the floor to her. But I must \nearnestly implore this body, I would be very hopeful that Members will \nvote for this amendment and vote no on H.R. 1122.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, there is about 2 minutes remaining? Thank \nyou.\n  Let me just thank my colleague. Again, I have been extremely proud to \nstand with her, really proud to stand with her and Senator Moseley-\nBraun. When we started maybe we had 3 votes, our own. I do believe we \nwill do considerably better than that. I do believe, if the people who \nwatch this debate--that we would get even more votes if they would get \non the phone and tell their Senator what this is all really about.\n  I was going to ask my colleague, but since there is no time to ask a \nparticular question I want to share with her an editorial today that \nran in USA Today, because it backs up everything my colleague has said. \nIt says that: ``The Partial-Birth ban would stop few, if any, \nabortions.'' We know that is true because the Santorum bill does not go \nafter any other procedure. ``But it would set a precedent of lawmakers \nplaying doctor.''\n  I think this point has been made by us, over and over again. We do \nhave a lot of confidence in ourselves around here. To be a U.S. Senator \nyou have to have confidence. But we do not have, save for one of us, a \nmedical degree. It is the height of ego, to me, to then decide we are \ngoing to be, not only lawmakers, but doctors. It is really somewhat \nextraordinary. Especially, it is more extraordinary because this issue \nis going to be so harmful to women.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time of the Senator from California has \nexpired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent for 25 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 17 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield the Senator from California 25 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, that is very nice of you.\n  I would say the one thing that broke my heart today was when the \nSenator from Pennsylvania said, ``How could someone kill their son or \ndaughter.'' They are talking about these women, these women who \ndesperately wanted these children. These families like Coreen Costello, \nand Eileen Sullivan. These are the faces: Viki Wilson and Maureen \nBritell. And, last, Vikki Stella.\n  These women, these men, these families wanted these babies. They did \nnot kill their child. They desperately wanted a baby. I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for his efforts \nhere. I thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, let me just preface my comments by saying I will be \nspeaking on the bill generally, as opposed to specifically to the \namendment before us. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for giving \nme that chance.\n  Obviously, abortion is an issue on which people disagree. We have \nseen much of that disagreement expressed here on the floor of the \nSenate. We see it expressed in the debates, whether it is at public \nmeetings or around coffee tables around our country all the time.\n  It does seem to me, though, that we ought to be able to agree on some \nthings with respect to abortion, even when people are on different \nsides. One of those should be the fact that there are too many \nabortions and we should have fewer abortions in this country. I would \nhope we could agree on that.\n  I hope we could agree also that certain types of abortions are wrong. \nPartial-birth abortion, in my judgment, is an example of an abortion \nprocedure that is wrong. We have had the procedure itself described \nhere on the floor, both in the course of this debate and in previous \ndebates on this issue. I do not have to retell the horrible details \nthat we have all become familiar with. It seems to me almost on its \nface that we ought to be able to come to an agreement that that type of \nprocedure is wrong and ought not take place in our country.\n  In addition, contrary to the claims of some of the advocates, those \non the other side of this issue, it is not an anesthetic which causes \nthe child, the baby to die during a partial-birth abortion. Indeed, \nlast year when we confronted this issue in the Judiciary Committee, we \nhad several discussions about the actual cause of death.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record both the \ntestimony, as well as questions and answers, that related to that issue \nwhich\n\n[[Page S4535]]\n\nwas before the Judiciary Committee last year.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Statement of Norig Ellison, M.D., President, American Society of \n Anesthesiologists--Before the Subcommittee on the Constitution, House \n                   of Representatives, Mar. 21, 1996\n\n       Chairman Canady, members of the Subcommittee. My name is \n     Norig Ellison, M.D., I am the President of the American \n     Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), a national professional \n     society consisting of over 34,000 anesthesiologists and other \n     scientists engaged or specially interested in the medical \n     practice of anesthesiology. I am also Professor and Vice-\n     Chair of the Department of Anesthesiology at the University \n     of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia and a \n     staff anesthesiologist at the Hospital of the University of \n     Pennsylvania.\n       I appear here today for one purpose, and one purpose only: \n     to take issue with the testimony of James. T. McMahon, M.D., \n     before this Subcommittee last June. According to his written \n     testimony, of which I have a copy, Dr. McMahon stated that \n     anesthesia given to the mother as part of dilation and \n     extraction abortion procedure eliminates any pain to the \n     fetus and that a medical coma is induced in the fetus, \n     causing a ``neurological fetal demise'', or--in lay terms--\n     ``brain death''.\n       I believe this statement to be entirely inaccurate. I am \n     deeply concerned, moreover, that the widespread publicity \n     given to Dr. McMahon's testimony may cause pregnant women to \n     delay necessary, even lifesaving, medical procedures, totally \n     unrelated to the birthing process, due to misinformation \n     regarding the effect of anesthetics on the fetus. Annually \n     over 50,000 pregnant women are anesthetized for such \n     necessary procedures.\n       Although it is certainly true that some general analgesic \n     medications given to the mother will reach the fetus and \n     perhaps provide some pain relief, it is equally true that \n     pregnant women are routinely heavily sedated during the \n     second or third trimester for the performance of a variety of \n     necessary surgical procedures with absolutely no adverse \n     effect on the fetus, let alone death or ``brain death''. In \n     my medical judgment, it would be necessary--in order to \n     achieve ``neurological demise'' of the fetus in a ``partial \n     birth'' abortion--to anesthetize the mother to such a degree \n     as to place her own health in serious jeopardy.\n       As you are aware, Mr. Chairman, I gave the same testimony \n     to a Senate committee four months ago. That testimony \n     received wide circulation in anesthesiology circles and to a \n     lesser extent in the lay press. You may be interested in the \n     fact that since my appearance, not one single \n     anesthesiologist or other physician has contacted me to \n     dispute my stated conclusions. Indeed, two eminent obstetric \n     anesthesiologists appear with me today, testifying on their \n     own behalf and not as ASA representatives. I am pleased to \n     note that their testimony reaches the same conclusions that I \n     have expressed.\n       Thank you for your attention. I am happy to respond to your \n     questions.\n                                  ____\n\n       After Dr. Norig Ellison presented his prepared testimony at \n     the Nov. 17 public hearing before the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee, the following exchange occurred among Senator \n     Spence Abraham (R-Mi.); Dr. Mary Campbell, medical director \n     of Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington; and Dr. \n     Ellison.\n       Senator Abraham [to Dr. Campbell]. Would you make the \n     statement then that the fetus dies due to the anesthesia? Is \n     that your position?\n       Dr. Campbell (Medical Director, Planned Parenthood of \n     Metropolitan Washington). I think the fetus has no pain \n     because of the anesthesia. I do not----\n       Senator Abraham. No, I'm asking you whether you think \n     that's what causes the fetus to die?\n       Dr. Campbell. I do not know what causes the fetus to die. \n     The fetuses are dead when delivered.\n       Senator Abraham. Well, let me just direct you, if I could--\n     I have here a factsheet that indicates it was prepared by you \n     which relates to the House legislation in which----\n       [Sen. Abraham was referring to ``H.R. 1833, Medical \n     Questions and Answers,'' which contains the caption, ``Fact \n     Sheet Prepared by Mary Campbell, M.D.'' This document was \n     circulated to Members of the House of Representatives in \n     October, before HR 1833 came to a vote in that house. This \n     document contains the following passage:\n       ``Q: When does the fetus die?\n       ``A: The fetus dies of an overdose of anesthesia given to \n     the mother intravenously. A dose is calculated for the \n     mother's weight which is 50 to 100 times the weight of the \n     fetus. The mother gets the anesthesia for each insertion of \n     the dilators, twice a day. This induces brain death in a \n     fetus in a matter of minutes. Fetal demise therefore occurs \n     at the beginning of the procedure while the fetus is still in \n     the womb.'']\n       Dr. Campbell. I was quoting Dr. McMahon at that time. \n     [Editor's note: There is no reference to Dr. McMahon anywhere \n     in Dr. Campbell's five-page factsheet.] On thinking it over \n     in more depth, I believe because there are no EEG studies \n     available----\n       Senator Abraham. So you no longer adhere to the position \n     that you say in here, ``the fetus dies of an overdose of \n     anesthesia given to the mother intravenously.'' That is no \n     longer your position?\n       Dr. Campbell. I believe that is true.\n       Senator Abraham. You believe that is true?\n       Dr. Campbell. I believe that is true.\n       Senator Abraham. Dr. Ellison, would you like to comment on \n     that?\n       Dr. Ellison (President, American Society of \n     Anesthesiologists). There is absolutely no basis in \n     scientific fact for that statement. There is--I can present \n     you a study in the American Journal of Obstetrics and \n     Gynecology, 1989, by [names inaudible] et al, of 5,400 cases \n     of women having surgery having general anesthesia or regional \n     anesthesia in which the fetus did not suffer demise. I think \n     the suggestion that the anesthesia given to the mother, be it \n     regional or general, is going to cause brain death of the \n     fetus is without basis of fact.\n       Dr. Campbell. I have not said brain death. I'm saying no \n     spontaneous respirations, no movement.\n       Senator Abraham. Well, that's what you are saying today, \n     but in this fact sheet, which you prepared I believe fairly \n     recently, it says, ``The fetus dies''--there's no qualifying \n     regarding breathing or anything else--``of an overdoes of \n     anesthesia.'' I mean, that is a very clear statement \n     assertion.\n       Dr. Campbell. [Pause] I simplified that for Congress. \n     [Outburst of laughter from audience.] I do not actually \n     believe that you want a full discussion of when death occurs.\n       Senator Abraham. Well, we are forced to make those \n     decisions, and I guess my question is that how many other \n     things would you say in the fact sheet or in your statements \n     today have been likewise simplified in this dramatic fashion?\n       Dr. Campbell. Since I have over 28 years of education and \n     experience in medicine, I would say that is a great deal less \n     and a great deal more simple than what I know.\n       Senator Abraham. Well, it seems to me that there's a rather \n     substantial disparity between what Dr. Ellison says and what \n     you are both saying now and have certainly written here. I \n     just am wondering how that bears on other comments that have \n     been made.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, at that time, we heard from some of the \nadvocates on behalf of maintaining the current practice that it was an \nanesthetic that was the reason the baby died. The National Council of \nAnesthesiologists, I think, conclusively and irreversibly rebutted that \nposition.\n  I was struck--and as the testimony I have had printed in the Record \nwill indicate--by the efforts on the part of the advocates to try to \nfuzz up this issue and make assertions that were patently inaccurate \nand inconsistent during the course of that hearing.\n  In my judgment, we should be able to end this practice and we should \nbe able to end it in the context of this legislation which provides, I \nthink, protections for the life of the mother in sufficient fashion to \nmeet whatever standards society might demand.\n  I understand why some had concerns the last time we debated this \nissue. Back then, we were told that only a few of these partial-birth \nabortions were conducted per year. We were told that they only occurred \nlate, very late, in the process of a pregnancy, so late that this was \nthe only option available. We were also told that they were exclusively \nused in these very rare circumstances to deal with serious fetal \ndefects in high-risk circumstances.\n  But this year we enter the debate in a different context. We now know \nthat those three pieces of information were not true. As we learned \nfrom Ron Fitzsimmons of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, \nit is not the case that only a few such procedures occur per year. It \nis not the case that these only occur very late during a pregnancy, and \nit is not the case that they only occur in instances of serious fetal \ndeformities and risk. They happen too often, they happen too early, and \nthey happen without the kinds of circumstances and without the same \njustifications we were told were the exclusive conditions under which \nthey took place.\n  In my judgment, those statements from Mr. Fitzsimmons, combined with \nthe statements just printed in the Record from Dr. Campbell a year ago, \nmake me wonder how many of the other assertions we heard during the \ndebate from so-called experts in favor of this practice are correct. I \ndon't know the answer to that. I have serious questions about some of \nthe arguments made in support of the maintenance of these practices.\n  There are, however, a variety of facts which have come to light \nduring the debate this year that seem to me not only to be accurate but \nhave strong bearing on how Members of this body should deal with this \nissue.\n  The Physicians' Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth, a 600-member group of \nphysician\n\n[[Page S4536]]\n\nspecialists, issued a variety of statements in specific reference to \npartial-birth abortions. Included is this the statement:\n\n       Partial-birth abortion is never medically necessary to \n     protect the mother's health or her future fertility. On the \n     contrary, this procedure can pose a significant threat to \n     both.\n\n  In addition, that organization has indicated:\n\n       It is never medically necessary in order to protect a \n     woman's life, health, or future fertility, to deliberately \n     kill an unborn child in the second and third trimester of \n     pregnancy, and certainly not by mostly delivering the child \n     before putting him or her to death.\n\n  For these reasons, I hope that we can join together--a majority of us \nalready have--and I hope this time an overwhelming majority of us will \njoin together to support the legislation before us offered by the \nSenator from Pennsylvania.\n  In light of the new information, both the refutation of the claims \nmade by proponents of the partial-birth abortion procedure, as well as \nthose made by the various physician committees that have now emerged in \nsupport of the abolition of this practice, it seems to me that it is \ntime for us to end this horrible procedure.\n  I just want to make two other comments, Mr. President. They go to \npart of the debate which I have been watching for several days now and \nrecollect from last year, and that is the argument that we hear because \nwe are not doctors in this body, we lack the expertise to deal with \nthese issues. It is true that only one of us is a doctor, but we have \nheard from him, and I think he has been very compelling in his \nstatements on the floor that it is time for us to end the partial-birth \nabortion procedure. If a doctor's advice makes sense, the advice of our \ndoctor from Tennessee should make sense to all of us.\n\n  It also is the case that we, as Members of the Senate, are called \nupon to act as experts in a variety of areas where our own experiences, \neducation and training have not necessarily prepared us before our \nelections to do the people's business. None of us, I don't believe, in \nthis body, are nuclear physicists, and yet we are regularly called upon \nto make important decisions with respect to nuclear policy. Not all of \nus in this body have expertise or have served in the military, and yet \nall of us are called upon to make extraordinarily difficult choices \nwith respect to the defense of our Nation. On and on it goes across the \nspectrum of issues.\n  This is not a unique circumstance. It is consistent with the \nresponsibilities we have here to make judgments, to learn the facts, to \ndo the best we can and to consult the experts. We have done that on \nthis issue, and that is why I believe a majority of Members in this \nChamber are going to vote to end the partial-birth abortion practice.\n  I will just conclude with my own personal experiences, two of them. \nFirst involves the experience my wife and I had, which I have related \nbefore on this floor, and it is a major reason why I support this \nlegislation. When our two oldest children were born almost 4 years ago, \nthey were very early in the process. They were twins, and they came \nearly. We were in a neonatal intensive care unit for several weeks with \nthem.\n  We were lucky because our children were sufficiently developed that \nthey were able to come home with us after a fairly brief stay, but we \nalso got to know the families whose children came at an earlier point \nin the pregnancy, some who were born with birthweights under 2 pounds, \nsome almost 1 pound--small, tiny children who would be potential \nvictims of the partial-birth abortion procedure, struggling and \nsurviving. We were lucky, as I say, because our daughters were born \nfairly well along in the process, so we only were in that circumstance \nfor a couple of weeks.\n  But just a few months ago, we had it occur again in our family, this \ntime my wife's sister, whose child was born I believe in the 28th week \nof pregnancy and was, therefore, in the neonatal intensive care unit \nfor many, many weeks.\n  The experiences we have gone through, the familiarity we have \ndeveloped with these tiny newborn babies and their struggle for \nsurvival makes at least this Senator extraordinarily committed to \ntrying to protect and defend those babies. I believe, at a minimum, we \nshould be able to protect them from practices such as the partial-birth \nabortion. For that reason, today I speak in support of the legislation.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor back to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for \nhis excellent statement and for his tremendous defense of the unborn, \nparticularly on this particular issue. He has been a partner in \nproviding information to Senators on the facts, the real facts of what \nhas gone on here on the issue of partial-birth abortion. I want to \naddress a couple of things the Senators from California talked about in \nclosing my remarks.\n  The Senator from California said that conditions could differ; that \nthere is always a chance that something could happen.\n  I will just refer again to the quote from over about 500 physicians, \nincluding many people who deal in the area of maternal fetal medicine, \nperinatology, people who deal with high-risk pregnancies. The experts--\nwe hear so much about we are not the experts. I am not the expert. I am \ntalking about the people who are the experts. This is what the experts \nsay. They don't equivocate. Senator Frist read from the head of \nobstetrics at Vanderbilt University, one of the most prestigious \nuniversities in our country. He agrees with this comment:\n\n       While it may become necessary, in the second or third \n     trimester, to end a pregnancy in order to protect the \n     mother's life or health, abortion is never required--i.e., it \n     is never medically necessary, in order to preserve a woman's \n     life, health or future fertility, to deliberately kill an \n     unborn child in the second or third trimester, and certainly \n     not by mostly delivering the child before putting him or her \n     to death. What is required in the circumstances specified by \n     Senator Daschle--\n\n  Boxer-Feinstein--\n\n     is separation of the child from the mother, not the death of \n     the child.\n\n  It is never necessary. According to doctors, not Rick Santorum, \naccording to doctors who practice in this speciality, hundreds of them, \nit is not necessary, you don't have to kill the child.\n  Let's use your own common sense. Use our own common sense. Here is \nthis procedure. You have dilated the cervix over 2 days, you brought \nthe baby into position feet first, you have taken it out of the womb, \nyou have taken it out of the uterus, out of the birth canal, the baby \nis completely out of the mother's uterus, birth canal, except the head. \nTell me what health reason of the mother requires you to kill this \nbaby? These babies are very small. You can see the hands of the \nphysician compared to the size of this baby. This baby can fit in the \npalm of your hand. Why do you have to kill this baby?\n  There is no reason, as these doctors just said, that you cannot at \nleast give this baby some chance, some chance of living. Why? In fact, \nthe argument is made by several doctors who have written me that by \npuncturing the base of the skull like that in a blind procedure--you \ncannot see the area where you are inserting these scissors--that you \nrisk, obviously, missing, causing damage, you risk--and this is \ngraphic, but it, again, was written to me by several physicians--the \nsplintering of the skull can cause problems. I know this is graphic \nstuff, but this is reality. This is what they want to keep legal, and \nthey believe that this protects the woman's health. I guarantee you \nthis does not protect the woman's health.\n  There is no reason at this point to kill this baby, but they insist \nupon having that choice. This is the choice right here. It is not a \nchoice. It doesn't have to be a choice. It is not me saying it doesn't \nhave to be a choice, it is doctor after doctor, specialist after \nspecialist saying it doesn't have to be a choice.\n  Their legislation pretends to bar third-trimester abortions, \npostviability abortions with a narrow health exception, they suggest. \nWhat they say is that it comports with Roe versus Wade. We know what \nRoe versus Wade and Doe versus Bolton say that health is anything--\nmental health, depression, the mother is young. Those are all reasons \napproved by the courts to allow an abortion any time--any time--for any \nreason. Those are all legitimate health reasons. They continue to be \nhealth reasons.\n\n[[Page S4537]]\n\n  They say we don't want elective abortions. Let me tell you what Dr. \nWarren Hern said--again, Dr. Warren M. Hern, author of ``Abortion \nPractice,'' what I am told is the definitive textbook on abortions who \ndoes second- and third-trimester abortions, said it yesterday in the \nBergen County Record, and I will repeat it:\n\n       I will certify that any pregnancy is a threat to a woman's \n     life and could cause grievous injury to her physical health.\n\n  The Boxer-Feinstein amendment does not say anything about physical \nhealth. This is the Daschle amendment he is referring to, which also \ndoes not do anything. But there is never a case, according to Dr. Hern, \nwhere he cannot do an abortion and claim physical health.\n  He says it again, just in case he was misquoted, in today's USA \nToday:\n\n       I say every pregnancy carries a risk of death.\n\n  What this amendment does is nothing. If you want to stop partial-\nbirth abortions, vote against the Boxer-Feinstein amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). All time has expired.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Comprehensive Abortion Ban \n     Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) As the Supreme Court recognized in Roe v. Wade, the \n     government has an ``important and legitimate interest in \n     preserving and protecting the health of the pregnant woman . \n     . . and has still another important and legitimate interest \n     in protecting the potentiality of human life. These interests \n     are separate and distinct. Each grow in substantiality as the \n     woman approaches term and, at a point during pregnancy, each \n     becomes compelling''.\n       (2) In delineating at what point the Government's interest \n     in fetal life becomes ``compelling'', Roe v. Wade held that \n     ``a State may not prohibit any woman from making the ultimate \n     decision to terminate her pregnancy before viability'', a \n     conclusion reaffirmed in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern \n     Pennsylvania v. Casey.\n       (3) Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. \n     Casey also reiterated the holding in Roe v. Wade that the \n     government's interest in potential life becomes compelling \n     with fetal viability, stating that ``subsequent to viability, \n     the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of \n     human life may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, \n     abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical \n     judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the \n     mother''.\n       (4) According to the Supreme Court, viability ``is the time \n     at which there is a realistic possibility of maintaining and \n     nourishing a life outside the womb, so that the independent \n     existence of the second life can in reason and all fairness \n     be the object of State protection that now overrides the \n     rights of the woman''.\n       (5) The Supreme Court has thus indicated that it is \n     constitutional for Congress to ban abortions occurring after \n     viability so long as the ban does not apply when a woman's \n     life or health faces a serious threat.\n       (6) Even when it is necessary to terminate a pregnancy to \n     save the life or health of the mother, every medically \n     appropriate measure should be taken to deliver a viable \n     fetus.\n       (7) It is well established that women may suffer serious \n     health conditions during pregnancy, such as breast cancer, \n     preeclampsia, uterine rupture or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, \n     among others, that may require the pregnancy to be \n     terminated.\n       (8) While such situations are rare, not only would it be \n     unconstitutional but it would be unconscionable for Congress \n     to ban abortions in such cases, forcing women to endure \n     severe damage to their health and, in some cases, risk early \n     death.\n       (9) In cases where the mother's health is not at such high \n     risk, however, it is appropriate for Congress to assert its \n     ``compelling interest'' in fetal life by prohibiting \n     abortions after fetal viability.\n       (10) While many States have banned abortions of viable \n     fetuses, in some States it continues to be legal for a \n     healthy woman to abort a viable fetus.\n       (11) As a result, women seeking abortions may travel \n     between the States to take advantage of differing State laws.\n       (12) To prevent abortions of viable fetuses not \n     necessitated by severe medical complications, Congress must \n     act to make such abortions illegal in all States.\n       (13) abortion of a viable fetus should be prohibited \n     throughout the United States, unless a woman's life or health \n     is threatened and, even when it is necessary to terminate the \n     pregnancy, every measure should be taken, consistent with the \n     goals of protecting the mother's life and health, to preserve \n     the life and health of the fetus.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Prohibition of post-viability abortions...............1531''.....\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, it \nis my understanding we have 5 hours of debate to be divided evenly, is \nthat correct, beginning at 2:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the issue of late-term abortion has been \na very troubling issue for a lot of us. For the past 6 or 7 months, I \nhave been making an effort to better understand all of the implications \nand all of the circumstances surrounding this issue. I am repulsed by \nthe practice of so-called partial-birth abortions, but I am also very \nsensitive to the extraordinarily personal circumstances that many women \nface as they face excruciating decisions involving their lives and the \nlives of their potential children.\n  I was troubled by the votes cast last fall, and indicated at that \ntime that I was going to do whatever I could to see if we could find a \ncompromise. Today, I come to the floor with the realization that I \ncould not find a compromise. What I did do was seek out doctors, \nconstitutional experts, people in virtually every walk of life, who \nhave voiced their opinion about this issue.\n  The conclusion I reached was that rather than a compromise, an \nentirely different approach may be our best solution, not necessarily \nsaying yes or no to what it was others have advocated with their \npartial-birth-abortion ban because that is a procedural prohibition.\n  My feeling--and the feeling expressed by many experts from whom I \nhave sought advice--was that the pending legislation, the so-called \npartial-birth-abortion ban would not stop one abortion. This will not \nend abortion. This will simply force physicians to use other, equally \ntroubling forms of abortion that I will address in a little while.\n  So my concern was: Could we find a constitutional way with which to \naddress this issue and also find a way to provide a comprehensive ban \non abortion?\n  In seeking ways in which to do that, I began with a series of \nconclusions and considerations that I want to talk about momentarily.\n  First of all, I was amazed to find that, in spite of all the \nstatistics bandied about with regard to numbers, there are very few \nnumbers upon which anybody can base their estimates with any \nreliability--very, very few. The numbers of the Alan Guttmacher \nInstitute are considered the best and used by the Centers for Disease \nControl. They report that 89 percent of all abortions occur in the \nfirst 12 weeks, that 10 percent of the abortions occur in weeks 13 to \n20, that eight-tenths of 1 percent of all abortions occur in weeks 21 \nto 24, and that six-hundredths of 1 percent of all abortions occur in \nthe final weeks beyond that.\n  Those aren't my figures. They are the most legitimate estimations \nbased upon the available evidence and the statistical data which is \nused by the Centers for Disease Control.\n  So that is one question. When do abortions occur? The answer by the \nGuttmacher Institute is this: 89 percent occur in the first 12 weeks.\n  The real issue, in my view, is not which procedure ought to be \noutlawed, because I find, as I have already indicated, the so-called \npartial-birth abortion of viable fetuses to be absolutely abhorrent, as \nI find other abortion procedures. The question is when, and under what \ncircumstances, should the Government restrict abortion? It seems to me \nthat really is what is going to cause us to deal with this issue in a \nway that will solve the problem and not simply force it into another \ncontext.\n  When and under what circumstances should the Government restrict \nabortion?\n  The Supreme Court has ruled on this matter on a number of occasions. \nThey have already given us guidance that they require us to follow, if \nwe are going to be within the constitutional parameters in answering \nthe question that I just asked.\n  Obviously, Roe versus Wade is the basis upon which all decisions have \nsubsequently been made, and Roe versus Wade simply asserts that a \nwoman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy is protected \nby the Constitution.\n  There have been proposals to change the Constitution in that regard, \nand I know some of my colleagues support a constitutional amendment to \noverturn Roe versus Wade. But that isn't the issue today.\n  Colautti versus Franklin in 1979 further clarified Roe versus Wade. \nThe Court said, ``A fetus is considered viable if it is potentially \nable to live outside the womb, albeit with artificial aid.''\n\n[[Page S4539]]\n\n  Why is that decision important? That decision is important because in \n1973, the Court ruled that it was really on the basis of trimesters \nthat we would make some decisions with regard to a woman's right and \nthat it was within the first two trimesters--chosen to approximate the \ntransition at viability--that a woman had a right during those first \ntwo trimesters to make the decision, and after that it would be up to \nthe States to decide what limits they would impose on a woman's right \nto choose, because at that point there was clearly the possibility that \na fetus could live outside the womb. They clarified the definition of \nviability in Colautti. They built upon it. They created a new set of \ncriteria by which to make that decision in 1979. They said now with \ntechnology, viability is not something that neatly falls into the \ncategories of trimesters.\n\n  Then in 1992, in Planned Parenthood versus Casey, the Court redefined \nthe point at which the States could restrict abortion by incorporating \nthe viability definition. The Court clarified the constraints and the \ncircumstances under which a woman can consider an abortion. They have \nalready decided now that the States may restrict abortion after \nviability. Now the question is, Are there any other circumstances? \nWell, in Casey the Court ruled that there can be a prohibition as long \nas it does not place ``a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman \nseeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus.''\n  What do they mean by that? Basically they said if a fetus is viewed \nto be nonviable, you cannot put obstacles in the place of a woman. \nViability is determined not only, of course, by time but also by the \ncondition of the fetus.\n  So in cases throughout the 1970's, 1980's, and 1990's, the Court has \nmade it very clear what it is they intend to do with regard to \nprotection of the fetus as well as protection of the mother. Viability \nthen--based upon the decisions made by the Court--is simply the ability \nto sustain survivability outside the womb with or without life support. \nIf a fetus can live outside the womb with life support, that fetus has \nto be protected--has to be protected.\n  So our amendment very clearly says, in findings that I will read in a \nmoment, it shall be the policy, the determination of this country, that \nwe must make every medically appropriate effort to protect a viable \nfetus.\n  That viability, as I said a moment ago, occurs between the 23d and \nthe 28th weeks. Who determines viability? I have heard people say, \n``Well, abortionists determine viability.'' Abortionists. But we all \nknow that to be a pejorative term. Of course abortionists may determine \nthat. But a high-risk ob/gyn determines that, too. The question is, \nWhat is the alternative to that? What is the alternative to a doctor \nmaking the determination of viability? Based on the medical evidence, \nthe medical information available in their best judgment, is a fetus \nviable? That is what the Court requires. That is what the Supreme Court \nrulings were all about: protecting viable fetuses after defining the \nconcept of viability.\n  So the key questions posed by the bill that is pending seem to me to \nbe, Should just one or all post-viability abortion procedures be banned \ngiven what the Court has ruled? Should it be just one, or should it be \nall of them? Should a mother's health be protected throughout \npregnancy? Should that have any consideration at all?\n  Should a woman's constitutional right to choose before viability be \npreserved? Those seem to me to be pretty fundamental questions that \nthis debate brings about. I think it is a legitimate, a very fair, an \nunderstandable debate around which there are very deeply divided \nopinions.\n  But those are the questions that I think are the most significant as \nwe debate the legislative options we are debating right now.\n  So, Mr. President, my proposal, and the proposal cosponsored by a \nnumber of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--not seeking again \nto compromise but to provide a different approach--simply does this. S. \n6, or H.R. 1122, bans one procedure that I believe ought to be banned. \nI personally believe it ought to be banned. Our alternative bans all \nprocedures.\n  S. 6, because it doesn't distinguish between pre- and post-viability, \nin my view--and because it doesn't address a woman's health at all--in \nmy view would be ruled unconstitutional. What we have attempted to do \nis to recognize and to respect constitutional findings of the Supreme \nCourt, to say that present viability--I must add I believe viability \ncould conceivably be reached at less than 23 at some point in the \nfuture. So I believe it is a very honest way with which to determine on \na timeline when a woman's right to choose ought to end in terms of \nbeing the sole constitutional consideration. But right now it is viewed \nto be 23 weeks, well into the 6th month. But we preserve the \nconstitutionality by ensuring that a woman's right is respected as the \nCourt has required. We also said that there are circumstances involving \nhealth in very, very extraordinary circumstances, even addressed by the \nAMA, that ought to be considered.\n\n  So, Mr. President, those are the two approaches that we have pending \nnow this afternoon.\n  According to the Guttmacher Institute, 99 percent of the abortions \nare performed within the first 20 weeks. The right to choose is \nprotected. Viability comes at week 23, approximately. The alternative \nprotects the fetus after that period of time. H.R. 1122 and S. 6 ban \nabortion using that procedure only--before amd after viability. So from \na timeline point of view, in that time before viability, we protect the \nright of the mother to choose, as the Court requires.\n  What about after viability, because this is really the crux of the \nwhole debate? What do we do to protect a viable fetus?\n  This is what troubles me perhaps the most about where we are with \nregard to S. 6. We have seen the procedure graphically depicted, and I \nthink that graphic depiction clearly compels one to want to respond in \na way that says we have to end it, in some way. I have not chosen this \nafternoon to depict the alternatives on similar charts.\n  (Mr. HUTCHINSON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DASCHLE. But I must tell you I have seen them. So-called partial-\nbirth abortion is technically called dilatation and extraction. There \nis another dilatation method called dilatation and evacuation. In that \nmethod a fetus is dismembered inside the womb and removed. You could \ndepict that very graphically, too. S. 6 does not restrict that \napproach.\n  Induction is a method that you could graphically depict. Saline \nsolution or other agents chemically poison the fetus and premature \nlabor is induced. A chemical poisoning of the fetus could be \ngraphically depicted.\n  You could graphically depict hysterotomies. Hysterotomies are pre-\nterm c-sections, an incision. A fetus is lifted outside the womb and \nthe life is terminated. That could be graphically depicted.\n  You could graphically depict a hysterectomy used for purposes of \nabortion where a woman's womb is completely pulled out of her body.\n  Every one of the procedures that I have just verbally depicted would \nstill be legal under S. 6. They are still legal. And what amazes me is \nthat in spite of the fact that they are every bit as graphically \nrepulsive, they are not addressed in S. 6. A doctor somehow is supposed \nto certify that the one procedure is inappropriate--dilatation and \nextraction is something that ought to be prohibited--but under S. 6 \ndilation and evacuation, induction, hysterotomy, hysterectomy are all \nOK.\n  We went onto the Web and looked at what National Right to Life \nCommittee had said about these particular procedures. As of the first \nof May, National Right to Life said that dilatation and evacuation \n``may cause cervical laceration.'' Why? Cervical laceration may be \ncaused because when you shove the medical instrument into a woman's \nwomb, you may puncture it. You may puncture it seriously. But there is \nno ban on this procedure. ``Bleeding may be profuse,'' according to \nRight to Life.\n  Induction, according to Right to Life, ``risks cervical trauma, \ninfection, hemorrhage, cardiac arrest and rupture of the uterus. Death \nis not unheard of.'' Those are not Tom Daschle's words but those of the \nNational Right to Life Committee. But guess what. No ban. No ban.\n  According to the National Right to Life Committee, hysterotomy, or c-\nsection involves ``the highest risk to the health of the mother; \npotential for rupture during subsequent pregnancies.''\n\n[[Page S4540]]\n\n  And there is no ban for that procedure. What is amazing, at least as \nof May 1, is that Right to Life cites no maternal health risks for the \nD procedure, and yet, lo and behold, that is the one that is banned.\n  Now, I understand why it is banned, and I am sympathetic to banning \nit. But does it not seem a little unusual that we would not consider \nthese other approaches, that we would not worry about causing cervical \nlacerations, bleeding, that we would not worry about cervical trauma \nand infection and hemorrhage and cardiac arrest and uterine rupture?\n  Now, again, I could have a graphic illustration of a cervical \nlaceration. I could have a graphic illustration of cervical trauma and \ninfection and hemorrhages and cardiac arrest. But you do not need much \nof an imagination and you do not have to be married to a woman very \nlong to be pretty sympathetic.\n  So who should decide, Mr. President? That is the question. Who should \ndecide? Who should decide which medical procedure is appropriate? A \nwoman and her doctor, knowing all these ramifications, or the \nGovernment? That is the question. That is what we are trying to grapple \nwith. We are trying to make the best decision about what to do with \nthese horrendous circumstances.\n  Well, the Court has also grappled with it. The Court has also tried \nto figure out a way constitutionally to address all of these issues. In \nRoe versus Wade, what the Court says is that a woman's health ought to \nbe protected throughout pregnancy for the reasons cited, for all these \nreasons. These are the reasons the Court was concerned about health. \nYou do not have to be a doctor to know that, given the circumstances \ninvolving a woman's health, we have to come up with some legal \nprotection.\n\n  In the 1975 case of Planned Parenthood versus Danforth, the Court \nsaid you cannot force a woman and her physician to terminate her \npregnancy by methods more dangerous to her health than the method \noutlawed. In other words, you cannot risk creating a more egregious \nhealth set of circumstances for the mother.\n  And then in Thornburgh versus American College of Ob-Gyn's in 1986, \nit says you cannot force a mother to bear an increased medical risk to \nsave a viable fetus. You may not trade off the mother's health for the \nfetus's health.\n  That is what the Court says.\n  So, Mr. President, over the last 6 months, we have worked, asking, if \nwe want to act in the Senate and not worry about being overturned by \nthe Court 3 months later, how do we deal with these things? How can you \nensure that we are not going to be back here this fall or next year \nhaving been declared unconstitutional? What do we do about these Court \ndecisions? They are not just there as guidance. They are there as law. \nWe do not have the luxury of saying we will agree or we will not agree \nunless we change the Constitution.\n  It is under those constraints and in that context that we attempt to \nfind ways with which to address this issue, first in a comprehensive \nway, banning all procedures; and, second, in a constitutional way so \nthat we do not have to do our work over again in 6 months or a year.\n  I know there have been a lot of different charts in the Chamber \nduring this debate quoting physicians groups, and I know that you can \nsay anything and use a quote to justify it. But I also know that the \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists includes both pro-\nlife and pro-choice physicians. I have talked to them. I know they are \nthere. They have been very involved in this debate from the beginning \nbecause they, more than anybody else outside mothers who are affected, \nhave to deal with this issue. Pro-life and pro-choice physicians have \nhad to confront this matter. And so ACOG, as they are called, the \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, has said in a \nletter:\n\n       An intact D may be the best or most appropriate procedure \n     in a particular circumstance to save the life or preserve the \n     health of a woman, and only the doctor, in consultation with \n     the patient, based upon a woman's particular circumstances \n     can make this decision. The intervention of legislative \n     bodies into the medical decisionmaking is inappropriate, ill-\n     advised, and dangerous.\n\n  Now, we do not have to agree with that. All I am saying is that is \nwhat this group of Republican and Democratic, pro-life and pro-choice, \ndoctors have said officially. That is their position. You can challenge \nit and others have, but I believe that they are perhaps the most \nrespected organization directly involved with this particular issue. \nThey do not deal with hearts. They do not deal with brains. They do not \ndeal with feet. They deal with pregnancy. They deal with fetuses. They \ndeal with wombs and uteruses and cervixes and all of the things we have \nhad graphically depicted. They are the experts.\n  Here is what they also tell us, and they cite manuals like this, the \nClinical Manual of Obstetrics, from the Medical School of the \nUniversity of California, Davis, or the Manual of Obstetrics, with \ncontributions from respected obstetric professors from around the \ncountry.\n  They say that there are cases when pregnancy termination is required. \nPregnancy termination. Now, keep in mind, there is a difference between \npregnancy termination by delivery and by abortion. I think everybody in \nthis Chamber would agree that there are some cases when pregnancy \ntermination is required, but pregnancy termination may be delivering a \nlive fetus, a child. And what we are saying in our legislation is that \nin every case where it is possible to deliver a viable fetus a doctor \nmust do that--must. But there are cases when, unfortunately, that will \nnot provide the mechanism a doctor needs to respond to the crisis.\n\n  ``Primary pulmonary hypertension, involves the sudden death or \nintractable congestive heart failure. Maternal mortality approaches 50 \npercent. This or other complications occur in 10 to 40 percent of \npatients with chronic hypertension.''\n  ``Preeclampsia. Severe hypertension and accompanying renal or liver \nfailure.'' Five to 10 percent of pregnancies in circumstances of that \nkind. ``Cardiomyopathy occurs late in pregnancy in women with no \nhistory of heart disease as a distinct well described syndrome of \ncardiac failure.''\n  These are diseases caused by the pregnancy, Mr. President, that \ndoctors and manuals like these cite as reasons for pregnancy \ntermination.\n  Now, there are also other cases, other situations unrelated to the \npregnancy itself when a pregnancy complicates treatment.\n  ``Cancers. Cancer occurs in approximately 1 in every 1,000 \npregnancies. Pregnancy depresses mother's immune system; radiation and \nchemotherapy are harmful to the fetus.''\n  Again, the first consideration for termination of the pregnancy must \nbe early delivery. If possible, deliver the fetus.\n  ``Lymphoma. 50 percent cure rate with immediate treatment; likely \ndeath in 6 months if delayed; radiation and chemotherapy risk fetal \nmutation.'' Again, if you can deliver the child, do so. Do so.\n  Breast cancer. 1 in 3,000 pregnancies. ``Increased estrogen and \nlactose production during pregnancy accelerates cancer; immune system \ndepressed.''\n  Those are cases, categories of cases, Mr. President, that are listed \nin obstetrics manuals because they can and do occur. Physicians should \nbe prepared for them, and should know the proper ways to treat pregnant \nwomen who develop these serious conditions.\n  There are specific cases that graphically illustrate the answer to \nthe question posed so often by those on the other side of this \namendment: Why not deliver? I want to cite a few because I think this \nis really the crux of the issue.\n  These are the specific cases. A woman in her 25th week is \nhemorrhaging with internal injuries. Her blood would not clot, leading \nto uncontrollable bleeding. Delivery by c-section or induction was \nimpossible, because c-section and its increased blood loss posed \nsignificant risks. Induced delivery would take too long. Because of the \nrisks to the mother's life and health and the low chance of fetal \nsurvival, termination through abortion was chosen because it could not \nbe delivered.\n  It has always concerned me that some say we ought to prohibit \nabortion except in cases of immediate life endangerment--that they are \nunwilling to recognize that there also may be cases involving serious \nhealth endangerment. How is it that life and\n\n[[Page S4541]]\n\ndeath are so clearly delineated, that health never falls in between \nthem? If there are cases involving death, would there not also be cases \ninvolving health? And who but the doctor decides when the mother's life \nis endangered? If we are making liars of all ``abortionists,'' would we \nnot be making liars of doctors who are doing their best to save the \nmother's life, who decide that termination of a pregnancy through \nabortion may be required, as is allowed in H.R. 1122?\n  Case No. 2: A 23-year-old woman in her 24th week presented with \npreeclampsia and deteriorating kidney function. Doctors tried to induce \ndelivery early. After 3 days of unsuccessful attempts, induction was \nstill not possible. At that time, the woman's failing kidneys became \ncompletely nonfunctional, risking permanent kidney failure. Recognizing \nthat induction was impossible and c-section totally out of the \nquestion, the pregnancy was terminated to save the woman's health--\nterminated by abortion.\n  Mr. President, there are others. I will read one provided to us by a \ntrauma surgeon whom I know well--highly regarded, nationally \nrecognized. A patient in the 6th month of pregnancy was severely \ninjured in a motor vehicle collision. She sustained multiple fractures \nto her extremities and a critical head injury, developed adult \nrespiratory distress syndrome, massive pulmonary inflammation. Her \nlungs were stiff and it was impossible to ventilate. The trauma staff \nused every possible technique to improve the lung function, but the \nsize of her uterus made the ventilator unable to inflate her lung. \nAfter agonizing, consulting with the family, the physicians came to the \nconclusion that to protect her heart and lungs, to save her life and \nher long-term health, they had to abort.\n  And finally, Mr. President, a doctor from my own State of South \nDakota related to me a tragic circumstance that completely answers the \nquestion of why doctors sometimes absolutely cannot deliver a viable \nfetus. A 25-year-old woman arrived at the hospital in active, \nspontaneous labor in her 25th week of pregnancy. The fetus was in the \nbreech position, its feet coming out first. Because of the breech \nposition, the woman's cervix was not fully dilated. Even though most of \na preterm fetus can pass through even a partially dilated cervix, a \nnormal fetal head is sometimes too large to be fully delivered and \nbecomes stuck. It is not stopped by the physician, prevented from \ncoming out--it is tragically, but naturally, trapped.\n  In this case, the fetus was already in the process of preterm, \nspontaneous delivery, and because it could not be completely delivered, \nit was impossible to further dilate the woman artificially. Manual \nstretching of the cervix was necessary to create a wide enough opening \nfor complete delivery. This South Dakotan doctor tried pulling at the \nwoman's cervix--the only option left for the doctor--in order to widen \nthe opening enough to deliver the fetus.\n  Manual stretching was not successful. In addition to being very \ndifficult, it also poses great risks to the woman's health and future \nfertility because such stretching can permanently damage the cervix, \nrisking hemorrhaging. Without complete dilation, the fetus suffocates. \nEvacuation must be effected by any means, and in this tragic case, that \nevacuation of the fetus was by the D procedure.\n\n  These were real cases. These did not come from ``abortionists.'' \nThese were doctors trying their very best to help the fetus and the \nmother to survive. That is what they were trying to do. They were not \nin the business of abortion. They were in the business of life.\n  What do you do in cases like this? Say that the Government has ruled \nthat these are all impossible? Would that be our response? ``The \nGovernment has ruled that none of these cases exist; it is all a \nfigment of your imagination. You are trying to abort. Don't kid us, we \nknow better. We are the Government. We can decide for you. We will tell \nyou. None of these are possible. You are lying to us.'' Is that what we \nwant to say? Do we really know better than this trauma surgeon? Do we \nknow better than these physicians who have been there, who have had \nblood on their hands, who have tried to save a mother's life and a \nfetus?\n  Having thought through all of this, and having talked to a lot of our \ncolleagues, this is the best, tightest, toughest language we know how \nto come up with:\n\n       It shall be unlawful to abort a viable fetus unless the \n     physician certifies that continuation of the pregnancy would \n     threaten the mother's life or risk grievous injury--grievous \n     injury--to her physical health.\n       ``Grievous injury'' shall be defined as:\n       (a) a severely debilitating disease or impairment \n     specifically caused by the pregnancy.\n\n  That is case No. 1 that I outlined on the chart. Or:\n\n       (b) an inability to provide necessary treatment for a life-\n     threatening condition.\n\n  That is case No. 2 that I outlined in my chart.\n\n       ``Grievous injury,'' we further elaborate, ``does not \n     include any condition that is not medically diagnosable or \n     any condition for which termination of pregnancy is not \n     medically indicated.''\n\n  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have been \nvery helpful to us in trying to work through this. They say that this \nis acceptable--they have endorsed our substitute--because it includes \n``an exception when it is necessary for a woman's health * * * \nphysicians [have] to make judgments about individual patients,'' as \nthese cases would dictate.\n  There is a similar recommendation in the AMA Board of Trustees draft \nreport just released and so often raised on the floor in the last \ncouple of days. You can agree or disagree with its findings, with its \nrecommendations, but they did say, quoted in the report: ``Except in \nextraordinary circumstances, maternal health factors which demand \ntermination of the pregnancy can be accommodated without sacrifice of \nthe fetus. * * *''\n  And we say, ``Hurrah, absolutely. That is exactly what we are trying \nto do. Let us not end the fetus's life if it is at all possible.'' But \nkeep in mind that first phrase, ``except in extraordinary \ncircumstances.'' I have just tried to give you some extraordinary \ncircumstances--not figments of somebody's imagination, but real life \nsituations presented to us by real life doctors who said, ``We are \ngoing to do everything possible to save the fetus, but there are,'' as \nthe AMA has said,'' extraordinary circumstances that cannot be wished \naway.''\n  So, who should decide when the medical risks are serious enough? Who \nshould decide? The Government or the doctors?\n  I believe that H.R. 1122, having laid it out as clearly as I know how \nto lay it out, is unconstitutional. Because doctors can use other \nprocedures, it will not stop a single abortion. I am still absolutely \nconvinced it is a procedure that ought to be abolished. But if we are \ntrying to find ways with which to deal with circumstances in real life, \ninvolving efforts to stop abortion after a fetus is viable, H.R. 1122 \ndoes not do it. It will not do it. What we do is simply say, look, the \nConstitution has said that prior to viability, whether you like it or \nnot, unless you are willing to change the Constitution, prior to \nviability we may not restrict a woman's access to safe abortion. I \nsupport a woman's right to choose prior to viability. But that is not \nthe issue, because it is the constitutional requirement.\n\n  Under our substitute, after viability, all procedures are banned with \nan exception only when life and health are seriously threatened. I have \nseen the criticisms. I have seen the arguments that, ``Well, a doctor \ncertainly can do his own thing. Who is looking? A doctor can just \nlie.'' But a doctor who is caught lying--and the mother, the family, a \nnurse, somebody in the hospital, anybody, anybody can call attention to \nthe fact that he lied--and when he is caught he is subject to perjury \ncharges, $100,000 fine and revocation of his license in the first \ninstance; the second time, permanent revocation of his license--the \nloss of his ability to practice--and a $250,000 fine.\n  I would be willing to look at any other way with which to ensure that \nwe keep a doctor honest. But I must say, there is no assurance that a \ndoctor is being honest under H.R. 1122. How do we know that a doctor \ndid not perform a dilation and extraction procedure on a woman? How do \nwe know that? He must certify--right? That is the only way we know, if \nhe certifies. Actually,\n\n[[Page S4542]]\n\nunder H.R. 1122, he does not even have to certify, as he must under our \nsubstitute. Under H.R. 1122, the doctor must simply assert that the \nabortion was necessary to save the mother's life if the situation is \nreported or investigated. Why is it that he cannot lie? Why is it that \nthey are not just as vulnerable to doctors who may try to find a way \naround the law in this case? Why is it assumed doctors are less likely \nto lie about a woman's life being threatened than about her health \nbeing threatened?\n  Mr. President, I think the Washington Times last Friday had it right. \nWe spare viable fetuses. Our proposal is stricter than the one pending.\n  There are a lot of people who wish to be heard, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I see a lot of Members here and I will \nkeep my remarks brief in order to give them an opportunity to speak. \nBut I, too, just want to get in a couple of points in response, and a \ncomment. First the comment.\n  That is, I very much appreciate what the Senator from South Dakota \nhas stated. I respect his opinion. I respect the fact that he is trying \nto make an effort to deal with a very serious issue, and that is \nabortion in this country, moving toward making it much more rare. \nCertainly, I do not doubt his intentions at all. I know this is an \nissue that not only he is struggling with, on the issue of partial-\nbirth abortion, but other Members who I have talked to and who I have \nheard from directly and indirectly. This has been an issue that has \nbeen a very difficult issue for people to deal with. We are looking for \nanswers and looking for different ways. I respect the effort of the \nSenator from South Dakota to do what he believes is right.\n  I hope, and I would just offer this--while I do not agree in the \nassessment of the Senator from South Dakota as to what his bill does, \nwe have an honest disagreement on that. And I think it is one. I think \nit is simply a disagreement on what he believes his bill does. He \nbelieves it does some things. I will argue as to why I don't think it \ndoes what he says it does. Two people can reasonably disagree on that. \nAnd we will have that debate here today at length.\n  I will say that I certainly am open to working with the Senator from \nSouth Dakota, and anybody else in this Chamber, after this day is done \nand this issue is behind us, and hopefully it will be behind us soon, \nto look at other ways that we can get at these very, very prickly \nissues. We can do it in a way that can be bipartisan. The people who \nare generally concerned about unborn children--I know the Senator from \nSouth Dakota is. So I just want to start, having said that, and just \naddress the two points which I see are the flaws in his legislation, as \nwell-intentioned as I believe it is.\n\n  The Senator from South Dakota referred over and over again to how \nthese different procedures that are not banned by the partial-birth \nabortion ban, H.R. 1122--he kept saying this is no ban, this is no ban. \nI suggest, as carefully as the Senator tried to construct this \namendment, that in fact his bill is no ban either. It allows for two \ndeterminations to be made, two issues to be left to the discretion of \nthe doctor, which creates the loophole by which not one single abortion \nwill be banned under this procedure.\n  I do not say that lightly. I say that with the very strong conviction \nthat what will happen as a result, if this bill were to become law and \nsigned by the President, there would not be one less abortion done in \nthis country. There would not be one abortion banned in this country.\n  The reason I say that--and I will talk about two particular areas. I \nwill be brief. I will get into this in more detail later, because I \nknow there are people who want to speak. I am going to be here. They \nhave things to do.\n  I will talk first about the health exception. I showed the quote \ntoday from Dr. Warren Hern. Again, Dr. Hern is an authority on abortion \nprocedures and techniques. He has written ``Abortion Practice,'' Warren \nM. Hern. This is the definitive textbook on teaching abortion. He does \nsecond- and third-trimester abortions.\n  He does them from all over the world. He instructs doctors through \nhis book and directly on abortion practice. This is what Dr. Hern said \nyesterday to the Bergen County Record:\n\n       I will certify that any pregnancy is a threat to a woman's \n     life and could cause grievous injury to her physical health.\n\n  Dr. Hern, who does second- and third-trimester abortions, was \ncommenting on the Daschle amendment. This is one of the leading people \nin this field. I just suggest that Dr. Hern, while I could not disagree \nmore with what Dr. Hern says, the fact of the matter is that he can \nstand there and, in good conscience, say that to not only the Bergen \nCounty Record, but to USA Today--he repeated the statement in case \nthere is no validity to the original statement, a different quote, \nsimilar in nature--that any pregnancy could be a threat and could cause \ngrievous injury--I know this is the language the press keeps honing in \non, ``grievous injury'' to physical health. Here it is.\n  I have a lot of other things I am going to say about health and why \nthe health exception, as drafted in this amendment, is a very broad \nloophole and will not restrict abortions. The fact that the doctor is \nthe one to certify, what does that mean? That is pretty much current \nlaw. The doctor certifies when there is a health reason to do an \nabortion, and we say we are going to ban these, but the doctors \ndetermine when there is an exception.\n  I use the example of recently in the Congress, we banned assault \nweapons. We said we were going to make assault weapons illegal, but we \nare going to give the person selling the gun the ability to determine \nwhat an assault weapon is. That is what we have done with the Daschle \namendment. It has given the person performing the abortion \ncertification dispositive, conclusive authority to determine what is a \nhealth reason.\n  I agree that is what Roe versus Wade says, but the fact that the \nDaschle amendment parrots that shows that there will be no change in \nthe way doctors view this issue. There will be no change.\n  The second issue is the issue of viability, and I think Senator \nDaschle points up very accurately the progress we have made since Roe \nversus Wade in the area of viability, but, again, the only way you can \nfor sure determine whether a child is viable is to try to save the \nchild. There is no way that a doctor can look into the womb of a mother \nand say this child will survive and this one will not. You cannot do \nit. They might have guesses, but we have cases of children surviving at \n22 weeks, 21 weeks, not many, very few, maybe only singular cases. But \nhow do we know unless we deliver the baby alive, and births after 20 \nweeks are almost certainly alive if you deliver the baby without doing \nanything to it. The heart is beating. Unfortunately, they gasp for \nbreath. They will be alive, but you never know whether they are going \nto survive until you try.\n  So to suggest that the doctor can then define viability by knowing in \nadvance whether this baby is going to survive, you cannot do that. What \nyou end up doing is, again, leaving the doctor absolute discretion, \neven at times--I think we are now up to the point at 26 weeks you are \ninto roughly 80 percent survival, but you can still say, ``Twenty \npercent don't survive, and I make a determination this is one of the 20 \npercent.'' It is a reasonable judgment call. There is no way you can \nsecond-guess it, because there is no way to know for sure.\n  You have, literally, up until 26, 27--you can go on, there is not \n100-percent certainty survival of viability until well into pregnancy, \nuntil maybe even in the 35th week where you have 100-percent chance. So \nthe doctors can always say, ``This was one and I certify it, it is \nconclusive, it is dispositive,'' as it is under Roe versus Wade.\n  I am not saying he is changing current law, but by applying current \nlaw, codifying current law, he accepts the exception to the overall ban \nwhich nullifies the ban, and so what we have is a ban that does not do \nanything.\n\n  Again, I say to the Senator from South Dakota, I appreciate the \neffort he put behind trying to address this issue, but it does not \naccomplish what was intended. I feel bad about it. I wish I could stand \nup here and say this is something that is going to make a positive \nimpact. Look, if I felt that this was going to do something to stop\n\n[[Page S4543]]\n\nchildren from being aborted, I would sign up right now, but I don't \nbelieve that it will.\n  I am willing to work in the future if we can come up with something \nthat will save children's lives, count me in. I will say that I was not \napproached on this compromise. I was not asked for my input as the \nsponsor of the bill that is on the floor. That is the prerogative of \nthe people who drafted the amendment. That is certainly within the \nrealm of Hoyle around here. But if we truly want to reach out and try \nto work on something across the chasm, which unfortunately is a chasm \nthat has been breached somewhat on the issue of partial-birth abortion, \nI am happy to say that maybe as a result of partial-birth abortion, we \nare beginning to see that there are real problems out there, even those \nwho support abortion rights.\n  So I hope, while I have to stand and speak against this amendment and \nurge my colleagues to vote against this, because not only does the \nDaschle amendment create a ban that has no limits to it, there is no \nban, the Daschle amendment wipes out the partial-birth abortion ban. So \nit wipes out the underlying legislation. In a sense, whoever votes for \nDaschle votes against banning partial-birth abortions because under the \nDaschle amendment, not one partial-birth abortion will stop. Not one. \nSo if you vote for this amendment, you vote against the underlying bill \nand replace it with something that, as well-intentioned as it may be, \ndoes nothing to limit late-term abortions, the fifth, sixth month and \nbeyond.\n  I had to rise in opposition. I respect the Senator from South Dakota. \nI look forward to engaging further in this debate. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me respond quickly because many \nSenators are seeking recognition. I appreciate the tone of the \nSenator's response. I also acknowledge that the Senator from \nPennsylvania is certainly well intentioned. I respect the fact that he \nis also trying to find a solution. I was perhaps sent the wrong message \nabout his desire to become a constructive partner in the dialog when I \nread his criticisms of the effort several months ago. I take \nresponsibility for perhaps misinterpreting his criticisms. But, \nnonetheless, I do believe he is well intentioned.\n  It is ironic that we both come to the same conclusion. The Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania has offered legislation that will clearly not stop \none abortion because every other abortion procedure is available. He \nrecognizes that. So I don't know how anyone could argue that his ban of \na procedure is a ban of abortion, because it doesn't stop all of the \nother procedures. So how does it stop abortion?\n  As to Dr. Hern, that man is going to jail, and I will just tell him \non the record in public right now, ``Dr. Hern, you're going to jail for \nperjury if this legislation passes and you lie about the need for \nunnecessary abortions you perform.'' If you don't go to jail, there is \nsomething wrong with our legal system, not with the law as it is \nwritten.\n  As to viability, I have no differences of opinion with the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania on viability. He and I agree on the need to find a \nway to ensure that the viable fetus is a top priority, along with a \nmother's health in these circumstances, and if it can be delivered \nlive, it ought to be, regardless of what week. So we have no \ndisagreement on that.\n  With regard to making the determination, that it is up to the doctor, \nlet me just say one last thing. I don't know what the Senator or any \nother Senator who supports H.R. 1122 would say if a doctor said, \n``Well, I'm going to take Dr. Hern's approach `to save the life of a \nmother,' '' which is a clause in their bill, ``I'm going to use \ndilation and extraction to save the life of the mother. I can do that. \nIt's legal.'' Dr. Hern should love that language. That is still \navailable.\n\n  So if we distrust the veracity of a doctor in my circumstances, I \nwould think we would be reciprocal in distrusting the veracity of any \ndoctor who could use any out and, indeed, they allow an out, not to \nmention all the other alternative abortion procedures.\n  So there are differences between us in spite of the good intentions \nwe have, in spite of the fact I know we both want to come to the same \nconclusion.\n  Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nMaryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Daschle alternative, \nand I do so because of three reasons: No. 1, it preserves Roe versus \nWade; No. 2, it prohibits all postviability abortions; and No. 3, it \nprovides an exception for the life and the health of the mother, which \nis both intellectually rigorous and compassionate at the same time.\n  The Daschle substitute respects the Supreme Court's ruling in the Roe \ndecision. When the Court decided Roe, it was faced with the task of \ndefining when does life begin. Theologians and scientists differ on \nthis. People of good will and good conscience differ on this. So the \nSupreme Court used viability as its standard. Once a fetus is viable, \nit is presumed not only to have a body, but a mind, a spirit and a \npersona that has standing in our society and in our courts. Therefore, \nit has standing under the law as a person.\n  The Daschle alternative respects that key holding of Roe. It says \nafter the point of viability, no woman should be able to abort a viable \nfetus. There would only be two exceptions: to immediately save her \nlife, and the other may be when the woman faces a serious and \ndebilitating threat to her health.\n  The bill before us, H.R. 1122, as proposed by the Senator from \nPennsylvania, simply bans a particular abortion technique at any point \nin the pregnancy. Because it would ban the use of a technique during \npreviability, it would violate the Supreme Court's standard on \nviability. Should this language be passed, in all probability, it would \nbe struck down by the courts, and the proponents of the legislation do \nknow this.\n  The Daschle alternative bans all postviability abortions. It does not \ncreate loopholes by allowing other procedures to be used. Therefore, \nthis Daschle alternative is superior to H.R. 1122 because it does ban \nabortions, it doesn't just ban a procedure, it bans all abortions after \nthe point of viability. Therefore, it is good public policy, it is good \npublic health and also will stand up to the test of the Supreme Court.\n  I believe there is no Senator who thinks a woman should abort a \nviable fetus for frivolous or nonmedical reasons. It does not matter \nwhat procedure is used. It is wrong and we know it. Therefore, the \nDaschle alternative bans those abortions.\n  However, on the other hand, H.R. 1122 does not stop one single \nabortion. For those who think they support this approach, know that it \nis unconstitutional and is, therefore, both hollow and ineffective.\n  Let us be clear. A vote for the underlying bill will be both hollow \nand ineffective. It will attempt to ban a particular procedure, but \nallows doctors to simply go to another procedure.\n  The Daschle alternative does ban abortions. It says that a woman \ncannot have an abortion once the fetus is viable. We talk about then \n``What is viable?'' It means surviving outside of the womb with or \nwithout life support. Medical advances are the ones that will determine \nwhat enables a fetus to be viable.\n  Let me tell you what else I like about the Daschle alternative. The \nhealth of the mother is rigorously, intellectually defined, but it is \nalso compassionate. Under the Daschle alternative, the only time an \nabortion would be allowed--other than saving the life of the mother--is \nwhen the woman faces a medical crisis that is grave and severe. And it \ndefines that as circumstances that ``threaten the mother's life or risk \ngrievous injury to her physical health.''\n  But I want to be very clear in this. The Daschle alternative does not \ncreate a gaping loophole with its health exception. We are not loophole \nshopping when we insist that the Constitution requires, and the reality \nof women's lives demands, an exception for women's health.\n  The health exception in the Daschle alternative has been carefully \ndeveloped. I know that the Senator has consulted with medical \nethicists, physicians, as well as constitutional scholars. It is \nspecific and not vague. It is meant to cover only the most severe types \nof medical conditions.\n\n[[Page S4544]]\n\n  What kind would they be? Some of these conditions are caused or \naggravated by the pregnancy itself. For instance, issues like severe \nhypertension or preeclampsia, which occurs in 5 to 10 percent of \npregnancies. In severe instances, the woman would face severe renal \nfailure, kidney failure, liver failure, and ultimately could die.\n  Other women find themselves at risk for serious heart damage as a \nresult of peripartal cardiomyophy. These women have no previous history \nof heart disease. It is the pregnancy itself that puts them at risk for \ncardiac failure. Would anyone argue that this is not a profound health \ncrisis?\n  There are other complications. Women with existing hypertension often \nfind their condition dangerously aggravated by the pregnancy. \nComplications of hypertension occur in 10 to 40 percent of these \npatients. These women are at risk for organ failure, seizures, or even \ndeath.\n  Women who suffer from diabetes may find their condition exacerbated \nduring pregnancy, so severe that it could lead to blindness or \namputations. And in some instances, where the woman is carrying a fetus \nwith severe anomalies, she is at risk of uterine rupture and the loss \nof future fertility.\n  These are real, undeniable severe medical complications. While they \nare rare, they do occur. Senator Daschle's alternative addresses this \nreality.\n  It recognizes that to deny these women access to the abortion that \ncould save their lives and health would be unconscionable. When the \ncontinuation of the pregnancy is causing these sorts of profound health \nproblems, a woman's doctor must have every tool available to respond.\n  There are also cases where a life-endangering condition, unrelated to \nthe pregnancy, arises and cannot be properly treated because of the \npregnancy.\n  For instance, in the course of her pregnancy, if a woman is defined \nas having breast cancer, leukemia or some other form of cancer, she \ncould not have her chemotherapy or radiation because it would cause \nprofound fetal mutation.\n  Doctors are faced with choices. Mothers and fathers will be faced \nwith choices. The question is, who decides? I do not think it should be \ndone on the floor of the U.S. Congress by politicians. I believe the \ndecisions should be made in a clinical situation between a doctor, the \nmother, and her husband. I support the Daschle alternative because it \nwould provide this health exception and allow the physician and the \nfamily affected to make the decision that is medically appropriate to \naddress very grave health situations that a woman may face.\n  That is why the Daschle alternative is so important. That is why the \nDaschle alternative is critical to passage. For those who are serious \nabout banning postviability abortions, the Daschle alternative is the \nonly alternative. For those who really want to seek common ground, the \nDaschle alternative is compassionate, intellectually rigorous. It \nenables physicians to determine what is medically necessary.\n  I have been troubled by this issue ever since I came to the House of \nRepresentatives more than 20 years ago. I am associated as being a pro-\nchoice U.S. Congresswoman, and now Senator. What does pro-choice mean? \nIt is not that I am for abortion. I do not believe that abortion is an \nunlimited right. But I believe it is the woman, in consultation with \nthe physician and the family affected, who should decide.\n  Through the grace of God, I have been granted the faith of being a \nRoman Catholic. I will be eternally grateful for that gift of faith. \nBut with that gift came two other gifts, one of hope and one of \ncompassion. I hope to live as a Catholic; I hope to be able to die a \nCatholic. I feel that the Daschle alternative gives us an option that \nis not only constitutionally defensible, but is medically and morally \ndefensible. And I hope that finally we can bring this debate and this \ndiscussion to the end.\n  Last year, we voted 52 times on the subject of abortion. Was the \npublic served by it? Were women served? I don't know. I do not think \nso. So, please, let us take politicians out of this conversation. Let \nus put doctors back in because if we truly cannot trust the decisions \nin the medical profession, then I do not know who we can trust. You ask \nthe American people, who do you trust more, your doctor or your \npolitician? I do not think they would debate as long as we will be \ndebating this issue.\n  Before closing, let me just extend my deep appreciation for the work \nour Democratic leader has done on this issue. He has been heroic, \nfaithful and determined.\n  He has reached out to every Member of the Senate. He has consulted a \nwide range of medical professionals, lawyers, and legal and ethical \nscholars. He has been absolutely committed to finding a solution that \nis passable, signable, and constitutional. I believe he has succeeded.\n  So I thank him. And I compliment his excellent staff, Laura Petrou, \nCaroline Fredrickson, and Amy Sullivan, who have done truly outstanding \nwork in developing the alternative before us.\n  Mr. President, today we have the opportunity to do something very \nimportant. We can move beyond soundbites and politics, and do something \nreal, something which I know reflects the views of the American people.\n  We can pass the Daschle alternative. We can say that we value life \nand we value our Constitution. We can make clear that a viable fetus \nshould not be aborted. We can say that we want to save women's lives \nand women's health.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Daschle alternative.\n  I respect people on the other side who have differing views. But I am \nalso concerned that there might be a lack of clarity about some of \nthose issues.\n  Before I yield the floor, I wonder if the distinguished Democratic \nleader would yield for two questions, if he might?\n  There is some question whether the woman's physician would be \nallowed--the alternative has been criticized because it allows the \nwoman's physician to make the medical judgment regarding the woman's \nneed.\n  Could you tell me what procedures your alternative provides so that a \nphysician does not abuse the strict standards provided for in your \nmeasure, and what enforcement tools there would be so we could trust \nthe doctors?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Well, I appreciate the Senator's question.\n  Let me just say that, first of all, the circumstances involving a \ndoctor's role are identical between the bill offered, which is pending, \nS. 6, and our legislation. A doctor makes the determination in their \ncase whether or not a life is affected and can make the determination \nto use their procedure, the procedure that is outlawed, I should say, \nif in their opinion a life is affected.\n  What we say is that a doctor has to make the decision, but we limit \nthe definition of ``health'' and ``life'' to include only grievous \ncircumstances. And we define ``grievous circumstances'' as severely \ndebilitating diseases specifically caused by pregnancy or an inability \nto provide necessary treatment for a life-threatening condition.\n  Then we say what it is not. It is not any condition that is not \nmedically diagnosable or a condition for which termination of the \npregnancy is not medically indicated.\n  In a previous provision of the bill, we say that termination of a \npregnancy must first include the possibility of a live birth. It must \ninclude that. Then we say, if you violate it, you are going to lose \nyour license, you are going to pay $100,000; and then $250,000 and you \nare going to lose your license for good, and you are going to be \nsubject to charges of perjury if you lie.\n  We make anybody who wants to bring charges able to--a nurse, a family \nmember, somebody in the hospital--anybody who has any question about \nwhether or not the right decision was made can bring a charge.\n  So we have done everything we can, I would say to the Senator from \nMaryland, to get at the legitimate concern that somebody could abuse \nthis.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you, Mr. Leader. I appreciate that.\n  I think that spells that out.\n  Now, one of the reasons I support your alternative is because I truly \nbelieve it will prevent abortion, particularly postviability abortion.\n  Can you assure me that your alternative--assure those who also want \nto ban all postviability abortions that your alternative would do so?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Well, that is really the fundamental difference between\n\n[[Page S4545]]\n\nthe two pending bills. We ban abortion; they ban a procedure. They \nallow all the other abortion procedures available--dilation and \nevacuation, induction, hysterotomies--those are still legally \navailable. But what we ban are all of those procedures, all of them, \nand affix the penalties that we have discussed.\n  So I would say with absolute certainty to the Senator from Maryland \nthat we do everything within the constitutional parameters available to \nus to stop all abortions.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Many States have enacted their own laws on \npostviability abortion. My own State of Maryland has a law that bans \npostviability abortions. It was approved by the voters of Maryland in a \nreferendum. The Maryland law says a postviability abortion is only \nallowed when it ``is necessary to protect the life or health of the \nwoman; or the fetus is affected by genetic defect or serious deformity \nor abnormality.'' Other States have even more far-reaching bans.\n  How does the bipartisan alternative affect Maryland law, which the \npeople of Maryland endorsed through referendum?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The alternative does not prohibit a State that already \nhas a postviability ban from retaining its State law. Especially in a \nState such as Maryland, where the people decided that the health \ndefinition you outlined was the most appropriate way to deal with \nwomen's health, States should be allowed to either retain their own \nlaws, or enact this alternative. We believe we have provided an \nappropriately clear and tight definition. States with even more \nrestrictive laws may disagree, and we do not preempt their laws, \neither.\n  The alternative would not displace any comprehensive State \npostviability abortion bans, in whole or in part, currently in effect. \nThe bipartisan alternative would not displace any procedure-specific \nrestrictions or any other abortion-related State statutes. However, if \na State has no comprehensive postviability ban in effect--either \nbecause none has been enacted or because a ban has been repealed or \ninvalidated by the courts--the bipartisan alternative would take effect \nin that State. The effect of the bipartisan alternative is to ensure \nthat there is a postviability abortion ban in effect in every State.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The bipartisan alternative has a very narrowly drawn \ndefinition of the health situations under which a postviability \nabortion would be allowed. It says that the physician must certify that \n``continuation of the pregnancy would threaten the mother's life or \nrisk grievous injury to her physical health.''\n  Does this mean that there are no situations when a woman with a \nprofound mental health problem would be permitted a postviability \nabortion under your bill?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. As we discussed last year during the debate over mental \nhealth parity, most of us now realize that there is a connection \nbetween mental and physical illnesses. They are not mutually exclusive. \nWomen with serious psychiatric diseases who risk psychotic breaks that \nwould leave them nonfunctional may have physical manifestations of \nthose psychiatric conditions. If such physical manifestations take the \nform of severely debilitating impairments, they would be covered under \nthe health definition. I do not know if any cases would fall under that \nstrict standard, but we cannot anticipate every medical circumstance.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the leader for his explanation.\n  I want to thank the Democratic leader for the excellent work he has \ndone. I intend to support his alternative.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, on behalf of the manager of the bill, I \nyield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise in reluctance, but very strong opposition, to \nthis amendment. I join with the comments that my friend, Senator \nSantorum, has made about our colleague, the distinguished minority \nleader. I think he has made a very honest attempt to deal with this \nissue. But I would like to explain over the next few minutes why I \nbelieve that this attempt has failed and why I believe that this \namendment, however well intentioned I know it is, is a gutting \namendment and how this amendment strips really everything away.\n  It is really not the Senator's fault. I do not know if it is anyone's \nfault. But the reality is, we have to live with previous Court \ndecisions and we have to live with a whole body of law. Legislation \nthat we write has to take that into consideration, how words have in \nfact been defined.\n  The Supreme Court has made it abundantly clear in the Bolton case how \nbroad the language of ``health'' is, and when there is a health \nexception what that really does, and that everything is taken into \nconsideration.\n  I understand the Senator has tried to craft this legislation maybe to \ndeal with that. I do not think it can be done. I do not think, in light \nof those cases, that that really can be done at all.\n  But let us walk through, for a moment, what has to take place. The \nword ``certification'' is important because what this amendment says \nis--you have several issues, but they are all decisions, let us keep in \nmind, that are made by the attending physician, by the person \nperforming the abortion.\n  You start with the issue of viability. Now, the reality is --you \ncannot change the reality--the vast majority of these occur before \nviability. And the vast majority of them--according to Dr. Haskell 80 \npercent--are elective abortions. That is a fact. Those are the facts. \nWe cannot change those facts, which means that this amendment does not \ndeal with that. It does not deal with all those abortions at all.\n  But let us go beyond that, because what this amendment says is the \ndoctor has to certify. But even before he gets to the certification \nprocess, he makes a determination about viability. If he says ``not \nviable'' then that is it; it ends the debate. Only if he or she then \nsays this child is viable, the fetus is viable, then the language kicks \nin. It says the doctor must certify.\n  I would submit that once the certification takes place, that is it. \nAnd, again, it is solely within the discretion of the doctor whether \ncertification takes place or does not take place. The operative act is \nnot an objective standard; it is the certification in and of itself. \nThat ends the discussion. That is it.\n  Let me, if I could, Mr. President, recap where we are and what I \nthink we have learned in the last few days. But before that, of course, \nwith testimony in the Judiciary Committee on several different \noccasions, the other floor debates that we have had, I think we have \nestablished certain things, that certain things are uncontroverted.\n  We have all seen the graphic descriptions of what happens in this \nprocedure. There is no dispute about that. There is no dispute about \nthe horror. There is no dispute about the tragedy.\n  I believe it has been established and recognized from the AMA to Dr. \nC. Everett Koop that this procedure is never the only procedure that \nwill save the life, or the health, of the mother.\n  I think we have established that even when the baby, for medical \nreasons, must be separated from the mother, there is no reason to kill \nthe baby. The termination of pregnancy is not the same as an abortion.\n  I think the evidence is clear that the real reason this procedure is \ndone is because it is easier for the abortionists. We have heard what \nDr. Martin Haskell, the abortionist from Dayton, OH, has to say. I read \nhis quote yesterday. This is what he says in part: ``The goal of your \nwork is to complete an abortion.'' To complete an abortion. That is the \ngoal.\n  So we know, Mr. President, why these babies are killed--not for \nhealth reasons, not because the mother needs it, not because the baby \ncannot be delivered and may be saved, but because an abortionist does \nnot want the baby to survive.\n  That is the object. That is what Dr. Haskell says in his quote.\n  The amendment that is before the Senate purports to deal with the \nissue of health. The amendment would ban postviability abortions unless \n``the physician certifies''--the operative language--``that the \ncontinuation of the pregnancy would threaten the mother's life or risk \ngrievous injury to her health.''\n\n[[Page S4546]]\n\n  As I mentioned in my statement yesterday, I believe it is clear this \namendment--and the Court cases show--this amendment would do nothing to \nstop partial-birth abortion. To the contrary, it would allow any \nabortion, any abortion, Mr. President, to be performed.\n  Roe versus Wade provides, as we all know, that in the third trimester \nthere is a legitimate State interest in prohibiting abortions after \nfetal viability. This amendment would add a health exception to the \nunderlying bill. That sounds good on its face, it looks good, but when \nyou look at the Court decisions and when you look at the reality of how \nthis would work in the real world, we find that exception expands in \npractice.\n  There are no health circumstances, the evidence has clearly shown, \nthat require a pregnancy be terminated by administering this \nparticularly horrible procedure. Yesterday, I quoted Dr. Nancy Romer, \nchairman of ob-gyn and a professor at Wright State University Medical \nSchool in Ohio. Dr. Romer said,\n\n       This procedure is currently not an accepted medical \n     procedure. A search of medical literature reveals no mention \n     of this procedure, and there is no critically evaluated or \n     peer review journal that describes this procedure. There is \n     currently no peer review or accountability in this procedure. \n     It is currently being performed by physicians with no \n     obstetric training in an outpatient facility behind closed \n     doors and with no peer review.\n\n  Dr. Romer goes on to say,\n\n       There is no medical evidence that the partial-birth \n     abortion procedure is safer or necessary to provide \n     comprehensive health care to women.\n\n  So, Mr. President, it is clear there are no medical circumstances \nthat would require this procedure. Well, then you could argue, if that \nis true, Senator DeWine, why, then, what is wrong with putting a health \nexception in? What harm would that do? If there are no such \ncircumstances, why not add a health exception anyway? The answer is, \nthis health exception is so broad that it would, in fact, swallow up \nthe rule. It is so broad that, literally, any abortion would be \npermitted.\n  How do we know that? When the Supreme Court handed down its decision \nin Roe versus Wade, it also handed a decision entitled ``Doe versus \nBolton.'' Bolton held that a State statute that forbade abortions based \non a life exception had to be interpreted to mean that ``the medical \njudgment'' to provide abortion for health reasons ``may be exercised in \nthe light of all factors--physical, emotional, psychological, the \nwoman's age--relevant to the well-being of the patient.''\n  It is clear from other cases how that is interpreted. That is \ninterpreted, basically, to mean that it cannot be enforced in any way, \nthat health exception consumes everything.\n  If we pass the Daschle amendment and require this concept of \nphysician certification, that the pregnancy would risk grievous injury, \nI believe that clearly would render this bill meaningless. The courts, \nin interpreting the meaning of the word ``health,'' were accorded the \nbroad interpretation that the Supreme Court has consistently applied.\n  My colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, has already read \nthe quote from Dr. Warren Hern, but it is appropriate to hear it again \nbecause it is directly on point to this issue. Dr. Warren Hern, a \nColorado abortionist who has performed hundreds of late-term abortions, \nhas already stated that he will certify that any pregnant woman can \nmeet the standard of the Daschle amendment. ``I will certify that any \npregnancy is a threat to a woman's life and could cause grievous injury \nto her physical health.'' Any pregnant woman.\n\n  So, Mr. President, there we have it. Under this exception, any \nabortion would be permitted. When we have the testimony of America's \nmost respected doctor, Dr. C. Everett Koop, backed by the American \nMedical Association in support of the assertion that there is never a \nmedical necessity for this procedure, it is clear what the health \nexception is.\n  Mr. President, unfortunately, tragically, that purported exception is \na hoax, it is a sham, it is a smokescreen, however well-intentioned the \nauthors are.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, when you come down to it, I think it is \na moral dodge. I think it puts us to sleep. It is a way we can try to \nconvince ourselves that it is OK, this amendment is OK, even though, in \neffect, we are tolerating something very, very bad.\n  Mr. President, we are not OK. We know what is going on behind the \ncurtain and we cannot wish that knowledge away, however much we would \nlike to. We have to face it and we have to do what is right. That means \npassing this bill to ban this barbaric, inhuman, unconscionable \npractice.\n  Again, with respect to my distinguished colleague, the minority \nleader, it also means we must vote this amendment down.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I listened with great interest to the distinguished \nSenator from Ohio. He mentioned Dr. Hern's remark that he would use \nlife or grievous injury. That was his term, life or grievous injury as \na reason to continue an abortion practice.\n  I cite his remark because, of course, H.R. 1122 uses life as a \nreason, justifiably, to allow the late-term abortion, the dilation and \nextraction method that the bill otherwise prohibits from being used. \nSo, if Dr. Hern would use health, he would use life, as he indicated, \nmaking meaningless the language in H.R. 1122, as well.\n  I just hope we apply the same standards to both bills in our debate \nas to what the efficacy of language will be. Indeed, if people are \ngoing to find loopholes, they will find them in H.R. 1122, as in our \nbill.\n  But, again, I reiterate that Dr. Hern, with our language, will go to \njail, will go to jail.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Senate minority leader for yielding me this \ntime, but, more importantly, I secondly want to commend him for his \nrefreshing approach in trying to craft a consensus on what is obviously \na very difficult issue when it comes to the problem of late-term \nabortion. He has shown determination and persistence and dedication in \narriving at this compromise. I think that if more people in this body \ntook that approach on the most contentious issues, we would not be \nstanding here today even debating this one.\n  This is a very difficult issue. But the compromise that the Senate \nminority leader has worked out clearly represents a serious attempt in \nbridging the differences on this issue, but also an attempt to address \na very divisive issue.\n  I had to reread the legislation after I heard several interpretations \nof it today. The Senate minority leader's legislation will ban all \npostviability abortions. There is one area upon which we all agree, \nthat no viable fetus should be aborted by any method unless it is \nnecessary to protect the life and the health of the mother.\n  The difference here today is one issue: It is whether or not we are \nprepared to provide a health exception. I am very grateful to my \ncolleague from South Dakota for trying to find common ground on this \nissue. All Members, pro-choice and pro-life, ought to be able to come \ntogether and agree.\n  Mr. President, 41 States, including my own State of Maine, already \nban postviability abortions. We all agree that we need to ensure that \nhealthy pregnancies are never terminated after a fetus is viable \nregardless of which procedure is used. That is why the Daschle approach \nis so important.\n  Furthermore, the Daschle substitute will lower, actually lower the \nnumber of abortions in this country as opposed to the legislation \noffered by the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The legislation of the Senator from Pennsylvania, S. 6, would not \nprevent a single abortion. Ironically, what it would do is force a \nwoman to choose another potentially life-threatening procedure when it \ncomes to her health.\n  It clearly does not make any sense to me that we here in the U.S. \nSenate are prepared to place a woman's health in jeopardy, place a \nwoman in an unacceptable risk, while doing nothing to lower the number \nof abortions that occur in this country.\n  The Daschle amendment will decrease the number of abortions and will \ndo so without putting a woman's life and health on the line. To critics \nwho say the Daschle language contains a\n\n[[Page S4547]]\n\nloophole because it leaves it to the doctor to determine when the fetus \nis viable, I ask, who is in a better position than doctors to determine \nthis? Certainly not the Federal Government. Certainly not the U.S. \nSenate. I know some would think they are omnipotent, but certainly not \nthe U.S. House of Representatives. Certainly not politicians making \nthis determination. This is a determination that should be made by the \nphysician and the physician alone.\n  In fact, the report that has been touted here by the American Medical \nAssociation, which I find quite interesting, is a 35-page report. I \nknow that proponents of S. 6 and the legislation supported by the \nSenator from Pennsylvania touts this report, but this report did not \neven come down in support of the Senator's legislation after 35 pages. \nBut in this report that was released on Tuesday by the American Medical \nAssociation, it states, ``It is the physician who should determine the \nviability.'' Exactly.\n  But it is not only the American Medical Association who says the \nviability of determination should be left to the doctor. It is also the \nSupreme Court. In Planned Parenthood versus Danforth, the Supreme Court \nsaid,\n\n       The time viability is achieved may vary with each \n     pregnancy, and the determination of whether a particular \n     fetus is viable is, and must be, a matter for the judgment of \n     the responsible attending physician.\n\n  Only doctors are equipped to make this determination. It is not those \nof us here in the U.S. Senate. It is not a bureaucracy. It is not the \nGovernment. We want our physicians to make that determination.\n  Now, critics say protecting a woman from a grievous injury to her \nphysical health does not justify terminating a later stage pregnancy.\n  I ask again. Who are these politicians to make this heart-wrenching \ndecisions for a family when a woman's life is in jeopardy? To the \ncritics who say the Daschle language contains a loophole because \ndoctors can interpret the health exception any way they want, as I say, \nread legislative language.\n  ``Grievous physical injury'' is defined as a ``severely debilitating \ndisease or impairment caused by the pregnancy,'' or ``an inability to \nprovide necessary treatment for a life-threatening condition.''\n  That is very clear. It is very plain. It is very strict. It is a very \nnarrow definition. And, as the Senator from South Dakota indicated, the \npenalties are extremely harsh, if the doctor didn't make that \ndetermination according to this definition.\n  If I were a doctor and I read the penalties in this legislation that \nbecame law, I can guarantee you the doctor would make that \ndetermination and that definition in terms of what was grievous, what \nwas a severely debilitating disease or impairment caused by the \npregnancy or an inability to provide necessary treatment for a life-\nthreatening condition. Their definition is protecting women from the \nmost serious and life-threatening health risk.\n  This narrow definition comports with again the American Medical \nAssociation's position that postviability abortion should only be used \nunder those extraordinary circumstances when it absolutely is necessary \nto preserve the life and health of the mother. The Daschle substitute \nis narrowly tailored to allow postviability abortions only under these \nextraordinary circumstances.\n  This language could not be more clear. How can you second-guess what \nis grievous? How could you second-guess the penalties that are included \nin this legislation? How could you second-guess the notion of going to \njail?\n  There is no question that any abortion is an emotional and difficult \ndecision for a woman. When a woman must confront this decision during \nthe later stages of her pregnancy because she knows that the pregnancy \njeopardizes her very life and health, such a decision becomes a \nnightmare. And we have heard example after example. These aren't \nfaceless individuals. These are human beings. These are women--women we \nknow who have faced these circumstances who do not want the U.S. Senate \nor the U.S. Congress making that decision for them in these very \nlimiting exceptional health circumstances. We have no right to be \nmaking that decision.\n  The Roe versus Wade decision was carefully crafted by the Supreme \nCourt 24 years ago. It was designed to balance the rights of women in \nAmerica with reproductive decisions that have to be made. And they said \nthat the rights of women are paramount in those decisions. This \ndecision held that women have a constitutional right to an abortion, \nbut after viability States could ban abortions as long as they allow \nexceptions for cases in which a woman's life or health is in danger. \nLet me repeat that: Allow exceptions for cases in which a woman's life \nor health is endangered.\n  The Supreme Court has reaffirmed that decision time and time again. \nForty-one States have passed legislation upholding that banning of \nabortions in the later stages of pregnancy, except when it comes to a \nwoman's life or a woman's health.\n  The legislation offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania does not \nallow the exception for health. It does not allow it. In the last year, \nwe heard, ``Oh, it provides a health exception.'' But it is so broad. \nIt just says health. It is so broad you could drive a truck through it.\n  The Senate minority leader made a good-faith effort to come up with a \nvery narrow definition of grievous injury. You couldn't get much \nstricter in its interpretation.\n  So that in certain situations, where a woman's life and health is in \nsevere jeopardy, an exception can be made. The health exception for \ngrievous physical injury can only be invoked under two circumstances.\n  The first involves those heart-wrenching cases where a wanted \npregnancy seriously threatens the health of the mother. The Daschle \nlanguage would allow a doctor in these tragic cases to perform an \nabortion because he believes it is critical to preserving the health of \na woman facing cardiac failure:\n  Peripartal cardiomyopathy, a form of cardiac failure which is often \ncaused by the pregnancy which can result in death or untreatable heart \ndisease; pre-eclampsia, or high blood pressure, which is caused by a \npregnancy which can result in kidney failure, stroke, or death; uterine \nruptures, which could result in infertility.\n  Is anyone suggesting here that we should not allow exceptions in \nthese very serious health circumstances--circumstances that are not \nexcepted in the language that has been proposed by the Senator from \nPennsylvania? Imagine: A form of cardiac failure that causes death \nwould not be excepted. High blood pressure that can result in kidney \nfailure, stroke, or death would not be excepted, or exempted; or \ninfertility. Or the second circumstance that would be provided for as \nan exception under the Daschle language: When a woman has a life-\nthreatening condition that requires lifesaving treatment.\n\n  It applies to tragic cases, for example, when a woman needs \nchemotherapy when pregnant. So the family faces a terrible choice of \nconfronting the pregnancy, or providing lifesaving treatment.\n  These conditions include breast cancer, lymphoma, which has a 50-\npercent mortality rate, if untreated; primary pulmonary hypertension, \nwhich has a 50-percent maternal mortality rate.\n  Are we saying here that the U.S. Senate is saying, ``No, we will not \nprovide any exception.'' I hope not. I hope that would not be the case. \nAnd the Daschle substitute allows for those very limiting but very \nserious instances of health circumstances that could jeopardize \npermanently a woman's life, if not resulting in death.\n  If this Chamber passes this bill without the Daschle amendment, it \nwill represent a direct frontal assault on the health of American \nwomen. Make no mistake. Innocent women will suffer. We must not \noverlook that women's lives and health are at stake. They hang in \nbalance. Women who undergo these procedures face a terrible tragedy of \nlater-stage pregnancy that has through no fault of their own gone \nterribly, tragically wrong.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Daschle language. It will ensure \nthat no abortions will take place after viability unless it is \nabsolutely necessary to avoid grievous physical injury to a woman while \nprotecting the woman's life and health.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n[[Page S4548]]\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, a couple of comments before I yield to \nthe Senator from Arkansas.\n  I want to repeat what was stated by George Will in a column talking \nabout the Daschle amendment. He said, ``The Daschle amendment is a law \nthat is impossible to violate.''\n  All these things sound really wonderful. We have these real tough \ndefinitions; real tough except for the fact that you can't violate the \nlaw because you are giving all of the authority to the doctor to \ndetermine whether he breaks the law, or she breaks the law.\n  Wouldn't you love to have a law where you are the self-enforcer of \nthe law? You have to call it yourself because, once you sign that \ncertification, it is a conclusion. You cannot be second-guessed. What \ndoctor is going to say, ``Oh. I aborted this baby, and it would have \nbeen viable''?\n  First of all, no second-trimester baby is ever going to be viable by \nany doctor doing an abortion. They just won't because there is still a \npercentage that aren't, and they will just say, ``It is not viable.'' \nThey will sign a certification saying it is not viable. Next, they will \nsign it saying there is a health problem. Like Dr. Hern said, you can't \nget away from the fact that the people who are doing these abortions--\nmost of the folks who do them--do them for a living. They are not going \nto call it on themselves--that there really wasn't a health exception. \nThey are not going to say, ``That is the reason I did this. I did this \nabortion wrong.''\n  What we have here instead of a judge, jury, and executioner is \nexecutioner, judge, and jury.\n  As far as I am concerned, George Will is absolutely right. This is a \nlaw that cannot be violated. As tough as all of this sounds, as \npersuasive as some of his arguments that they really care about \nlimiting abortions, it will not stop one abortion.\n\n  At least what the underlying bill does is outlaw a procedure that is \nso far outside of what our country should permit, and at least take the \nstep in the right direction of providing some sense of humanity to \nthose little children.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania \nfor yielding.\n  Mr. President, I rise in respectful but very, very strong opposition \nto the Daschle amendment.\n  I want to commend the Senator from Pennsylvania for his courageous \nleadership on an issue that deserves to be debated and a ban which \ndeserves to be passed.\n  I believe that abortion and the human life issue in this country are \nthe great moral issues that confront our society.\n  I heard my colleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, say that we \nvoted 52 times in the last Congress on the issue of abortion. And she \nsaid, ``Are we any better off?''\n  I would suggest that while we debate balanced budget amendments, \nwhile we debate chemical weapons treaties, and while we debate a host \nof important issues, there is no issue more important to the future of \nour country, to civilization, and to the kind of people we are going to \nbe than the sanctity of human life. If it takes 52 votes, then it is \nworth it.\n  Many of today's politicians will run for cover at the very mention of \nabortion, even at the term ``partial-birth abortion.'' How do we call \nourselves leaders if we are not willing to grapple, to debate, to \nstruggle, to agonize and reach moral conclusions as to this great issue \nconfronting who we are as a people and what kind of civilization we are \ngoing to be.\n  I heard over and over the proponents of the Daschle amendment, the \nopponents of the ban on partial-birth abortions, that it is hard to \nimagine that we would be debating on the floor of the U.S. Senate with \nthose who would oppose a ban on the most horrific, barbaric procedure \nimaginable. But that is what we are doing. I heard them over and over \nsay, ``Let's keep politicians out of it; shouldn't have politicians \ngetting involved in such an issue''; suggested that Government should \nstay out of the abortion issue. If the protection of innocent human \nlife is not Government's duty, then what is?\n  Thomas Jefferson once wrote, ``The care of human life, not its \ndestruction, is the first and only legitimate objective of good \ngovernment.'' Then Jefferson went on. He said, ``Legislative efforts to \nprotect the weak and defenseless are right, and should be pursued.''\n  Isn't that the proper role of Government--to protect those who are \nweak, to protect those who are defenseless? Should we not, in \nJefferson's words, ``pursue'' those legislative efforts? I believe we \nshould.\n  To me it is the great irony of the Daschle amendment because in every \nspeaker who has advocated and spoken in favor of the Daschle amendment \nthere has been a dichotomy. There has been, ``Keep Government out. Oh, \nthis is tough. This is a tough ban. Keep Government out of this. Leave \nit with the physician. But we will throw that physician in jail. The \nDaschle abortion ban spares viable fetuses, proposals stricter than the \nGOP measure. They will throw him in jail, and then, keep Government \nout.''\n  To my colleagues, I say you can't have it both ways. It is clever. It \nsounds good. The reason we have this amendment today is because the \npolls say that 70 percent of the American people support a ban on this \nterrible, terrible medical procedure, if you can call it a medical \nprocedure--partial-birth abortion.\n  That is why this amendment is being offered. I hope that after this \ndebate is over, Senator Daschle will offer this as a freestanding bill. \nI think it has problems. I do not think it will do all what he believes \nit will do, what I think he sincerely believes it will do, but if he is \nsincere in this, it will be offered as a freestanding bill, and we will \ntake this up through the legislative process.\n  The reason the President has said he will support the Daschle \namendment, in my opinion, is simply that he knows it is no ban. It is, \nin the words of George Will, ``a law that can't be violated.'' In fact, \nthe ultimate arbiter becomes the physician, in this case the abortion \nprovider.\n  Seventy percent of the American people say we need this ban and \nsupport it. In March of this year, Arkansas, my home State, joined with \nseven other States in banning such a procedure. The State legislature \npassed the bill. Gov. Mike Huckabee signed the bill into law. And I \nbelieve that the home State of our President has, in enacting that \nlegislation, in passing our own partial-birth abortion ban in the State \nof Arkansas, they have sent a message to the President of the United \nStates, our former Governor, our native son, that the people of his \nhome State do not want this procedure legal in this country.\n  Partial-birth abortion is barbaric; it is uncivilized; it is \nshockingly close to infanticide; and no civilized country should allow \nit. It is that simple. Any woman knows that the first step of a \npartial-birth abortion--breech delivery--is something to avoid, not \nsomething to cause purposely.\n  The rhetoric surrounding this issue is amazing. Those who would allow \nunlimited partial-birth abortions characterize the procedure as one \nthat is used very rarely and only in an absolute emergency and only \nwhere no other procedure is available. They would have you believe that \nall those who have this procedure want to carry their pregnancy to term \nand have the child. These claims are simply wrong and they are \nunfounded. A quote that is extremely interesting to me is from Jean \nWright, associate professor of Pediatrics at Emory University. Ms. \nWright was testifying against the argument that fetuses who are \ncandidates for a partial-birth abortion do not feel pain during the \nprocedure. She testified that the fetus is sensitive to pain, perhaps \neven more sensitive than a full-term infant. She added, and this is the \npart that is especially striking, ``This procedure, if it was done on \nan animal in my institution, would not make it through the \ninstitutional review process. The animal would be more protected than \nthis child is.''\n  It is incredible. We are protecting animals better than we protect \nunborn, viable fetuses. Making one class of humanity expendable, I \nbelieve, devalues all humanity. In fact, the rejection of life's \nsanctity begins a downward journey toward human debasement.\n  I was interviewed, as we all have been interviewed, by a reporter. I \nwas\n\n[[Page S4549]]\n\ninterviewed yesterday, and the reporter asked an interesting question. \nShe asked this: Won't this ban start us down a slippery slope that will \nend up banning all abortions? Interesting choice of words, ``slippery \nslope,'' because now in this country we debate assisted suicides, we \ndebate partial-birth abortions. The slippery slope has been in our slow \ndebasement and devaluing of the worth and sanctity and dignity of human \nlife. That is the slippery slope.\n  Over the last few months there has been some breakthrough, I think, \nin information that is being disseminated. The confession of Ron \nFitzsimmons was very telling when he admitted that he ``lied through \nhis teeth'' to the Nation. I cannot help but wonder after this vote is \nover if 2 months, 3 months down the road we will not find again that \nthere has been a campaign of disinformation to prevent this ban from \nbeing enacted. I even now ask my colleagues to look deep within their \nsouls. They have been misled. They have been sold a bill of goods. They \nhave every justification for switching a vote and voting for this ban \nand voting to override an expected veto.\n\n       In the vast majority of cases, the procedure is performed \n     on a healthy mother with a healthy fetus.\n\n  That is what Ron Fitzsimmons said. That is what he admitted. He is an \nadvocate of abortion. He goes on to say that\n\n     the abortion-rights folks know it, the anti-abortion folks \n     know it, and so probably, does everyone else. One of the \n     facts of abortion is that women enter the abortion clinics to \n     kill their fetuses. It is a form of killing. You are ending a \n     life.\n\n  That is what the head of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers \nconfessed. Syndicated columnist Richard Cohen admitted he ``was led to \nbelieve that late-term abortions were extremely rare and performed only \nwhen the life of the mother was in danger or the fetus irreparably \ndeformed.'' Realizing the mistake, and I quote again, he said, ``I was \nwrong.''\n  Wouldn't it be refreshing if some of those who were misled would \nsimply say, ``I was wrong. I will change my vote.''\n  Could I ask the Senator from Pennsylvania for an additional 5 \nminutes?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Senator is yielded such time as he may consume.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Now we have the Daschle amendment before us. The \nfacts have not changed. I think many are beginning to see the truth on \nthis issue, the truth behind the partial-birth abortion myth.\n  The next myth that we have to overcome in this debate is that the \nPresident and his congressional allies have a viable alternative to the \npartial-birth abortion ban, that this amendment that we are debating \neven now is a legitimate alternative to a ban on partial-birth \nabortions.\n  Well, that is a myth. George Will said, ``It is a law that's \nimpossible to violate.'' He is right. It is an amendment that pro-\nabortion allies can support so they can tell their constituents they \nsupported a ban, I believe. And, again, I hope that this will be \nintroduced as a freestanding bill because I think in that situation, we \nwill be able to see exactly where the flaws are as it is debated in a \ncommittee, as it is scrutinized.\n  The Daschle proposal would explicitly allow abortion even in the \nthird trimester if an abortionist simply asserts that ``continuation of \nthe pregnancy would risk grievous injury to the mother.'' That is all \nhe has to say. That's all the abortionist has to say. In effect, the \nDaschle amendment would allow partial-birth abortions on demand in the \nfifth and sixth months of the baby's development when the vast majority \nof such abortions are performed. So the vast majority of partial-birth \nabortions--this procedure that is universally condemned--would be \npermitted under the Daschle amendment, it would not affect them at all, \nwould not stop a one, even though we know that many of those preborn \ninfants can now survive even before the third trimester because of \nadvanced technology.\n  I recently visited the Children's Hospital in Little Rock, AR. I was \nabsolutely amazed at the neonatal unit and what is being done today in \nlowering the age of viability. On the basis of recent published \ninterviews with abortionists who perform these procedures as well as \nthe head of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, Ron \nFitzsimmons, it appears likely that 90 percent or more of partial-birth \nabortions are performed in the fifth and sixth months, not the third \ntrimester. The Daschle amendment will not affect those partial-birth \nabortions at all.\n  One of Senator Daschle's arguments against adding second-trimester \nlanguage is that Roe versus Wade prohibits second-trimester abortions. \nBut in the official report of the House Judiciary Committee on the \nbill, the committee argues that the partial-birth abortion procedure is \nnot protected by Roe versus Wade. It is not protected by Roe versus \nWade since the baby is mostly outside the womb throughout the \nprocedure, and Roe versus Wade refers to fetuses inside the womb.\n\n  So to say we cannot address the second-trimester issue of partial-\nbirth abortions because it is protected by Roe versus Wade is to beg \nthe issue and to avoid, I think, good legal opinion.\n  Many lawmakers who support Roe versus Wade also support the Partial-\nBirth Abortion Ban Act, some of them explicitly citing the Judiciary \nCommittee's constitutional argument. In addition, several States have \npassed bills to ban partial-birth abortions at any point in the \npregnancy with only a life-of-the-mother exception. It appears, \ntherefore, that many State legislators do not share the Democratic \nleader's view that they are powerless to prevent partial-birth \nabortions in the fifth and sixth months.\n  My home State of Arkansas, as I mentioned earlier, is one of those \nStates that does not share in that opinion.\n  Moreover, the Physicians Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth, a coalition of \nover 500 physicians, including professors and department chairmen in \nobstetrics and gynecology, has emphasized that not only is a partial-\nbirth abortion never necessary to preserve a woman's health or future \nfertility, but this procedure can, in fact, pose a significant threat \nto both.\n  While there may be a medical circumstance which requires a fetus to \nbe delivered early, there is none--none--which requires killing the \nfetus and certainly none requiring that a fetus be partly delivered and \nthen killed as during a partial-birth abortion.\n  The Daschle proposal would allow any abortionist to kill a baby even \nafter viability merely by signing a permission slip to himself, a so-\ncalled certification, and once the abortion provider signs such a piece \nof paper, this amendment would give that abortion provider complete \nimmunity from any penalty, even if there is overwhelming objective \nevidence that he aborted a healthy, viable baby of a mother who is not \nat risk, because he signed that certification.\n  The House passed H.R. 1122, its version, with a margin sufficient to \noverride a Presidential veto. I hope my colleagues in the Senate will \njoin our House colleagues in such a vote here. There is nothing, I \nbelieve, that will define us as a people, there is nothing that will \ndefine us as a civilization more than how we speak on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter dated May 7, \n1997, from PHACT be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                Physicians' Ad Hoc\n\n\n                                          Coalition for Truth,\n\n                                                      May 7, 1997.\n     Letters to the Editor,\n     The Washington Post,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Editors: Senator Tom Daschle lists several medical \n     conditions as indications for a ``termination of pregnancy'' \n     in the health interests of the mother (``Late Term Abortion--\n     In Rare Cases Only,'' The Washington Post, 5/2/97). However, \n     he confuses ``termination of pregnancy'' with abortion--the \n     deliberate destruction of the unborn (or, in the case of the \n     partial-birth abortion procedure, the mostly born) human \n     fetus. The two things are not the same.\n       As specialists in the care and management of high risk \n     pregnancies complicated by maternal or fetal illness \n     (perinatology), we have all treated women who, during their \n     pregnancies, have faced the conditions cited by Senator \n     Daschle. We are gravely concerned that the remarks by Senator \n     Dashle and those who support the continued use of partial-\n     birth abortion may lead such women to believe they have no \n     other choice but to abort their children because of their \n     conditons. While it may become necessary, in the second or \n     third trimester, to end a pregnancy in order to protect the \n     mother's life or health, abortion is never required--\n\n[[Page S4550]]\n\n     i.e., it is never medically necessary, in order to preserve a \n     women's life, health or future fertility, to deliberately \n     kill an unborn child in the second or third trimester, and \n     certainly not by mostly delivering the child before putting \n     him or her to death. What is required in the circumstances \n     specified by Senator Daschle is separation of the child from \n     the mother, not the death of the child.\n       Fetal indications have been cited in attempts to justify \n     partial-birth abortion, including hydrocephaly, triscomy, \n     omphalocele and encephalocele. Such fetal anomalies alone do \n     not threaten a mother's life or health and therefore do not \n     require the death of the child for the mother's medical well-\n     being.\n       Sen. Daschle would limit his ``ban'' to the third-trimester \n     or ``post-viability.'' Again, there is no medical necessity \n     for killing a post-viable child. If maternal conditions \n     require the emptying of the womb post-viability, the standard \n     would be to induce labor and simply deliver the child. By \n     definition, the post-viable child delivered early is simply a \n     premature baby.\n       Moreover, because Sen. Daschle limits his proposal to the \n     third trimester, it would do little to end the practice of \n     partial-birth abortion. The majority of partial-birth \n     abortions--estimated at some four to five thousand annually--\n     take place in the fifth and six month (late second trimester) \n     and mostly on healthy mothers with healthy children. But even \n     at this earlier stage of pregnancy, a standard induction of \n     labor, in terms of the mother's health, is far preferable to \n     partial-birth abourtion as the means for emptying the womb.\n       Finally, it should be noted that at 21 weeks and after, \n     abortion is twice as risky for women as childbirth: the risk \n     of maternal death is 1 in 6,000 for abortion and 1 in 13,000 \n     for childbirth. If the chief concern is to minimize health \n     risks to women who show indications for a termination of \n     pregnancy in the second or third trimester, then, as these \n     numbers clearly show, termination by induction of labor and \n     delivery is clearly preferable to abortion.\n       With on-going advances in the care and management of high \n     risk pregnancies, even women suffering from those conditions \n     cited by Senator Daschle can often be brought safely to term \n     and their child delivered. In those cases where a second or \n     third trimester preterm termination of pregnancy is \n     indicated, abortion, and certainly partial-birth abortion, is \n     never medically required or necessary to achieve this. We \n     agree with Senator Daschle that it is ``appropriate . . . for \n     Congress and the public to consider when, and under what \n     circumstances the government may restrict access to abortion \n     by any procedure.'' Having the medical facts straight is a \n     necessary part of this process.\n       While we support Sen. Daschle's goal of banning abortion \n     after the fetus is viable--because they are never medically \n     indicated or necessary--his proposal would do nothing to \n     achieve this goal, while leaving the practice of partial-\n     birth abortion virtually untounched.\n           Sincerely,\n         Steve Calvin, M.D., Assistant Professor, Ob/Gyn, Division \n           of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, University of Minnesota; \n           Thomas M.

Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  There is an old saying that ``virtue is its own reward.'' I would \nhave to say to the minority leader, Senator Daschle, that when he \nundertook this project and this responsibility to try to craft a \nreasonable answer to this national debate on partial-birth abortion, as \nit is characterized, he truly understood the daunting task which he \nfaced. I have seen the advertisements against the Senator, full-page \nads which have called the Senator every name in the book. But I know, \nhaving tried to do the same thing, that the Senator addressed this \nissue in an honest and forthright way, that the Senator worked for \nmonths to come up with the right language that was, first, \nconstitutional; second, sensitive to reality; and, third, which \naddressed a serious national concern about late-term abortions. I am \nproud to be a cosponsor of Senator Daschle's amendment.\n  When this issue came before the House of Representatives, and I \nserved in that body, I sat in the Chamber of the House and listened to \nevery minute of debate. I have never, ever in my public career viewed a \nvote on abortion as an easy vote. I have always sat down and thought \ncarefully about what is the right thing to do, and some of the votes \nhave troubled me because it is a troubling issue. Since our national \ndebate on slavery, I cannot think of another issue which has divided \nAmerica over such a protracted period of time.\n  And the reason, of course, is that in this debate we are addressing \none of the most enduring debates in the history of man, the appropriate \nrole of Government. At what point do the rights of the individual end \nand the rights of society and the Government begin? This classic \nquestion, pitting individual liberty against the responsibility of \nGovernment, is clearly at issue when we discuss abortion.\n  Religions and moralists draw clear lines of belief, but where does a \ndiverse society like America draw the line? Where do the rights of a \nwoman to control her body end, and the rights of the fetus, or \npotential life, begin? The Supreme Court, in Roe versus Wade, tried to \ndraw a bright line on this clouded issue. The absolute rights of a \nwoman in America to privacy and to the control of her body yield when \nthe fetus can survive outside the mother. Thus, viability is the \ndividing line in this national debate. Before viability, when the fetus \ncannot survive, then the mother's rights and decisions are paramount. \nAfter viability, the fetus is protected except in the most \nextraordinary cases.\n  Senator Daschle, what I find interesting is this: Had you presented \nthis bill 2 or 3 years ago, and said that you wanted to take the Doe \nversus Bolton case, which said that we would allow abortions after \nviability to protect the mother's life or health, but you wanted to \ntake that language and clarify it so that the word ``health'' was \nbetter understood and that those violating it would be subject to \nserious penalties, I would daresay that you would have been applauded \nby many of the people who are going to vote against you today.\n  But they do not accept your sincerity in this, and I do. I share your \nfeeling. I believe that after viability we should apply a strict test \nas to whether any abortion procedure is going to be allowed.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania, in banning one procedure, previability \nand postviability does not address this. And he would have to admit, in \nall honesty, that Senator Daschle addresses the specific procedure he \nwould like to ban and any other abortion procedure after the moment of \nviability. His ban, his restriction is much more specific, but much \nless respectful of the Constitution, women, and fetuses, than that \nbeing offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  I find it interesting, too, that Senator Daschle's proposal faces \ncriticism on the grounds that the doctor is going to make the decision \nas to whether there is a possibility of risk to the mother's life or a \npossibility of grievous injury, which is very carefully defined. If the \ndoctor does not make this decision, who will? The local Congressman? A \nU.S. Senator? Some Federal employee? I have been to a lot of town \nmeetings, hundreds of them. People have asked my opinion and help in \nmany, many situations, but never, never have they asked me to come to \ntheir homes when their family has to make an important medical decision \nand give them the Government's point of view. Quite honestly, Senator \nDaschle addresses this in the only way that you can. This is a \nsituation to be certified by a doctor.\n  The Republican side has said, well, what if the doctor lies? What if \nhe misleads people? What if, in fact, there is not a threat of grievous \ninjury and he goes ahead with the procedure? And then they quote ``Dr. \nWill,'' who says, well, this is a law that can never be violated. But \nthere will be other people in that operating room. There will be other \nwitnesses to this act. If that doctor's certification is fraudulent, I \ndaresay he or she runs the risk that they will be held responsible. So, \nto say that this is unenforceable is, I think, unfair.\n  The problem with this debate, as I see it, is that many times it \ndeteriorates very quickly. There was an advertisement, a full page ad \nthat was\n\n[[Page S4551]]\n\nbought by a religious group, which listed the reasons a woman seeks a \nlate-term abortion. It was an embarrassment to read that ad. At one \npoint they said, ``Some women seek an abortion because they no longer \nfit in their prom dresses.'' Perhaps that is the case. Perhaps not. But \nfor those who are arguing this issue, I hope, I sincerely hope that \nthey have taken the time, as I have, to speak to women who faced tragic \ncircumstances, and never made a casual decision.\n\n  I, for one, have met six different women who have been faced with \nthis challenge and have undergone this procedure. They remind me that \nthis debate is not about politics. It is not about legal jargon. It is \nabout our daughters, our sisters, our wives and our friends. It is \nabout families. One woman in my home State of Illinois, when she heard \nthis debate, came forward and said: This isn't fair. The way they are \ncharacterizing this procedure and the decision that I faced is not \nfair. I want to tell my story. My husband and I have decided we have to \ntell our story.\n  This is their photograph. Vikki Stella of Naperville, IL, the mother \nof two daughters, 32 weeks pregnant with her third child whom she had \nnamed Anthony. She had painted the nursery. They were prepared, \nexpectant parents, again, for the happiness of another baby, their \nfirst son. And then they learned through a sonogram that Anthony \nsuffered from a serious deformity. Anthony had no brain. Anthony would \nnot survive birth but for a few moments. And, if she continued the \npregnancy, she ran the risk of jeopardizing her ability to ever have \nanother baby.\n  So her dying infant would be the last child she ever would bear. \nVikki Stella tells the story about she and her husband, hearing this \ntragic news--imagine, 8 months into the pregnancy--and then being faced \nwith the awful decision as to whether to terminate the pregnancy. They \nprayed over it. They cried over it. They went forward with it. \nAfterward, she held Anthony in her arms and understood it was the only \nthing that she and her family could do. And she came back home.\n  Last year I had a chance to be introduced to Nicholas. He is in the \npicture here. He is the little boy in her arms. Nicholas is their new \nson. I was not really introduced to him because he was asleep in a \nstroller. But the fact of the matter is, Vikki Stella's story is what \nthis debate is all about. Do you really want to say to this family that \nwe don't care whether or not this family ever has another child; that \nit makes no difference, the government is going to decide this one for \nyou? Do you really want to say that? I don't think so. This was no \ncasual decision. This was no perfect infant, as some of your \nillustrations try to prove. This was a sad situation and this family in \ngrief faced a tragic situation and made a difficult decision. This bill \nthat is being offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania would preclude \nthe very procedure which Vikki Stella's doctor recommended. That is not \nfair.\n  If you value life, look in the eyes of Nicholas and understand that \nlife came from this decision. There would not have been more life had \nshe been precluded from ending that first pregnancy. It would have been \nthe end of her ability to bear any children. Six different women I have \nspoken to on this, each one of them a gripping story.\n  Let me just concede a point. Are casual decisions made? Are there \nsome abortions where you and I might agree, oh, wait a minute, come on, \nthat is not a serious case? Yes, I think that is true. But that is what \nSenator Daschle addresses with his amendment. He says when you are late \nin the pregnancy you cannot terminate that pregnancy unless you have a \nserious reason: The life of the mother is at stake, or she risks a \ngrievous injury. We have gone beyond the abstract, we have gone beyond \nthe casual, we are into the serious situations which he has described. \nAnd that is why the Daschle amendment is one which I hope those who \ndecry abortion will think about.\n  The Senator from Arkansas, my colleague, just said, ``Search your \nconscience and soul.'' I would ask you to do the same over the Daschle \namendment. What Tom Daschle is offering today is a sensible statement \nof policy for this Nation. It does not preclude any State from saying \nwe are going to impose a stricter standard. But it says that, for a \nnational policy, we will preclude all late-term abortions except in the \nmost serious situations.\n  He does not stand alone here. This is not a political calculation. \nThe American Medical Association stands with him, as does the American \nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.\n  We have so many people practicing medicine on the floor of the Senate \ntoday, I am sure that those who are tuning in must wonder whether or \nnot we have diverted from passing law. I do not profess to have any \nexpertise when it comes to medicine. But the people who do, the \nAmerican Medical Association, the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists, have said the Daschle amendment is sensible, it is \nreasonable, it will preserve for doctors the discretion they need to \nmake the very important decisions about a woman's pregnancy, and \nterminate it. I respect that. I think all of us should.\n  Let me also say that, as this issue divides America, it divides this \nChamber, it divides political parties, it divides members of our \nfamilies. I would hope that at the end of this debate, whatever the \noutcome, we can lower the volume of rhetoric on this difficult issue \nand try to find some common ground on issues that we might all agree \non. How can we implement policies in this Nation to reduce the number \nof unintended pregnancies? Whether you are pro-life or pro-choice, can \nwe try to find some common ground there? Would that not be good for \nthis Nation and good for this issue--whatever your position on \nabortion?\n  How can we make certain that children, wanted children, receive \nappropriate pre-natal nutritional care during the pregnancy? Should we \nnot all agree on that, pro-choice or pro-life? I think there are so \nmany things which we can address which really speak to our reverence \nfor life. But today I stand in the midst of this long and maybe \nintractable debate, and urge my colleagues to seriously consider the \namendment offered by the minority leader. I believe it is responsible \nand I believe it addresses late-term abortions in terms that every \nfamily can concede are realistic. Yes, we want to reduce the number of \nabortions. We want to make them rare. But let us never preclude that \noption, when we have the life of the mother at stake, or the situation \nthat faced Vikki Stella. She had her chance because abortion is legal \nand safe in America. As a result, she is, in this photo, with her son \nNicholas.\n  I yield my time.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nKansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the Senator from \nPennsylvania leading this critical dialog that we are having. I note my \nappreciation for what the Democrat leader is putting forward, and \nappreciation as well for his discussion, what he is saying, that what \nwe need to be talking about is limiting abortion. I think folks should \nnote the change that is taking place. We are finally talking about \nstopping the destruction from occurring here. We are finally addressing \nthat, rather than saying let us continue and let us continue the growth \nof that. I appreciate his efforts in putting that forward.\n  I would note, the American Medical Association has said that this is \nnot a needed procedure at all, the partial-birth abortion procedure. \nThis is not a needed procedure. Regardless of the statements of the \nSenator from Illinois or others, this is not a necessary procedure. \nIndeed, it is a heinous procedure. The partial-birth abortion is \nsomething that pricks our conscience because we cannot even stand the \nconcept of it for pets or for animals, let alone for children and for \nbabies in this country or any other country around the world.\n  But, if I could, I would like to stand here and sound a hopeful note \nfor us, us as a people, us as a nation, we as a body as the U.S. \nSenate. I want to stand here and sound a hopeful note because it seems \nto me we are finally talking about and starting to really wrestle with \none of those things that has been one of the parts of the decline in \nthe American culture. I have shown these charts before, but I want to \nshow them during this debate because I\n\n[[Page S4552]]\n\nthink they are an important part about this debate, about what has \nhappened to the American culture during the past 30 years.\n\n  Look at this chart. This is about child abuse and neglect reports in \nthe United States since 1976. This is about children being abused, \nbeing neglected in America. We had a lot in 1976. We had nearly 600,000 \ntaking place then. In 1976, 600,000 children being abused. What do we \nhave today? I don't know if it will be surprising to anybody. Over 3 \nmillion children are being abused or neglected in America today. That \nis the state of our culture.\n  What about violent crimes? I chair the District of Columbia \nSubcommittee. We have no shortage of violent crimes here. We have had \nthree police officers murdered, assassinated, actually. I have had \nthree staff members who have suffered break-ins in my short service in \nthe U.S. Senate. I have been here 4 months. This is a violent society. \nLook at the numbers per 100,000. About 160 per 100,000 in 1960; 746 per \n100,000 in 1993. My goodness, a shocking amount of violent crime taking \nplace in this society.\n  What have we had taking place in abortion during this period in our \nsociety and our culture? In 1973 we had a little under 800,000 \nabortions in America occurring, in this country an awful lot. Look, it \nhas nearly doubled, 1.6 million per year in America.\n  If you are an astute observer you will notice some inconsistencies \nhere between a couple of these charts. You will say, ``Wait a minute, \nshouldn't child abuse have gone down if we had children who were not \nwanted who did not come into the world?'' We were promised that an \nexpansion of legal abortion would make every child a wanted child and \nreduce abuse and neglect, yet child abuse has gone up during that same \nperiod of time that we have nearly 1.6 million abortions in America \nannually.\n  What has happened here? What is going on? I think it just talks \nabout--it is a debate everybody is familiar with, the coarsening of our \nculture, the lack of love, the lack of respect. You can call it, \nreally, whatever you want to. It is just that this culture has been in \ndecline for the past 30 years. We get child neglect on the rise, and \nviolent crimes, and 1.6 million abortions a year in America. But do you \nknow what the hopeful note is here? It is we are finally talking about \nhow we limit some of this.\n  We all, everybody in this body, want this number to go down. \nEverybody in this body, regardless of whether you are pro-life or pro-\nchoice, wants this number to go down. Now we are finally talking about \nit. How can we help bring this number down?\n  I oppose Senator Daschle's amendment. I don't think his does it. I \ndon't think we will have any fewer of these taking place. I don't know \nhow many we are actually talking about with the bill of the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, and nobody really knows, but I think what we are \nreally talking about is we, as a nation, don't really like this. We \nwant it to be less. We want to stop it. We want it to go down.\n  Mother Teresa was here in this country 3 years ago. She is a saint to \nall of us. She is probably today the most respected person in the \nworld. She addressed the National Prayer Breakfast 3 years ago, and she \nstood there, this small, frail little woman, and said, ``Can't you care \nfor your children? If you can't, send me your children and I will care \nfor them. Send me your children. I'll care for your children.'' She \nalso noted at that point in time, as she noted previously, America is \nnot a rich nation; America is a poor nation--it is poor in love and \ncaring.\n  I hope historians will look back on this debate and say this was the \nstart of us changing this culture from destruction to caring, from \nsaying how can we go down to how can we start back up, and that is the \nhopeful note I have here. That is why I support Senator Santorum's \nproposed bill to eliminate, to ban this procedure of partial-birth \nabortion.\n  Mr. President, let me close by noting the heading the Democrat leader \nhas blown up from the Washington Times, suggesting his alternative is \nmore comprehensive. Mr. President, now that the details are known, the \nWashington Times printed today on an article with the headline, \n``Daschle bill may not ban anything.'' And I would like to ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of that article be included in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, May 15, 1997]\n\n                   Daschle Bill May Not Ban Anything\n\n                          (By Frank J. Murray)\n\n       A bill written by Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle that \n     is designed to head off a ban on ``partial-birth'' abortions \n     proposes a mix of state and federal sanctions that critics \n     say hinges entirely on the judgment of the abortionist.\n       ``[A doctor would] pretty much have to indict himself,'' \n     said one Capitol Hill aide involved in efforts to stop \n     abortions once a fetus can live outside the uterus.\n       Even when violations are found, federal officials would not \n     be able to act until 30 days after notifying a state's \n     governor and medical licensing board--and then only if needed \n     ``to secure substantial justice,'' according to a text of Mr. \n     Daschle's bill obtained by The Washington Times.\n       The South Dakota Democrat says his bill would bar aborting \n     any fetus capable of living outside the uterus. A doctor's \n     certification that a pregnancy risks a woman's life or \n     ``grievous injury'' to her health would be required to \n     perform such an abortion.\n       The bill's unusual and complex division of authority was \n     termed an unenforceable ``scam'' yesterday by interests as \n     diverse as Douglas Johnson, lobbyist for the National Right \n     to Life Committee, and Dr. Warren Hern, who literally wrote \n     the textbook on ``Abortion Practice.''\n       The Denver gynecologist said the fact of occasional death \n     in childbearing can justify any abortion, no matter how late \n     it is done.\n       ``I will certify that any pregnancy is a threat to a \n     woman's life and could cause ``grievous injury' to her \n     `physical health.' '' Dr. Hern said, using key words from the \n     ``Daschle bill, which he criticized as an unwise political \n     stunt to keep pace with pro-life Republicans.\n       Although Dr. Hern said some doctors would be frightened \n     into complying with the Daschle ban, Mr. Johnson predicted \n     most would follow Dr. Hern's lead.\n       ``In their world, they're not doing anything unethical to \n     sign these certifications. They think it would be unethical \n     not to. They won't see it as lying or bad faith at all,'' Mr. \n     Johnson said.\n       The lobbyist would not be drawn into discussing how the \n     partial-birth abortion ban, which would bar a specific type \n     of late-term procedure, and the Daschle bill might be merged.\n       ``You'd still be putting lipstick on a pig,'' Mr. Johnson \n     said, adding that he is unwilling to help Mr. Daschle \n     ``change the subject.''\n       Lingering doubts about whether physical ``impairment'' \n     mentioned in the Daschle bill would cover psychological \n     stress or depression were unanswered by its text or those who \n     would comment on it.\n       As many as 41 states have legislation restricting late-term \n     abortion, but pro-life groups say only New York and \n     Pennsylvania have set a time, both at 24 weeks.\n       That disparity was listed as a congressional finding to \n     justify uniformity so that women cannot cross state lines for \n     abortions once viability occurs.\n       Dr. Hern said that, in the past year, he performed 13 \n     abortions on women beyond week 26 who ``came to me from all \n     over the world.''\n       Among other untested legal questions the Daschle measure \n     poses:\n       Whether the Supreme Court would let Congress exercise \n     powers that its Roe vs. Wade ruling assigned to states. The \n     bill's ``findings'' say the court indicated it is \n     constitutional for Congress to act, but a quote from the \n     ruling is edited to omit specific reference to states having \n     that power.\n       How civil or criminal courts might examine a physician's \n     belief that ``continuation of the pregnancy would threaten \n     the mother's life or risk grievous injury to her physical \n     health.''\n       Whether the 1973 Doe vs. Bolton ruling, issued as a \n     companion on the same day with Roe vs. Wade, forbids second-\n     guessing a physician's ``professional that is his best \n     clinical, judgment.''\n       Kristi S. Hamrick, communications director for the Family \n     Research Council, faulted Mr. Daschle for not releasing the \n     text and asking the Senate ``to put aside the Partial-Birth \n     Abortion Ban Act in favor of an unseen bill hidden behind the \n     legislative equivalent of Monty Hall's door No. 2.''\n       The draft bill obtained yesterday by The Times, after a \n     spokesman insisted it had not yet been prepared, would bar \n     all abortions ``after the fetus has become viable.''\n       Although a Daschle fact sheet titled ``The Bipartisan \n     Alternative'' includes extensive descriptions of potential \n     medical complications, the proposed statute's entire \n     definition of grievous injury is: ``(A) Severely debilitating \n     disease or impairment specifically caused by the pregnancy or \n     (B) an inability to provide necessary treatment for a life-\n     threatening condition.''\n       The bill also would bar enforcement through private \n     lawsuits when government will not act.\n       There may not even be federal jurisdiction, said a House \n     Judiciary Committee aide to Rep. Charles T. Canady, Florida \n     Republican who sponsored the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act \n     that passed the House March 20 by the veto-proof vote of 295-\n     136.\n       ``How does the federal government have any way to get into \n     court on this? It's a civil\n\n[[Page S4553]]\n\n     suit, there's no criminal case here. I don't think they even \n     have a federal nexus,'' said the aide, who asked not to be \n     named.\n       In effect, the draft measure would give a doctor, or \n     nonphysician allowed to do abortions, the last word on the \n     likelihood a fetus would survive outside the uterus, as well \n     as calculating risks of ``grievous injury'' to the mother if \n     she continues the pregnancy.\n       The bill would assign the Department of Health and Human \n     Services to regulate a doctor's certificate that ``in his or \n     her best medical judgment the abortion involved was medically \n     necessary.'' False statements to federal agencies are \n     felonies.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I want to make a couple comments. The \nSenator from Illinois made his comments, as did the Senator from Maine.\n  They keep focusing on the reason we need a health exception, that the \nDaschle amendment will do some things, ``We provide for a mother's \nhealth as well as provide for taking care of these viable babies.'' I \ndon't know how many times I have to repeat it from how many different \nsources, but it needs to be repeated again and again and again, and it \nis being repeated, frankly, without contradiction. These people who I \nam quoting are people who are involved in maternal fetal medicine. \nThese are people who deal with high-risk pregnancies, pregnancies that \nare talked about as so important to keep this health option open, that \nthose of us who want to ban partial-birth abortion without a health \noption, which everyone knows is an open door to do abortion on demand--\nthe courts have said it is, it is an open door--there is no need for a \nhealth option in second- and third-trimester abortions. That is not \nRick Santorum saying it. I don't know how many times I have said this. \nI am not saying this.\n  I will give you another physician who is a specialist in maternal \nfetal medicine, a perinatologist at the Medical College of Pennsylvania \nwho testified under oath--under oath--in U.S. Federal District Court in \nthe Southern District of Ohio. This is Dr. Harlan Giles, who \nspecializes in high-risk obstetrics and perinatology and also performs \nabortions. This is not someone who is pro-life. Under oath, a \nspecialist in the field who performs abortions, and here is what he \nsays:\n\n       After 23 weeks--\n\n  This is a 23-week case--\n\n       After 23 weeks, I do not think there are any maternal \n     conditions that I'm aware of--\n\n  This is 23 weeks, which is what Senator Daschle termed as \n``viability''--\n\n       . . . I do not think there are any maternal conditions that \n     I'm aware of that mandate ending the pregnancy that also \n     require that the fetus be dead or that the fetal life be \n     terminated.\n\n  In other words, you do not have to kill the baby, even in viable \nbabies:\n\n       In my experience for 20 years, one can deliver these \n     fetuses either vaginally, or by cesarean section for that \n     matter, depending on the choice of the parents with informed \n     consent. . . But there's no reason these fetuses cannot be \n     delivered intact vaginally after a miniature labor, if you \n     will, and be at least assessed at birth and given the benefit \n     of the doubt.\n\n  The Senator from Illinois said, ``You don't care about the health of \nthe woman, you want to take these decisions away.'' It is a decision, \nunfortunately, of too many doctors in this country and we know this--\none thing I learned in being involved, unfortunately, as I have with \nhealth care problems personally with my family is that doctors don't \nknow everything. Not every doctor is up on all the literature, not \nevery doctor knows what is out there. So, unfortunately, a lot of \npeople get a lot of bad advice.\n  Yes, they get a lot of bad advice as to when to abort a baby, far, \nfar, far too often. Maybe it is bad advice because they just don't know \nor they haven't taken the time to figure it out, or maybe it is because \nthey just don't want to deal with that high-risk pregnancy because that \nis not their speciality and they would rather just take the easy way \nout. You don't get sued for performing an abortion, you get that little \nconsent. In fact, most of the consents on abortions waive the right to \nbe sued. So you get that consent and no one is sued for doing abortions \nwrongfully. But doctors are sued for wrongful birth. Can you believe \nthat? We don't sue people for doing abortions; we sue them for having \nbabies with deformities or abnormalities. Interesting country we live \nin.\n  But the fact of the matter is that no health exception is necessary \nunder the Daschle proposal, because after viability, if you will, there \nis no reason to kill the baby to protect the health of the mother. No \nreason; never, never. I have 400 physicians who sent a letter saying \nnever. I have a doctor who is a perinatologist who performs abortions--\nnever. I don't know what else we need.\n  We talk so much. I know the Senator from California often said, \n``You're not doctors, and we shouldn't be making decisions here because \nwe're not doctors.'' I think the Senator from Michigan was right. We \nare not nuclear scientists, but we make decisions on nuclear energy, \nand we are not generals, but we make decisions on defense. That is our \njob. It may not be that we are the best qualified in all cases to make \ndecisions, but that is what we are here to do, and we do it.\n  I can tell you the Senator from California is not shy about telling \nother people how to live their lives in a whole lot of other areas. So \nI just suggest that what we are talking about are the experts telling \nus to stop the tragedy, and what we have done with the partial-birth \nabortion ban is to stop the tragedy.\n  What the Daschle bill does is continue the status quo. It does \nnothing to stop. You have seen this picture. Donna Joy Watts. Every \ndoctor who looked at Donna Joy Watts in utero said she was not viable. \nThe Daschle amendment would not have stopped doctors, and there were \nmany of them who wanted to abort Donna Joy Watts.\n\n  This is a little girl who was born to Joe and Sandra Mallon who live \nin Upper Darby, PA. This is Kathleen. Kathleen had the same condition, \nhydrocephalus. She would not be viable, she would not be protected from \nabortion under the Daschle amendment. The list goes on and on and on.\n  The fact of the matter is, there is a loophole in this amendment that \nnullifies the whole good intent that everyone is going around talking \nabout. This does nothing. What it does is provide political cover for \nthose who do not want to vote for a partial-birth abortion ban.\n  Even if you believe the Daschle amendment does what he says it does, \neven if you believe that it bans ``postviability abortions,'' most \npartial-birth abortions are done at 20 to 24 weeks, which is just at \nthe edge of viability. So most partial-birth abortions would, \nundoubtedly, continue to be legal under the Daschle amendment.\n  I suggest that we stick to what we know are the facts. We know the \nfact is that the partial-birth abortion procedure is a brutal, barbaric \nprocedure that should not be legal in our country. We should abolish \nit. We have the opportunity to do that. If the Senator from South \nDakota, and the other Members who are part of his team, want to work on \nfurther restricting abortions, count me in, but this amendment does not \ndo that.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMaine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Maine \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the substitute offered by the \ndistinguished minority leader and my colleague from Maine, Senator \nSnowe, to H.R. 1122, the partial-birth abortion legislation.\n  Let me be clear at the outset that I do not favor abortion. Like most \nwomen, I do not believe that abortion should be used as a means of \ncontraception, and I am extremely pleased that the incidence of \nabortion is on the decline in my State of Maine. In fact, it has \ndropped by more than 43 percent over the past 10 years.\n  Moreover, while I respect the right of a woman to choose to terminate \na pregnancy during the early stages, even if it is not a choice that I \npersonally would ever make, I am strongly opposed to all late-term \nabortions that are not necessary to preserve the physical health or the \nlife of the mother.\n  Fortunately, these procedures are exceedingly rare in my State where \njust one abortion involving a fetus 20 weeks or older was recorded in \nall of 1995.\n  We have heard some graphic and extremely disturbing descriptions of \nthe partial-birth-abortion procedure during\n\n[[Page S4554]]\n\nthe debate on this bill. However, all of the procedures used to perform \nlate-term abortions are equally gruesome and horrible and troubling.\n  I agree with the minority leader that this debate should not be about \none particular method of abortion, but rather should focus on the \nlarger question of under what circumstances should late-term abortions \nbe legally available. My belief is that late-term abortions, whatever \nthe procedure used, should be banned, except in those rare cases where \nthe life or the physical health of the mother is at serious risk.\n  In my view, Congress is not well equipped to make judgments on \nspecific medical procedures. As the American College of Obstetrics and \nGynecologists has said:\n\n       The intervention of legislative bodies into medical \n     decisionmaking is inappropriate, ill-advised and dangerous.\n\n  Most politicians have neither the training nor the experience to \ndecide which procedure is most appropriate in any given case. These \nmedically difficult and highly personal decisions should be left for \nfamilies to make in consultation with their doctors.\n  While I do not believe that it is appropriate for us to dictate \nmedical practice, I do believe that Congress does have an appropriate \nduty to consider the circumstances under which access to abortion by \nany procedure should be restricted.\n  The Supreme Court, in Roe versus Wade, has set certain parameters for \nour task by identifying ``viability''--the point at which the fetus is \ncapable of sustaining life outside the womb with or without life \nsupport as the defining point in determining the constitutionality of \nrestrictions on abortion.\n  The amendment we are proposing today goes beyond S. 6 which simply \nprohibits a medical procedure and will not prevent a single abortion. I \nthink that is a point that has been missed frequently in this debate. \nBy contrast, the Daschle-Snowe substitute would prohibit the abortion \nof any viable fetus by any method unless the abortion is necessary to \npreserve the life of the mother or to prevent grievous injury to her \nphysical health.\n  Mr. President, some have expressed concern that providing a general \nexception for the health of the mother creates too large a loophole, \nthat it will allow late-term abortions to be performed simply because \nthe mother is depressed or feeling stressed by the pregnancy. I share \nthis concern. I completely agree. And that is why I opposed the \namendment offered by the Senators from California, and it is why I have \nworked so hard to carefully and tightly limit the exception in this \namendment to grievous injury to the mother's physical health.\n  ``Grievous injury'' is narrowly and strictly defined by the amendment \nas either a ``severely debilitating disease or impairment specifically \ncaused by the pregnancy'' or an ``inability to provide necessary \ntreatment for a life-threatening condition.'' Moreover, grievous injury \ndoes not include any condition that is not medically diagnosable or any \ncondition for which the termination of the pregnancy is not medically \nindicated. This language is far more restrictive, and rightly so, than \nthe broad ``health'' exception debated earlier.\n  Mr. President, we are not talking about healthy mothers aborting \nhealthy fetuses in the final weeks of pregnancy. We are not talking \nabout hypothetical examples developed by rogue doctors as excuses for \nperforming abortions. What we are talking about are the severe \nmedically diagnosable threats to a woman's physical health that are \nsometimes brought on or aggravated by pregnancy. Let me give my \ncolleagues a few examples.\n  Primary pulmonary hypertension, which can cause sudden death or \nintractable congestive heart failure;\n  Severe pregnancy-aggravated hypertension with accompanying kidney or \nliver failure;\n  Complications from aggravated diabetes, such as amputation or \nblindness;\n  Or an inability to treat aggressive cancers, such as leukemia, breast \ncancer, or non-Hodgkins lymphoma.\n  These are all conditions that are cited in the medical literature as \npossible indications for pregnancy terminations. In these rare cases, I \nbelieve that we should leave the very difficult decisions about what \nshould be done to the best judgment of the women, their families, and \nthe physicians involved.\n  Mr. President, last month, after weeks of heated debate and \ndiscussion, the Maine State legislature rejected a bill to ban partial-\nbirth abortions.\n  During the course of that emotional debate--and this was a very \ndifficult and agonizing debate for all of us--Republican Senator Betty \nLou Mitchell of Etna, ME, talked about the decision her daughter-in-law \nfaced 12 years ago. Well into her much-wanted pregnancy, at more than 5 \nmonths, the expectant mother learned that her fetus was seriously brain \ndamaged and could not live in the world for more than a few months. \nMoreover, she was told that carrying the baby to term would prevent her \nfrom ever having another child. Faced with this devastating news, she \nmade the heartwrenching decision to terminate the much-wanted \npregnancy.\n  Maine State minority leader Jane Amero told me of a similar \nexperience of a friend's daughter who suffered an extremely serious \ninfection very late in her pregnancy. If she had not terminated that \npregnancy, this young woman, who very much wanted to be a mother, would \nhave been left sterile at the age of 25.\n  The stories told by these two Maine State senators revealed the \nreality behind the rhetoric in this highly charged emotional debate. \nThankfully, most of us here will never face such wrenching decisions. \nBut we know that there are women who do. And the question is, whether \nthis highly personal choice, under such difficult and tragic medical \ncircumstances, should be made by these women and their families or by \nthe Federal Government.\n  In my judgment, the substitute before us will ensure that late-term \nabortions are severely limited and limited to only those rare and \ntragic cases where the life or the physical health of the mother is in \nserious jeopardy. I urge adoption of the substitute.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). Who yields time?\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield such time as he may consume to the Senator from \nNew Hampshire who, I might add, while we have had many speakers come to \nsupport this partial-birth abortion legislation--this time in effect we \nhave 42 cosponsors on this legislation--when the bill first came to the \nU.S. Senate, Senator Smith, and, frankly, Senator Smith alone, was \nstanding, debating this issue and defending this position. He was a \ncrusader and someone who stood out when few were willing to speak up. \nAnd he is truly the champion of this legislation. It is an honor to \nyield whatever time he would like to talk about it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank my distinguished colleague from \nPennsylvania for his very kind remarks, and want to join many of my \ncolleagues in applauding his efforts on this issue the way that he has \npursued this, I think in fairness and in looking for every opportunity \nto proceed along this course which basically, as we all know, is the \ntaking of innocent life. And Senator Santorum has stood up for those \ninnocent children, time and time again on the floor.\n  I do know what it feels like to do that, but you know, when you look \nback in the great debates of history--and this is one of the great \ndebates of history; it will be so judged, I will say to my colleagues--\nit will be judged up there with the debate on slavery and other great \nmoral issues of our time, which some say we ought not to be debating \nhere on the floor. But the truth of the matter is, this is a very \nappropriate place to debate these kinds of things.\n  Slavery was wrong. It was morally wrong. And people stood up against \nthe popular tide at the time and opposed it. Because they did, slavery \nwas ended.\n  I sincerely hope--and I know that there has been enough rhetoric said \non all sides of this issue to make everybody tired of it, I am sure. \nAnd I do not intend to be loud. I like to try to be as quiet and \nunassuming, but firm, as I can.\n  As I sat here listening this afternoon, and also as I have listened \nto so much of it on the monitor over the last day,\n\n[[Page S4555]]\n\nI could not help but wonder what those who have been the victims of \nabortion would say if they could vote. They cannot.\n  Some of our constituents who disagree with us or agree with us, \nwhatever the case may be, have the opportunity to so judge you at \nelection time, but not--not--the victims that we are talking about in \nthis debate, which is somewhat ironic to say the least.\n  And I know that I have seen pictures from both sides of the debate \npresented from those children who were born because a young woman had \nanother opportunity to have a child and also from those children who \nwere born because a young woman did not have an abortion. So I have \nseen the pictures. But, Mr. President, I go beyond pictures.\n  I had the opportunity about a year-and-a-half ago to be at an event \nwhere a young woman--I will not use her name--but she was aborted in \nthe eighth month by her mother, and she survived. And she was a 22-\nyear-old young woman who had a slight disability as a result of the \nprocedure. Other than that, she had nothing wrong with her. The \nabortion that this young child was the victim of was purely for \nconvenience.\n  Now, that is not the debate here--and I do not mean that it is on the \nDaschle amendment--but she was aborted. And to listen to her, Mr. \nPresident, stand before an audience of probably 800 to 1,000 people, \nsay, No. 1, ``I forgive my mother. And she is my mother,'' she said, \nand, No. 2, listening to her sing ``Amazing Grace''--now, if you want \nsomething to tear at your heartstrings, endure that. I have. But that \nis nothing as to what this young woman endured.\n  I remember her testifying here before congressional committees where \nshe was taunted by Members of Congress. We all know that story. And I \nbring that up to simply make the point that these are innocent \nchildren, the most innocent of society, unborn, but still children.\n  I remember engaging in a dialog with one of my colleagues earlier on \nthis issue--and it is a tough issue; there is no question about it--but \nthis person--and I will not mention the name; it is not necessary; the \nrecord speaks for itself--but this person indicated that they felt that \nthey looked at the issue and did not feel there was viability in these \nyoung months, therefore, there was not life. And I guess I would simply \nrespond by saying: I started at conception.\n  If there is anybody out here that did not, I would like to hear from \nthem. But I started at conception. I do not know of any way to get \nwhere I am now without starting at conception. Now, if there is a way, \nI would like somebody to tell me what it is.\n  The truth of the matter is, no matter how you define these terms--you \ncan say ``fetus,'' you can talk about ``viability,'' and ``medical \nprocedure'' and ``abortion,'' you can talk about all these words--but \nit boils down to children, innocent, unborn children.\n  And in the case of partial-birth abortion, I might make the point, as \nSenator Moynihan has done, that it is probably children, born children, \nand borders on infanticide. Senator Moynihan is a very respected \nindividual in this body, and one who does, by his own admission, call \nhimself pro-choice, and I believe, unless he has changed his mind--I do \nnot think he has--supports the ban on the partial-birth abortions.\n  So, Mr. President, I would just like to preface my remarks by, again, \nmaking the point that we are talking about real children here, children \nwho have no say, no opportunity to be heard.\n  And, again, I would just ask my colleagues to reflect, as we have \nthese next few votes on this issue, to think about that. They cannot \nvote against us. They cannot vote for us. They cannot criticize us. \nThey cannot say anything. And they will never get the opportunity. And \nyou know, I cannot help but wonder. I think about this a lot. I do not \nknow. There are some 20 million-plus children that have been aborted, \nnot partial-birth abortions.\n  But let us just take partial-birth abortions. We know there have been \nthousands who have been aborted through this process. So let us focus \non that group.\n  How many children in that group may have grown up to be a President \nof the United States, a Senator, a doctor who maybe finds the cure for \ncancer, a teacher who perhaps saves a dozen, 15, 20 children during the \ncourse of his or her teaching career, saving these children from going \nastray, a clergyman who saves a soul? How many people, how many people \nwould there be in that group? We will never know. We will never know.\n\n  That is the issue, Mr. President. I hope as we continue this debate--\nand I know it is tough--I hope we can separate all of this rhetoric and \nall of the harsh words and the hard feelings, just put that aside and \nthink about what we are really thinking about here, an unborn child--\nyes, created at conception, at some point along the way, denied the \naccess to life, to being born. That is the issue.\n  Now, I know how hard my colleague from South Dakota has struggled \nwith this issue because we have talked, and I respect him very much and \nhe knows that. I had to think long and hard and very carefully about \nwhat the Senator proposed to do. He is my friend. I cannot understand \nthe amendment. I want to make some points about this amendment that I \nthink perhaps the Senator has not thought about--I do not know if that \nis true or not. There have been a lot of things said out here, and it \nis probably unlikely there is something he has not thought about.\n  I believe this amendment, as presented by the Senator from South \nDakota, represents, even though it is not intended, an extremist \nposition on this issue, on the abortion issue, because the Daschle \nsubstitute amendment explicitly permits abortions even in the 7th, 8th, \nand 9th month of pregnancy, so long as the abortion claims, \n``Continuation of the pregnancy would risk grievous injury to the \nmother.''\n  Think about that, Mr. President. Babies in the 7th, 8th, and 9th \nmonth have already developed to the point where they can survive. In \nfact, babies can survive even earlier than that, survive in the sense \nthat I mean survive outside the body of their mother. They can survive \nindependently.\n  Then let me ask this question, for anybody who may be undecided, and \nthere probably are not many, if any. If you have a child that can live \nindependently of the mother, why abort it? Why not deliver the baby \nalive? By definition, abortion means taking the life of a child. Why do \nwe have to do that? Why do we have to take the life of a child?\n  I am not a doctor and I do not pretend to be, but I do listen to \nmedical advice and medical comments. I listen to the point of view of a \ngroup called the Physicians Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth, an organization \nof 600 doctors nationwide who have been providing an enormous public \nservice by working to get the true medical facts out about partial-\nbirth abortions. In a statement they issued on May 12 of this year, \nthey said, as follows: ``If maternal conditions require the emptying of \nthe womb''--and these are not my words; these are the words of \nphysicians--``If maternal conditions require the emptying of the womb \npostviability, the standard would be to induce labor and deliver the \nchild. By definition, the postviable child delivered early is simply a \npremature baby. Senator Daschle's legislation never addresses the \nreason why it may ever be necessary to kill a premature baby, including \nthose in the process of being born,'' as is the case in partial-birth \nabortion, ``in order to preserve the health of the woman.''\n  The Catholic Diocese in Sioux Falls, SD, Reverend Carlson, made a \nstatement saying, ``The substitute bill allows abortions, including \npartial-birth abortion procedures in the last weeks of pregnancy, \nbecause in the case of certain serious illnesses a physician may have \nto `terminate' a pregnancy after viability to save the mother, yet in \nsuch cases a physician can simply deliver the child. Nothing in the \nmedical literature indicates a need to abort or kill a child in such \ncases.''\n  See, that is the issue here. By definition, you are saying \n``viability.'' Viability by definition means that the child can survive \noutside the body of the mother. Then why kill the child?\n  Mr. President, let me repeat the latter part of the statement that \nwas made by these physicians. The Daschle legislation never addresses \nthe reason why it may ever be necessary to kill a premature baby, \nincluding those in the process of being born in order to preserve the \nhealth of a woman. It does not address that. That is the flaw, the main \nflaw, as I see it, in the amendment, as well-intended as it is.\n\n[[Page S4556]]\n\n  I remember having a debate with one of my colleagues a couple of \nyears ago when I was out managing this same bill. It was very \ninteresting, and I ask Members to reflect for a moment. We all know in \nthe partial-birth-abortion procedure, first of all, it does not always \nhappen in the 7th, 8th, and 9th month. Sometimes it happens earlier \nthan that, and, of course, the Daschle amendment would not protect \nthose children.\n  I remember in the debate having a very interesting dialog with one of \nmy colleagues in which I pointed out that in order to ensure the \nopportunity to take a child's life through partial-birth abortion, you \nhave to turn the child in the womb and deliver the child breach, or \nfeet first, and in the process, stop the child's head from coming into \nthe world. Now, my colleague that I was debating said, ``That is fine. \nThat child is not born yet because the head is still in the birth \ncanal.'' I said, ``OK, I do not agree, but fine. Let me turn it \naround. What happens if the child comes into the birth canal head first \nand only 10 percent of the body comes into the world, for example, just \nthe head?'' And the answer was, ``That is life, that is life.''\n\n  So now what we have done is define a certain part of the baby's body \nas being life and another part of the baby's body as not. There is no \nlogic here. There is absolutely no logic here. I am not trying to \nsensationalize this. These are facts. You turn the child around because \nif the baby is born head first, you cannot use the needle and destroy \nthe child. So 10 percent in the world, head first, it is a child \naccording to the critics; 90 percent in the world, feet first, it is \nnot. Does anybody really believe that? Does anybody really in here, \nnever mind up here, in here, does anybody believe that? If you believe \nthat, you ought to vote against the partial-birth abortion ban; you \nought to vote for Daschle if you really believe that.\n  Why is it necessary, ever, to kill a premature baby? That question \nhas not been answered yet in this debate, including those in the \nprocess of being born in order to preserve the health of a woman. How \ndoes it help the health of a woman to restrain a child from coming the \nrest of the way through the birth canal--that is what a partial-birth \nabortion is, restraining a child from coming into the world so you can \nkill it. That is the purpose.\n  As Senator Moynihan said, it is bordering on infanticide. Indeed, it \nprobably is infanticide. This is not abortion. It is probably misnamed. \nIt is killing a child in the hands of the doctor. Nothing impersonal \nabout this one. There are many impersonal ways to commit abortions. We \nall know, we have all heard about them. Nothing impersonal about this \none. You are holding the child in your hand when you do it.\n  With all the problems we have in the world and in our country--you \nname it, race problems, poverty problems, problems of protecting \nourselves and national defense, anything, all the problems we have, \ninfrastructure--do we really want to spend time doing this to our \nchildren? Do we?\n  In May 1997, in the Washington Post, and again on the Senate floor, \nSenator Daschle said every effort should be made to save the baby. I \nknow he means that. But with all due respect, the amendment is trying \nto have it both ways. It does not focus on the baby, it focuses only on \nthe mother.\n  How can you say you are for saving a baby when your amendment \nexplicitly authorizes an abortionist to kill a baby? The assertion is \nthat the Daschle amendment somehow requires doctors to try to save the \nlife of the viable baby that they are aborting. Yet, the language to \nthis effect, which includes a wide open health exception, appears on \npage 4 of his amendment in the nonbinding findings. I say you put this \nin the nonbinding findings, but you do not have it in the main language \nof the amendment.\n  This language would not have the force of law. It would, if it were \nin the main bill, in the amendment, but it is not. It is in the \nlanguage. So if we want to truly write some protection for the viable \nfetus into this proposed criminal statute, we could put it in the \nstatute itself, not in the nonbinding finding section and certainly not \nwith a wide open health exception.\n  We all know and respect and support, I believe, the principle of \nself-defense. If the health of the mother is a problem and the life of \na mother is a threat, try to save both. What is wrong with that? Why do \nwe say we are going to say something is viable and then kill it? If you \nsay it is viable, if you make the admission, which this amendment does, \nthat this child is viable any time after the sixth month, if it is \nviable, then when you abort it you are killing it because you said it \nis viable by your own definition.\n\n  This is really a pretty logical debate here, Mr. President. Sometimes \nwe get off on other tangents. After viability, doctors can terminate \nthe pregnancy without killing the baby. It happens all the time. They \ncan do this by delivering the baby by cesarean section or directly \nthrough the birth canal. Sometimes they must do that in order to \nprotect both the mother and the child. That is not an abortion. It is a \npremature delivery. It happens every day in America. There is no reason \nwhy it cannot happen here.\n  Dr. Harlan Giles, a professor of high-risk obstetrics and \nperinatology at the Medical College of Pennsylvania, performs abortions \nby a variety of procedures before viability, and in sworn testimony \nbefore the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio in \nNovember 1995, Giles had this to say about abortions after viability. \nThis is a doctor who performs them:\n\n       [After 23 weeks] I do not think there are any maternal \n     conditions that I am aware of that mandate ending the \n     pregnancy that also require that the fetus be dead or that \n     the fetal life be terminated. In my experience for 20 years, \n     one can deliver these fetuses either vaginally, or by \n     cesarean section for that matter, depending on the choice of \n     the parents with informed consent . . . But there's no reason \n     these fetuses cannot be delivered intact vaginally after . . \n     . labor, if you will, and be at least assessed at birth and \n     given the benefit of the doubt.\n\n  That is the doctor's own words who perform abortions.\n  Mr. President, the question that I ask to the proponents of the \nDaschle amendment is the same one I have been asking over and over and \nover again, year after year, on this issue, with those who support \npartial-birth abortion on demand. And it is on demand and we know that. \nI repeat the question in a moment.\n  We know that because of the statements made by an individual who \nperformed them, and I stood on the Senate floor a year and a half ago \nor 2 years ago, and took flak from every direction, from my opponents \non the other side of this issue, accusing me of making that up, that it \nwas only a few hundred abortions a year this way, done in this manner, \nwhen, in fact, we now know it is thousands, and that they admitted they \nlied. But to the individual's credit, he told the truth now. But the \nquestion is, why is it necessary to kill a partially born baby? Will \nsomebody come out on the floor of the Senate and answer me that \nquestion, when you have a baby in the birth canal, 90 percent born but \nfor the head, somebody give me one reason why we have to take that \nbaby's life in order to protect the mother's life or health when you \nliterally restrain that child from coming the rest of the way out of \nthe birth canal.\n\n  Nobody has been able to tell me that. Why not just deliver the baby \nalive. And I will tell you why, Mr. President, because you have a \nproblem when the baby is alive, don't you? And you know what another \nreal dark secret is here? And they do not talk about it much. Do you \nknow what happens oftentimes? You get the baby in the position, the \nabortionist is prepared with the needle, the head is still in the birth \ncanal and, whoops, the baby comes out. You look around and you do it.\n  That is not abortion, Mr. President. Do not let anybody tell you it \nis. That is killing an innocent child, a live, born child, and it \nhappens. That is the dirty dark secret, one of them, about partial-\nbirth abortion. Why not just deliver the baby. Her body, her shoulders \nare already out of the womb and in the birth canal. Why not just \ncomplete the delivery? Why kill her before completing the delivery?\n  Unfortunately, that is what this amendment will allow. Why propose an \namendment that explicitly authorizes abortions to kill viable children? \nThat is not saving lives. And I know what the intent here is by the \nSenator, but we are killing viable children in seventh, eighth, and \nninth months of pregnancy. We are protecting the mother\n\n[[Page S4557]]\n\nbut why not protect the child, too? It is not necessarily one against \nthe other.\n  In his May 2, Washington Post opinion article Senator Daschle cited \ncertain conditions for termination of pregnancy such as hypertension, \nkidney failure, coma, breast cancer, et cetera. However, what was not \nsaid was why the Senator and the supporters of the amendment believe \nthat it would ever be necessary to kill that viable baby because of the \nmedical conditions that he cites.\n  Think about it. Why would you have to kill the child for any of those \nreasons: hypertension, kidney failure, coma, breast cancer. Remove the \nchild alive. It can be done. It is done every day.\n  Once again, let me point out that physicians, not Senators, \nphysicians, across America address these complicated pregnancies day in \nand day out and they do it by delivering babies. This amendment, even \nthough it is not intended to do that, would give abortionists the legal \nauthority now under law to perform abortions in these cases whenever \nthey want to without any consideration to the law.\n  Before the Senate closes debate, and I know we are getting close--for \nthe benefit of my colleagues, I am shortly going to yield--before the \nSenate closes debate on this amendment, I hope that we will have an \nanswer to the question that I have posed. I would really sincerely like \nto hear the answer as to why this child must be terminated, killed, \ntaken dead from the womb of the mother when, in fact, you could perhaps \nsave both?\n  I have one final point. Those proponents of this amendment assert \nthat it would provide some limitation on postviability abortions \nbecause it includes what they say is a narrow health exception. The \nSenator's amendment says that postviability abortions are permitted if \nan abortionist certifies that a woman is threatened with some ``risk,'' \nno matter how remote, of a ``grievous injury'' to her health. \nUnfortunately, the ``grievous injury'' exception does not protect one \nsingle viable unborn child, not one. Not one. And if the intent of the \nauthors of the amendment and the proponents of the amendment is to save \nlives, babies' lives, the amendment does not do it. If it is the intent \nto save mothers' lives at all costs, I think it does do that and I \nsupport that part of it, saving mothers' lives, but it does not do \nanything to save a baby's life.\n\n  Dr. Warren Hern, a leading third-trimester abortionist, who has \nwritten a major treatise on the subject of the ``grievous injury'' \nexception, in an interview published on May 14, yesterday, in the \nBergen County Record, said:\n\n       I will certify that any pregnancy is a threat to a woman's \n     life and could cause grievous injury to her physical health.\n\n  In other words, no matter what the grievous injury it is the health \nexception that the abortionist will use. That is not what the Senator \nfrom South Dakota intends but is the result of this amendment. Any \ndoctor who wishes to do it can do it.\n  So we have a leading third-trimester abortionist who basically says, \nhey, pass that thing. Then I can kill all kinds of babies and not have \nto worry about a thing. Just pass it. He is an expert, and he is saying \nthis will allow him to perform an abortion on a viable child any time \nhe wants to. So you could not ask for more compelling testimony, in my \nopinion, that this amendment, the Daschle amendment is a prescription \nfor abortion on demand even after viability, and it is the main reason \nthat it should be defeated and that we should pass the ban on partial-\nbirth abortions as prescribed by the bill introduced and supported by \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote \noccur on or in relation to the Daschle amendment at 7 p.m. and that the \ntime between now and then be equally divided between Senators Santorum \nand Daschle.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I have a \nrequest for 45 minutes of time that I would be willing to lock in, but \nI think that would mean a slight difference in the amount of time \nallocated to both sides. So with the understanding that I could have 45 \nminutes, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Let me respond briefly to the distinguished Senator from \nNew Hampshire prior to the time I yield time to the Senator from \nLouisiana. He asked the question, why not allow a child to live? And my \nanswer is that is exactly what we want to happen. On page 3 of the bill \nwe say:\n\n       Even when it is necessary to terminate a pregnancy to save \n     the life or health of the mother, every medically appropriate \n     measure should be taken to deliver a viable fetus.\n\n  Termination of a pregnancy does not necessarily mean abortion. We \nwant to provide the opportunity for that child to live. And on page 3 \nwe assert that.\n  On page 4:\n\n       Abortion of a viable fetus should be prohibited throughout \n     the United States unless the woman's life or health is \n     threatened, and even when it is necessary to terminate the \n     pregnancy every measure should be taken, consistent with the \n     goals of protecting the mother's life and health--\n\n  Which is the constitutional requirement--\n\n       to preserve the life and health of the fetus.\n\n  On page 3 and on page 4 of the bill we assert that as unequivocally \nas possible.\n  Now, he indicates that this is the findings. Well, the findings are \ndesigned to instruct the Court on how to interpret the law. That is \nwhat the findings do. There is no more appropriate place than in the \nfindings to tell the Court this is how we want you to interpret whether \nor not a doctor is in compliance with the law.\n\n  I would be more than ready to state that assertion on every page of \nthe bill if it would make my colleague from New Hampshire more \nconfident that the intent of our legislation is to do just as I have \nasserted. But this is the language in the bill. We want the child to \nlive.\n  Now, with regard to permitting abortions in the seventh, eighth, and \nninth month, I find it ironic that anybody supporting H.R. 1122 would \nuse that as a criticism of our amendment because that is exactly what \nthe partial-birth abortion ban does. It allows abortions. It allows \ndilation and evacuation. It allows induction. It allows hysterotomies. \nIt allows abortion. H.R. 1122 is banning only one procedure here. They \nare not banning abortion with their bill. We, by contrast, ban them \nall. So I hope that no one would cite that as a reason to oppose our \namendment.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair. I begin by thanking my distinguished \ncolleague from South Dakota, Senator Daschle, for his hard work and \nexcellent work. He has been working for months, talking with medical \ndoctors, advocates for children and families, and affected women to try \nto help us arrive at a balanced approach, that will resolve this very \ndifficult of issues.\n  To my distinguished colleague from New Hampshire, who just spoke, I \nsay that I am here today because I want to join with you in ending \nlate-term abortions. The young woman about whom the Senator spoke so \nbeautifully, would have a chance to live under our amendment because it \nwill ban all procedures except in the very rarest of circumstances. \nWith due respect, under the bill that the gentleman is supporting, that \nwonderful child could still be aborted, because the mother would still \nbe free to choose another procedure.\n  My colleagues on the opposite side continue to make reference to a \nDr. Hern. I want to say again that when this bill passes, he will lose \nhis license. He will not be able to practice.\n  My distinguished colleague from New Hampshire has made the excellent \nargument for the minority of people in this country who believe that \nabortion should be banned at all times, in every circumstance, in every \ncase, but the majority of Americans in my State of Louisiana and in \nthis country want reason. They want to abide by the Constitution which \ngives the woman the right to terminate a pregnancy in the early stages, \nbut they want most certainly to ban and prohibit late-term abortions. \nThat is what this amendment does.\n\n[[Page S4558]]\n\n  We have heard all day about one or two doctors that might say they \nwould never perform a late-term abortion. That is their right under the \nlaw. But the American Medical Association, 37,000 strong, has said, and \nI want to quote again for the debate:\n\n       In recognition of the constitutional principles regarding \n     the right to an abortion articulated by the Supreme Court and \n     in keeping with the science and values of medicine, the AMA \n     recommends that abortions not be performed in the third \n     trimester except in the cases of serious fetal abnormalities, \n     incompatible with life. Although third-trimester abortions \n     can be performed to preserve the life or health of the \n     mother, they are in fact generally not necessary for those \n     purposes except in the most extraordinary circumstances.\n\n  That is what my distinguished colleague from South Dakota along with \nthe two Senators from Maine, have tried to craft, a very narrow health \nexception with tight restrictive language.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Snowe-Daschle amendment \nto Senate Bill 6.\n  Mr. President, the distinguished Supreme Court Justice Felix \nFrankfurter wrote:\n\n       Great concepts like liberty were purposely left to gather \n     meaning from experience. For they relate to the whole domain \n     of social and economic fact, and the statesmen who founded \n     this nation knew too well that only a stagnant society \n     remains unchanged.\n\n  We are not a stagnant society and changes in reality and our \nperceptions have brought us here today. It has been nearly 25 years \nsince the Supreme Court decided Roe versus Wade. The Roe decision \nencompassed a lot of the experience and wisdom that our nation had \nacquired regarding personal liberty. In 1973, it affirmed the new \nunderstanding that Americans had developed about the role of women in \nsociety and the role of government in our personal lives.\n  However, 25 years after Roe, our country has had more time to reflect \non its experiences. Social and economic factors have altered the world \nin which we live. Breakthroughs in medicine have changed our \nunderstanding of human development and have allowed us to deliver \npremature babies at ages never before possible. We have reached the \nappropriate time to review our definition of liberty in the context of \na woman's right to end a pregnancy.\n  Those of us who support Roe versus Wade understand this was not a \ndecision which allowed for abortion on demand, but rather it was a \ndecision which balanced the rights of privacy and liberty on one hand--\nand State's authority to protect prenatal life on the other. In writing \nhis decision, Justice Blackmun clearly stated:\n\n       A state may properly assert important interests in \n     safeguarding health, in maintaining medical standards, and in \n     protecting potential life. At some point in the pregnancy, \n     these respective interests become sufficiently compelling to \n     sustain regulation of the factors that govern the abortion \n     decision.\n\n  One of the questions we face today is what is the approximate point \nat which prenatal life becomes sufficiently compelling and what are the \nappropriate regulations to the termination of pregnancy.\n  In reviewing both Roe and Casey, it is clear that the Court has given \nus one sure point on which to balance individual liberty and prenatal \nlife. That point is viability. Before a fetus is viable, the rights of \nprivacy and personal liberty found in the Constitution require us to \nprovide safe and accessible method to terminate a pregnancy. After \nviability, the State's interest in prenatal life should prevail. Our \nfirst woman on the Supreme Court, Sandra Day O'Connor, framed the \ndelicate balance our society has reached in the Casey decision when she \nstated:\n\n       While [Roe] has engendered disapproval, it has not been \n     unworkable. An entire generation has come of age, free to \n     assume Roe's concept of liberty in defining the capacity of \n     women to act in society, and to make reproductive decisions . \n     . . and no changes of fact have rendered viability more or \n     less appropriate as the point at which the balance of \n     interests tips.\n\n  Viability presents a bright line--a legal standard--that we can use \nto govern our decisions about regulating abortion.\n  Mr. Santorum's bill violates the viability standard and does nothing \nto end late-term abortion. On the other hand, Mr. President, Senator \nDaschle and Senator Snowe's alternative method would indeed make clear \nthat all late-term abortions by any procedure are prohibited. I thank \nthem for their leadership in bringing this alternative to the floor. \nThey have both displayed a willingness to reach across the aisle and \nprovide us with a bill which reflects the consensus that the American \npeople have already reached.\n  A 1996 Gallup Poll indicated that 64 percent of Americans support a \nwoman's right to have an abortion during the first 3 months of \npregnancy. This is a strong indication of a national consensus that \nabortion should be an available, legal, and safe option for women in \nthe early stages of pregnancy.\n  When you ask those same people how they feel about abortions in the \nthird trimester, the consensus flips the other way. Only 13 percent of \nthose surveyed supported abortion, 82 percent would prohibit it. Those \n82 percent of the people who oppose abortion in the third trimester are \nnot just opposed to a particular procedure; they are opposed to all \nprocedures. They believe that once a fetus reaches the point where it \ncould sustain meaningful life, they are opposed to abortion.\n  That is precisely what is accomplished by the Snowe-Daschle \namendment. We make clear, with appropriate penalties, that late-term \nabortion by any procedure will not be allowed, except in the rare and \nextraordinary circumstances when a woman's life or physical health is \ngravely threatened. Yes, a doctor would certify the viability and \nhealth risk to the mother, but who else would be qualified to make such \nmedical decisions? The local judge or city council?\n\n  Without this amendment, S. 6 would accomplish very little. The \npartial birth abortion ban concentrates on banning only one procedure, \nit does nothing to stop late-term abortions. What possible good is \naccomplished by bringing this very heart-wrenching subject before the \nCongress and the American people, only to pass a bill that does not \naffect abortions? As written, this bill is simply an opportunity for \npeople to congratulate themselves on having done something important, \nwhen in fact they have accomplished nothing. If we pass S. 6 unamended, \nit would be like outlawing armed robbery with an Uzi, but allowing \ncriminals to hold you up with a handgun. The American people will see \nthrough this facade and be even more disillusioned with this \ninstitution and its members.\n  Maybe the most significant advantage of the Snowe-Daschle amendment \nis that it can be passed, signed by the President and will meet \nconstitutional scrutiny. The bipartisan approach of this amendment is \nour best chance to address post-viability abortions, while also \npreserving our understanding of liberty in the 25 years since Roe \nversus Wade.\n  I would be remiss if I did not add that when the government acts to \nrestrict abortions, as is its right in certain circumstances, it has an \nincreased obligation to make the choice to support life more \ncompelling. We cannot on one hand require women to forego the option of \nabortion and at the same time undermine all the programs that support a \nwoman as she struggles to bring a child into the world. Since the Roe \ndecision, a number of steps have been taken to make abortion safer and \nmore accessible. We need to act affirmatively to make abortion more \nrare and less necessary. We can do that by vigorously supporting \npregnancy prevention strategies that would minimize or preclude the \nneed for abortion.\n  A key component of this effort must be adoption. This Nation needs to \nmake adoption more affordable through tax credits and Congress should \nwork to implement State and Federal laws and regulations that encourage \nfamilies to build through adoption.\n  We must continue to reform our foster-care system to make permanent \nplacement for children a reality and a loving family for every child an \nachievable goal.\n  We should invest more in prenatal care and health insurance for our \nchildren so that young mothers deliver healthy babies, taxpayers save \nmoney, and children have a real chance at a decent life.\n  We ought to concentrate on effective pregnancy prevention efforts in \nour schools. Our children need to understand the serious ramifications \nof sex outside of marriage so that we are faced with fewer unplanned \npregnancies. We have had years of experience with sex education \nprograms in\n\n[[Page S4559]]\n\nthis country. We should, state-by-state, replicate those successful \nprograms nationwide.\n  It is important that we in the Congress and in this Chamber \nunderstand that a commitment to life means more than just talk. In a \ntime of tight budgets, the true test of peoples' priorities is where \nthey are willing to commit scarce resources. We can all agree that we \nshould make every effort to preserve human life. However, it is a \nhollow promise to bring life into the world and then abandon it when it \narrives. If life is a priority for this Congress, we should reflect it \nby making our policies and pocketbooks available to nurture young \nlives.\n  Mr. President, the debate surrounding late-term abortions has been a \nvaluable opportunity for the American people to take stock of what we \nmean by liberty. I believe that the Snowe-Daschle amendment is an \nexcellent reflection of what our experience has taught us since Roe. It \nrestores a balance to our national dialogue about abortion and premises \nit upon the clear standard of viability. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  Thank you very much.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, I would like to compliment my \ncolleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, in addition Senator \nSmith of New Hampshire, who brought this issue to the floor of the \nSenate last Congress and maybe educated everybody in the Congress and \nmaybe in the country about this very gruesome procedure which, \nunfortunately, happens all too many times. The President said it \ndoesn't happen very many times. But now we found out it happens \nthousands of times. In one clinic in New Jersey it happened 1,500 \ntimes.\n  So I compliment my colleagues from Pennsylvania and from New \nHampshire, and also Senator DeWine and Senator Frist, who spoke very \neloquently about this issue. It is not an easy issue. It is not one \nthat I think a lot of us look forward to debating.\n  Mr. President, I speak on this issue on occasion. Again, it is not \none that I particularly like to speak on. Maybe I did it for a lot of \nreasons. Somebody said, ``Why does Congress always have debates on \nabortion?''\n  I think part of the premise goes back to the fact that the Supreme \nCourt legalized abortion. They legalized abortion in the Roe versus \nWade decision. Everybody acknowledges that. I have a problem any time \nthe Supreme Court legalizes or legislates in any area. I look at the \nConstitution. Article I says Congress shall pass all laws--Congress \nbeing comprised of the House and the Senate, elected bodies.\n  People have a choice. If they don't like the laws we pass, they can \nchange Members of Congress.\n  In 1973, the Supreme Court legalized abortion. They overturned laws \nin almost every State that had some restrictions dealing with abortion \nand basically decided by trimesters what was legal and what was not \nlegal. I object to that process.\n  Colleagues who really think that we should legalize abortion or \npreempt all State laws, or some State laws, should introduce such \nlegislation, and, if they have the votes, they can codify Roe versus \nWade, or they can change it. But they should do it through legislative \nprocess not do it through a nonelected judicial process of the Supreme \nCourt.\n  So I object to the Supreme Court legislating. I think that they have \ndone a pretty crummy job in their legislating.\n  Our colleagues are aware of the fact--because we had this debate last \nyear and now we have this debate before us today--that there is a \nprocedure called partial-birth abortions where the baby is almost \ntotally delivered, yet its head is held inside, scissors are inserted \ninto the baby's head, and the brains are sucked out. Then the dead baby \nis delivered.\n  We are trying to ban that procedure. Senator Daschle has an \namendment. I looked at the headline. It says: ``Daschle Abortion Ban \nSpares `Viable' fetuses.''\n  If I believed that headline, I would support the amendment. But I \nlook at the amendment. What does it do? In the first place, it is a \nsubstitute. If it was in addition to the language before us, maybe we \nwould have something to talk about. But it isn't. It is a substitute. \nIt strikes the language.\n  If you look at the language of the amendment, it strikes all of the \nprohibition on banning partial-birth abortions and says let's insert \nthe following.\n  So it totally eliminates the bill that has already passed the House \nof Representatives by an over two-thirds vote, and a bill that we voted \non last year when we had overwhelming support. We didn't have two-\nthirds. It strikes that, and says let's start over.\n  We just saw the language today. It was just inserted today. We have \nnot had enough time to totally review it. But I have read it. I have \nsome problems with it.\n  If the real purpose of it is to spare viable fetuses, I am going to \nsupport it. But I don't think that is the case. I want to go into the \nlanguage and maybe point out what I think is deficient in the language \nand then tell my colleagues and my friend, the minority leader, that I \nwill be happy to work with him. Maybe we can come up with language that \nwould accomplish the objective of sparing viable fetuses. I will work \nwith any Senator to try to do that. I will be happy to. But I don't \nthink the language that we have in front of us today does that. I will \ngo into a statement to illustrate it.\n\n  Mr. President, the amendment that we have before us includes the \nhealth exception that is said to be ``stricter than the Republican \nmeasure,'' what it says on the headline. But, in reality, the exception \ncontained in this amendment is no exception at all, but a large hole, a \nlarge protection for late-term abortions.\n  The proposal is--as George Will accurately characterized it in his \nApril 24, 1997, column--``a law that is impossible to violate.''\n  That's one reason this amendment has been termed by critics ``the \nabortionist empowerment clause.''\n  While this amendment claims to protect viable unborn children from \nabortion, a closer look shows that it provides no protection at all.\n  The amendment would make it ``unlawful for a physician to abort a \nviable fetus. * * *''\n  Who determines whether a particular fetus is viable?\n  There is no definition of ``viability'' in federal law. Nor does this \namendment define ``viability.''\n  The prevailing standard of viability in federal law was set by the \nSupreme Court in Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri versus \nDanforth. In that case, the Court held:\n\n  The determination of whether a particular fetus is viable is, and \nmust be, a matter for the judgment of the responsible attending \nphysician.\n\n  In other words, the person who performs the abortion decides whether \nthe baby he or she is aborting is viable. This is the standard that \ngoverns the Daschle amendment.\n  The abortionist decides whether the baby is viable. The abortionist \ndoesn't even have to certify his decision. Unless he voluntarily says \nto a U.S. attorney that the baby he aborted is viable, no civil penalty \ncan be brought against him.\n  Let's say that an abortionist tells a U.S. attorney that he has \naborted a viable baby. In order to avoid civil action, the abortionist \nneed only ``certif[y] that the continuation of the pregnancy would \nthreaten the mother's life or risk grievous injury to her physical \nhealth.''\n  To whom does the physician certify? Does he file a certification with \nthe Justice Department? With HHS? With the state licensing authority? \nWith a notation in the patient's file? The amendment doesn't say.\n  When does the physician certify? Before he performs the abortion? \nAfter he performs the abortion? After he is called into question for \nhaving performed the abortion? The amendment doesn't say.\n  It merely says that by ``certifying,'' he avoids civil action for \nhaving aborted a viable infant, and it leaves it to the Secretary of \nHHS to develop regulations defining what the certification entails.\n  A physician who aborts a viable child must certify that ``the \ncontinuation of the pregnancy would threaten the mother's life or risk \ngrievous injury to her physical health.''\n\n[[Page S4560]]\n\n  While the amendment defines ``grievous injury,'' it does not define \n``risk.''\n  The risk of continuing a particular pregnancy may be small, but that \nis irrelevant under the Daschle amendment.\n  The risk of carrying a pregnancy to term may carry less risk in a \nparticular case than the risk of terminating the pregnancy, but that \ndoesn't matter under the Daschle amendment.\n  The only relevant question is ``does the abortionist believe that the \n``continuation of the pregnancy'' poses any risk of ``grievous \ninjury?'' Since every pregnancy poses at least some risk, an \nabortionist can justify any abortion under the Daschle amendment.\n  The Daschle amendment states that a physician must certify--under \npenalty of perjury--``that, in his or her best medical judgment, the \nabortion involved was medically necessary.''\n  Unfortunately, as with other provisions of this amendment, the \nperjury penalty is very difficult, if not impossible, to enforce.\n  The abortionist only has to sign a paper that asserts that ``in his \nor her best medical judgment,'' the abortionist believes that ``the \ncontinuation of the pregnancy would . . . . risk grievous injury to her \nphysical health.''\n\n  The certification is based not on objective medical facts but on the \nabortionist's subjective judgment.\n  If the certification by an abortionist was challenged in an action \nfor perjury, the question before the court would not be about medical \nfacts but on whether the physician believed that he had exercised his \nbest medical judgment. Impossible, impossible to bring a conviction.\n\n  I think that every abortionist would certify he had exercised his \nbest judgment when he aborted a baby, whether viable or no. For \nexample, Dr. Warren Hern, who performs third-trimester abortions in \nColorado, said of this amendment: ``I will certify that any pregnancy \nis a threat to a woman's life and could cause grievous injury to her \nphysical health.'' So long as Dr. Hern says he used his best medical \njudgment in making these certifications, he could not be prosecuted for \nperjury under this amendment. So this amendment, in my opinion, would \nbe ineffective, totally ineffective in protecting viable unborn \ninfants.\n  Mr. President, I ask the sponsor if I can have an additional 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 2 additional \nminutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we have to ask the question Senator Smith \nasked us: Why kill a viable baby? That is another aspect of this \namendment that troubles me a lot. The amendment allows for the \ndestruction of viable unborn children.\n  A group of physicians headed by my colleague from Oklahoma, Dr. Tom \nCoburn, and the Physicians' Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth, states that it \nis ``never medically necessary, in order to protect a woman's life, \nhealth or future fertility, to deliberately kill an unborn child in the \nsecond or third trimester of pregnancy.'' He is an obstetrician. He has \ndelivered hundreds, thousands of babies. I have not. But he has made \nthat statement. Dr. Koop has made that statement. I happen to give them \ncredit. I think the child would like for us to give them that credit.\n  So the Daschle amendment would be ineffective in protecting viable \nunborn infants.\n  Mr. President, a big difference between the Daschle amendment and the \namendment by the Senator from California that was defeated earlier \ntoday is that the Daschle amendment does not include a ``mental \nhealth'' exception.\n  The distinguished Democratic leader, in speaking with the press \nearlier this week, said that his amendment does not contain ``a simple \nmental health loophole.''\n  But he then added, ``It's my understanding based upon an \nextraordinary number of conversations and consultations that mental \nproblems ultimately, in situations involving pregnancy and abortion, \nevidence themselves physically.''\n  Thus, while the amendment does not contain a simple mental health \nloophole, the author of the amendment believes that mental illness can \nhave physical manifestations that would possibly justify late-term \nabortions.\n  The Daschle amendment would not eliminate the vast majority of all \npartial-birth abortions.\n  Ron Fitzsimmons, the executive director of the National Coalition for \nAbortion Providers admitted he lied about the frequency and necessity \nof partial-birth procedures.\n  He told the American Medical News that the vast majority of partial-\nbirth abortion are performed in the 20-plus week range on healthy \nfetuses and healthy mothers. ``The abortion rights folks know it, the \nanti-abortion folks know it, and so, probably, does everyone else.''\n  Yet this amendment would permit most partial-birth abortions since \nthey are usually performed during the 2d trimester of pregnancy.\n  The amendment prohibits abortions of viable infants unless there is a \nrisk of grievous injury to the mother's life or health.\n  Abortionists who violate this law are subject to fines and suspension \nof their medical licenses. No provision is made for any review of the \nphysician's certification or the medical basis for it.\n  Unfortunately, since the abortionist determines the health of the \nmother and the viability of the baby, no punishment would result no \nmatter what the evidence.\n  In order for someone to be prosecuted under this amendment they would \nhave to voluntarily report that the child they had aborted was viable \nand that the abortion they had performed was not medically necessary.\n  Does anyone imagine a physician would ever volunteer for such a \npenalty?\n  It would be as if we allowed each driver to decide whether or not he \nor she was speeding. The only people who would receive speeding tickets \nwould be those who voluntarily reported to the police that they had \nexceeded the speed limit.\n  Self-enforcement is no enforcement. And that is what the Daschle \namendment would put in place.\n  I just conclude with the statement, Mr. President, this is a vitally \nimportant issue. I do not question the motives of my colleagues on the \nother side of this issue. I hope maybe we can come up with some type of \na ban on aborting viable fetuses. But I believe this language in the \nfirst paragraph of the bill, language that says it shall be unlawful \nfor a physician to abort a viable fetus when the physician makes that \ndetermination, unless the physician certifies--and he can do that, \nbasically, by saying it is his best medical judgment that the \ncontinuation of the pregnancy would threaten the mother's life or risk \ngrievous injury to her physical health--any risk, every pregnancy has \nrisk--I am afraid that this language is so riddled with loopholes that \nit would provide no protection whatsoever, that it would have no real \nimpact whatsoever.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Daschle amendment, to \nsupport the ban on partial-birth abortions, and then let us see if we \ncannot work together in the intervening couple of months, through the \nproper committees, have hearings, have suggestions from experts, health \nexperts, and maybe we can refine language comparable to this to provide \nreal protection for unborn children.\n  I ask unanimous consent an article by Charles Krauthammer, ``Saving \nthe Mother? Nonsense,'' which is dated March 14, and also a letter from \nthe Physicians' Ad Hoc Coalition for the Truth, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 14, 1997]\n\n                      Saving the Mother? Nonsense\n\n                        (By Charles Krauthammer)\n\n       Even by Washington standards, the debate on partial-birth \n     abortion has been remarkably dishonest.\n       First, there were the phony facts spun by opponents of the \n     ban on partial-birth abortion. For months, they had been \n     claiming that this grotesque procedure occurs (1) very \n     rarely, perhaps only 500 times a year in the United States, \n     (2) only in cases of severe fetal abnormality, and (3) to \n     save the life or the health of the mother.\n       These claims are false. The deception received enormous \n     attention when Ron Fitzsimmons, an abortion-rights advocate, \n     admitted that he had ``lied through his teeth'' in making up \n     facts about the number of and rationale for partial-birth \n     abortions.\n       The number of cases is many times higher--in the multiple \n     thousands. And the majority of cases involve healthy mothers\n\n[[Page S4561]]\n\n     aborting perfectly healthy babies. As a doctor at a New \n     Jersey clinic that performs (by its own doctors' estimate) at \n     least 1,500 partial-birth abortions a year told the Bergen \n     record: ``Most are for elective, not medical, reasons: people \n     who didn't realize, or didn't care, how far along they \n     were.''\n       Yet when confronted with these falsehoods, pro-abortion \n     advocates are aggressively unapologetic. Numbers are a \n     ``tactic to distract Congress,'' charges Vicki Saporta, \n     executive director of the National Abortion federation. ``The \n     numbers don't matter.'' Well, sure, now that hers have been \n     exposed as false and the new ones are inconvenient to her \n     case.\n       Then, the defenders of partial-birth abortion--led by \n     President Clinton--repaired to their fall-back position: the \n     heart-tugging claim that they are merely protecting a small \n     number of women who, in Clintons' words, would be \n     ``eviscerated'' and their bodies ``ripped . . . to shreds and \n     you could never have another baby'' if they did not have this \n     procedure.\n       At his nationally televised press conference last Friday, \n     Clinton explained why this is so: ``These women, among other \n     things, cannot preserve the ability to have further children \n     unless the enormity--the enormous size--of the baby's head is \n     reduced before being extracted from their bodies.''\n       Dr. Clinton is presumably talking about hydrocephalus, a \n     condition in which an excess of fluid on the baby's brain \n     creates an enlarged skull that presumably would damage the \n     mother's cervix and birth canal if delivered normally.\n       Clinton seems to think that unless you pull the baby out \n     feet first leaving in just the head, jam a sharp scissors \n     into the baby's skull to crack it open, suck out the brains, \n     collapse the skull and deliver what is left--this is \n     partial-birth abortion--you cannot preserve the future \n     fertility of the mother.\n       This is utter nonsense. Clinton is either seriously \n     misinformed or stunningly cynical. A cursory talk with \n     obstetricians reveals that there are two routine procedures \n     for delivering a hydrocephalic infant that involve none of \n     this barbarity. One is simply to tap the excess (cerebral \n     spinal) fluid (draw it out by means of a small tube while the \n     baby is still in utero) to decompress (reduce) the skull to \n     more normal size and deliver the baby alive. The other \n     alternative is Caesarean section.\n       Clinton repeatedly insists that these women, including five \n     he paraded at his ceremony vetoing the partial-birth abortion \n     ban last year, had ``no choice'' but partial-birth abortion. \n     Why, even the American College of Obstetricians and \n     Gynecologists, which supports Clinton's veto, concedes that \n     there are ``no circumstances under which this procedure would \n     be the only option to save the life of the mother and \n     preserve the health of the woman''--flatly contradicting \n     Clinton.\n       Moreover, not only is the partial-birth procedure not the \n     only option. It may be a riskier option than conventional \n     methods of delivery.\n       It is not hard to understand that inserting a sharp \n     scissors to penetrate the baby's brain and collapse her skull \n     risks tearing the mother's uterus or cervix with either the \n     instrument or bone fragments from the skull. Few laymen, \n     however, are aware that partial-birth abortion is preceded by \n     two days of inserting up to 25 dilators at one time into the \n     mother's cervix to stretch it open. That in itself could very \n     much compromise the cervix, leaving it permanently \n     incompetent, unable to retain a baby in future pregnancies. \n     In fact, one of the five women at Clinton's veto ceremony had \n     five miscarriages after her partial-birth abortion.\n       Why do any partial-birth abortions, then? ``The only \n     possible advantage of partial-birth abortion, if you can call \n     it that,'' Dr. Curtis Cook, a specialist in high-risk \n     obstetrics, observes mordantly, ``is that it guarantees a \n     dead baby at time of delivery.''\n       Hyperbole? Dr. Martin Haskell, the country's leading \n     partial-birth abortion practitioner, was asked (by American \n     Medical News) why he didn't just dilate the woman's uterus a \n     little bit more and allow a live baby to come out. Answer: \n     ``The point is here you're attempting to do an abortion. . . \n     not to see how do I manipulate the situation so that I get a \n     live birth instead.''\n       We mustn't have that.\n                                  ____\n\n\n      Daschle Abortion Proposal Doesn't Pass Muster With Medical \n                             Professionals\n\n       Alexandria, VA.--The more than 600 doctors nationwide who \n     make up the Physicians' Ad-hoc Coalition for Truth (PHACT) \n     maintain that Sen. Daschle's recently announced legislative \n     proposal regarding ``post-viability'' abortion will leave the \n     practice of partial-birth abortion virtually untouched, and \n     fails to address why late-term abortions are ever medically \n     necessary.\n       PHACT agrees with Sen. Daschle that it is appropriate for \n     Congress and the American people to consider when and under \n     what circumstances the government may restrict access to any \n     abortion procedure. Having the medical facts straight is a \n     necessary part of this process.\n       It is never medically necessary, in order to protect a \n     woman's life, health or future fertility, to deliberately \n     kill an unborn child in the second or third trimester of \n     pregnancy, and certainly not by mostly delivering the child \n     before putting him or her to death. While it may become \n     necessary, in the second or third trimester, to terminate a \n     pregnancy because of maternal illness, abortion is never \n     required. What is required is separation of the child from \n     the mother, not the death of the child.\n       Senator Daschle would limit his legislation to third \n     trimester or ``post-viability'' abortion. This would leave \n     virtually untouched the practice of partial-birth abortions, \n     since the vast majority of partial-birth abortions take place \n     in the second trimester, several thousand times a year on \n     mostly healthy mothers with healthy children.\n       If maternal conditions require the emptying of the womb \n     post-viability, the standard would be to induce labor and \n     deliver the child. By definition, the post-viable child \n     delivered early is simply a premature baby. Senator Daschle's \n     legislation never addresses the reason why it may ever be \n     necessary to kill a premature baby, including those in the \n     process of being born, in order to preserve the health of a \n     woman.\n       At 21 weeks and after, abortion is far riskier to a woman's \n     health than childbirth. According to the Alan Guttmacher \n     Institute (affiliated with Planned Parenthood) the risk of \n     maternal death at 21 weeks and after is actually twice as \n     great for abortion as for childbirth. If the chief concern is \n     to minimize health risks to women who show indications for a \n     termination of pregnancy in the second or third trimester, \n     then as the statistics show, termination by induction of \n     labor and delivery is clearly preferable to abortion.\n       Nowhere does Senator Daschle every explain the need to kill \n     a post-viable child in order to protect a woman's health. \n     Medically, he cannot, for there is no medical reason, either \n     in the second or third trimester of a pregnancy, to prefer \n     killing the child to delivering the child.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield the Senator from Connecticut 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today the Senate once again returns to \nthe morally perplexing question of abortion, a question which has not \nonly divided the Senate and divided America, but I would say that it \ndivides individual Senators and individual Americans. I must say, as I \nhave listened to this debate today, I am proud to be serving here, as \ndifficult as the question before us is, because of the thoughtful, \nsincere and civil way in which this debate has proceeded.\n  We have in front of us two responses to the problem of abortion: one \nthat would prevent use of a specific medical procedure, intact dilation \nand extraction, which is used for abortion, and, a second that would \nprevent almost all abortions from being performed after viability. I \nbelieve that the second alternative, Senator Daschle's, more broadly \nand appropriately responds to the mix, the difficult mix, of moral and \nlegal concerns at issue here, and, therefore, I will vote for Senator \nDaschle's amendment.\n  In Pope John Paul II's Encyclical Letter on the Value and \nInviolability of Human Life, His Holiness writes that, ``The direct and \nvoluntary killing of an innocent human being is always gravely \nimmoral.'' I respect, with humility, the depth of the Pope's statement \nand the moral conviction of millions of Americans of all religions who \nrecoil from abortion and believe that any abortion at any stage of \npregnancy is a taking of life. The Pope's statement, and others by \nthose who oppose all abortions regardless of how early in pregnancy are \npowerful expressions driven by deep convictions and high moral \nprinciples. I respect and value the sincerity and depth with which \nthose convictions are held and expressed--certainly so by the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, who is the sponsor of the underlying proposal. In \nfact, I personally share many of those convictions.\n  But the question for me today--and each of us must decide this \npersonally--remains the same as it was when I was called upon to pass \npublic judgment during my time as a State senator in Connecticut in the \n1970's after the Roe v. Wade decision was passed down: What is the \nappropriate place for my personal convictions about abortion, my \npersonal conviction that potential life begins at conception, and, \ntherefore, my personal conviction that all abortions are unacceptable? \nHow do I relate that appropriately to my role as a lawmaker?\n  I struggled with this over and over again in the 1970's in the \nConnecticut State Senate. How does one, appropriately, as a lawmaker, \nbalance the right of the mother to life, the right of the potential \nlife to protection by the State, and the right of privacy of the woman, \nthe right of the woman to choose, which is recognized by our courts?\n\n[[Page S4562]]\n\n  These competing interests that exist throughout the pregnancy are \nwhat we in the Senate are called upon, each in our own way, to try to \nbalance and resolve. Our role here, it seems to me, calls on us to \nresolve that competition in a way that respects and reflects our own \nconvictions, our constituents', and finally our Constitution.\n  I was shaken, as I would imagine many Members of the Senate were, as \nthe debate over this partial-birth-abortion ban went on, and it sent me \nback to the conflicts that I faced in the 1970's in the Connecticut \nState Senate because the partial-birth abortion, the intact dilation \nand extraction, is horrific; it is horrifying. Yet, the more I focused \non it, the more I got concerned about the number of these abortions \nthat are being performed--and as small as that number is--the number is \nunacceptable--the more I had to face my own personal conclusion that \nany abortion is unacceptable. Any abortion is horrific.\n\n  It brought me back to the question of what the role of a body of \nlawmakers is in reconciling the interests of the mother, the interests \nof the fetus, potential life, and in respecting the judgments of our \ncourts. In the end, again today, I resolve that conflict with a sense \nof humility about my authority as one lawmaker, about my capacity, \nabout my judgment in the face of the uniquely private personal judgment \nand right to choose that a woman has up until the point of viability of \nthe fetus, when that right is equalized by the right of the fetus to be \nprotected by the State.\n  The amendment in front of us, offered by the Senate Democratic \nleader, does, in fact, ban all abortions of viable fetuses, regardless \nof procedure, except where the physician certifies that continuation of \nthe pregnancy threatens the mother's life or risks grievous injury to \nher physical health.\n  It was my honor to work with Senator Daschle, Senator Snowe and many \nothers in preparing this amendment. My personal conclusion, and here I \nspeak as a lawyer, as a former attorney general, is that this amendment \nwill, in fact, ban almost all postviability abortions that might \notherwise be performed in this country.\n  The definition of the exception, particularly with the addition of \nthe words ``physical health'' tied to ``grievous injury,'' is very \nnarrow. Senator Daschle's amendment sets up a procedure where the \nDepartment of HHS, Health and Human Services will, in fact, promulgate \nregulations about certification, will require the doctor to file a \ncertification with the Department.\n  What doctor, and there are only a few who perform postviability \nabortions, would certify inappropriately under the narrow definition in \nthis law and risk losing his or her medical license? Tying the State's \nprotection of the fetus to viability extends protection in a way that I \ndo not believe we have before, to those fetuses that need all the \nassistance, postviability, that today's technology and medical science \nmake available. It is a remarkable advance, if you will, for the pro-\nlife movement in that regard.\n  As I read Senator Daschle's amendment, and I have spoken with him \nabout this and he has spoken to this, it would prevent abortions of any \nfetus that could survive outside the mother's body with or without life \nsupport. I asked him this question, ``What about a fetus postviability \nthat a test reveals is disabled or may have Down's syndrome, but yet \ncan survive with life support outside the mother's body?'' Senator \nDaschle said quite clearly to me that is a viable fetus which could not \nbe terminated under his amendment.\n  The term ``viability'' allows the protection of the law to move as \nmedical science advances. When Roe v. Wade was handed down, fetuses \nunder 28 or 29 weeks of gestation were not considered viable. \nSimilarly, for many developmental and genetic defects that led to the \ndeath of a fetus or the inability to survive without the mother's \nbodily support, medicine has found ways to save those babies. Medical \nscience has advanced, and with it, younger and sicker fetuses now are \nable to live. The term ``viability'' will allow the Government's \nresponsibility to protect potential human life to move with medical \nscience.\n  I want to pick up on something that the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. \nNickles, said a short while ago. The truth is Senator Daschle, Senator \nSnowe and the others who sponsored this amendment have reached common \nground. I think he has established a common ground here that both pro-\nchoice and pro-life Members of this Senate can support. I understand \nthat many will not support it today because it is a substitute for the \nunderlying legislation proposed by Senator Santorum, and the Daschle \namendment clearly does not protect fetuses previability.\n  But if this amendment fails today, I believe that it is such an \nadvance and provides such an opportunity for common ground that I hope \nMembers of the Senate, regardless of their position on it, on this \ndifficult and perplexing issue, will come together and help us on \nanother day, if not today, pass this legislation.\n  I thank the Senate Democratic leader and his staff and all who have \nworked conscientiously on both sides of the aisle for the thoughtful, \nconstructive approach which will save a lot of fetal life, if it is \npassed--if and when it is passed.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield to the Senator from Tennessee, the only \nphysician in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. I rise in opposition to the Daschle amendment. I also want \nto congratulate him because I know he worked very, very, very hard with \npeople around the country to fashion an amendment that would, as \nnarrowly as possible, define ``health,'' which I really think this \ndebate is balanced on, ``health of the mother.''\n  He has done his very, very best. But what he has tried is impossible. \nIt has not been done in this bill. And I think it probably cannot be \ndone, defining the ``health of the mother'' in such a narrow, narrow \nfashion.\n  His proposal is a substitution bill and, thus, that means he would \nput aside what the underlying bill does, and that is to ban the \npartial-birth abortion procedure, a procedure that we all know is \nbrutal, that is vicious, that is a fringe procedure and that destroys \nlife. We have heard very little today that this is not a vicious, \nbrutal procedure.\n  Thus, I think the Daschle amendment attempts to shift the focus away \nfrom the underlying bill that is banning this vicious procedure, and I \nthink it is not going to be accepted tonight. I urge opposition and \nvoting against it because I think, even if you look at the substance of \nit, it does nothing--it does nothing--to decrease the number of \nabortions in this country. And I will come back and cite why.\n  No. 2, his bill, an amendment which is a substitution amendment, \nwould still allow this vicious procedure to be performed if certain \ncriteria are met.\n  This procedure should be outlawed. It should be banned. Again, we \nhave seen the graphs and we have seen the charts.\n  Let me refer to the paper ``Dilation and Extraction for Late Second \nTrimester Abortion'' by Martin Haskell, presented at the National \nAbortion Federation, Risk Management Seminar, September 13, 1992. This \ndescribes the procedure in medical terms, not with charts, not with \ncartoons and not with all the other figures. Basically, we have gone \nthrough it before. This is a medical paper. But it says:\n\n       When the instrument appears on the sonogram screen, the \n     surgeon is able to open and close its jaws to firmly and \n     reliably grasp a lower extremity. The surgeon then applies \n     firm traction to the instrument causing an inversion of the \n     fetus . . . and pulls the extremity into the vagina. . . .\n       With a lower extremity in the vagina, the surgeon uses his \n     fingers to deliver the opposite lower extremity, then the \n     torso, the shoulders and the upper extremities. . . .\n       At this point, the right-handed surgeon slides the fingers \n     of the left hand along the back of the fetus and ``hooks'' \n     the shoulders of the fetus with the index and ring fingers \n     (palm down). . . .\n       While maintaining this tension, lifting the cervix and \n     applying traction to the shoulders with the fingers of the \n     left hand, the surgeon takes a pair of blunt, curved \n     Metzenbaum scissors in the right hand. He carefully advances \n     the tip, curved down, along the spine and under his middle \n     finger until he feels it contact the base of the skull under \n     the tip of his middle finger.\n\n[[Page S4563]]\n\n       Reassessing the proper placement of the closed scissors tip \n     and safe elevation of the cervix, the surgeon then forces the \n     scissors into the base of the skull or into the foramen \n     magnum. Having safely entered the skull, he spreads the \n     scissors to enlarge the opening.\n       The surgeon removes the scissors and introduces a suction \n     catheter into this hole and evacuates the skull contents. \n     With the catheter still in place, he applies traction to the \n     fetus, removing it completely from the patient.\n\n  This is not somebody's description of the procedure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the \nRecord in its entirety.\n  There being no objection, the material ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, is as follows:\n\n       Dilation and Extraction for Late Second Trimester Abortion\n\n                       (By Martin Haskell, M.D.)\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n       The surgical method described in this paper differs from \n     classic D in that it does not rely upon dismemberment to \n     remove the fetus. Nor are inductions or infusions used to \n     expel the intact fetus.\n       Rather, the surgeon grasps and removes a nearly intact \n     fetus through an adequately dilated cervix. The author has \n     coined the term Dilation and Extraction or D to distinguish \n     it from dismemberment-type D's.\n       This procedure can be performed in a properly equipped \n     physician's office under local anesthesia. It can be used \n     successfully in patients 20-26 weeks in pregnancy.\n       The author has performed over 700 of these procedures with \n     a low rate of complications.\n       D evolved as an alternative to induction or instillation \n     methods for second trimester abortion in the mid 1970's. This \n     happened in part because of lack of hospital facilities \n     allowing second trimester abortions in some geographic areas, \n     in part because surgeons needed a ``right now'' solution to \n     complete suction abortions inadvertently started in the \n     second trimester and in part to provide a means of early \n     second trimester abortion to avoid necessary delays for \n     instillation methods.\\1\\ The North Carolina Conference in \n     1978 established D as the preferred method for early second \n     trimester abortions in the U.S.2,}3,}4\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     * Footnotes to appear at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Classic D is accomplished by dismembering the fetus \n     inside the uterus with instruments and removing the pieces \n     through an adequately dilated cervix.\\5\\\n       However, most surgeons find dismemberment at twenty weeks \n     and beyond to be difficult due to the toughness of fetal \n     tissues at this stage of development. Consequently, most late \n     second trimester abortions are performed by an induction \n     method.6,}7,}8\n       Two techniques of late second trimester D's have been \n     described at previous NAF meetings. The first relies on \n     sterile urea intra-amniotic infusion to cause fetal demise \n     and lysis (or softening) of fetal tissues prior to \n     surgery.\\9\\\n       The second technique is to rupture the membranes 24 hours \n     prior to surgery and cut the umbilical cord. Fetal death and \n     ensuing autolysis soften the tissues. There are attendant \n     risks of infection with this method.\n       In summary, approaches to late second trimester D's rely \n     upon some means to induce early fetal demise to soften the \n     fetal tissues making dismemberment easier.\n\n\n                           patient selection\n\n       The author routinely performs this procedure on all \n     patients 20 through 24 weeks LMP with certain exceptions. The \n     author performs the procedure on selected patients 25 through \n     26 weeks LMP.\n       The author refers for induction patients falling into the \n     following categories: Previous C-section over 22 weeks; Obese \n     patients (more than 20 pounds over large frame ideal weight); \n     Twin pregnancy over 21 weeks; and Patients 26 weeks and over.\n\n\n             DESCRIPTION OF DILATION AND EXTRACTION METHOD\n\n       Dilation and extraction takes place over three days. In a \n     nutshell, D can be described as follows: Dilation; More \n     Dilation; Real-time ultrasound visualization; Version (as \n     needed); Intact extraction; Fetal skull decompression; \n     Removal; Clean-up; and Recovery.\n\n                            Day 1--Dilation\n\n       The patient is evaluated with an ultrasound, hemoglobin and \n     Rh. Hadlock scales are used to interpret all ultrasound \n     measurements.\n       In the operating room, the cervix is prepped, anesthetized \n     and dilated to 9-11 mm. Five, six or seven large Dilapan \n     hydroscopic dilators are placed in the cervix. The patient \n     goes home or to a motel overnight.\n\n                          Day 2--More Dilation\n\n       The patient returns to the operating room where the \n     previous day's Dilapan are removed. The cervix is scrubbed \n     and anesthetized. Between 15 and 25 Dilapan are placed in the \n     cervical canal. The patient returns home or to a motel \n     overnight.\n\n                          Day 3--The operation\n\n       The patient returns to the operating room where the \n     previous day's Dilapan are removed. The surgical assistant \n     administers 10 DU Pitocin intramuscularly. The cervix is \n     scrubbed, anesthesized and grasped with a tenaculum. The \n     membranes are ruptured, if they are not already.\n       The surgical assistant places an ultrasound probe on the \n     patient's abdomen and scans the fetus, locating the lower \n     extremities. This scan provides the surgeon information about \n     the orientation of the fetus and approximate location of the \n     lower extremities. The tranducer is then held in position \n     over the lower extremities.\n       The surgeon introduces a large grasping forcep, such as a \n     Bierer or Hern, through the vaginal and cervical canals into \n     the corpus of the uterus. Based upon his knowledge of fetal \n     orientation, he moves the tip of the instrument carefully \n     towards the fetal lower extremities. When the instrument \n     appears on the sonogram screen, the surgeon is able to open \n     and close its jaws to firmly and reliably grasp a lower \n     extremity. The surgeon then applies firm traction to the \n     instrument causing a version of the fetus (if necessary) and \n     pulls the extremity into the vagina.\n       By observing the movement of the lower extremity and \n     version of the fetus on the ultrasound screen, the surgeon is \n     assured that his instrument has not inappropriately grasped a \n     maternal structure.\n       With a lower extremity in the vagina, the surgeon uses his \n     fingers to deliver the opposite lower extremity, then the \n     torso, the shoulders and the upper extremities.\n       The skull lodges at the internal cervical os. Usually there \n     is not enough dilation for it to pass through (The fetus is \n     oriented dorsum or spine up.)\n       At this point, the right-handed surgeon slides the fingers \n     of the left hand along the back of the fetus and ``hooks'' \n     the shoulders of the fetus with the index and ring fingers \n     (palm down). Next he slides the tip of the middle finger \n     along the spine towards the skull while applying traction to \n     the shoulders and lower extremities. (The middle finger lifts \n     and pushes the anterior cervical lip out of the way.)\n       While maintaining this tension, lifting the cervix and \n     applying traction to the shoulders with the fingers of the \n     left hand, the surgeon takes a pair of blunt curved \n     Metzenbaum scissors in the right hand. He carefully advances \n     the tip, curved down, along the spine and under his middle \n     finger until he feels it contact the base of the skull \n     under the tip of his middle finger.\n       Reassessing proper placement of the closed scissors tip and \n     safe elevation of the cervix, the surgeon then forces the \n     scissors into the base of the skull or into the foramen \n     magnum. Having safely entered the skull, he spreads the \n     scissors to enlarge the opening.\n       The surgeon removes the scissors and introduces a suction \n     catheter into this hole and evacuates the skull contents. \n     With the catheter still in place, he applies traction to the \n     fetus, removing it completely from the patient.\n       The surgeon finally removes the placenta with forceps and \n     scrapes the uterine walls with a large Evans and a 14 mm \n     suction curette. The procedure ends.\n\n                                Recovery\n\n       Patients are observed a minimum of 2 hours following \n     surgery. A pad check and vital signs are performed every 30 \n     minutes. Patients with minimal bleeding after 30 minutes are \n     encouraged to walk about the building or outside between \n     checks.\n       Intravenous fluids, pitocin and antibiotics are available \n     for the exceptional times they are needed.\n\n\n                               anesthesia\n\n       Lidocaine 1% with epinephrine administered intra-cervically \n     is the standard anesthesia. Nitrous-oxide/oxygen analgesia is \n     administered nasally as an adjunct. For the Dilapan insert \n     and Dilapan change, 12cc's is used in 3 equidistant locations \n     around the cervix. For the surgery, 24cc's is used at 6 \n     equidistant spots.\n       Carbocaine 1% is substituted for lidocaine for patients who \n     expressed lidocaine sensitivity.\n\n\n                              MEDICATIONS\n\n       All patients not allergic to tetracycline analogues receive \n     doxycycline 200 mgm by mouth daily for 3 days beginning Day \n     1.\n       Patients with any history of gonorrhea, chlamydia or pelvic \n     inflammatory disease receive additional doxycycline, 100mgm \n     by mouth twice daily for six additional days.\n       Patients allergic to tetracyclines are not given \n     proplylactic antibiotics.\n       Ergotrate 0.2 mgm by mouth four times daily for three days \n     is dispensed to each patient.\n       Pitocin 10 IU intramuscularly is administered upon removal \n     of the Dilapan on Day 3.\n       Rhogam intramuscularly is provided to all Rh negative \n     patients on Day 3.\n       Ibuprofen orally is provided liberally at a rate of 100 mgm \n     per hour from Day 1 onward.\n       Patients with severe cramps with Dilapan dilation are \n     provided Phenergan 25 mgm suppositories rectally every 4 \n     hours as needed.\n       Rare patients require Synbalogos DC in order to sleep \n     during Dilapan dilation.\n       Patients with a hemoglobin less than 10 g/dl prior to \n     surgery receive packed red blood cell transfusions.\n\n\n                               FOLLOW-UP\n\n       All patients are given a 24 hour physician's number to call \n     in case of a problem or concern.\n       At least three attempts to contact each patient by phone \n     one week after surgery are made by the office staff.\n       All patients are asked to return for check-up three weeks \n     following their surgery.\n\n\n                            THIRD TRIMESTER\n\n       The author is aware of one other surgeon who uses a \n     conceptually similar technique.\n\n[[Page S4564]]\n\n     He adds additional changes of Dilapan and/or lamineria in the \n     48 hour dilation period.

It \n     can be used in the third trimester.\n       Among its advantages are that it is a quick, surgical \n     outpatient method that can be performed on a scheduled basis \n     under local anesthesia.\n       Among its disadvantages are that it requires a high degree \n     of surgical skill and may not be appropriate for a few \n     patients.\n\n\n                               FOOTNOTES\n\n     \\1\\ Cates, W.

Mr. President, the American Medical Association has \nafforded to me a statement, because a number of people on both sides \nhave mentioned the board of trustees report. The Senator from Louisiana \njust quoted it. Let me say that the trustee report that people have \nbeen referring to has not been approved, has not been approved by the \nAmerican Medical Association.\n  It is OK for people to cite it, I would think, but it does not become \nAMA policy until it is approved by the house of delegates. And it has \nnot yet been approved. It has not been sent to the house of delegates \nyet.\n  No. 2, it has been suggested that the AMA supports one side or the \nother. It was suggested earlier that the AMA is for the Daschle \namendment. I quote the AMA in a press release released about 30 minutes \nago. ``The report,''--meaning the board of trustees report--``does not \ndirectly address any pending legislation regarding `partial-birth \nabortion.' The AMA does not support any legislative proposals at this \ntime.'' So I think we need to make that very clear.\n  So the substitution bill--amendment really--addresses a whole \ndifferent issue, not the procedure that we are here to ban, this \nvicious procedure.\n  But let us look at the piece of legislation that the Democratic \nleader has introduced. This is a real problem, a real fundamental \nproblem. I do say this as a physician, as somebody who spent 4 years in \nmedical school, somebody who is board trained. I have my boards in \ngeneral surgery. We are talking about surgical procedures. I spent \nabout 14 years in trauma centers. When we talk about trauma, we talk \nabout the heart and pulmonary hypertension and we talk about other \nrelated diseases.\n  So I want to comment, with that as my background. And I have \ndelivered babies. I am not an obstetrician, but I do want people to \nknow I know a little bit about the medical literature. I want to \ncomment on my view as a U.S. Senator, but also as a physician.\n  Basically, this bill says that: It shall be unlawful for a physician \nknowingly to perform an abortion after the fetus has become viable \nunless the physician certifies that the continuation of the pregnancy \nwould threaten the mother's life--I think most people agree with \neverything so far--or risk grievous injury to her physical health. That \nis the problem. ``Grievous injury'' is not a medical term. It is not \neven accepted as a medical term. It is not in the medical dictionary. \nIt is a term that was crafted, I think, by the Democratic leader to try \nto allay people's feelings.\n  It defines ``grievous injury'' as ``a severely debilitating \ndisease.'' Well, again that sounds pretty good, but I can tell you what \nis a severely debilitating disease to one physician is not going to be \nthe same to another. To me, in heart disease, a severely debilitating \ndisease is when a patient is going to die in 3 months.\n  To other physicians, a severely debilitating disease would be maybe \nsome heart attack. To me, that is not severely debilitating. But \nanother physician thinks a heart attack is severely debilitating. Why? \nBecause I am a heart transplant surgeon. The people I see are all, \nwithout intervention, going to die shortly.\n  My point is that ``severely debilitating disease'' depends on who the \nperson is, who the physician is, what his or her experiences are.\n  Depression. Is that a severely debilitating disease?\n  Remember, 39 cases--Dr. McMahon in California has been cited earlier. \nThere were 39 cases in which he did the procedure called or referred to \nas a partial-birth abortion. In 39 cases he did it for depression--he \ndid it for depression. Is that a severely debilitating disease or is \nthat a physical disease?\n  I can tell you today that if somebody is depressed, it is going to \naffect them physically. It might affect their heart rate. It is going \nto affect their attitude. They may not have any appetite. You cannot \nseparate mental health from physical health, especially in a bill or \nstatute like this. I cannot do it as a physician. I will guarantee you, \nother physicians cannot.\n  So to throw physical health in there to attempt to narrow this down \ndoes not work. It just does not work. We know that physical health \ninfluences mental health and mental health influences physical health. \nWe do know that abortions are performed today for depression, for \nemotional reasons. And this bill has a huge loophole by this definition \nof ``grievous injury'' meaning ``severely debilitating disease.''\n  The only other definition of ``grievous injury'' in this amendment is \n``impairment specifically caused by the pregnancy.''\n  I have done five heart transplants on cardiomyopathy, \npostcardiomyopathy people who I have transplanted. Those five women are \nalive. Their children are alive. Did their pregnancy cause the \ncardiomyopathy or the bad pumping heart that I had to replace? I do not \nknow if it caused it or not, was associated with it. But it says for \n``grievous injury,'' ``a severely debilitating disease or impairment \nspecifically caused by the pregnancy.'' I have taken hearts out of \npeople that I guess one could say was caused by the pregnancy. They had \nnormal children. But I am a little hesitant to allow this loophole as \nwell.\n\n  It comes down to supporting, I think, this whole big loophole. We \nknow that in Doe versus Bolton in 1973, health is defined as ``all \nfactors: physical, emotional, psychological, mental, the women's age \nrelevant to the well-being of the patient.'' And that is the problem. \nThe health can be anything you want it to be. It can be emotional \nhealth, physical health, mental health. And it is really hard to \nseparate out the two. In fact, I would say it is impossible as a \nphysician to separate physical from mental health. It is impossible to \ndo.\n  I am a trauma surgeon. I am a heart surgeon, lung surgeon. I have my \nboards in cardiothoracic surgery and general surgery. But I am not an \nobstetrician. So I simply called my expert friends around and asked \nthem a very specific question. Point blank, is there ever a time when \nit is necessary to destroy a viable fetus? Remember, a viable fetus is \none that, at the point in time when you took it out of the womb, would \nlive, would grow up, have a job, have a family. Do you ever destroy \nthat opportunity? Is it ever necessary for the health of the mother, \nphysical or otherwise, ever necessary for emotional reasons or \nfinancial reasons or social reasons, which all can be called health, \nbut necessary for her physical health? And the answer--the answer--is a \nresounding ``No.''\n  So, while I support the Democratic leader's attempt to narrow the \ndefinition, it cannot be done. It is not done in this amendment, and I \nwould contend that it cannot be done.\n  So I asked Dr. Koop--in fact, I have a letter from Dr. Koop. I ask \nunanimous consent to have it printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S4565]]\n\n\n                                               The G. Everett Koop\n\n\n                                       Institute at Dartmouth,\n\n                                        Hanover, NH, May 13, 1997.\n     Hon. William Frist, MD,\n     U.S. Senate\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Bill: It is never necessary to destroy a viable fetus \n     in order to preserve the health of the mother. Although I \n     can't think of an example, if it were deemed beneficial for \n     the mother to be without the fetus, it could be delivered by \n     induction or C-section. Abortion is truly more traumatic than \n     either and exposes the mother to future problems with an \n     incompetent cervix, miscarriage, and infertility.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                         C. Everett Koop, MD, ScD.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. This letter from Dr. Koop is dated May 13, 1997. It is a \nletter to me. It says the following:\n\n       Dear Bill:\n       It is never necessary to destroy a viable fetus in order to \n     preserve the health of the mother. Although I can't think of \n     an example, if it were deemed beneficial for the mother to be \n     without the fetus, it could be delivered by induction or C \n     section. Abortion is truly more traumatic than either and \n     exposes the mother to future problems with an incompetent \n     cervix, miscarriage, and infertility.\n       Sincerely yours, C. Everett Koop.\n\n  The first sentence: ``It is never necessary to destroy a viable fetus \nin order to preserve the health of the mother.''\n  That is from Dr. Koop.\n  Steadman's Dictionary, the dictionary we use to define ``viable \nfetus'' denotes a fetus that is ``sufficiently developed to live \noutside the uterus.''\n  As a physician, I have tried to think of a circumstance where you can \njustify destroying that viable fetus. I cannot. Not only do we have \nalternatives, which we have--the delivery of a normal child.\n  So I asked a number of people, and my colleagues have said, no, they \ncannot think of a circumstance. So it seems to me to be pretty simple. \nWhen you have a viable fetus, once it is removed from the womb or \nleaves the womb, do you kill it? Do you allow it to progress to \ndelivery? Or do you allow the pregnancy to continue throughout the \nentire 9 months? Remember, it is a viable child.\n  So, Mr. President, I think we see, as we step back, that we have an \nunderlying bill that is brutal, vicious, that we need to ban--and that \nis the partial-birth abortion. The attempt today has been made to put \nthat bill aside, put in a bill which basically cannot define the health \nof the mother, that leaves a huge loophole that I contend might even \nincrease the number of abortions, because once you put in writing what \nthis loophole is, everybody is going to say that the health of the \nmother is debilitating, is grievous. And once that is certified by a \nphysician, all of a sudden you do the procedure. You can even do a \npartial-birth abortion, this vicious procedure, if you meet that \ncertification criteria laid out in the bill.\n  Mr. President, I feel strongly--feel strongly--that we must defeat \nthe Daschle proposal, that it does not address the underlying issue. I \nurge all of my colleagues to support and continue to support the ban on \nthe partial-birth abortion.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the Daschle amendment \nthat is before us. I want to take a minute to thank and applaud the \nDemocratic leader for the amount of work that he has put into this very \ndifficult and divisive issue, to try to find common ground that not \nonly Members of the Senate can agree on but people across this country \ncan find common sense in.\n  The majority of Americans do support Roe versus Wade and want to \nprotect a woman's right to choose previability. The Daschle amendment \ndoes that. The vast majority of Americans want to ensure that if there \nis a healthy baby in a healthy woman, that that baby is born in this \ncountry, and the Daschle amendment does that.\n\n  The vast majority of Americans also want to ensure that, if a woman's \nlife is at risk, she is not forced to keep a pregnancy and lose her \nlife herself or have a grievous injury as a result of that. The Daschle \nbill protects a woman's health.\n  I know we have heard a lot of arguments about this. We have listened \nto this debate all day long. For my colleagues, I want us to remember \nthis is not about choice or termination of unwanted pregnancy. This \ndebate right now is about women's health.\n  The Santorum bill that is pending before the Senate today does not \nand will not end late-term, postviability abortions. As the Democratic \nleader has pointed out, there are other alternatives out there. What \nthis bill does do is subject women to more dangerous procedures that \ncould render them infertile. What the Santorum bill will do is forever \neliminate the ability of a physician to take whatever steps are \nnecessary to protect the health of his or her patient. If the Santorum \nlegislation is enacted over the objections of the President, doctors \nwho try to provide the best care possible for their patients will be \narrested. I can tell my colleagues that I have more faith in a \nphysician to make these decisions than I do in the U.S. Senate.\n  This debate is about the health of a woman. This is about women \nacross this country and their ability to make sure that their health is \nprotected. That is what the Daschle amendment does.\n  I listened to my colleagues time and again on this floor, come to the \nfloor to say they are protecting women's health. We have had many \ndebates about women's health, with many champions of women's health on \nthis floor. I hope those Senators who so quickly rush to this floor to \nbe those champions will be here to vote for the Daschle amendment.\n  I ask all of my colleagues to think of your wife or your daughter or \nyour sister. If they are faced with a threatening, serious and grievous \nillness like cancer, would you not want their doctor to have every \noption available to save their life? We should remember this is about \nprotecting the women.\n  I urge my colleagues to seriously think about the grievous \nconsequences of the decision that this body is making today. I urge \nthem to support the thoughtful, commonsense solution that Senator \nDaschle and others have put forward and to reject the Santorum bill.\n  I thank the Senator from South Dakota and yield my time back to him.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. President, I withdraw that request.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Go ahead, I might be enlightened.\n  Mr. DODD. Hope springs eternal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from Texas, and my Democratic leader, \nSenator Daschle, for yielding some time.\n  Mr. President, I have some brief remarks, and I begin by commending \nthe Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, for offering what I think is a \nvery thoughtful and reasonable substitute proposal before the Senate. I \nwant to associate my remarks with those of my colleague from \nConnecticut, Senator Lieberman, who spoke a few moments ago about the \ndifficult decision that Congresses over the last quarter of a century \nhave grappled with since the adoption of Roe versus Wade by the Supreme \nCourt of the United States. It is never an easy issue.\n  Mr. President, let me also state at the outset that I have deep \nrespect for those who have differing views on this issue. By and large, \npeople in this body have held out a great deal of respect for those \nwith opposing views on this issue. It is not easy. There are those who \ntake the position except where the life of the mother is involved, \nabortion ought to be banned. I respect that view. I disagree with it. \nThere are those who take the view that abortion ought to be allowed \nunder any circumstance during pregnancy. I respect that view. I \ndisagree with it.\n\n  What Senator Daschle has offered here today, I think, is a reasonable \napproach to dealing with the issue of postviability abortion. It does \nso by addressing concerns that have been raised over the years, putting \naside the particular procedure which is the subject, of course, of the \nproposal being offered by our colleague from Pennsylvania. That is, it \ntries to limit and define the circumstances under which a fetus would \nbe aborted in the postviability period.\n  I say with all due respect, obviously with the exception of one of \nour colleagues, none of us are physicians. We\n\n[[Page S4566]]\n\nare Senators. We are public figures. I have a great deal of hesitancy, \nMr. President, to engage in debate and discussion on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate and to try to take on responsibilities where we lack \nexpertise.\n  What the proposal of our colleague from Pennsylvania suggests is that \nwe ban a particular procedure. I respect that but I do not feel in any \nway adequately prepared to be engaged in deciding whether or not \ncertain medical procedures are adequate or inadequate. I note that the \nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, on behalf of some 38,000 \nphysicians, has endorsed the Daschle proposal. I do not suggest that \neveryone has. I suspect there are those who disagree within the medical \nprofession about abortion, just as physicians disagree about other \nmedical issues, and just as there are those who are not physicians who \nhave disagreements.\n  But I believe that Senator Snowe and Senator Daschle, as I said, have \noffered a carefully crafted measure that will actually reduce the \nnumber of abortions performed in this country in the postviability \nperiod. I share the hope expressed by my colleague from Connecticut, \nSenator Lieberman, a few moments ago. It appears there will not be \nenough votes to support the Daschle amendment. I hope that is not the \ncase, but it may be such. I also hope that we will come to the point \nwhere this reasonable proposal becomes the position of the majority, if \nnot unanimously, of Members of this body. There are those who have \ndisagreed on this issue and will continue to do so, but if we can find \ncommon ground on this particular proposal where we would deal with the \nissue in a broader context than the issue of approaching this situation \nprocedure by procedure by procedure by procedure, sitting here as a \nbody trying to determine whether each and every one of those procedures \nis medically sound or proper or right.\n  The procedure of abortion itself, no matter how it is performed, can \nbe described, of course, in the most brutal terms, and all of us \nunderstand that. It does not mean, necessarily, that you are going to \nban all the procedures at any time except, of course, if you subscribe \nto the notion that abortion ought to be banned from conception.\n  So this proposal here, I think, does offer people of different views \non this issue a chance to come together to do something in a positive \nand constructive way and deal with this issue in a much more generic \nway than the effort to do so on a procedure-by-procedure basis--an \neffort, by the way, that would not stop a single abortion.\n  Mr. President, regarding the issue of the health of the mother, when \na woman and her fetus are both healthy and the fetus is able to survive \noutside the womb, we should not and do not permit abortion. Roe versus \nWade and subsequent decisions do not permit abortion in these \ncircumstances. The Senator from South Dakota's legislation does not \npermit abortion--by any method--in these circumstances. But, we also \nrecognize that a woman's life and physical health, when either is \nseriously threatened, should be protected.\n  Tragically, that is sometimes the case when a woman is in the later \nstages of pregnancy. Thankfully, such instances are rare. But they do \noccur. And when they do, abortion is sometimes the only way to save the \nwoman's life or preserve her health from grievous, lasting, physical \ndamage. I cannot turn my back on women who, along with their husbands, \ndesperately want the children with whom their are pregnant and then \ntragically find themselves with their physical health at grievous risk. \nSuch cases should be excepted under a ban on post-viability abortions, \nand that is what the Daschle proposal does.\n\n  Some argue, Mr. President, that there are never health circumstances \nthat would require partial-birth abortion. Others say that post-\nviability abortions are never necessary. Viable babies, they argue, can \njust be delivered. Mr. President, in those cases where the mother faces \na serious health risk and a viable baby can still be delivered alive, \nit is. But sadly, that is not always the case. As the American College \nof Obstetricians and Gynecologists has explained, after viability, \n``terminating a pregnancy is performed in some circumstances to save \nthe life or preserve the health of the mother.''\n  The Senator from South Dakota, along with the Senator from Maine, \nworked very, very hard to craft language here that would ban post-\nviability abortions except to deal with life endangerment or grievous, \nserious, physical conditions. That is an effort reached through serious \nconsultation. I think all of our colleagues here, as the Senator from \nTennessee indicated earlier, have deep appreciation for the time and \neffort that the Democratic leader has put into this effort. This was \nnot legislation or wording crafted by staff here trying to come up with \nsome words that would make all of us feel comfortable. Rather, the \nSenator from South Dakota went about the business of asking people all \nacross this country who are knowledgeable to define language which they \ncould support and could relate to. The fact that the College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists supports this language, I think, is a \ngood indication that they feel comfortable that this would do what the \nSenator wants to do. They do not necessarily agree with what he wants \nto do, but they believe they can function as medical professionals and \ndefine clearly what must be done.\n  The fact there is a certification process here is important. The \nsuggestion that this certification is somehow going to allow for \nwidespread violation of the ban is, I think, mistaken. As the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, my colleague, pointed out, a \ncertification process which would place in jeopardy the medical license \nof a physician has to be taken very, very seriously. I cannot believe \nthat the overwhelming majority of doctors in this country, when \nconsidering whether or not circumstances existed which would warrant \nhaving a postviability abortion, would not want to know very, very \ncarefully whether or not those circumstances were being met as dictated \nby the substitute of the Senator from South Dakota. I don't think any \ndoctor would violate this ban when doing so would mean loss of his or \nher very livelihood.\n  I believe this is a real solution. I believe it would make a \ndifference. I believe it would give this body an opportunity to really \nspeak in a far broader and meaningful way on this issue that I think \nthe Nation would applaud. There will be some who obviously disagree \nwith this because they think it does not go far enough, others who \nthink this goes way too far. But from my point of view, Mr. President, \nI think this strikes the reasonable balance and reflects where most \npeople are on this issue. None feel terribly comfortable with this. I \nknow of very few who enjoy any sense of comfort in discussing, or \nconsidering even, this issue.\n  So, today, we are given an opportunity to do something meaningful on \nthis, not on a procedure-by-procedure basis, but to deal fundamentally \nwith the issue of what and how a woman, her doctor and her family can \nact under the most serious and troublesome circumstances. I applaud the \nSenator from South Dakota for this effort. I support this effort. I \nhope my colleagues will do so, as well.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of H.R. \n1122, the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1997.\n  I understand that many people on both sides of this issue have very \nstrongly held beliefs. I respect those whose views differ from my own. \nAnd I condemn, as I know every other Member of this body does, the use \nof violence or any other illegal method to express any point of view on \nthis issue. Unfortunately, Mr. President, it ought to be noted the \nexpression of points of view on the issue of partial-birth abortion has \nbeen marked by half-truths and the knowing or reckless deception of the \nAmerican people.\n  Let us be very clear about what is at issue in this legislation. \nDespite the rhetoric of the bill's more extreme opponents, it is not \nabout the right of a woman who so chooses to have an abortion. H.R. \n1122 does not address whether all abortions after a certain week of \npregnancy should be banned, nor whether late-term abortions should be \npermitted only in certain circumstances. The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban \nAct of 1997 bans one, and only one, specific abortion procedure.\n  During a joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the \nHouse Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution on partial birth \nabortions,\n\n[[Page S4567]]\n\nheld March 11, 1997, Dr. Curtis Cook, a board-certified obstetrician/\ngynecologist and a subspecialist in maternal-fetal medicine, also known \nas high risk obstetrics, described the partial-birth abortion procedure \nas follows:\n\n       An instrument is then inserted into the uterus to grasp the \n     leg of her living baby and drag it down into the cervix and \n     into the vagina. The baby is then delivered up to the level \n     of the after-coming head, before grasping the baby's chest \n     and stabilizing the skull. The base of the skull is then \n     punctured with a sharp instrument, and a suction instrument \n     is then [placed into the hole] after it has been enlarged. \n     The brain contents are then sucked out, thereby killing the \n     fetus and collapsing the skull, allowing the infant to \n     thereby deliver.\n\n  Only this inhumane procedure, which our colleague from New York, \nSenator Moynihan, has described as ``close to infanticide,'' would be \nprohibited under this legislation.\n  The record in support of this legislation is long. At the March 1997 \nSenate-House joint hearing, we heard from 10 witnesses, including \nrepresentatives of the major organizations on both sides of this issue \nand a medical doctor who specializes in maternal-fetal medicine. In \nNovember 1995, the Judiciary Committee held a comprehensive, 6\\1/2\\-\nhour hearing on the subject of partial-birth abortions. The committee \nheard from a total of 12 witnesses presenting a variety of perspectives \non this issue, including a registered nurse who had worked as a \ntemporary nurse for 3 days in the clinic of a doctor who performs this \nprocedure and who testified as to her personal experience in observing \nthe procedure, from four ob-gyn doctors, from an anesthesiologist, from \nan ethicist, from three women who had personal experience either with \nhaving or declining to have a late-term abortion, and from two law \nprofessors who discussed constitutional and legal issues raised by this \nlegislation.\n  I find it difficult to comprehend how any reasonable person could \nexamine the mountain of evidence and continue to defend the partial-\nbirth abortion procedure. The indefensibility of this procedure is so \nevident, even to those who oppose this legislation, that, to date, few \nhave tried to defend partial-birth abortions. Instead, abortion \nadvocates embarked on what became a pattern of dissemblance and \ndeception intended to make this procedure appear less barbaric and thus \nmore palatable to the American people.\n\n  Even worse, opponents of the bill not only misrepresented the \npartial-birth abortion procedure--which is bad enough--but also spread \npotentially life-threatening misinformation concerning the effects of \nanesthesia on the fetus of a pregnant woman that could prove \ncatastrophic to women's health. By falsely claiming that anesthesia \nkills the fetus, opponents spread misinformation that could deter \npregnant women who might desperately need surgery from undergoing \nsurgery for fear that anesthesia could kill or brain-damage their \nunborn child.\n  In a June 23, 1995 submission to the House Judiciary Constitution \nSubcommittee, the late Dr. James McMahon, one of two doctors who had, \nat the time, admitted performing partial-birth abortions, wrote that \nanesthesia given to the mother during the procedure caused fetal \ndemise. In a so-called fact sheet circulated to Members of the House, \nDr. Mary Campbell, medical director of Planned Parenthood who testified \nat the Judiciary Committee hearing, wrote: ``The fetus dies of an \noverdose of anesthesia given to the mother intravenously . . . [The \nanesthesia] induces brain death in a fetus in a matter of minutes. \nFetal demise therefore occurs at the beginning of the procedure while \nthe fetus is still in the womb.'' This claim was picked up and reported \nby the media, as in a November 5, 1995 editorial in USA Today which \nstated, ``The fetus dies from an overdose of anesthesia given to its \nmother.''\n  When Senator Abraham referred to that statement during the medical \npanel at the 1995 Judiciary Committee hearing, the president of the \nAmerican Society of Anesthesiologists, Dr. Norig Ellison, flatly \nresponded, ``There is absolutely no basis in scientific fact for that \nstatement.'' The American Society of Anesthesiologists had sought the \nopportunity to set the record straight and, although they did not take \na position on the partial-birth abortion ban, to their credit they came \nforward out of concern for this harmful misinformation.\n  The March 1997 Senate-House hearing, appropriately entitled ``Partial \nBirth Abortion: The Truth,'' documented how the leaders of major pro-\nabortion groups repeated, over and over again, their false mantra that \npartial-birth abortions were extremely rare and performed only in \nexceptional circumstances. These charts contain a sampling of such \nstatements. On this first chart, we have statements from the National \nAbortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, including one by Kate \nMichaelman, dated December 8, 1995, in which she stated ``These are \nrare procedures, performed under only the most compelling circumstances \nof life endangerment. . . .'' The next chart contains similar \nstatements from Planned Parenthood of America, typified by a November \n1, 1995 Planned Parenthood press release which states ``The procedure . \n. . is extremely rare and done only in cases when the woman's life is \nin danger or in cases of extreme fetal abnormality.'' As recently as \nFebruary 25, 1997, the National Abortion Federation was spreading the \nfalse message, via its Internet web page, that ``[T]his particular \nprocedure is used only in about 500 cases per year, generally after 20 \nweeks of pregnancy, and most often where there is a severe fetal \nanomaly or maternal health problems detected late in pregnancy.''\n  For a time, the pro-abortion lobby's campaign of misinformation, \naided by a media which, as was demonstrated at the March 1997 hearing, \nall too often passively accepted false or inaccurate information from \npro-abortion sources and reported it, unexamined, as news, succeeded in \nmisleading the American people and their elected representatives about \nthe horrible reality of partial-birth abortion. How many times during \nthe Senate debate on this issue in the last Congress did we hear that \nsuch procedures were extremely rare and performed only to save the life \nof the mother in cases of severe fetal abnormalities?\n\n  One of the greatest strengths of our free society is that the truth \nusually manages to emerge into the light. And so it is with partial-\nbirth abortions.\n  The recent admissions by Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of the \nNational Coalition of Abortion Providers, as reported in the American \nMedical Association's weekly newspaper, American Medical News, dated \nMarch 3, 1997, have finally broken through the abortion extremists' \nsmokescreen of deception and confirmed what many already knew to be \ntrue, that Fitzsimmons, like others, had ``lied through my teeth'' when \nhe said the partial-birth abortion procedure was used rarely and only \non women whose lives were in danger or whose fetuses were damaged. As \nhe himself admits, ``I just went out there and spouted the party \nline.''\n  The terrible truth is that this grisly procedure is, according to \nFitzsimmons, used as many as three or four thousand times a year, with \nthe vast majority of such abortions performed in the 20-plus week range \non healthy fetuses and healthy mothers. As Fitzsimmons put it: ``You \nknow they're primarily done on healthy women and healthy fetuses and it \nmakes you feel like a dirty little abortionist with a dirty little \nsecret.''\n  The truth is that partial-birth abortions are being performed on an \nelective basis, where the abortion is being performed for non-health \nrelated reasons on healthy fetuses and healthy mothers, and even though \nthere are equally safe alternative abortion procedures available.\n  As Congress has considered this issue, and, in particular, as more \nand more members of the medical community have spoken out with respect \nto partial-birth abortion, it has become abundantly clear that there is \nno medical necessity or justification for the use of this inhumane \nprocedure to protect either the life or the health of the mother. \nIndeed, partial-birth abortion can be harmful to a woman's health.\n  The absence of any medical justification for partial-birth abortion \nis now well-documented in the legislative records of the 104th and \n105th Congresses. Several of my colleagues will discuss this particular \nissue in greater detail. Let me just quote former Surgeon General C. \nEverett Koop, who said in an interview in the American Medical News, \nthat ``in no way can I twist my mind to see that the late-term abortion \ndescribed--you know, partial\n\n[[Page S4568]]\n\nbirth and then destruction of the unborn child before the head is \nborn--is a medical necessity for the mother. It certainly can't be a \nnecessity for the baby. So I am opposed to . . . partial-birth \nabortions.''\n  In addition, a group of over 400 obstetrician-gynecologists and \nmaternal fetal specialists have unequivocally stated that ``partial-\nbirth abortion is never medically necessary to protect a mother's \nhealth or future fertility.'' In fact, the opposite is true: The \nprocedure ``can pose a significant threat to both her immediate health \nand future fertility.''\n  Let me address one important aspect of the debate over the Partial-\nBirth Abortion Ban Act; the argument raised by opponents of this bill \nthat it would violate the right of women to obtain abortions and is \ntherefore unconstitutional under Roe versus Wade.\n  The constitutional arguments raised in opposition to the Partial-\nBirth Abortion Ban Act reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of \nconstitutional principles and of the Supreme Court's abortion \njurisprudence. This is not only my view, but the view of numerous \nrespected constitutional scholars at our Nation's finest law schools, \nincluding Douglas Kmiec of the Notre Dame Law School, Michael McConnell \nof the University of Utah College of Law, and of other authorities \non constitutional law, such as William Barr, former Attorney General of \nthe United States. Congress can constitutionally, and should morally, \nprohibit the particular, inhumane abortion procedure addressed by this \nlegislation.\n\n  Banning partial-birth abortions does not violate the Supreme Court's \nholding in Roe versus Wade, or any of the Court's other abortion \ndecisions. I differ strongly with the Court's ruling in Roe, and \nbelieve the jurisprudence willed by the Court was fundamentally flawed. \nNevertheless, I recognize that Roe is the law, and that we should \nendeavor to craft legislation that is consistent with its progeny.\n  While the Court in Roe did hold that the word ``person,'' as used in \nthe 14th amendment, does not include the ``unborn,'' it has never \naddressed the constitutional status of those who are in the process of \n``being born,'' and there is no controlling legal authority on this \nprecise issue. Indeed, the Supreme Court specifically noted in its \ndecision that the plaintiffs in Roe did not challenge the \nconstitutionality of the Texas statute which prohibited killing of a \nchild during the birth process.\n  The child involved in a partial-birth abortion is unquestionably one \nin the process of being born. The statutory definition of partial-birth \nabortion contained in H.R. 1122 is clear and precise: ``the term \npartial-birth abortion means an abortion in which the person performing \nthe abortion partially vaginally delivers a living fetus before killing \nthe fetus and completing the delivery.''\n  Because of the timing in the birth process at which this particular \ntype of abortion is performed, when the fetus is literally just inches \naway from birth, these fetuses may actually qualify as persons under \nthe Constitution as interpreted by the Court in Roe and its progeny, \nentitled to all of the protections of law that all other American \ncitizens enjoy. The Supreme Court's decision in Roe makes clear that \nthe Court did not even consider--let alone decide--whether partial-\nbirth abortion could be prohibited. Congress is, therefore, free to \naddress and decide this issue on its merits, and to pass a statute \nprotecting such partially born children.\n  Even if one believes that a partially born child is not a person \nunder the 14th amendment, Supreme Court jurisprudence on abortion, \nprincipally articulated in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern \nPennsylvania versus Casey, fully permits Congress to ban partial-birth \nabortions.\n  While the Supreme Court in Roe versus Wade established a right for a \nwoman to choose to have an abortion, the Court explicitly rejected the \nargument that the right to an abortion is absolute, and that a woman is \nentitled to terminate her pregnancy at whatever time, in whatever way, \nand for whatever reason she alone chooses.\n  In Planned Parenthood versus Casey, the Court established a \nbifurcated approach to determine whether an abortion statute is \nconstitutional, drawing a line at fetal viability. In reviewing a \nstatute regulating abortion, a court must first determine whether the \nstatute imposes an undue burden on the mother's right to choose to have \nan abortion. If the statute does not impose an undue burden on the \nmother, the court must then determine whether the statute reasonably \nrelates to a legitimate governmental purpose. Once the fetus is viable, \nthe Government can prohibit abortion.\n  Under Casey, pre-viability regulation of abortion is constitutional \nso long as it does not constitute an undue burden on the abortion \nliberty. The essence of the undue burden test is whether the law, on \nits face, places a substantial obstacle on the woman's liberty interest \nthat effectively deprives her of the right to make the ultimate \ndecision of whether or not to have an abortion. Writing for the Court, \nJustice O'Connor wrote:\n\n       A finding of an undue burden is a shorthand for the \n     conclusion that a state regulation has the purpose or effect \n     of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman \n     seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus. . . . What is at \n     stake is the woman's right to make the ultimate decision, not \n     a right to be insulated from all others in doing so. . . .''\n\n  A prohibition on partial-birth abortions would not unduly burden a \nwoman's right to have an abortion even in pre-viability cases. Just as \nthe right to have an abortion first recognized in Roe versus Wade did \nnot guarantee a right to ``abortion on demand,'' so, too, the undue \nburden test adopted in Casey does not guarantee an absolute, \nunrestricted right to have an abortion at the request of a woman under \nany and all circumstances.\n  H.R. 1122's ban on partial-birth abortions clearly passes muster \nunder the Casey undue burden standard. The record before Congress \nestablishes that there are several safe, standard abortion techniques \nfor providing abortions other than the partial-birth procedure. \nCongress's fact finding is entitled to considerable respect and \ndeference from the courts. H.R. 1122 does not prevent a woman from \nhaving an abortion, nor does it force a woman to undergo an \nunacceptably dangerous or painful medical procedure. H.R. 1122 merely \nbars a physician from performing an abortion in one particular manner. \nIt has neither the purpose nor effect of prohibiting or restricting \nabortions other than those performed by the partial-birth procedure, \nand leaves in place alternative methods of abortion. It thus would not \nconstitute an undue burden on a woman's right to choose to have an \nabortion.\n  Since banning partial-birth abortions does not place an undue burden \non a mother's right to choose to have an abortion, H.R. 1122 will be \nupheld as constitutional if it is reasonably related to a legitimate \ngovernment interest. The Supreme Court has recognized many legitimate--\nand even compelling--interests that may justify abortion statutes such \nas this.\n  In Roe itself, the Court acknowledged the government's legitimate \ninterest in safeguarding health, maintaining medical standards and in \nprotecting potential life. The Court has also recognized as legitimate \ninterests: protecting immature minors, promoting general health, \npromoting family integrity, and encouraging childbirth over abortion.\n  In addition, this act serves the legitimate government interest of \nprotecting human life, that of the child who is otherwise killed after \nbeing partially delivered from his mother's womb. Partial-birth \nabortion would be criminal infanticide but for a mere three inches. \nBanning this procedure would protect children from being killed during \nthe delivery process.\n  The act also serves the interests of protecting the dignity of human \nlife and preventing cruel and inhumane treatment. The partial-birth \nprocedure is a particularly heinous method of abortion, one that \ninflicts excruciating pain on the child. No one would question a \nstatute prohibiting the treatment of animals in such a manner. In fact, \nwe have laws and regulations preventing harsh and painful treatment of \nlaboratory animals in government research projects. Surely the \ngovernment has a legitimate interest in extending at least the same \nlevel of protection to living children in their last seconds before \nbirth.\n  Mr. President, when Ron Fitzsimmons finally came forward to confirm \nthe truth about the terrible procedure called partial-birth abortion, \nthere was one more thing he said which\n\n[[Page S4569]]\n\nbears remembering. He reminded us that women who enter abortion clinics \ndo so to kill their unborn children. He said that abortion is ``a form \nof killing . . . You're ending a life.''\n  And that, Mr. President, is the ultimate truth which should be \nremembered by each Senator, and by each American, during this debate. \nWe are deciding whether this nation will continue to permit partially \nborn children, children just three inches away from life, thousands of \nchildren each and every year, mainly healthy children from healthy \nmothers, to be killed in a particularly painful, dangerous, inhumane \nand medically unjustified and unnecessary manner.\n  We now know the truth about partial-birth abortions. The question is \nwhether we will have the courage to do what I believe each member of \nthe Senate knows, in his or her heart, to be the right, the moral, \nthing. With respect to this one terrible and unnecessary procedure, let \nus finally say, as a nation, enough. Here, on the edge of infanticide, \nis the line that we will not cross. I urge my colleagues to vote to \npass H.R. 1122.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, The Daschle amendment narrows the \ndefinition of health to such a degree that in practice it would lead to \nphysical and mental harm to women in emergency situations.\n  I believe the amendment is inconsistent with Supreme Court decisions \non this issue.\n  At this time, I ask unanimous consent that excerpts from a letter by \nProf. Laurence Tribe, of Harvard University Law School, be printed in \nthe Record. These excerpts outline in some detail my concerns.\n  The Feinstein-Boxer-Braun alternative essentially codifies Roe versus \nWade and offers a clear alternative to H.R. 1122, which would cause \ngrave harm to women.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The upshot is that the Daschle language would criminalize \n     at least three categories of post-viability abortions that, \n     under Roe and Casey, may not be prohibited.\n       First, abortions that are regarded by the woman and her \n     physician as necessary to avoid medically diagnosable injury \n     to mental health, including suicidal depression that might \n     result from having to carry to term a fetus so severely \n     deformed (as in a case of anencephaly, for instance) that it \n     would be born only to die hours later after a brief and \n     painful life;\n       Second, abortions that are required because, in the \n     judgment of the woman and her physician, continuing the \n     pregnancy would seriously and permanently threaten the \n     woman's physical and/or mental health but not by bringing \n     about what the physician could certify is a ``severely \n     debilitating disease or impairment specifically caused by the \n     pregnancy;''\n       Third, and to some degree encompassed within the second \n     point above, abortions that are medically required because \n     continuing the pregnancy would preclude the provision of \n     necessary treatment for a condition that, although not life-\n     threatening, would indeed amount to a ``severely debilitating \n     impairment''--such as, for instance, permanent inability to \n     bear children in the future, or permanent impairment of some \n     important bodily capacity or function such as e.g., vision--\n     but not an impairment that is ``specially caused by the \n     pregnancy.''\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Feinstein and \nDaschle amendments and in opposition to H.R. 1122.\n  The decision to proceed with a potentially lethal pregnancy or one \nthat would endanger the future health of the mother should rest with a \nwoman and her doctor. As a general principle, the Government's role in \nsuch a difficult decision should be secondary to that of the woman who \nmust inevitably come to terms with her own personal moral, religious, \nand philosophical beliefs.\n  H.R. 1122 supersedes the medical judgment of trained physicians and \ncriminalizes medical procedures that may be necessary to preserve the \nlife and health of the woman. Indeed, it seeks to restrictively and \ncoercively dictate what constitutes appropriate medical practice.\n  Furthermore, H.R. 1122 does not provide an exception for the health \nof the mother, thus rejecting the constitutional standard governing \npostviability abortions set forth in the Supreme Court's decision in \nRoe versus Wade. Let us make no mistake, Roe versus Wade does not allow \na healthy mother of a healthy fetus to have a postviability abortion.\n  During this emotionally charged debate, it is important to keep in \nmind those unfortunate women who have faced unpredictable, tragic, and \nlife-threatening pregnancies. For instance, two women who endured such \ngrave circumstances shared their stories recently before a joint House-\nSenate Judiciary Committee hearing. They testified to the heart-\nwrenching circumstances surrounding their decision--a decision that \nwould have been illegal under this legislation. We have heard these and \nother equally compelling stories shared by many of my colleagues during \nthis debate today.\n  The amendments offered by Senator Feinstein and Senator Daschle, \nhowever, both take into consideration the woman's life and health. The \nFeinstein amendment bans all postviability abortions, except those \nnecessary to preserve the life of the woman or to avert serious adverse \nhealth consequences. The Daschle amendment also bans all postviability \nabortion, but makes an exception for those necessary to save the \nmother's life or to protect her from grievous injury to her physical \nhealth. I will support these amendments because their sponsors seek to \npreserve the core principles of Roe versus Wade.\n  Of these two amendments, the Feinstein approach is preferable to meet \nthe tragic and trying circumstances of women facing this agonizing \ndecision. I am concerned that the Daschle amendment may not ensure \nappropriate medical options for all the possible health-related \ndifficulties faced by some women. If it is the true intention of H.R. \n1122's proponents to address late term abortions, I would urge my \ncolleagues to support the Feinstein and Daschle amendments which \naccords with the Supreme Court's decisions in this area and have been \nendorsed by the President.\n  Mr. President, the debate on the issue of abortion involves profound \nquestions. Questions of a moral, personal, and religious nature. I do \nnot personally favor abortion. However, my duty as a Senator is to \nuphold the Constitution and ensure that the power of the State is not \nused to compel citizens in a manner which contradicts an individual's \nprotected religious and moral beliefs.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in March, the House of \nRepresentatives--in a bipartisan manner--overwhelmingly voted 295-136 \nto end the horrible procedure known as partial birth abortion. That \nstrong endorsement for the ban came in the wake of a confession by a \nprominent proponent of abortion who admitted that he lied through his \nteeth when he said that partial birth abortions were very rare and only \nperformed in the most dire of circumstances.\n  On February 27, 1997, Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of the \nNational Coalition of Abortion Providers, an association of over 200 \nabortion providers, recanted his earlier statements that partial birth \nabortions were used only in extreme medical circumstances. Fitzsimmons \nadmitted that: In actuality, 5,000 partial birth abortions are \nperformed every year as an elective procedure on a healthy mother with \na healthy fetus that is 20 weeks or more along.\n  Fitzsimmons justified his lie by saying that he just went out there \nand spouted the party line. The party line Fitzsimmons referred to, of \ncourse, is the party line agreed on among the Washington-based pro-\nabortion groups.\n  Unfortunately, President Clinton justified his veto of this ban by \nspouting the same party line lies--that this procedure is medically \nnecessary in certain compelling cases to protect the mother.\n  Mr. President, here is the truth about partial birth abortions:\n  According to reputable medical testimony given before this Congress \nby partial birth abortion practitioners, partial birth abortions occur \nas many as 5,000 times a year. They are used predominantly for elective \npurposes and are seldom necessary to safeguard the mother's health or \nfertility.\n  Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop confirmed that President \nClinton was misled by his medical advisors and stated that ``In no way \ncan I twist my mind to see that the late-term abortion as described as \npartial birth is a medical necessity for the mother.''\n  Other physicians agree: In a September 19, 1996, Wall Street Journal \neditorial, three obstetricians declared\n\n[[Page S4570]]\n\nthat ``contrary to what abortion activists would have us believe, \npartial birth abortion is never medically indicated to protect a \nwoman's health or her fertility.''\n  Here's another truth: Partial birth abortions are violent. The \nprocedure is one in which four-fifths of the child is delivered before \nthe abhorrent process of killing the child begins. Sadly, throughout \nthis procedure, the majority of babies are alive and may actually feel \npain during this ordeal. Ms. Brenda Schaffer, a nurse who observed the \nprocedure, made this moving statement before a congressional committee:\n\n       The baby's little fingers were clasping and unclasping, and \n     his little feet were kicking. Then the doctor stuck the \n     scissors in the back of his head, and the baby's arms jerked \n     out, like a startle reaction, like a flinch, like a baby does \n     when he thinks he is going to fall.\n       The doctor opened up the scissors, stuck a high-powered \n     suction tube into the opening, and sucked the baby's brains \n     out. Now the baby went completely limp.\n\n  Mr. President, it's not easy to discuss this topic, but \nunfortunately, those are the stark and brutal realities of a partial \nbirth abortion. My good friend and colleague Senator Moynihan declared \nthat the practice of partial birth abortions is ``just too close to \ninfanticide.''\n  Mr. President, the vote today is not an issue of pro-life or pro-\nchoice--it's an issue of putting an end to an inhumane procedure. This \ninfant is within inches from being declared a legal person in every \nState of the Union. The time has come for this body to legally protect \nthat person.\n  During the last Congress, a ban on partial birth abortion failed \nbecause of misinformation. This year, may the truth prevail. As we in \nCongress and the President finally hear the truth about this \nprocedure--that it cannot be defended medically nor morally.\n  I ask my colleagues to look into their consciences to make the right \ndecision: To ban this painful, unnecessary, and morally offensive \nprocedure of terminating the life of a viable child.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, consistent with my remarks made both \non the 14th and today, it will be my intention to vote against the \nDaschle substitute amendment to H.R. 1122.\n  I made the argument that I believe both H.R. 1122 as well as the \nDaschle substitute are unconstitutional.\n  With respect to the Daschle amendment, my reading of it indicates \nthat, even if a severely, horribly deformed fetus were capable of only \n1 hour of life outside the womb, a woman would be forced to carry that \npregnancy to full term and deliver that child, without consideration of \nwhat may be severely debilitating consequences to her health.\n  For me that is not enlightened public policy, and I cannot support \nit.\n  Additionally, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nletter to me from Laurence Tribe, professor of constitutional law at \nHarvard University, which more definitively spells out the \nconstitutional vulnerability of the Daschle amendment.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                Harvard University Law School,\n\n                                      Cambridge, MA, May 15, 1997.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I've been surprised to learn that \n     some people are evidently confused about whether the health \n     exception contained in Senator Daschle's proposed legislation \n     complies with the constitutional requirements set forth in \n     Roe and Casey. You've asked me to put in writing my \n     explanation of why the Daschle exception is constitutionally \n     insufficient, and I'm glad to do so.\n       Both Roe and Casey unambiguously hold that a state may not \n     prohibit any post-viability abortion that is ``necessary, in \n     appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the \n     life or health of the mother.'' The Daschle language would \n     forbid abortion of a viable fetus unless the physician \n     certifies that continuing the pregnancy ``would threaten the \n     mother's life or risk grievous injury to her physical \n     health,'' and goes on to explain that even this narrowed \n     health exception--which impermissibly excludes medically \n     diagnosable risks, however severe, to the woman's mental \n     health and which requires the physician to certify that the \n     physical injury to the woman would be ``grievous''--is \n     inapplicable unless the ``severely debilitating disease or \n     impairment'' that the physician believes requires termination \n     of pregnancy is ``specifically caused by the pregnancy.'' \n     Thus, although a pregnancy may be terminated without \n     violating Daschle if its continuation would cause what the \n     proposed statute calls ``an inability to provide necessary \n     treatment for a life-threatening condition,'' a pregnancy may \n     not be terminated without violating Daschle if its \n     continuation would cause only an inability to provide \n     necessary treatment for a severely debilitating but not life-\n     threatening condition.\n       The upshot is that the Daschle language would criminalize \n     at least three categories of post-viability abortions that, \n     under Roe and Casey, may not be prohibited:\n       First, abortions that are regarded by the woman and her \n     physician as necessary to avoid medically diagnosable injury \n     to mental health, including suicidal depression that might \n     result from having to carry to term a fetus so severely \n     deformed (as in a case of anencephaly, for instance) that it \n     would be born only to die hours later after a brief and \n     painful life;\n       Second, abortions that are required because, in the \n     judgment of the woman and her physician, continuing the \n     pregnancy would seriously and permanently threaten the \n     woman's physical and/or mental health but not by bringing \n     about what the physician could certify is a ``severely \n     debilitating disease or impairment specifically caused by the \n     pregnancy;''\n       Third, and to some degree encompassed within the second \n     point above, abortions that are medically required because \n     continuing the pregnancy would preclude the provision of \n     necessary treatment for a condition that, although not life-\n     threatening, would indeed amount to a ``severely debilitating \n     impairment''--such as, for instance, permanent inability to \n     bear children in the future, or permanent impairment of some \n     important bodily capacity or function such as, e.g., vision--\n     but not an impairment that is ``specifically caused by the \n     pregnancy.''\n       I should stress the arbitrariness of the exclusion, from \n     the Daschle language, of impairments in the latter category. \n     If a woman is pregnant with a viable fetus in circumstances \n     where the pregnancy itself, unless terminated, would cause a \n     severe impairment (say, to kidney function), the Daschle bill \n     would permit her to obtain an abortion. If the same woman is \n     pregnant with the same viable fetus where the pregnancy \n     itself causes no impairment but where the continuation of \n     that pregnancy would make impossible the use of certain drugs \n     or procedures (because those drugs or procedures would cause \n     severe deformity in the fetus, for instance, as is often the \n     case with chemotherapy or radiation therapy) without which \n     the woman would suffer an even more severe impairment (say, \n     to kidney and liver function and future reproductive \n     capacity), the Daschle bill would make it a crime for her \n     doctor to perform the same abortion. This arbitrary \n     distinction would in all likelihood violate the Due Process \n     Clause of the Fifth Amendment even apart from Roe and Casey, \n     bit in any event it seems undeniable that it would violate \n     the principles laid down in those decisions, which quite \n     pointedly focus on whether the abortion is necessary to \n     preserve ``the life or health of the mother,'' not on the \n     (quite irrelevant) issue of whether the pregnancy itself \n     endangers her life or health.\n       The Daschle bill recognizes that the key question is the \n     necessity of the abortion and not what the pregnancy itself \n     might cause when it comes to what it calls ``life-\n     threatening'' conditions, making clear that a pregnancy may \n     be terminated if it causes an ``inability to provide \n     necessary treatment'' for such conditions. The glaring \n     omission of any parallel provision for terminating a \n     pregnancy that causes an inability to provide necessary \n     treatment for severely debilitating even if not life-\n     threatening conditions, or an inability to provide procedures \n     that would prevent the development of such conditions, cannot \n     be squared with the requirements of Roe and Casey.\n       For these reasons, I cannot understand how anyone could \n     doubt the inconsistency of the Daschle language with the \n     requirements of the Constitution as construed in Roe and \n     Casey. I can readily understand the political temptation of \n     some to sign onto a measure that seems less drastic and \n     dangerous from some perspectives than Santorum, and this \n     letter is not intended to address the political pros and cons \n     of various positions. I think it would be a tragedy, however, \n     for Senators, or the White House, to proceed on the basis of \n     demonstrably indefensible readings of the Daschle language or \n     of Roe v. Wade or both.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                Laurence H. Tribe.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I commend the Minority Leader for his good \nefforts to bring about a thoughtful compromise on this difficult issue. \nHe and his staff have worked long and hard to develop the language we \nhave before us in the form of this amendment. The Daschle alternative \nwould ban all post-viability abortions while presenting an exception \nfor the life of the mother and a meaningful, narrowly tailored \nexception for serious health risk to the mother. The amendment also \ncontains penalties for a first violation of the law in the form of a \nfine of up to $100,000 or the loss of the physician's license.\n  While I am generally opposed to abortion, I also believe that there \nshould be the ability to protect the mother. This issue is a very \ndifficult\n\n[[Page S4571]]\n\nand a very emotional one. I have grappled with it long and hard. While \nsome may argue that this amendment is a paper tiger, I disagree. This \namendment, unlike the underlying bill, would address all late-term \nabortion procedures, not just the partial-birth abortion procedure.\n  Again, I appreciate the efforts of the Minority Leader, and I will \ncast my vote in support of his amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I supported and still support the partial-\nbirth abortion bill. I voted for it in 1995 and voted to override the \nPresident's veto last year. The bill was a step in the direction of \nending late-term abortions. But, it was not a perfect solution. It did \nnot, as I would have liked, ban all post-viability abortions.\n  There is no dispute that under the Supreme Court's Roe versus Wade \ndecision, the government can ban post-viability abortions. But, I was \nand still am concerned that in banning only partial-birth abortions, we \ndo not go far enough. In fact, there is a legitimate concern that in \nbanning partial-birth abortions, not a single abortion would be \nprevented. The result would be merely to shift the type of procedure \nused in performing an abortion.\n  Today, Mr. President, we have a better solution--a solution that goes \nbeyond the ban on a single procedure by actually banning all late-term \nabortions. The Daschle proposal would make all post-viability \nabortions--regardless of the method used--illegal, except in very \nlimited circumstances consistent with Roe versus Wade. As an article in \nThe Washington Times put it--and the Times is one of the most \nconservative newspapers in America--``Mr. Daschle's plan would go \nfurther in restricting abortion than the . . . partial-birth plan.''\n  If the goal is to reduce the number of abortions in America and to \neliminate late-term abortions consistent with Roe versus Wade--and that \nhas been my goal from day one--then the Daschle proposal is the answer \nbecause the Daschle proposal bans all post-viability abortions. The \nonly exception is when an abortion is necessary to save the woman's \nlife or in the small number of cases where continuation of the \npregnancy would, to quote the amendment, ``risk grievous injury to her \nphysical health.''\n  Now, I wish to address for just a minute the health exception. \nCritics often claim that a health exception is a gigantic loophole--a \nloophole so big, some have said, that it would allow a teenage girl to \nget a late-term abortion just because she could not fit into her prom \ndress. That is an outrageously untrue claim to begin with, regardless \nof the language of the health exception. But, the rhetoric aside, the \nhealth exception under the Daschle proposal is extremely narrow. It \nmust be a severely debilitating disease caused by the pregnancy or it \nmust be a case where a woman cannot undergo necessary treatment for a \nlife-threatening condition as long as she is pregnant. This is not \nmental health. This is not a minor ailment. This is grievous physical \ninjury.\n  There are some, Mr. President, who simply do not believe that there \nshould ever be a health exception no matter how narrow. I disagree. \nThere needs to be a narrow health exception. Take, for example, a woman \nwho, during pregnancy, is diagnosed with breast cancer. Her life is not \ndirectly endangered by the pregnancy, but her long-term prospects for \nsurvival are. Early detection and treatment of breast cancer can \nincrease survival rates by 30 percent. But, a pregnant woman cannot \nundergo chemotherapy treatment unless her pregnancy is terminated \nbecause the chemotherapy can result in permanent damage, even mutation, \nof the fetus. And, a continued pregnancy will weaken her body's immune \nsystem, making it harder for her to fight the cancer. That decision \nshould be between the woman and God, not the government.\n  Cases such as these are tragic situations--rare and tragic. But, it \nwould be even more tragic to say that ipso facto a woman cannot have an \nabortion unless her life is threatened by giving birth. That is why the \nSupreme Court has required a health exception and why the Daschle \nproposal includes a very narrow health exception.\n  Mr. President, I admit I am faced with a dilemma here. I can vote to \nban one particular abortion procedure that I find repugnant--but in the \nprocess, allow late-term abortions to continue. Or, I can vote to \neliminate more abortions, by banning all late-term abortions--but in \nthe process allow the so-called partial-birth abortion procedure to \ncontinue under limited circumstances. I wish we were not faced with the \nchoice of one or the other. I would like to do both. But, I must cast \nmy vote now for the proposal that I believe will result in fewer \nabortions. In my view, that is the Daschle proposal. But, let me also \nbe clear. If the Daschle proposal fails, I will again vote for the bill \nto ban partial-birth abortions.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am voting against the amendments \noffered by Senator Feinstein and Senator Daschle because I believe \nthose amendments are so broad as to negate the purpose of the bill.\n  In my judgment, as detailed below, once the child is partially out of \nthe mother's womb, it is no longer abortion. It is infanticide.\n  As a legal matter, infanticide would be justified only by analogy to \nself-defense to save another life--the life of the mother. That legal \nconclusion is based on the judgment that infanticide is not warranted \nfor the lesser values of averting ``serious adverse health consequences \nto the woman''--Senator Feinstein's amendment--or avoiding ``grievious \ninjury to her physical health''--Senator Daschle's amendment.\n  I adhere to the fuller statement of my views set forth in my floor \nstatement of September 26, 1996:\n\n       This is among the most difficult of the 6,003 votes I have \n     cast in the Senate because it involves a decision of life and \n     death on the line between when a woman may choose abortion \n     and what constitutes infanticide.\n       In my legal judgment, the issue is not over a woman's right \n     to chose within the constitutional context of Roe versus Wade \n     or Planned Parenthood versus Casey. If it were, Congress \n     could not legislate. Congress is neither competent to \n     micromanage doctors' decisions nor constitutionally permitted \n     to legislate where the life or health of the mother is \n     involved in an abortion.\n       In my legal judgment, the medical act or acts of commission \n     or omission in interfering with, or not facilitating the \n     completion of a live birth after a child is partially out of \n     the mother's womb constitute infanticide. The line of the law \n     is drawn, in my legal judgment, when the child is partially \n     out of the womb of the mother. It is no longer abortion; it \n     is infanticide.\n       This vote does not affect my basic views on the pro-choice/\n     pro-life issue. While I am personally opposed to abortion, I \n     do not believe it can be controlled by the Government. It is \n     a matter for women and families with guidance from ministers, \n     priests, and rabbis.\n       If partial-birth abortions are banned, women will retain \n     the right to choose during most of pregnancy and doctors will \n     retain the right to act to save the life of the mother.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to first say how proud I am of two \nof our colleagues here, Senator Santorum and Senator DeWine. I have \ndelayed coming over to speak until the end because, quite frankly, I \nthink they have done a better job of defending the position that I hold \nthan I could possibly do. I think their arguments over the last few \ndays have been a great testament to the seriousness with which we take \nour business. I was thinking, since I was chairman of the National \nRepublican Senatorial Committee when they were both elected, that if I \nfound myself at the Pearly Gates and St. Peter added up my good deeds \nand found me coming up short, I would say as my final argument, \nSantorum and DeWine, I had a little something to do with their being \nelected. I am convinced that would be instrumental in getting me \nthrough the gates.\n  We have had a lot of things said here, and I want to get back to the \nbasic point, which I think often gets lost. This is not a debate about \na woman's right to choose. This is not a debate about the rights of the \nunborn. We are debating, today, a gruesome procedure that no civilized \nsociety would condone.\n  We are back here again today because every day since we had the first \ndebate more facts have come out, often contradicting the very arguments \nthat were used against this bill when we debated it last year on the \nfloor of the Senate. As people learn more about this procedure, they \nbecome stronger in their conviction that it should be stopped. We are \nhere today because many members who voted against this bill last year \nhave constituents back\n\n[[Page S4572]]\n\nhome who, as they have gotten to know more about this procedure, feel \nthat a mistake was made. We are here today because even the people who \nopposed the bill before are deeply troubled by this procedure that we \nare trying to ban.\n  Now, I am not a physician. I first got involved in this debate when \nback in 1995, I came over to give one of my dull lectures on economics. \nWhile waiting to speak, Senator Smith was standing here talking about \nthis procedure. I knew little about its gruesomeness prior to that \ntime. A Senator rose to object. That Senator was offended by what \nSenator Smith was trying to demonstrate. It suddenly struck me, if we \nare offended by somebody simply talking about this procedure, for God's \nsake, we ought to be offended that it is happening to thousands of \nchildren in America. I cosponsored Senator Smith's bill. That marked \nthe beginning of my involvement.\n  The bottom line here is that we are trying to ban a gruesome \nprocedure which is inhumane, uncivilized, and clearly unnecessary.\n  I am not sure about all that the Daschle amendment purports to do. \nMany people see it doing many different things. But I am sure that the \none thing it does not do is ban partial-birth abortion. Should we as \nmembers of the greatest of all civilized societies continue to condone \na procedure? An unborn living child is completely delivered, except for \nthe child's head, and that child is literally 3 inches from the full \nconstitutional protections afforded every person in this country. Only \nat that point is that child's life terminated.\n  I think the American people who have come to understand this \nprocedure want it stopped. If you want it stopped, you can't stop it \nwith the Daschle amendment. You have to stop it by banning partial-\nbirth abortion.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Daschle amendment and to \nvote for this bill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader has 8 minutes remaining. \nThe other side has 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the distinguished \nminority leader for yielding.\n  Mr. President, for 25 years the question of abortion has been among \nthe most divisive in our Nation. It divides our families and poisons \nour political debate.\n  We come to this floor today still holding, I know, fundamentally \ndifferent views on this question. I believe strongly that the issue of \nbringing a pregnancy to term remains with a woman in consultation with \nher conscience and her doctor. I know others have fundamentally \ndifferent views.\n  But there is a real chance at long last, at least for this moment, \nfor one narrow part of this issue, to find some common ground. Because, \non this day, there is a chance to address at least the issue of \npostviability, late-term abortions. And the question largely rests with \nthose who have dedicated these years in opposition to abortion rights \ngenerally.\n  The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] has offered an \nalternative--that it is constitutional because it deals only with \npostviability pregnancies. It, and it alone, can pass the \nconstitutional test of Roe versus Wade. It alone does not have an undue \nburden or a substantial obstacle, as outlined in Casey versus Planned \nParenthood. And it alone will get the signature of the President of the \nUnited States.\n  Yet, there are those who passionately want to prohibit this procedure \nbut will not be voting with us on this occasion. It raises the question \nof whether they avoid this chance to end late-term abortions because \nthey seek to preserve a political issue more than to end the procedure \nwhich many Americans find offensive.\n  Mr. President, I will be voting with Senator Daschle because, while I \nstrongly believe--as our Supreme Court has affirmed--that there is an \ninherent right to privacy, that every woman has a constitutional right \nto reach her own judgment about whether to bring to term or terminate a \npregnancy before viability, there is a legitimate public policy \nquestion affirmed by the courts on whether or not this procedure or any \nother should be allowed to continue postviability.\n  Senator Daschle, in the alternative that he brings to the Senate \ntoday, prohibits not only the late-term abortion procedure described in \ndetail by those supporting Mr. Santorum's legislation, but he also \nprohibits other alternatives dealing with postviable fetuses. And he \nalone does so.\n  It again begs the question whether or not this Senate is intending to \nactually prohibit late-term abortions, or whether, cynically and \nregrettably, this is genuinely an effort to maintain a political issue, \nbecause, if Senator Daschle fails, our opponents may, in fact, outlaw \nthis single procedure, but at least three other procedures also dealing \nwith postviable fetuses would be allowed to continue, and many women \nwhose lives would be better protected, their health better assured, \nwould be forced to use other procedures that are more dangerous.\n\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of Senator Daschle's alternative. \nIt is constitutional. It protects a woman's choice. It is a better \nbalance. It is the only chance for common ground. Let us resume the \nfight tomorrow and today to end this late-term abortion struggle.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from \nOhio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, why do we argue with the Daschle amendment \nthat sounds, on its face, reasonable? Why do we argue to say that it is \na gutting amendment? Let me give my colleagues, very quickly, four \nreasons.\n  When you look at the language of the Daschle amendment, you find that \nit creates a subjective standard. The underlying bill has an objective \nstandard.\n  The amendment says ``would threaten the mother's life,'' or ``risk \ngrievous injury to her physical health.'' ``Risk'' is the key word.\n  We have quoted Dr. Hern in Colorado who said, ``I will certify that \nany pregnancy is a threat to a woman's life and could cause grievous \ninjury to her physical health''--``could cause.'' We cited this. But, \nfrankly, I don't believe anyone, if you look just at the language, \nwould disagree with what the doctor said. The reality is that any \npregnancy has a risk. We are dealing with subjective language.\n  Second, it is doctor self-certified. The operative language, the key \nlanguage, is certification. No way you can look beyond and behind that \ncertification. Once the certification is made, that is it.\n  Third, the issue of viability: Before you even get to the question of \ncertification, you have the issue of viability. All the doctor has to \nsay is ``not viable.'' Who is going to look behind that?\n  Senator Nickles has pointed out very well in citing the Supreme Court \ncase that says when we are dealing with the issue of viability it is \nleft up to the discretion of the physician. We look to the physician. \nMy friends on the other side of the aisle can say, ``Well, who else \nwould you look at?'' That is fine. But the reality is, you can't then \ntell me it is an objective standard. It is a subjective standard. It is \nself-certification, self-decided by the person who is performing the \nabortion.\n  Finally, the fourth reason: The courts have historically given a very \nliberal interpretation to the whole issue of health as it pertains to a \nbill having to do with abortions.\n  Four reasons, Mr. President, and Members of the Senate, why this very \ngood-sounding amendment is a gutting amendment which really destroys \nthe underlying bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader has 2 minutes and 43 \nseconds. The Republican side has 4 minutes and 15 seconds.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, does the Senator from Pennsylvania wish \nto consume any of the remaining time prior to the time of vote?\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, several comments have been made about\n\n[[Page S4573]]\n\nwhat the minority leader's legislation attempts to do, postviability \nabortions, and that ours doesn't do that. That is correct. That was \nnever the intention of the bill. What our bill does is stop the \ninfanticide.\n\n  We have had a change in the debate here. We have had a debate about \nthe late-term abortion. But what we have been debating--maybe the other \nside didn't realize it--here is stopping the killing of children, \n``infanticide.'' That is not my word. The Senator from New York, \nSenator Moynihan, says this looks like infanticide. This baby is \noutside of the mother, a fully formed little baby.\n  That is what this debate is about. We have gotten off track here a \nlittle bit and tried to talk about late-term abortions and trying to \ndefine it.\n  I think you heard the Senator from Tennessee define how this doesn't \ndo anything. But that is one. The Senator from South Dakota said you \nhave the same procedures, as far as doctors determining life of the \nmother in partial-birth abortions.\n  The difference is there is no certification procedure in the partial-\nbirth abortion--none. By giving a certification procedure in your bill, \nyou raise that as a standard that is dispositive. We do not do that in \nthis bill. We leave that up to a judge and a jury.\n  In the case of the Daschle bill, as I said before, the executioner is \nthe judge and the jury. In our bill, that is not the case.\n  So there is a substantive difference in how we deal with this.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  I hope that we have opposition to the Daschle amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two and one-half minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  In closing, I simply also urge opposition to the Daschle amendment \nand support for the underlying bill to ban partial-birth abortion.\n  The Daschle amendment, although well-intended and with a good, strong \neffort to narrow the definition of health of the mother, simply does \nnot accomplish what it intends. The bill tries to close the loophole. \nIt is a loophole in the sense that there are many people, \nunfortunately, who exploit the definition of health of a mother to \ntheir benefit, to perform abortions very late, second trimester, third \ntrimester. Unfortunately, there are people like that. We have heard \nabout them. We have described their cases. Some of them exploit the \nloophole of health of the mother to use the partial-birth-abortion \nprocedure.\n  I have argued that the Daschle amendment does not outlaw, does not \nban, the partial-birth abortion. And if the criteria are met in his \nbill, people will still be performing the partial-birth procedure.\n  Second, the bill, although it tries to narrow the definition, fails. \nWhy? Because you can't separate physical health from mental health, \nfrom emotional health. That is why you can't define health of the \nmother so narrowly.\n  Mr. President, I have had the opportunity to deliver babies as a \nphysician, as a resident in training. It is a miraculous process. It is \na beautiful process to see and help deliver that child, to come into \nthe real world. Many of us as fathers have participated in that \nprocess.\n  Remember, we are talking about banning a procedure that at one point \nin time in this miraculous, this beautiful process is said to be OK, \nbut 1 second later, 3 inches later, we call it murder.\n  It is a procedure that is brutal, inhumane, and deeply offensive to \nour sensibilities as human beings. It must and should be banned.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we agree. We want to ban the procedure. \nBut we also respect the Constitution. We recognize how critical it is \nthat if we are indeed desirous of passing legislation that will remain \nconstitutional, we have to live within the bounds of the Constitution.\n  I respect greatly the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, and \nadmire him immensely. He is a distinguished physician as well as a \ndistinguished Senator.\n  But the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists disagrees \nwith his position.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na copy of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \n(ACOG) statement of policy, a letter of endorsement from ACOG, a report \nfrom the American Medical Associations Board of Trustees concerning \nlate term abortion techniques, and examples of serious maternal health \nconditions as noted in obstetrics manuals.\n  I would like to note that the recommendations of the American Medical \nAssociation regarding the use of late term abortion techniques are \nwholly consistent with the goals and intent of my amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        ACOG Statement of Policy\n\n                (As issued by the ACOG Executive Board)\n\n\n             statement on intact dilatation and extraction\n\n       The debate regarding legislation to prohibit a method of \n     abortion, such as the legislation banning ``partial birth \n     abortion,'' and ``brain sucking abortions,'' has prompted \n     questions regarding these procedures. It is difficult to \n     respond to these questions because the descriptions are vague \n     and do not delineate a specific procedure recognized in the \n     medical literature. Moreover, the definitions could be \n     interpreted to include elements of many recognized abortion \n     and operative obstetric techniques.\n       The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \n     (ACOG) believes the intent of such legislative proposals is \n     to prohibit a procedure referred to as ``Intact Dilatation \n     and Extraction'' (Intact D & X). This procedure has been \n     described as containing all of the following four elements: \n     (1) Deliberate dilatation of the cervix, usually over a \n     sequence of days; (2) instrumental conversion of the fetus to \n     a footling breech; (3) breech extraction of the body \n     excepting the head; and (4) partial evacuation of the \n     intracranial contents of a living fetus to effect vaginal \n     delivery of a dead but otherwise intact fetus.\n       Because these elements are part of established obstetric \n     techniques, it must be emphasized that unless all four \n     elements are present in sequence, the procedure is not an \n     intact D & X.\n       Abortion intends to terminate a pregnancy while preserving \n     the life and health of the mother. When abortion is performed \n     after 16 weeks, intact D & X is one method of terminating a \n     pregnancy. The physician, in consultation with the patient, \n     must choose the most appropriate method based upon the \n     patient's individual circumstances.\n       According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     (CDC), only 5.3% of abortions performed in the United States \n     in 1993, the most recent data available, were performed after \n     the 16th week of pregnancy. A preliminary figure published by \n     the CDC for 1994 is 5.6 percent. The CDC does not collect \n     data on the specific method of abortion, so it is unknown how \n     many of these were performed using intact D & X. Other data \n     show that second trimester transvaginal instrumental abortion \n     is a safe procedure.\n       Terminating a pregnancy is performed in some circumstances \n     to save the life or preserve the health of the mother. Intact \n     D & X is one of the methods available in some of these \n     situations. A select panel convened by ACOG could identify no \n     circumstances under which this procedure, as defined above, \n     would be the only option to save the life or preserve the \n     health of the woman. An intact D & X, however, may be the \n     best or most appropriate procedure in a particular \n     circumstance to save the life or preserve the health of a \n     woman, and only the doctor, in consultation with the patient, \n     based upon the woman's particular circumstances can make this \n     decision. The potential exists that legislation prohibiting \n     specific medical practices, such as intact D & X, may outlaw \n     techniques that are critical to the lives and health of \n     American women. The intervention of legislative bodies into \n     medical decision making is inappropriate, ill advised and \n     dangerous.\n       Approved by the Executive Board, January 12, 1997.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           The American College of\n\n\n                              Obstetricians and Gynecologists,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 13, 1997.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: On behalf of the American College of \n     Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), an organization \n     representing 38,000 physicians dedicated to improving women's \n     health. I am endorsing the legislative language of your \n     substitute amendment to H.R. 1122. Although it does not take \n     a position on the findings enumerated in your proposal, ACOG \n     believes that by banning abortions on viable fetuses except \n     when continuing the pregnancy threatens a woman's life or \n     risks serious injury to her health, your substitute \n     legislative language provides a meaningful ban while assuring \n     women's health is protected.\n       ACOG believes this amendment is preferable to H.R. 1122 for \n     the following reasons:\n\n[[Page S4574]]\n\n       It provides a meaningful ban, while allowing an exception \n     when it is necessary for a woman's health. This preserves the \n     ability of physicians to make judgments about individual \n     patents, an issue of critical importance to physicians.\n       The amendment does not dictate to physicians which abortion \n     procedures can or cannot be performed.\n       In conclusion, ACOG supports your amendment and urges the \n     Senate to adopt this language as an alternative to H.R. 1122.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Ralph W. Hale, MD,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n   From the Report of the Board of Trustees of the American Medical \n                        Association, April 1997\n\n  (Report is subject to review by the AMA House of Delegates in June, \n                                 1997)\n\n\n                            recommendations\n\n       The Board of Trustees recommends the adoption of the \n     following statements of policy and that the remainder of this \n     report be filed:\n       (1) The American Medical Association reaffirms current \n     policy regarding abortion, specifically policies 5.990, \n     5.993, and 5.995.\n       In summary: The early termination of pregnancy is a medical \n     matter between the patient and physician subject to the \n     physician's clinical judgment, the patient's informed \n     consent, and the availability of appropriate facilities; \n     abortion is a medical procedure and should be performed by a \n     physician in conformance with standards of good medical \n     practice; support of or opposition to abortion is a matter \n     for members of the AMA to decide individually, based on \n     personal values or beliefs. The AMA will take no action which \n     may be construed as an attempt to alter or influence the \n     personal views of individual physicians regarding abortion \n     procedures; and neither physician, hospital, nor hospital \n     personnel shall be required to perform any act violative of \n     personally held moral principles.\n       (2) The term ``partial birth abortion'' is not a medical \n     term. The American Medical Association will use the term \n     ``intact dilatation and extraction'' (or intact D) to refer \n     to a specific procedure comprised of the following elements: \n     Deliberate dilatation of the cervix, usually over a sequence \n     of days; instrumental or manual conversion of the fetus to a \n     footling breech; breech extraction of the body excepting the \n     head; and partial evacuation of the intracranial contents of \n     the fetus to effect vaginal delivery of a dead but otherwise \n     intact fetus. This procedure is distinct from dilatation and \n     evacuation (D) procedures more commonly used to induce \n     abortion after the first trimester. Because partial birth \n     abortion is not a medical term it will not be used by the \n     AMA.\n       (3) According to the scientific literature, there does not \n     appear to be any identical situation in which intact D is \n     the only appropriate procedure to induce abortion, and \n     ethical concerns have been raised about intact D The AMA \n     recommends that the procedure not be used unless alternative \n     procedures pose materially greater risk to the woman. The \n     physician must, however, retain the discretion to make that \n     judgment, acting within standards of good medical practice \n     and in the best interest of the patient.\n       (4) The viability of the fetus and the time when viability \n     is achieved may vary with each pregnancy. In the second-\n     trimester when viability may be in question, it is the \n     physician who should determine the viability of a specific \n     fetus, using the latest available diagnostic technology.\n       (5) In recognition of the constitutional principles \n     regarding the right to an abortion articulated by the Supreme \n     Court in Roe versus Wade, and in keeping with the science and \n     values of medicine, the AMA recommends that abortions not be \n     performed in the third trimester except in cases of serious \n     fetal anomalies incompatible with life. Although third-\n     trimester abortions can be performed to preserve the life or \n     health of the mother, they are, in fact, generally not \n     necessary for those purposes. Except in extraordinary \n     circumstances, maternal health factors which demand \n     termination of the pregnancy can be accommodated without \n     sacrifice of the fetus, and the near certainty of the \n     independent viability of the fetus argues for ending the \n     pregnancy by appropriate delivery.\n       (6) The AMA will work with the American College of \n     Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of \n     Pediatrics to develop clinical guidelines for induced \n     abortion after the 22nd week of gestation. The guidelines \n     will address indications and contra-indications for such \n     procedures, identify techniques which conform to standards of \n     good medical practice and, whenever possible, should be \n     evidence-based and patient-focused.\n       (7) The American Medical Association urges the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention as well as state health \n     department officials to develop expanded, ongoing data \n     surveillance systems of induced abortion. This would include \n     but not be limited to: a more detailed breakdown of the \n     prevalence of abortion by gestational age as well as the type \n     of procedure used to induce abortion at each gestational age, \n     and maternal and fetal indications for the procedure. \n     Abortion-related maternal morbidity and mortality statistics \n     should include reports on the type and severity of both \n     short- and long-term complications, type of procedure, \n     gestational age, maternal age, and type of facility. Data \n     collection procedures should ensure the anonymity of the \n     physician, the facility, and the patient.\n       (8) The AMA will work with appropriate medical specialty \n     societies, government agencies, private foundations, and \n     other interested groups to educate the public regarding \n     pregnancy prevention strategies, with special attention to \n     at-risk populations, which would minimize or preclude the \n     need for abortions. The demand for abortions, with the \n     exception of those indicated by serious fetal anomalies or \n     conditions which threaten the life or health of the pregnant \n     woman, represent failures in the social environment and \n     education. Such measures should help women who elect to \n     terminate a pregnancy through induced abortion to receive \n     those services at the earliest possible stage of gestation.\n                                  ____\n\n       This should not be considered an exhaustive list of serious \n     maternal health conditions. These are merely examples of \n     conditions listed in obstetrical textbooks as possible \n     medical indications for pregnancy termination.\n\n\n               Disease or Impairment Caused by Pregnancy\n\n       Preeclampsia with accompanying renal, kidney, or liver \n     failure, onset of severe hypertension during pregnancy: \n     ``Preeclampsia often occurs early and with increased \n     severity. Deterioration of maternal renal function or \n     uncontrolled hypertension is an indication for pregnancy \n     termination.'' \\1\\ Preeclampsia occurs in 5-10% of \n     pregnancies and is severe in less than 1%. Eclampsia \n     (complication characterized by seizures) occurs in \n     approximately 0.1% of pregnancies.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\  Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Peripartal cardiomyopathy, heart failure in late pregnancy: \n     ``Characterized by its occurrence in women with no previous \n     history of heart disease and in whom no specific [origin] of \n     heart failure can be found, peripartal cardiomyopathy is a \n     distinct, well-described syndrome of cardiac failure in late \n     pregnancy.'' \\1\\\n       Pregnancy-aggravated hypertension, acceleration of existing \n     hypertension: ``Maternal indications include organ failure \n     such as renal failure, seizures associated with the \n     development of eclampsia [progression from hypertension/\n     preeclampsia characterized by seizures and can result in \n     cerebral hemorrhage], and uncontrollable hypertension.'' \\2\\ \n     Complications develop in 10-40% of patients with chronic \n     hypertension.\n       Primary pulmonary hypertension, complication of existing \n     hypertension (abnormally high blood pressure): ``The natural \n     course of the disease terminates either by sudden death or by \n     the development of intractable congestive heart failure \n     resistant to therapy. Maternal mortality with primary \n     pulmonary hypertension approaches 50%.'' \\1\\\n\n\n       life-threatening conditions requiring immediate treatment\n\n       Bone marrow failure, severe form of anemia: ``The role of \n     pregnancy termination [in bone marrow failure treatment] is \n     unclear. Therapeutic abortion is inconsistently associated \n     with remission. It may be necessary, however, in order to \n     treat the patient with anabolic steroids.'' \\1\\ Additionally, \n     ``bone marrow transplant has become the treatment of choice. \n     Termination of the pregnancy would be necessary if a suitable \n     donor could not be found.'' \\1\\ It should be noted that bone \n     marrow transplant is also a treatment for other conditions \n     such as leukemia.\n       Cardiac arrest, heart failure: Most incidents of cardiac \n     arrest are secondary to other acute events, such as \n     anesthetic complications, trauma, or shock. According to \n     several obstetrics manuals, pregnancy termination--whether by \n     delivery or abortion--is often recommended.\\1\\ \\2\\ CPR can \n     generally be expected to generate only 30 percent of normal \n     cardiac output, and during pregnancy the uterus obstructs \n     this cardiac output even further.\n\n\n                                 Cancer\n\n       Cancer complicates approximately 1 out of every 1,000 \n     pregnancies. Issues that must be addressed in pregnancies \n     affected by cancer include the effect of pregnancy on the \n     malignancy, the need for pregnancy termination, and the \n     timing of therapy. Radiation and chemotherapy may be \n     contraindicated during pregnancy due to documented risks of \n     fetal mutation. Additionally, pregnancy inhibits a woman's \n     ability to fight off cancer because the immune system is \n     often depressed, and her nutritional intake is divided \n     between herself and the fetus.\n       Lymphoma, cancer of lymphatic system: ``High-grade Non-\n     Hodgkin's lymphoma is a rapidly progressive disease with a \n     median survival of six months. Since cure rates approach 50%, \n     it is imperative therapy not be delayed.\\2\\ In this \n     situation, delay of therapy could mean the loss of an \n     opportunity to cure the mother. Because both radiation and \n     chemotherapy present mutation risks for the fetus, \n     termination of the pregnancy is suggested in order to begin \n     treatment for lymphoma.\n       Breast cancer, especially breast cancer diagnosed during \n     pregnancy: ``Factors in pregnancy that could adversely affect \n     this malignancy include . . . increased estrogen and \n     prolactin stimulation [both factors that exacerbate breast \n     cancer], and depression of the immune system'' \\1\\ The \n     frequency of breast cancer in pregnancy is second only to \n     cancer of the cervix, occurring in 1 out of every 3,000 \n     pregnancies. In addition, adequate nutrition is a serious \n     problem.\n\n[[Page S4575]]\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ Manual of Obstetrics: Diagnosis and Therapy, ed.

Mr. President, second, let me just say that the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania said that only his bill allows \na judge and jury to decide. I beg to differ. We have virtually the same \nstandard with regard to the determination of illegality. They don't \n``self-certify'' any more than we ``self-certify,'' and vice versa.\n  It ultimately comes down to whether or not someone believes a \nphysician has broken the law. And we have very specific guidelines by \nwhich a person, a doctor, can be prosecuted if indeed he or she has \nviolated the law.\n  The third question is simply this. If indeed we want to stop \nabortion, then we really have a choice. We can stop one procedure, \nwhich is what H.R. 1122 does. It only stops one procedure. It allows \nall the other alternatives to continue. Or we can stop them all.\n  There is only one bill pending--one piece of legislation pending--\nthat allows the complete elimination of all methods of abortion.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me just say, as much as one might like to \nget around the parameters required by the Supreme Court and the \nConstitution, that when it comes to health, there can be no doubt. A \nwoman's health, as well as her life, needs to be protected.\n  That is exactly what this legislation does. It outlaws every one of \nthe procedures. It doesn't allow doctors just to shift to another \nprocedures as the colleagues on the other side who support this \nparticular procedure will continue to allow.\n  It does not allow that, but it does say we are going to stay within \nthe Constitution in prohibiting all these procedures but saving a \nmother's life and health. We can do no less. We need to support this \nlegislation. I hope on a bipartisan basis we will do that now.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, just to confirm, again, this is the last \nvote for tonight. The next recorded vote will not occur before 5 \no'clock on Monday. However, we are now working with the leadership on \nboth sides of the Capitol and the Budget Committees, with the idea of \nhaving the Budget Committees markup the budget resolution, and we hope \nto get to the budget resolution early next week. We will continue to \nwork to get the budget resolution out of the committee either tomorrow \nor Monday, and we will bring it to the floor as soon as we can get it \ncompleted and get an agreement as to how that will proceed, knowing \nwhat the rules require, but, also, wanting to work in good faith in a \nbipartisan way, which we think we are going to be able to do.\n  For the information of all Senators, as I said, there will be no \nfurther votes this evening. The Senate will next consider S. 476, \nrelative to the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, for debate only, and a \nrollcall has not been requested on passage. There will not be a \nrollcall on that passage. We are going to take that up tomorrow, and we \nwill be able to pass it without rollcall vote.\n  The Senate will be in session tomorrow for morning business to \naccommodate Senators' requests, although there will be no votes \ntomorrow.\n  Again, I think we have reached a final agreement on the package that \nwill go to the Budget Committee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/15/senate-section/article/S4517-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, the Mesa Monument Striders have held a \nroad race inside the beautiful landscape of Colorado National Monument \nsince 1993. Over the past 4 years, participation in the race has \nsoared. This year, 250 Rim Rock Run participants will be shut out of \nthe park in an effort by the National Park Service to snuff out a \nColorado legacy.\n  Yesterday, Deputy Regional Director, Robert Reynolds, upheld the \nruling of the park's superintendent to prohibit the race--all in the \nname of traffic congestion. But this is a 2 hour race held on an early \nSunday morning in November. This is a slap in the face to the State of \nColorado and the spirit of recreation which national parks were \nestablished for. I have watched the culmination of this dispute evolve \nfrom an irrational rejection of a race permit to a national dispute \nover the unjustified actions of a bureaucracy that refuses to listen to \nthe voice of the people.\n  The people of western Colorado have bent over backwards to reach a \ncompromise with the park's superintendent. Countless meetings have been \nheld offering rescheduled times and dates or proposals to scale down \nthe size of the race. The sheriff's department has committed their \nentire force to the security and coordination of the run. The local \npaper has arranged for a shuttle service to alleviate traffic \ninconveniences. It is clear to me that no amount of effort to \ncompromise will sway the park service's decision to forbid the race.\n  Well, I will not stand for this decision. I am requesting to meet \nwith the acting director of the Park Service to demand a justification \nfor this ludicrous ruling. Next month, this same Park Service is \nsponsoring the closure of a 13 mile stretch of George Washington \nParkway for a road race right here in our Nation's Capital. This might \ninconvenience a few thousand drivers, but I don't see any Park Service \nofficials challenging the legitimacy of this popular race. If this is \nthe precedent we want to set for holding an event in a national park, \nthen let's just call off the hundreds of events already planned this \nyear in all national parks.\n  This controversy is only the latest example of public land managers \nconsistently trying to restrict public access to lands which were set \naside for the public to use and enjoy. It is not an isolated case. I am \nconvinced that this fight in Colorado is only symptomatic of a much \nlarger problem.\n\n  This is not finished. I will continue to fight this outrageous ruling \nuntil\n\n[[Page S4576]]\n\nsomeone listens. Closing a national monument road for a few hours to \naccommodate a simple 23-mile road race should not provoke this kind of \ncontroversy. Yet, the Park Service seems determined to continue the \ncontroversy by ignoring the runners, the local paper and the community. \nWhen will our National Park Service understand that they need to work \nwith the people and not ignore them, especially when we have a \ncommunity that is willing to do its fair share?\n  I yield back the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 44, S. 476, regarding the \nBoys and Girls Clubs of America.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that there be 20 minutes under the \ncontrol of Senator Hatch, 10 minutes under the control of Senator \nBiden, and 10 minutes under control of Senator Leahy, and no amendments \nbe in order to the bill; and, finally, following the expiration or \nyielding back of the time, the bill be read a third time with no other \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 476) to provide for the establishment of not \n     less than 2,500 Boys and Girls Clubs of America facilities by \n     the year 2000.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport S. 476, legislation to further the commitment of the Republican \nCongress to support the expansion of the Boys and Girls Clubs of \nAmerica, one of the best examples of proven youth crime prevention.\n  This is not a partisan initiative, however. I am pleased to have the \ncompany of a bipartisan group of Senators, including Senator Biden, the \nranking Democrat on the Youth Violence Subcommittee, Senator Stevens, \nthe chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Gregg, the \nchairman of the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Subcommittee, \nSenator Kohl, who serves on the Judiciary Committee, and, of course, \nSenator Thurmond, who has served as a distinguished chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Mr. President, the volunteer spirit is alive and well in America. The \nPresidents' summit on voluntarism, held recently in Philadelphia, \nfocused national attention on this aspect of the American people's \ngenerous spirit. Yet, the effects of the legislation we are debating \ntoday will be felt in neighborhoods across the country long after the \nspotlight is gone, and long after the speeches are forgotten.\n  Our legislation addresses our continuing initiative to ensure that, \nwith Federal seed money, the Boys and Girls Clubs of America are able \nto expand to serve an additional 1 million young people through at \nleast 2,500 clubs by the year 2000. The dedication of all of these \nmembers demonstrates our commitment to both authorize and fund this \neffort.\n  Last year, in a bipartisan effort, the Republican Congress enacted \nlegislation I authored to authorize $100 million in Federal seed money \nover 5 years to establish and expand Boys and Girls Clubs in public \nhousing and distressed areas throughout our country. With the help of \nthe Appropriations Committee, we have fully funded this initiative.\n  The bill we are debating today streamlines the application process \nfor these funds, and permits a small amount of the funds to be used to \nestablish a role model speakers' program to encourage and motivate \nyoung people nationwide.\n  It is important to note that what we are providing is seed money for \nthe construction and expansion of clubs to serve our young people. This \nis bricks and mortar money to open clubs. After they are opened, they \nwill operate without any significant Federal funds. In my view, this is \na model for the proper role of the Federal Government in crime \nprevention.\n  The days are over when we can afford huge, never-ending, federally \nrun programs. According to a GAO report last year, over the past 30 \nyears, Congress has created 131 separate Federal programs, administered \nby 16 different agencies, to serve delinquent and at-risk youth. These \nprograms cost $4 billion in fiscal year 1995. Yet we have not made \nsignificant progress in keeping our young people away from crime and \ndrugs.\n  What we can and must afford is short-term, solid support for proven \nprivate sector programs--like the Boys and Girls Clubs--that really do \nmake a difference. Boys and Girls Clubs are among the most effective \nnationwide programs to assist youth to grow into honest, caring, \ninvolved, and law-abiding adults.\n  We know that Boys and Girls Clubs work. Researchers at Columbia \nUniversity found that public housing developments in which there was an \nactive Boys and Girls Club had a 25-percent reduction in the presence \nof crack cocaine, a 22-percent reduction in overall drug activity, and \na 13 percent reduction in juvenile crime. Members of Boys and Girls \nClubs also do better in school, are less attracted to gangs, and feel \nbetter about themselves.\n  There are many distinguished alumni of Boys and Girls Clubs, \nincluding President Clinton and other role models such as actor Denzel \nWashington, basketball superstar Michael Jordan, and San Francisco \n49ers quarterback Steve Young.\n  More important, however, are the uncelebrated success stories--the \nmiracles performed by Boys and Girls Clubs every day. At a Judiciary \nCommittee hearing on March 19, we heard from one of these miracles. \nAmador Guzman, from my State of Utah, told us how he believes the club \nin his neighborhood saved his life, by keeping him from gangs, drugs, \nand violence.\n  The reason Boys and Girls Clubs work--and the reason Congress wants \nto do more for them--is because they are locally run and depend \nprimarily on community involvement for their success.\n  Never have our youth had a greater need for the positive influence of \nBoys and Girls Clubs, and never has the work of the Clubs been more \ncritical. Our young people are being assaulted from all sides with \ndestructive messages. For instance, drug use is on the rise. Recent \nstatistics reconfirm that drugs are ensnaring young people as never \nbefore. Overall drug use by youth ages 12 to 17 rose 105 percent \nbetween 1992 and 1995, and 33 percent between 1994 and 1995. 10.9 \npercent of our young people now use drugs on a monthly basis, and \nmonthly use of marijuana is up 37 percent, monthly use of LSD is up 54 \npercent, and monthly cocaine use by youth is up 166 percent between \n1994 and 1995.\n\n  Our young people are also being assaulted by gangs. By some \nestimates, there are more than 3,875 youth gangs, with 200,000 members, \nin the Nation's 79 largest cities, and the numbers are going up. Even \nmy State of Utah has not been immune from this scourge. In Salt Lake \nCity, since 1992, the number of identified gangs has increased 55 \npercent, from 185 to 288. The number of gang members has increased 146 \npercent, from 1,438 to 3,545; and the number of gang-related crimes has \nincreased a staggering 279 percent, from 1,741 in 1992 to 6,611 in \n1996. Shockingly, 208 of these involved drive-by shootings.\n  Every day, our young people are being bombarded with cultural \nmessages in music, movies, and television that undermine the \ndevelopment of core values of citizenship. Popular culture and the \nmedia glorify drug use, meaningless violence, and sex without \ncommitment.\n  The importance of Boys and Girls Clubs in fighting drug abuse, gang \nrecruitment, and moral poverty cannot be overstated. The Clubs across \nthe country are a bulwark for our young people and deserve all the \nsupport we can give.\n  Indeed, Federal efforts are already paying off. Using over $15 \nmillion in seed money appropriated for fiscal year 1996, the Boys and \nGirls Clubs of America opened 208 new clubs in 1996. These clubs are \nproviding positive places of\n\n[[Page S4577]]\n\nhope, safety, learning and encouragement for about 180,000 more kids \ntoday than in 1995. In my State of Utah, these funds have helped keep \nan additional 6,573 kids away gangs, drugs, and crime.\n  The $20 million appropriated for fiscal year 1997 is expected to \nresult in another 200 clubs and 200,000 more kids involved in clubs. We \nneed now to redouble our efforts. The legislation we introduce today \ndemonstrates our commitment to do that. It will not, and cannot, solve \nour juvenile crime problem. We will be bringing other legislation to \nthe floor that will address, in a comprehensive manner, the urgent \nproblems of juvenile crime. S. 476, is, however, an important first \nstep in that endeavor, aimed at stopping youth crime before it starts.\n  Mr. President, let me just add, this is a terrific bill. It is a \nbipartisan initiative. I want to compliment my colleague from Delaware \nfor the hard work he has done through the years on Boys and Girls \nClubs, and he certainly deserves a lot of the credit for the bill. We \nhave worked together, and we are going to continue to do so. I hope \nthat the Congress will pass this in an expeditious fashion to continue \nto use one of the best ways of stopping crime and helping kids that our \nsociety has ever known.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague for his \nreference. I think it should be made clear that without the chairman's \nstrong and wholehearted support and initiation here, we would not be \nwhere we are. I want to, just in a very brief time, review the bidding \nhere a little bit.\n  Let me remind everybody that this was in the crime bill, the original \nBiden-Hatch crime bill, and ended up having some other iterations \nbefore it was over. But we had provisions in there for prevention.\n  One of the things that happened was on both sides of the aisle, left, \nright, center, was we got into this great debate about whether \nprevention works and whether or not the prevention money in the crime \nbill was to support prisoners in pink tutus dancing in ballet style, \nand all that kind of stuff. We got into big fights about midnight \nbasketball, and all that.\n  I am not suggesting we reengage those fights except to make this \nfollowing point. The reason why in the original bill a while ago I \nspecifically singled out Boys and Girls Clubs--I want to be up front \nabout this--was real simple. It was the one place I knew that we could \nget consensus among Democrats and Republicans, liberals and \nconservatives, because this is prevention that works. And it was my \nview at the time that, if we singled out Boys and Girls Clubs--and we \ndid, which is kind of unusual to do in a crime bill to single out a \nspecific nonprofit to make sure they get money. That is a bit unusual. \nThe reason to do it was, the statistics are overwhelming. Let me give \nyou a few reasons why this works.\n  There was a study done by Columbia University that demonstrated--and \nI am going to be brief--that public housing sites where there are Boys \nClubs and Girls Clubs, compared with public housing sites without these \nclubs, there was a drastic difference. Let me make it clear now, this \nstudy was done, no one disputes--they took public housing sites with \nthe same demographic makeup, same cities, same populations, same racial \ncomposition, put a Boys and Girls Club in the basements of one, not in \nthe other.\n  Here is what the study confirmed. Those public housing projects that \nhad a Boys and Girls Club in the basement, or wherever they were in the \nbuilding, had 13 percent fewer juvenile crimes, 22 percent less drug \nactivity, and 25 percent less crack presence. This is in the crack \nepidemic. Still a big problem. We have other things to worry about, \ntoo. But the bottom line, Mr. President, is it works.\n  I know the Presiding Officer from Montana has done a lot of work with \nkids over the years. He has been involved in things that have to do \nwith everything from 4-H to rodeos to Lord only knows what. I hear all \nthese stories he tells me about Montana and about how these kids are \ninvolved. The truth of the matter is you get a kid involved, you have \nless chance that kid is going to get involved in something bad.\n  My mom has an expression that I am sure every one of our moms have \nsaid in different ways, the expression is: ``Remember, Joey, an idle \nmind is a devil's workshop.'' The bottom line is you give a kid nothing \nto do, he is likely to find trouble. Give a kid nothing to do in an \narea where there is nothing but trouble, he or she becomes part of the \ntrouble. Give a child something to do, an alternative, an escape, a way \nout where there is nothing but trouble, give them a safe haven, and you \nincrease the prospects that they are not going to be in trouble.\n  So that is why we proposed and passed through the Senate in 1996 $20 \nmillion in spending for the first year of a 5-year effort to create \n1,000 new Boys and Girls Clubs. Ultimately we got $11 million in the \nfinal appropriations bill.\n  Senator Hatch and some of our colleagues, Senator Leahy and others \nthat are mentioned, worked together to provide the second year of \nfunding in last year's appropriations bill.\n  If it were not for the fact that Senator Hatch in the majority party, \nthe leader of the committee, jumped in at that point, I believe the \nappropriation would not have been anything. He used his influence and \nhis weight, got this up on the radar screen and continued to save this \nprogram. So the second year of funding in last year's appropriations \nbill came through.\n  Senator Hatch also worked to pass legislation supporting this \nconcept, the whole notion, last year. The bottom line is, we are \nworking together so that we can have a total of 2,500 Boys and Girls \nClubs by the year 2000. This bill does a very important thing. It \nsimplifies--let me emphasize, it simplifies--the application procedure.\n  So, although it does not provide additional funding beyond that \nalready authorized, the simplification is important, letting Boys and \nGirls Clubs go straight to the Justice Department. They do not have to \ngo through their Governors, do not have to go through their State \nlegislature, do not have to go through their city council. They go \nstraight to the Justice Department and seek the funding.\n\n  This is the simple, straightforward approach that I have always \nsupported in the Biden crime bill and why I am so pleased that my \ncolleague, the chairman of the committee, has in fact been so \nsupportive and led on this.\n  Last year's bill provided for consultation with the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development, an unnecessary requirement. I have \nnothing against HUD, but I believe we must get these important \nprevention dollars out to the Boys and Girls Clubs throughout the \ncountry as quickly and as efficiently as possible. And this bill well \nhelp do that.\n  Let me conclude by saying, if we are able to fund 2,500 Boys and \nGirls Clubs, it could not come at a more important moment in our \nhistory from a demographic standpoint. There are 39 million children, \nMr. President, under the age of 10 in the United States of America \ntoday, the largest cadre of young people about to enter the crime-\ncommitting years that we have had since the baby boom of those of us \nborn in the 1940's.\n  It is a big deal, Mr. President. If we through our police efforts, \nthrough our present efforts, hold the percentage of crime committed by \nyoung people to the same percentage it is now, without one one-\nhundredth of 1 percent increase in the amount of crime that is \ncommitted, as a percent of the population, we will in fact still have \nabout an 8 percent increase in violent crime in America. You know why? \nThat is how many more kids there are going to be. We better figure out \nnow before this so-called baby boomlet--that's what the demographers \nare referring to--before this baby boomlet hits those crime-committing \nyears.\n  I can think of nothing--nothing--that the police can do, nothing that \nwe can do, that can solve the problem alone without providing safe \nhavens and alternatives for these children. boys and Girls Clubs are a \nproven--a proven--safe haven. A proven safe haven.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to adopt this legislation. I \nhope this bill is a sign that we will continue to work together to deal \nwith those prevention efforts that work. Another thing all our moms \nsaid to us, ``An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.'' ``An \nounce of prevention.'' This is 2,500 ounces of prevention that will \nprevent tens of thousands of pounds of crime. This is a big deal.\n\n[[Page S4578]]\n\n  I thank my colleague for his support and allowing me to participate \nin this effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague for his kind remarks.\n  I think he has summed it up very, very well. So I will not repeat \nwhat he has said. I agree with him. I have to say this is one of the \nbest programs for youth that we could do. It is the right thing to do, \nand I urge all our colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Like my colleagues, I too support the expansion of Boys \nand Girls Clubs. I would like to ask the author of this legislation, \nits principal sponsor and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nwhether I am correct that this bill should serve to expand the \navailability of Boys and Girls Clubs in rural areas?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is correct. The bill will change the law to permit \nBoys and Girls Clubs to be expanded where needed, and certainly a club \nin a rural area could be needed, and make a significant difference to \nthe young people in that area.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Do we intend for the funds to be used to expand clubs in \ncommunities under 50,000 in population?\n  Mr. HATCH. Absolutely. The original language passed last year \nexpressly included rural areas, but this amendment is intended to make \nour intent clearer that not only can rural areas as well as urban \nqualify as distressed areas, but also that clubs ought be expanded into \nrural areas and smaller communities where needed and, in particular, \ninto rural areas such as those in my friend's State of Vermont, my \nState of Utah, and other States with few Boys and Girls Clubs. I agree \nwith the Senator that our call for 1,000 new clubs by the year 2001 \nshould include attention to expanding opportunities for young people in \nour rural areas and smaller communities.\n  Mr. LEAHY. So the author of the bill intends for there to be \nincreased expansion into rural activities by the Boys and Girls Clubs \neven beyond the almost 20 percent expended in the first year in rural \nareas?\n  Mr. HATCH. Absolutely. I am as concerned about the threat of drugs \nand gangs coming into our rural communities as is the Senator from \nVermont, and I believe strongly that the Boys and Girls Clubs we seek \nto establish are a big part of the answer to these threats.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator for clarifying this point. With that \nclarification, I am prepared to support this bill.\n  I join in supporting S. 476 to provide authority to expand Boys and \nGirls Clubs across the country, including both urban and rural areas. \nWhen we passed similar legislation last year, we did it as part of a \nlegislative package that included the National Information \nInfrastructure Protection Act that Senator Kyl and I authored and that \nI helped push through during the closing days of the last Congress.\n  Most important to me, the revised language should serve to expand the \navailability of Boys and Girls Clubs in rural areas. The original \nlanguage was more restrictive, requiring the grants to be used only for \nthe purpose of establishing Boys and Girls Clubs in public housing \nprojects and other distressed areas. I have worked with the Boys and \nGirls and know that they understand that rural areas as well as urban \ncan qualify as distressed areas.\n  Nonetheless, the new language is more expansive and will give girls \nand boys in rural areas greater opportunities to share in Boys and \nGirls Clubs and their programs. The revised statute will authorize \ngrants for establishing and extending facilities where needed. \nParticular emphasis continues to be given to housing projects, where \nBoys and Girls Clubs have proven effective in preventing youth crime, \nand to distressed areas, rural or urban. But the where needed language \nshould help make expansion into rural areas a greater priority.\n  Likewise, the removal of the language concerning contracts with HUD \nshould streamline the expansion process and help make clear that such \nexpansions are not limited to public housing projects.\n  The changes made to that program by this bill also permit up to five \npercent of the grant funds to be used to establish a role model \nspeakers' program. Anyone who has seen the Boys and Girls Clubs of \nAmerica commercial with Denzel Washington and his coach will know the \nkinds of outstanding role models that we are seeking to promote to \nencourage and motivate young people to be involved, productive \ncitizens.\n  I have seen the outstanding results at the Boys and Girls Club in \nBurlington, VT, under the direction of Bob Robinson. The role models \nthey provide include the outstanding instructors and volunteers who \nwork in the club's many programs. I have also witnessed the outstanding \nresults of the Kids `N Kops Program at the University of Vermont with \nthe cooperation of local law enforcement.\n  Expansions are proceeding and over 200 new clubs serving 180,000 \nyouth were opened as a result of last year's legislation. I know that \nthe Burlington Boys and Girls club received $100,000 to help enhance \nthat Club's outreach efforts. I was glad to receive a letter from the \nBoys and Girls Clubs of America indicating that they are in the \nplanning stages for the development of a new club in Rutland and \nresearching the feasibility of a club in Essex Junction, as well. I \nwould hope that with the continuation of this initiative they will look \nfor opportunities to serve young people in St. Albans, Brattleboro, St. \nJohnsbury, Montpelier, and other Vermont locations, as well. I would be \ndelighted for a sizeable portion of the 1 million additional young \npeople who we hope will be served by the end of this century to come \nfrom the 145,000 young people in Vermont and those in other rural \nareas.\n  In supporting this bill, I encourage the Boys and Girls Clubs as one \nexample of a successful youth-oriented program that can help make a \ndifference in young people's lives and prevent crime and delinquency. I \nalso support the work of others who are effective with young people, \nincluding our outstanding 4-H programs. In working for the passage of \nthis measure I have received assurances that other members will join \nwith me in supporting these other fine programs, as well.\n  It is nice to see Republican Members support juvenile crime \nprevention programs. Only a short time ago Republicans tried to stop \npassage of the President's 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law \nEnforcement Act and contended that crime prevention programs were \n``pork'' or a waste of funds.\n  In the juvenile crime bill I sponsored this year, S. 15, we include a \nnumber of initiatives to prevent juvenile crime and youth drug abuse. I \nhope that we can expect bipartisan support for those juvenile crime \nprevention provisions as we move forward in this Congress so that we \ncan enact a comprehensive approach to the problem of youth crime. This \nmeasure should not become an excuse for anyone not to join with us to \nto bolster comprehensive drug education and prevention for all \nelementary and high school students. We should proceed to help create \nafter school safe havens where children are protected from drugs, \ngangs, and crime with activities including drug prevention education, \nacademic tutoring, mentoring, and abstinence training. This bill is a \nstep but should not be the end of our efforts to support programs that \nhelp prevent juvenile delinquency, crime, and drug abuse.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a letter I just received from \nthe Boys and Girls Clubs of America be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              Boys and Girls Clubs\n\n\n                                                   of America,\n\n                                       Rockville, MD, May 8, 1997.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: Last week when the Judiciary Committee \n     discussed S. 476 I heard your concerns, and if possible, I \n     would like to clarify what we are trying to do with this Bill \n     and what we have done with previous appropriations.\n       Our goal within the state of Vermont is to strengthen the \n     youth development services currently being provided. In \n     addition, we are working to increase both the number of local \n     Boys & Girls Club facilities and youth being served \n     throughout the state.\n       Just this past year, we passed $100,000 through to the Boys \n     & Girls Clubs of Burlington, VT, to enhance the Club's \n     outreach efforts. Today, we are in the planning stages for \n     the development of a Boys & Girls Club in Rutland, VT, and \n     are researching the feasibility of a Club in Essex Junction, \n     VT. I\n\n[[Page S4579]]\n\n     give you every assurance that these efforts will remain a \n     priority.\n       Nationally, with Boys & Girls Clubs of America's 1996 \n     appropriation, we opened 208 Boys & Girls Clubs and served \n     180,000 new boys and girls. All told, Boys & Girls Clubs now \n     serve some 2.6 million young people throughout America, \n     including many in rural and semi-rural communities. Our \n     planned growth for 1997, with the assistance of our current \n     appropriation, will continue at this same pace.\n       Upon passage and successful implementation of S. 476, we \n     plan on serving 1,000,000 new boys and girls throughout the \n     United States. Many of the children in Vermont who are not \n     currently being served--will be.\n       Senator Leahy, you have been a friend to Boys & Girls Clubs \n     and to many youth organizations over the years. We hope that \n     you can now help us pass S. 476 and help us reach 1,000,000 \n     new boys and girls.\n       Thank you and we look forward to working with you on this \n     and other issues that help America's children and families.\n           Sincerely,\n     Robbie Callaway,\n       Senior Vice President.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I rise in strong support of S. 476, \nthe Boys and Girls Clubs of America Act of 1997, which I have \ncosponsored. This important legislation will give seed money to build \n1,000 additional Boys and Girls Clubs across America, with special \nemphasis on establishing clubs in public housing projects and \ndistressed areas.\n  In Alaska, and across the Nation, kids are reaping the benefits of \nBoys and Girls Clubs. They are safe places where kids can go after \nschool to learn and have fun. Boys and Girls Clubs are places where \nthey find role models, and where they can explore their own talents and \nskills. In 1995 there were 8,000 Alaskans participating in Boys and \nGirls Clubs; today more than 14,000 young Alaskans are Boys and Girls \nClub members. In fact many of my staff are alumni of these clubs in \nAlaska.\n  This seed money will insure that more than 1 million more young \nAmericans will have a safe place to grow and learn by the year 2000. \nThis is a model program supplying the construction cost for the clubs \nand giving youths in depressed communities a chance to succeed. Studies \nby Columbia University have shown that in areas of public housing where \nthere are Boys and Girls Clubs Juvenile crime has dropped 13 percent.\n  I thank Senator Hatch and the other cosponsors of this important \nlegislation for their hard work and dedication. I look forward to \nseeing more Boys and Girls Clubs across our great Nation.\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to \nclarify a statement I made last week with respect to the upcoming \nbattle to protect and extend the ethanol tax incentives.\n  I want to make clear that I do not think there is any room to \ncompromise on the existing tax incentives prior to the year 2000. Many \nethanol plants have made investments based on the expectation that \nthose incentives will be available in their current form until 2000. \nCongress should not change those incentives or jeopardize in any way \nthose existing plant investments.\n  Having said that, I appreciate that some will argue that the ethanol \nincentives should be allowed to expire in 2000. My response to them is \nthat the Nation will continue to benefit in some very significant ways \nin the 21st century from new entrants into the industry and expanded \nuse of clean burning ethanol and its ether. By encouraging billions of \ndollars of investment in commercial scale plants, the tax credits have \npromoted major technology advances and many more improvements are on \nthe brink of commercialization. These benefits justify some level of \ncontinuing support. On the other hand, to my fellow industry \nsupporters, I suggest that we need to recognize that the tax incentives \nare nearly 20 years old and should be reviewed for possible \nconstructive changes.\n  In extending the incentives beyond 2000, we should be willing to take \na critical look at the incentives to determine if they should be \nmodified to better achieve the objectives of the ethanol industry and \nthe country. During this debate, my first priority will be to ensure \nthe continued growth and development of small ethanol plants that have \nbeen responsible for diversification of the ethanol industry and rural \neconomic development. Those plants represent the future for economic \ngrowth in rural America and will help keep the benefits of value-added \nagricultural processing in the rural communities from which those \nproducts originate.\n  Ethanol and its ether, ETBE, have never played as large a role as I \nbelieve they can and should play in cleaning up America's air or \nreducing its dependence on foreign energy through the reformulated \ngasoline program. We\n\n[[Page S4580]]\n\nneed to explore how the tax incentives can be restructured to make ETBE \nmore price-competitive with MTBE, so that ethanol can play a greater \nrole in the reformulated gasoline market.\n  Finally, Congress should be willing to provide sufficient \nencouragement to the rest of the ethanol industry to allow it to \ncontinue converting corn and other grains into high grade liquid fuel \nand proteins, generating much needed rural employment and investment, \nand improving air quality. This can be done while still limiting our \ntax expenditures and contributing to a balanced Federal budget.\n  Since its inception in the late 1970's, the domestic ethanol industry \nhas helped reduce our dependence on foreign oil, create rural jobs and \ngreater farm income, and provide consumers with a choice of oxygenated \nfuels. That is a track record that makes sense for America, and that \nshould neither be discounted nor abandoned. It is my hope that in the \nnear future a constructive dialog can begin in Congress on how to \nextend the tax incentives in a fiscally prudent and economically \neffective manner beyond the year 2000. I am committed to that goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/15/senate-section/article/S4579-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4580-S4581]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DISTRICT COURT BACKLOG AND JUDICIAL VACANCIES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for the past several months I have spoken \nabout the crisis being created by the almost 100 vacancies that are \nbeing perpetuated on the Federal courts around the country and the \nfailure of the Senate to carry out its constitutional responsibilities \nto advise and consent to judicial confirmations.\n  Today, the Washington Post, in an excellent article written by Sue \nAnne Pressley, focused on the consequences of this judicial crisis in \none district court in Texas, the southern district of Texas. The \narticle reports on the growing drug and immigration cases that are \ninundating this district court and the lack of Federal judges needed to \nadminister justice in these cases.\n  This district has two vacancies, one open since December 1, 1990, and \nthe President has nominated Hilda Tagle to fill this judicial emergency \nvacancy. Ms. Tagle's nomination was first received by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee on August 10, 1995, but she has yet to have a \nhearing before the committee.\n  This district in Texas is only one example of crisis that affects the \nentire country. We could find similar backlog problems in district \ncourts in California, Florida, and other States that are swamped with \nrising cases and unfilled judicial vacancies. Yesterday, I met with \nmembers of the Federal Judges Association who are very concerned about \nthe growing backlogs and rising caseloads in Federal courts across the \nNation.\n  I want to commend Senators Boxer, Sarbanes, and Kennedy for joining \nme yesterday on the Senate floor to speak out against the Senate's \ncurrent stall on confirming Federal judges. I also want to commend \nSenator Kohl for his similar remarks today.\n  Mr. President, confirming Federal judges should not be a partisan \nissue. The administration of justice is not a political issue. Working \ntogether, the Senate should do our constitutionally mandated job and \nproceed to confirm the judges we need for the Federal system.\n  I ask unanimous consent that today's Washington Post article titled \n``Cases Pile Up As Judgeships Remain Vacant'' be printed in the Record \nimmediately after my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 15, 1997]\n\n               Cases Pile Up As Judgeships Remain Vacant\n\n                         (By Sue Anne Pressley)\n\n       Laredo, Tex.--The drug and illegal immigrant cases keep \n     coming. No sooner does Chief U.S. District Judge George Kazen \n     clear one case than a stack of new cases piles up. He takes \n     work home at night, on weekends.\n       ``It's like a tidal wave,'' Kazen said recently. ``As soon \n     as I finish 25 cases per month, the next 25 are on top of me \n     and then you've got the sentence reports you did 2 months \n     before. There is no stop, no break at all, year in and year \n     out, here they come.\n       ``We've already got more than we can say grace over down \n     here,'' he said.\n       This is what happens to a federal judge on the southern \n     border of the United States when Washington cracks down on \n     illegal immigration and drug smuggling. It is a situation \n     much aggravated by the fact that the Senate in Washington has \n     left another federal judgeship in this district vacant for 2 \n     years, one of 72 vacancies on federal district courts around \n     the country.\n       As Border Patrol officers and other federal agents swarm, \n     this southernmost region of Texas along the Mexican border in \n     ever-increasing numbers, Judge Kazen's docket has grown and \n     grown. He has suggested, so far unsuccessfully, that a \n     judgeship in Houston be re-assigned to the Rio Grande Valley \n     to help cope.\n       In Washington, where the laws and policies were adopted \n     that has made Kazen's life so difficult, the Senate has made \n     confirmation of federal judges a tedious process, often \n     fraught with partisan politics. In addition to the 72 federal \n     district court vacancies (the trial level), there are 25 \n     circuit court vacancies (the appellate level) and two vacant \n     international trade court judgeships across the country, \n     leaving unfilled 99 positions, or 11 percent of the federal \n     judiciary. Twenty-six nominations from President Clinton are \n     pending, according to Jeanne Lopatto, spokeswoman for the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee, which considers nominations for \n     recommendation to the full Senate for confirmation.\n\n\n on texas border, cases won't wait for wrangling on judicial vacancies\n\n       Of those 99 vacancies, 24 qualify as judicial emergencies, \n     meaning the positions have been vacant more than 18 months, \n     according to David Sellers of the administrative Office of \n     the U.S. Courts. Two of the emergencies exist in Texas, \n     including the one in Kazen's southern district.\n       Lopatto said the thorough investigation of each nominee is \n     a time-consuming process. But political observers say \n     Republicans, who run the Senate, are in no hurry to approve \n     candidates submitted by a Democratic president. The pinch is \n     particularly painful here in border towns. The nominee for \n     Brownsville, in Kazan's district, has been awaiting approval \n     since 1995. Here in Laredo, Kazen's criminal docket has \n     increased more than 20 percent over last year.\n       ``We have a docket,'' he said, ``that can be tripled \n     probably at the drop of a hat. . . . The Border Patrol \n     people, the Customs people at the [international] bridges \n     will tell you, they don't catch a tenth of who is going \n     through. The more checkpoints you man, the more troops you \n     have at the bridges, will necessarily mean more stops and \n     more busts.''\n       And many more arrests are expected, the result of an \n     unprecedented focus on policing the U.S.-Mexican border. \n     Earlier this year, Clinton unveiled a $367 million program \n     for the Southwest for fiscal 1998, beginning Oct. 1, that \n     includes hiring 500 new Border Patrol agents, 277 inspectors \n     for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, 96 Drug \n     Enforcement Administration agents and 70 FBI agents.\n       In Kazen's territory, the number of Border Patrol agents \n     already has swollen dramatically, from 347 officers assigned \n     to the Laredo area in fiscal 1993 to 411 officers in \n     fiscal 1996. More tellingly, in 1993, agents in the Laredo \n     sector arrested more than 82,000 people on cocaine, \n     marijuana and illegal immigration charges. By 1996, \n     arrests had soared to nearly 132,000, according to data \n     supplied by the INS.\n       All of which is keeping Kazen and the other judges here \n     hopping. ``I don't know what the answer is,'' said U.S. \n     District Judge John Rainey, who has been acting as ``a \n     circuit rider'' as he tries to help Kazen out in Laredo from \n     his post in Victoria, Tex. ``I certainly don't see it easing \n     up anytime soon. There still seems to be such a demand for \n     drugs in this country, and that's what causes people to bring \n     them in. Until society changes, we won't see any changes down \n     here.''\n       In a letter to Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) in February, \n     Kazen outlined the need for a new judge in the Laredo or \n     McAllen division, rather than in Houston, where a vacancy was \n     recently created when then-Chief Judge Norman Black assumed \n     senior status. ``The `border' divisions of our court--\n     Brownsville, McAllen and Laredo--have long borne the burden \n     of one of the heaviest criminal dockets in the country, and \n     the processing of criminal cases involves special pressures, \n     including those generated by the Speedy Trial Act,'' he \n     wrote.\n       On a recent typical day, Kazen said, he sentenced six \n     people on drug charges and listened to an immigration case. \n     His cases tend to involve marijuana more often than cocaine, \n     he said.\n       ``The border is a transshipment area,'' he said. ``The fact \n     is, a huge amount of contraband somehow crosses the Texas-\n     Mexican border, people walking through where the river is \n     low, and there are hundreds and hundreds of miles of \n     unpatrolled ranchland.\n       ``In some cases,'' Kazen continued, ``we're seeing a \n     difference in the kind of defendant. We're almost never \n     seeing the big shots--we're seeing the soldiers. Once in a \n     while, we'll see a little bigger fish, but we're dealing with \n     very, very smart people. We see some mom-and-pop stuff, too. \n     There was a guy who came before me who had been in the Army \n     umpteen years, and he needed the money, he was going \n     bankrupt, so he did this 600-pound marijuana deal. he said he \n     stood to pick up $50,000, and now he's facing five to 40 \n     years.\n       ``We see kids 18 and 19 years old,'' Kazen said. ``We see \n     pregnant women. We see disabled people in wheelchairs. This \n     is very, very tempting stuff.''\n\n[[Page S4581]]\n\n       In Washington, the argument over court vacancies continues. \n     On April 30, Attorney General Janet Reno told the Judiciary \n     Committee, ``Chief judges are calling my staff to report the \n     prospect of canceling court sittings and suspending civil \n     calendars for lack of judges, and to ask when they can expect \n     help. This committee must act now to send this desperately \n     needed help.''\n       In remarks yesterday to the Federal Judges Association \n     meeting in Washington, Reno warned that ``the number [of \n     vacancies] is growing.''\n       ``As you are no doubt aware,'' Reno told the judges, ``the \n     level of contentiousness on the issue of filling judicial \n     vacancies has unfortunately increased in recent times.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/15/senate-section/article/S4580-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4581]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          FIELD HEARING ON INTRASTATE AIR SERVICE IN COLORADO\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I want to call my colleagues' \nattention to an important issue facing the Western Slope of my home \nState of Colorado; namely, the lack of quality and reliable air \nservice.\n  I have long been concerned about this problem facing the residents \nand the business community in western Colorado. I have received \nhundreds of complaints from constituents up and down the Western Slope \nand have experienced many of these problems myself. For example, on \nnumerous occasions I have found myself waiting for a delayed flight for \nseveral hours only to find out later on that the flight had been \ncanceled. On one occasion, the pilot showed up only to announce that he \nwas not certified to fly the plane.\n  To address this issue, I held a field hearing on Wednesday, April 2, \nin Grand Junction, CO, to hear testimony firsthand from citizens and \nrepresentatives of the business community. Witnesses at the hearing \nincluded representatives from the airlines industry, consumers as well \nas the business community.\n  The testimony presented reflected the deep concern among business \nleaders and consumers in western Colorado about the lack of adequate \nair service. Many of the witnesses testified to the lack of competition \nin air service in western Colorado after deregulation. They further \nstressed that their concerns center around late arrivals, canceled \nflights, discontinuation of service, over booked flights, inadequate \naircraft that cannot handle passenger baggage, inadequate safety \nprocedures, inconvenient schedules and costs and high turnover of \npilots.\n  Because of the importance of this testimony, I wrote to the acting \nadministrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, Mr. Barry \nValentine, on April 18, requesting the FAA's review of this material \nand requested a report from the FAA on ways in which air service can be \nimproved on the Western Slope and how the witnesses' concerns can be \naddressed. I also provided a complete set of this testimony to the \nSenate Aviation Subcommittee, so it can be used in future subcommittee \nwork on commuter air service.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues, I ask unanimous consent that a copy \nof the witness list be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER, without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I am more concerned now than ever about the quality of \nair service in Colorado, and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on improving air service in this important region of our \ncountry.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                list of witnesses present at the hearing\n\n       Mr. Greg Walcher, President of Club 20.\n       Mr. Benard Buescher, Colorado Transportation Commissioner.\n       Mr. John Frew, President and CEO of Colorado Ski Country \n     U.S.A.\n       Mr. Jamie Hamilton, Vice President of the Grand Junction \n     Chamber of Commerce.\n       Mr. J.J.

Mr. President, I rise today because a bill is being \nintroduced by Senators Roth, Moynihan, and members of the Finance \nCommittee which seeks to amend trade laws and provisions referring to \n``Most Favored Nation'' [MFN] trading status. They seek to rename MFN, \n``Normal Trade Relations.''\n  I am not joining my Finance Committee colleagues on this bill today. \nBut I would gladly support this initiative once the United States has \nan effective China policy.\n  Mr. President, the reason we annually consider China's trade, human \nrights, and national security behavior during the MFN renewal debate is \nbecause we do not have an acceptable alternative. The goal, therefore, \nof this year's debate should not be to simply extend or revoke MFN for \nthe PRC. I suggest, instead, that we endeavor to address the \nshortcomings of our China policy so that we do not need the annual MFN \nissue to debate China.\n  Mr. President, we need a real China policy to replace the MFN \nrevocation threat, not a name change. If the issue were just about the \nname, Americans would not voice such strong opposition to trading with \nChina as if it were a normal country. The fact is, Mr. President, China \nis not like other trading nations. It is perhaps the worst violator of \nhuman rights and weapons nonproliferation standards in the world. The \nPRC trades unfairly, persecutes people of faith, imprisons and tortures \ndemocrats, proliferates weapons technology, sells arms to street gangs \nin the United States, and disbands democratic institutions in Hong \nKong. The PRC does this while receiving international aid, American \ntechnology--much with military applications, and free access to the \nAmerican market. This so-called engagement policy seems hollow and \ndangerous. Merely changing the name of MFN will not change this \nreality.\n  Mr. President, I traveled to Hong Kong and China in late March this \nyear with my colleague and fellow co-chair of the Senate's Hong Kong \ncaucus, Senator Lieberman of Connecticut.\n\n  I returned from this mission more concerned about Hong Kong than when \nI departed. The Chinese leadership tried to put to rest my concerns for \nHong Kong by reassuring me that democracy would be returned to Hong \nKong once the people received proper civic education. This distrust of \npeople is apparent in China's actions toward Hong Kong's civil and \npolitical freedoms.\n  It also caused me to renew my concern for our China policy. My \nposition on this bill, and on the MFN debate in general, arises from my \ndesire for good relations with China. I know this is in the best \ninterest of America, China, and the world.\n  There are a tremendous number of issues which Americans wish to raise \nwith China. In 1997, these include Hong Kong reversion, weapons \nproliferation, religious persecution, PRC-Taiwan relations, human \nrights, involvement in U.S. elections, and our unequal trade \nrelationship.\n\n[[Page S4582]]\n\n  Many people advise, however, that opposing MFN represents a hollow--\nessentially meaningless--threat. And yet, without a responsible \nalternative, Members of Congress must choose between voting to revoke \nMFN or taking no action. Neither option is acceptable. Neither choice \nis in our Nation's best interest.\n  So that our children and the children of China do not inherit an \nadversarial relationship, we must do two things in 1997. First, we must \nengage in a domestic debate on China; we must get beyond hollow \nengagement and hollow threats. Second, we must ensure our policy \ndemonstrates to China that their actions have consequences: That they \nare a member of the world community and actions which violate \nagreements and norms are not merely internal matters.\n  As many people know, I had discussed an idea to extend the current \nMFN status for the PRC for an additional 3 months in 1997. In offering \nthis idea, I sought to accomplish the above two goals. It is too late \nfor the House to take action on the 3-month extension as I had proposed \nit, but it is not too late for us to unite behind a call for action.\n  Mr. President, I agree with my distinguished Finance Committee \ncolleagues who believe we must get beyond the annual MFN revocation \nthreat. But the way to do this is not to change the name of MFN; we \nmust address the real problem. We must develop new instruments which \naddress our interests with China.\n  I fear, Mr. President, that the name change does not accomplish this \nmost important goal; in fact, to the extent that it decreases our \nresolve to discuss China, this bill jeopardizes our national interests. \nIt is for this reason that I do not join my colleagues today in \noffering this name-change legislation.\n  Instead, I invite the Congress and the President to join me in making \nthe best use of this year's debate. We must utilize this time to \ndevelop and advance our China policy, not merely put it off for another \nyear.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/15/senate-section/article/S4581-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4582-S4586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION BAN ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, we have heard a lot of talk over the \npast several days about the issue of partial-birth abortion, about \nlate-term abortion, about the need to have an option available should a \npregnancy go awry, and in describing when a pregnancy goes awry they \nhave described the need to have a health exception in cases where there \nis a fetal abnormality, where a baby is developing in the womb that is \nnot perfect.\n  Now we have heard all of the horrible accounts of Dr. McMahon \nperforming partial-birth abortions on children because they had cleft \npalates or other very minor--Down's syndrome, and other minor, or not \nlife-threatening maladies. That, in my mind, is an indefensible defense \nfor a health exception.\n  I found it absolutely astonishing that Members would have gotten up \nyesterday and talked about the need to have partial-birth abortion as \nan option to dispose of children who were developing in the womb with a \ndefect. They did so at the same time, the same day, we passed IDEA, \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act, the same day that people \npassionately got up on the floor and argued for the rights of the \ndisabled to be educated, to maximize their human potential, and some 30 \nSenators who voted for that voted today to wipe out the ban on partial-\nbirth abortion.\n  Now, I find that absolutely incongruous. How can you fight for the \nrights of the disabled to be educated? How can you fight for the rights \nof the disabled under the Americans With Disabilities Act, which all of \nthose Members, to my knowledge, those that were here, supported, back \nin 1990, I believe it was. How can you support that stand and say you \ncare about the disabled, that you want to maximize their potential, \nthat you want to treat them with dignity and give them civil rights, \nwhen you will not give them the most basic of civil rights, the right \nto live in the first place?\n  If you survive the womb, if you survive Roe versus Wade, which allows \nyou to be destroyed because you are not perfect--yes, Roe versus Wade, \nDoe versus Bolton, allow you to be destroyed because you are not \nperfect. I know that may click some sort of memory of people who \nremember what happened across the Atlantic some 50 and 60 years ago, \nthat just because you were not perfect, you were not deserving to live.\n  We have Members, standing here, arguing that we need to be able to \nhave the option of killing a little baby because it is not perfect. \nThey say, oh, that history that happened 50, 60 years ago, could never \nrepeat itself. It cannot happen. Oh, how history tends to repeat \nitself, even here on the Senate floor.\n  I find it absolutely amazing that people are not shocked by their own \nwords, that they do not understand, as the Bible says, that a house \ndivided against itself, that you cannot stand up on one side and argue \nfor rights of the disabled at the same time saying they do not even \nhave the right to be born in the first place, they are not going to be \nprotected by our Constitution, they are not going to be protected by \nour laws.\n  I will share with you tonight some stories, stories of people with \ndisabilities, diagnosed in the womb. I will share with you some happy \nstories, and I will share with you some sad stories. But even in the \nsad stories you will find a silver lining, a lining that would not be \nthere if it were not for someone who cared enough to treat their child \nwith dignity and respect, cared enough to love them as fully as they \nloved any one of their other children.\n  You heard me talk earlier today, yesterday, about Donna Joy Watts. \nOne of the cases cited over and over again by people who want to create \na health exception in the partial-birth abortion bill is that there are \ntimes when a baby's head has excess fluid, cerebral spinal fluid, and \nit is called hydroencephaly, water on the brain. Donna Joy Watts was \none of the babies that was diagnosed with hydroencephaly, and another \nmalady where the brain was actually growing outside of the skull.\n  The doctors diagnosed her condition as fatal and told her mother and \nfather they would have to abort her, and her mother and father said, \n``At 7\\1/2\\ months we are not going to abort our child. Why not give \nher a chance to live?'' They said, ``no, no, we will not give her a \nchance to live because she will not live. It is best for you. Trust me, \nyou will feel a lot less pain. You need to just get on with it.'' These \nwere obstetricians, genetics counselors. She had to go four places--\nfour places--to get someone who would deliver her baby. Any of the four \nwould have aborted her baby, but only one of the four would have \ndelivered her baby.\n  We are reaching the point in this country where it is almost easier \nto find an abortion than it is to find a doctor to deliver a child that \nwill have complications. The fear of lawsuit, the fear of \ncomplications, and the stress associated with it are just creating the \nimpetus to do abortions. Nobody can sue you for doing abortions. You \nsign a consent form. You give up your rights. You say, ``I won't sue. \nAs long as you kill my child, I will not sue.'' So they don't get sued. \nNo liability there. But if you work with the mother to deliver the \nchild, then if mom believes you didn't tell her everything you should \nhave, you get hit with a wrongful birth suit. In other words, ``My \nchild is better off dead than alive'' kind of suit.\n\n  What kind of society allows that? What kind of society would say we \nput in legal doctrine a suit that says my child is better off dead than \nalive? What a misunderstanding of life. Every child is perfect in the \neyes of God; I hope in the eyes of the mother, but we have some to go \nthat way. We have lots of people in the medical profession who \ncertainly do not see it that way, and counsel for abortion. In fact, at \nevery single turn, Donny and Lori Watts were hit with ``abort, abort, \nabort. Save yourself the trouble.'' She said no and he said no.\n  They finally delivered her. This is what she looked like. It is a \nlittle\n\n[[Page S4583]]\n\nDonna Joy, named after her daddy, Donna Joy. Oh, her little head is not \nperfect, and she had problems, serious problems. But she was born \nalive.\n  For 3 days Lori Watts told me the medical professional at the \nhospital referred to her little baby, who weighed about 7 pounds, as a \n``fetus.'' For 3 days after her birth, a ``fetus.'' For 3 days they \nwouldn't feed this baby because it was going to die. For 3 days they \nwouldn't drain the water from her head and put a shunt in it because \nshe was going to die. And Donna Joy just wouldn't die.\n  So Lori and Donny decided that they were going to threaten. Lori said \nin the paper that she would threaten the doctors if they didn't do \nsomething. So finally they did.\n  And through a struggle, which I detailed yesterday, which I will not \ntoday, but through an incredible struggle of heroism her mom and her \ndad fed her. She had 30 percent of her brain.\n  You often hear so much about you only use a small percentage of your \nbrain. And if there is one place in the body we don't understand, we \ndon't understand the brain very well. We don't understand how it really \nworks and how it compensates for problems, whether it be by stroke or \nthings like this. But Donna Joy had 30 percent of her brain. She had a \ndeformed medulla oblongata which connects the brain to the spinal cord. \nShe had no medulla oblongata. Her left and right side of the brain were \nnot connected. They didn't talk to each other. She fought and she \nfought and she fought through incredible difficulties.\n  Today, this is little Donna Joy Watts, who yesterday and today was in \nmy office playing, talking to reporters, writing me notes, playing with \nmy children, coloring books, acting like a little girl, walks with a \nlittle bit of a limp. She is a little bit behind for her age. But after \neight brain operations and with 30 percent of her brain, she is an \namazing story.\n  Her parents were told to have a partial-birth abortion because her \nhead was so large. They wanted to put those scissors in the base of \nthis little girl's skull and kill her. And Lori and Donny said no. They \ncould have taken the easy way out.\n  I can tell you. When Lori told me of the times when she was a little \nbaby of having to feed her, which took an hour and a half because she \ndidn't have the muscles to hold the food in--it would just come right \nback up, she had no muscular control as a baby. So the food would come \nright back up. They thought she would die of malnutrition until Lori \nthought it out. She would put this paste, which was real heavy that \nwould stay in her stomach, but it was drop by drop in the back of her \nmouth. It took an hour and a half to feed her. She would take an hour-\nand-a-half break, and another hour and a half to feed her, 24 hours a \nday, setting the alarm in the middle of the night, getting up to feed \nher child so the child would not die of malnutrition.\n  It is hard. But little Donna Joy Watts is one of the great stories \nthat ennobles all of us. Had Lori and Donny decided to kill, to let \nlittle Donna Joy die by aborting her, our society would be diminished. \nThe inspiration that this little girl and her family has provided \nennobles us all, calls us to a greater sense of commitment and love for \nour children and those who are not so fortunate to be perfect.\n  Another story: This is a story I just got the other day. It is a \nletter written to me by Sandra and Joseph Mallon from Upper Darby, PA. \nI will read the story as she writes it to me.\n\n       Dear Senator Santorum: My name is Sandra Mallon. I live in \n     Upper Darby, PA with my husband, Joe, and our 5 month old \n     daughter, Kathleen. Both Joe and I work outside the home--but \n     Kathleen is the most important thing in our lives. I am \n     writing in reference to the H.R. 872 and S. 5 bill currently \n     being considered. This issue is very near to my heart; and I \n     feel this is a crisis issue that I must discuss.\n       My daughter was diagnosed with hydrocephalus, an abnormal \n     accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid around the brain, at 23 \n     weeks gestation.\n\n  You may have heard the debate earlier about viability. At 22 weeks' \ngestation, a baby can survive. About 24 or 25 percent of babies survive \noutside the womb.\n\n       At that time we were not given a positive outlook for our \n     little girl. We were told first to abort--but that was out of \n     the question. Then we were told the best case would be to \n     expect a shunt operation and retardation; worse case would be \n     death before or shortly after delivery. We decided to give \n     our child every chance we could. We went to many doctors for \n     the next four months--the news got a little better as the \n     pregnancy went on.\n       Kathleen was born on December 6, 1996--and she is our \n     miracle baby. Though she has hydrocephalus, she is showing no \n     symptoms. One month ago she underwent an operation to place a \n     shunt, a tube which helps the fluid to pass through the brain \n     in a safe and effective way. This is the most widely used \n     treatment for hydrocephalus, and even so, most patients have \n     to have their shunt revised (replaced) several times in their \n     lifetimes. The alternative in most cases is death.\n       Joe and I have many hopes and dreams for Kathleen--but \n     mostly we want her to be a healthy, happy child. We want her \n     to be given every chance in life to experience her world. \n     Right now I want her to be able to play, jump, swim and maybe \n     even ride horses. Unlike most families these every day \n     activities could cause Kathleen to need a shunt revision. \n     This scares me to death!! Right now there is technology and \n     materials to help Kathleen should there be a reason. But if \n     these bills do not pass my child could be in for pain and \n     suffering which would slowly and painfully kill her. Don't \n     let this happen to my Kathleen Marie. Silicone is the only \n     material available which the body does not see or reject to \n     make these lifesaving shunts.\n       I can't stress how important this issue is to me and my \n     family. Besides our immediate need to know Kathleen can \n     continue to grow up as any other child. But the silicone is \n     also used in many other biomedical devices (i.e. ear tubes, \n     and pacemakers). So the S5 in the Senate and HR872 in the \n     House would seek to control my access to raw material for \n     shunts. I understand there are other issues wrapped up in the \n     bill, and I believe personally that Product Liability and \n     Tort Reform are important measures. If S5 and HR872 are not \n     passed, it is a certain death sentence for Kathleen and every \n     other person affected by hydrocephalus.\n       I ask you to look at the picture of Kathleen. Tell me that \n     you will help her. Don't wait too long Senator, people will \n     die. I am looking forward to your response to this issue of \n     life and death importance to me and my family.\n\n  These are two wonderful stories of children who would not be termed \n``viable,'' could be aborted late-term because it was a medical \ncomplication, and these children were deformed.\n  This is the kind of health exception that many want to allow so we \ncan kill children just like this. But we know there is another way, a \nway suggested by even people who perform abortions like the doctor at \nthe Medical College of Pennsylvania who says that after 23 weeks, the \nsecond or third trimester, it is not necessary to kill a baby. It may \nbe necessary to separate the mother from the child. But it is never \nnecessary to kill a baby, even one that has an abnormality.\n  In fact, doctors have told me they are not aware of any abnormality \nin and of itself that is a threat to the woman's health or life that \ncannot be remedied by a separation--not an abortion, not the deliberate \nkilling of the baby, but by separation. In fact, most abnormalities \ndon't require separation. You can deliver later in term, at term.\n  Not all stories end as happily. I want to share some stories with you \nof people that went through very tough decisions, and some that, \nfrankly, didn't have very tough decisions but went through heartaches \nwhen it came to a child who had a problem in the womb.\n  Let me first share the story of Jeannie French. Jeannie has been very \noutspoken. I shared her story last year, but it bears repeating.\n\n       My name is Jeannie Wallace French. I am a 34 year old \n     healthcare professional who holds a masters degree in public \n     health. I am a diplomat of the American College of Healthcare \n     Executives, and a member of the Chicago Health Executives \n     Forum.\n       In the spring of 1993, my husband Paul and I were delighted \n     to learn that we would be parents of twins. The pregnancy was \n     the answer to many prayers and we excitedly prepared for our \n     babies.\n       In June, five months into the pregnancy, doctors confirmed \n     that one of the twins, our daughter Mary, was suffering from \n     occipital encephalocele--a condition in which the majority of \n     the brain develops outside of the skull. As she grew, \n     sonograms revealed the progression of tissue maturing in the \n     sack protruding from Mary's head.\n       We were devastated. Mary's prognosis for life was slim, and \n     her chance for normal development non-existent. Additionally, \n     if Mary died in utero, it would threaten the life of her \n     brother, Will.\n       Doctors recommended aborting Mary. But my husband and I \n     felt that our baby girl was a member of our family, \n     regardless of how ``imperfect'' she might be. We felt she was \n     entitled to her God-given right to live her life, however \n     short or difficult it might be, and if she was to leave this \n     life, to leave peacefully.\n       When we learned our daughter could not survive normal \n     labor, we decided to go\n\n[[Page S4584]]\n\n     through with a cesarean delivery. Mary and her healthy \n     brother Will were born a minute apart on December 13, 1993. \n     Little Will let out a hearty cry and was moved to the \n     nursery. Our quiet little Mary remained with us, cradled in \n     my Paul's arms. Six hours later, wrapped in her delivery \n     blanket, Mary Bernadette French slipped peacefully away.\n       Blessedly, our story does not end there. Three days after \n     Mary died, on the day of her interment at the cemetery, Paul \n     and I were notified that Mary's heart valves were a match for \n     two Chicago infants in critical condition. We have learned \n     that even anacephalic and meningomyelocele children like our \n     Mary can give life, sight or strength to others. Her ability \n     to save the lives of two other children proved to others that \n     her life had value--far beyond what any of us could every \n     have imagined.\n       Mary's life lasted a total of 37 weeks 3 days and 6 hours. \n     In effect, like a small percentage of children conceived in \n     our country every year, Mary was born dying. What can partial \n     birth abortion possibly do for children like Mary? This \n     procedure is intended to hasten a dying baby's death. We do \n     not need to help a dying child die. Not one moment of grief \n     is circumvented by this procedure.\n       In Mary's memory, as a voice for severely disabled children \n     now growing in the comfort of their mother's wombs, and for \n     the parents whose dying children are relying on the donation \n     of organs from other babies, I make this plea: Some children \n     by their nature cannot live. If we are to call ourselves a \n     civilized culture, we must allow that their deaths be \n     natural, peaceful, and painless. And if other preborn \n     children face a life of disability, let us welcome them into \n     this society, with arms open in love. Who could possible need \n     us more?\n\n  I will now share a more personal story. A comment was made in this \nChamber on several occasions in the last debate and unfortunately again \nin this debate that Members who speak on this issue have no right to \nspeak on this issue because they cannot experience what the women who \nstood with President Clinton when he vetoed this bill experienced.\n  Well, that is not true. I will read from an article I wrote about \nwhat happened to me and my wife and our family.\n\n       On September 26, 1996, the Senate voted to sustain \n     President Clinton's veto of the Partial Birth Abortion Ban. I \n     led the fight to override the veto on the floor of the \n     Senate.\n       Central to the debate was the assertion by opponents of the \n     ban that this procedure was necessary later in pregnancy in \n     cases when a severe fetal defect was discovered. I was told \n     that I could not understand what these women, who experienced \n     this procedure, had gone through. ``It had never touched your \n     life,'' one Senator said.\n       This is a story of how just one week after that vote, it \n     did.\n       We had been through the joyous routine before--the \n     technician would turn out the lights, spread gel on Karen's \n     growing mid-section, and then right there on the screen in \n     front of our eyes we would get the first glimpse of our \n     baby--a fuzzy, black and white picture that told us all was \n     well.\n       This time, however, was different. Sitting in the darkened \n     room, listening to the background buzz of the machine, we saw \n     a large, dark circle on the screen, and we saw the \n     technician's demeanor change. Everything seemed fine--arms, \n     legs, head, spine--but the woman with the instrument was \n     strangely quiet, examining and re-examining the dark circle.\n       We had brought along our three children, ages 5, 3, and 1--\n     Elizabeth, Johnny, and Daniel--to this appointment because we \n     wanted them to be able to have a glimpse into the still, \n     perfect world of their unborn baby brother. We now feared \n     that they might get a glimpse into something else.\n       The technician left, giving way to a doctor who repeated \n     the earlier routine, mumbling something about a ``bladder.'' \n     Finally, we were coldly given the verdict: ``Your child has a \n     fatal defect and is going to die.''\n       It's not that the world stopped, nor that it moved in slow \n     motion, it was just that the world had changed. Suddenly, our \n     child whom we loved, prayed for, dreamed about, and longed to \n     meet was diagnosed with a life threatening condition. Through \n     our tears erupted the most basic of all parental instincts \n     and emotions--we were going to save our child.\n       After the initial shock, I took the kids out into the \n     hallway to the phone and called Dr. Scott Adzick. Six months \n     earlier, I had gone to Children's Hospital of Philadelphia \n     and seen a world I never knew existed--a world of Dr. \n     Adzick's creation--a world of surgery and care for children \n     still in their mother's womb. I remembered his amazing skill \n     and how I sensed an aura of peace and a certainty of purpose \n     surrounding his mission.\n       I frantically described what had transpired and asked if he \n     could help. Before he peppered me with questions, he calmly \n     reassured me that all was not lost. He had seen cases like \n     this before and knew immediately that it had to be post-\n     urethral valve syndrome.\n       Scott's principal concern had to do with the absence of \n     fluid in the amniotic sac. What he told us failed to lift our \n     hopes. The absence of fluid meant that the baby likely had a \n     complete obstruction of the urinary tract--in short, a very \n     rare, severe, and extremely problematic condition.\n       Not typically understood is that the element comprising the \n     amniotic fluid encompassing the baby during development is \n     the baby's urine. The fluid not only provides a barrier of \n     protection from outside trauma, but it is necessary in the \n     development of the baby's lungs. Without it its lungs would \n     not develop enough for him to survive outside the womb.\n       In addition, the baby's enlarged bladder would so compress \n     the internal organs--particularly the kidneys--that they \n     would cease to function. Kidney failure would mean near-\n     certain death shortly after birth.\n       Dr. Adzick arranged for tests to be done the next day in \n     Philadelphia at Pennsylvania Hospital. The initial results \n     did not look good. Seated in front of our second sonogram \n     machine in as many days, Dr. Adzick and Dr. Alan Donnefeld \n     described our son's kidneys as not positive. Dr. Adzick told \n     us that though he, too, was discouraged, there were one or \n     two occasions where he had seen bad kidneys have sufficient \n     levels of function, enabling a baby to survive until a \n     transplant soon after birth.\n       We adjourned to a supply room next to the treatment area. \n     The purpose of the meeting was to discuss options. Dr. \n     Donnenfeld took the lead, saying that things were grave, and \n     presenting us with three options. ``Your first option is to \n     terminate the pregnancy.'' As the word pregnancy left his \n     lips the room instantly went dark. The doctor quickly reached \n     up and turned on the light that was on a timer. Through \n     nervous and awkward laughter I said, ``I guess that answers \n     your question.''\n       We knew that abortion was a legal option, it just wasn't a \n     sane one. It was inconceivable to us as parents to kill our \n     baby because he wasn't perfect or because he might not live a \n     long life. While we couldn't look into his eyes or hold him \n     in our arms, he was no less our child than our other three \n     children. And we loved him every bit as much. He was our gift \n     from God from the moment we found out Karen was pregnant. In \n     our mind, from that time on our job as parents of this tiny \n     life was to do everything we could to nurture him through \n     life. Karen and I have this saying, ``life is about being \n     there,'' and this was our chance to be there for our baby.\n       The second option was to do nothing. In this case our son \n     would live only as long as he was in the womb. While in the \n     womb our baby's lungs and kidneys were not necessary for him \n     to survive--Karen was performing those functions for him. \n     There was no increased threat to Karen as a result of his \n     defect.\n       The third option would entail several tests and testaments \n     that could put Karen at risk. Karen's immediate response was \n     to do whatever it took to save our son, no matter what the \n     risk to her.\n       Our son went through two days of tests to determine kidney \n     function. If there was very poor or no kidney function there \n     would be no point in proceeding further--he would not develop \n     enough in the womb to survive outside. The first day the \n     results were so bad that we discussed whether it was worth \n     going through a second painful day of tests for Karen. Dr. \n     Adzick said we needed a miracle to get those kidneys to work \n     better.\n       We prayed more than I can remember for our son, who we \n     named that day Gabriel Michael, after the great archangels. \n     The next day our prayers were answered with a miraculous \n     improvement; the chances for success were not just okay, but \n     kidney function very good. We could now do the surgery that \n     would save his life.\n       For both of us, this crisis was not so much a ``faith \n     check'' as it was a time of reassurance. No matter what \n     happened, we knew that God held us--and held Gabriel \n     Michael--in his hands. What that knowledge there is a peace \n     beyond human understanding.\n       The bladder shunt procedure, to drain the urine into the \n     amniotic sac in an effort to create the proper fluid \n     environment for Gabriel, was scheduled for Tuesday with Dr. \n     Bud Wiener at Pennsylvania Hospital. Dr. Wiener had done more \n     of these procedures than anyone else on the east coast and \n     had pioneered the plastic tube that would be used to drain \n     the urine.\n       Next came the surgery. The idea that surgery on a child in \n     only its 20th week of life inside the womb could work boggles \n     the mind. And watching Dr. Weiner at work was something to \n     behold. He guided the shunt into place, though more slowly \n     than he would have liked, but it was a success. As we left \n     the hospital, we worried about whether the shunt had worked, \n     and whether the longer than usual procedure might have put \n     Karen more at risk.\n       Two days later, Karen began feeling both chills and \n     cramping--the cramping was the beginning of labor and the \n     chills were a sign of an infection in her womb. Our worst \n     fears had become a reality.\n       Hoping desperately that it was food poisoning or the flu, \n     Karen fought desperately to hold it all together. A call to \n     the doctor was met with an order to rush to the hospital. We \n     were in Pittsburgh at home. There another doctor performed \n     another sonogram. What we saw was perhaps the single worst \n     and single best things of our lives. The fuzzy picture on the \n     screen showed an active baby--arms and legs moving freely in \n     a sac of amniotic fluid. But the infection persisted.\n       Karen was seized with horrible chills. Huddled under nearly \n     a dozen blankets her body temperature soared to 105. By this\n\n[[Page S4585]]\n\n     point there was little that could be done. Intra-uterine \n     infections are untreatable as long as the source of the \n     infection--the amniotic sac--is in place. Unless the sac and \n     thereby the baby were delivered, Karen would eventually die, \n     and Gabriel Michael with her. Here again the doctors told us \n     that abortion was a legal option, but we knew there was \n     another way. This way gave our son the love and respect he \n     deserved and to Karen and me the gift of a precious few hours \n     with our son.\n       Karen was given an antibiotic which reduced the fever and \n     made her comfortable. She clung to the baby with all her \n     might, but nature was relentless. Soon the labor \n     intensified--the body had identified the source of the \n     infection. She did everything she could to delay the \n     inevitable. I tried calling everyone I knew to see if there \n     was something else that could be done. There was no answer to \n     be found. I thanked God for the presence of Karen's father, \n     Dr. Ken Garver, a physician whose specialty is in genetics \n     counseling, prenatal diagnosis of birth defects, and \n     Monsignor Bill Kerr who helped guide us through this time.\n       We knew the end was near so we tried to pack a lifetime of \n     love into those few hours. I put my hands on Karen's \n     abdomen--we prayed and we cried. We also talked to Gabriel to \n     let him know how much we loved him--how much we will miss \n     him, how much we will miss mothering and fathering him and \n     how his brothers and sister will miss his presence.\n\n  Within hours of 12:45, our son was born. He was a beautiful \ncreation--a small, pink, package of joy and sorrow, hope and questions. \nWe bundled him up, put a little hat on his head, we held him, sang to \nhim, cried for him. He was too small to make a sound but he spoke so \npowerfully to our hearts. His eyes never opened to see his mommy and \ndaddy, but he allowed us to see, in him, the face of God. Two hours \nlater, he died in my arms.\n  We tried to make Gabriel's short life, short time on Earth, filled \nwith love, only love. And we told him that soon he would be \nexperiencing something that we are striving for. God would be bringing \nhim to be with Him in heaven. Finally, we pledged to him that we would \nrededicate ourselves to joining him someday.\n  The next days were no less of a blur than the ones that led up to \nthem. We buried our son later that day, next to other members of our \nfamily, and we prayed to God to give us understanding.\n  This is our story, the irony finding ourselves confronted with a baby \nwith a fetal defect when only the few days before, the absence of such \nhad disqualified me from the debate on partial-birth abortion. It was \nin the eyes of many truly overwhelming. On two occasions we, too, could \nhave chosen the option to abort. We knew that Gabriel's life would \nprobably be measured in minutes and hours, not in years and decades. We \nchose to let Gabriel live and die in the fullness of time--being held \nand loved and nurtured by two parents who loved him dearly.\n  We wouldn't have traded those 2 hours with our son for anything in \nthe world. And we know he wouldn't have either.\n  In the midst of the debate that fall, disgusted by and worried about \nthe gruesome descriptions of abortion, one of the Senators said that a \nmedical procedure was bloody and that it was just the nature of the \nevent. The Washington Post described what happened next:\n\n       Republican Senator Rick Santorum turned to face the \n     opposition and, in a high, pleading voice, cried out, ``Where \n     do we draw the line? Some people have likened this procedure \n     to an appendectomy. That's not an appendix,'' he shouted, \n     pointing to a drawing of a fetus. ``This is not a blob of \n     tissue. It's a baby. It's a baby.''\n       And then, impossibly, in an already hushed gallery, in one \n     of those moments when the floor of the Senate looks like a \n     stage set, with its small wooden desks somehow too small for \n     the matters at hand, the cry of a baby pierced the room, \n     echoing across the chamber from an outside hallway.\n       No one mentioned the cry. But for a few seconds no one \n     spoke at all.\n\n  Maybe it was a freak occurrence. It was a baby, a visitor's baby that \nwas crying in the hallway as the door to the floor opened and a few \nseconds later closed. A freak occurrence, perhaps, or maybe a cry from \na son whose voice we never heard but whose life has changed ours \nforever.\n  Mr. President, I am using the words of my wife:\n\n       Accepting partial-birth abortion as our only alternative to \n     a difficult birth or a potentially disabled infant is to \n     thwart two of our strongest human impulses: the impulse of \n     love and the impulse of memory. All of us are united by our \n     need to love and by our need to remember and be remembered. \n     Giving life to and caring for a sick infant--for however \n     brief a period--allows us to express these uniquely human \n     impulses. Rick and I were blessed with the time to offer the \n     fullness of our love to our baby, and we have the peace of \n     knowing that he felt that love. Gabriel Michael joined our \n     family forever. He has not been obliterated. Gabriel was \n     known and will always be remembered. His memory will live \n     with us forever. I believe that every human being should be \n     remembered by somebody. Memory helps to anchor us to each \n     other; it locates us not only within a certain time and \n     place, but within a family and within a community. It is one \n     of the measures of the value we place on each other. And the \n     tragedy of infants who are destroyed and forgotten should \n     haunt us all.\n\n  There is another way. You heard me quoting doctors all day about the \nother way, that there is no need to kill a baby. You may need to \nseparate the mother from the baby, but there is no need to kill the \nbaby. I do know that. I have experienced that. And I, as I said, would \nnot trade one moment, one second.\n  What we are debating here is infanticide, not abortion. We should \nhave the moral courage to stop infanticide in the U.S. Senate. We \nshould be able to muster up enough support out around America to send a \nmessage, loud and clear, to every Member in this Senate, that we will \nnot stand for it any longer.\n  The children who are victims of partial-birth abortion are not here \nto speak for themselves. So we must do that. And so I ask you on their \nbehalf that you don't subject anyone else in America to this procedure. \nI plead with you on their behalf to stop the murder. I ask the \nPresident to look into his heart and see if he can't understand and \nfeel the disruption that this procedure is causing to our culture and \nto our civilization. I ask every Member of the Senate to do the same. I \nthink, if you do, the decision will be easy.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I congratulate and thank my colleague from \nPennsylvania, not only for bringing this bill to the floor, for working \non it for so many months, but also for that very eloquent statement \nabout the tragedy that occurred in his family.\n  I think his statement was the statement about the value of life and \nhow precious human life really is. Each one of us, at different times \nin our lives, are reminded of the value of life, and sometimes how \nbrief that life can be. As I look around the Chamber of the Senate this \nevening, I see three of my colleagues who have lost children, three of \nus who have lost children, who understand maybe more than we did before \nhow precious human life is.\n  Really, that is what this debate is about tonight, what it has been \nabout today. One of the things that we do in this Senate, as we have \nthe luxury, if you want to use the term, of unlimited debate, is to \nthoroughly discuss issues. And as we do that, this tradition that is \nover 200 years in this body, as we do that, many times we do, in fact, \neducate ourselves and understand things better. Maybe, as we try to \neducate ourselves, we help educate the American people.\n  We have been at this debate for a long time because we had this \ndebate last session of Congress. I would like, tonight, to talk about \nsome of the things we have learned. I entered this Chamber, as my \ncolleague from Texas, Phil Gramm, said earlier this evening, entered \nthe Chamber a few months ago--I say now over a year ago--with not a \nwhole lot of knowledge about partial-birth abortion. I think we all \nhave become educated, not just from the debate here on the floor, but \nalso we have been educated by the hearings. We have learned what \npartial-birth abortion is.\n  I think the most telling description was given by Brenda Pratt \nShafer, of Franklin, OH, when she testified in front of the Judiciary \nCommittee. Let me, if I could, share with my colleagues in part what \nshe said:\n\n       Mr. Chairman and Honorable Members of the Judiciary \n     Committee, I am Brenda Pratt Shafer. I am a registered nurse, \n     licensed in the State of Ohio, with 13 years of experience. \n     In 1993, I was employed by Kimberly Quality Care, a nursing \n     agency in Dayton, OH. In September 1993, Kimberly Quality \n     Care asked me to accept an assignment at the Women's Medical \n     Center, which is operated by Dr. Martin Haskell. I readily \n     accepted this assignment because I was at that time very pro-\n     choice.\n\n\n[[Page S4586]]\n\n\n  She continues:\n\n       So, because of the strong pro-choice views I held at that \n     time, I thought this assignment would be no problem for me.\n       But I was wrong. I stood at the doctor's side as he \n     performed the partial-birth abortion procedure--and what I \n     saw is branded on my mind forever.\n       I worked as an assistant nurse at Dr. Haskell's clinic for \n     3 days--September 28, 29, 30, 1993.\n\n  She continues:\n\n       On the third day, Dr. Haskell asked me to observe as he \n     performed several of these procedures that are the subject of \n     this hearing. Although I was in the clinic on the assignment \n     of the agency, Dr. Haskell was interested in hiring me full-\n     time, and I was being oriented in the entire range of \n     procedures provided by that facility.\n       I was present for three of these partial-birth procedures. \n     It is the first one that I will describe to you in detail.\n       The mother was 6 months pregnant, 26\\1/2\\ weeks. A doctor \n     told her that the baby had Down Syndrome, and she had to have \n     an abortion. She decided to have this abortion. She came in \n     the first 2 days and have the laminaria inserted and changed, \n     and she cried the whole time she was there. On the third day, \n     she came in to have the partial-birth abortion procedure.\n       Dr. Haskell brought the ultrasound in and hooked it up so \n     that he could see the baby. On the ultrasound screen, I could \n     see the heart beat. As Dr. Haskell watched the baby on the \n     ultrasound screen, the baby's heartbeat was clearly visible \n     on the ultrasound screen.\n       Dr. Haskell went in with forceps and grabbed the baby's \n     legs and pulled them down into the birth canal. Then he \n     delivered the baby's body and arms--everything but the head. \n     The doctor kept the head right inside the uterus.\n       Senators this is a baby that was a little bit smaller than \n     the baby that I actually saw that day.\n\n  She held something up.\n\n       This is a mechanical model of a baby.\n       The baby's little fingers were clasping and unclasping, and \n     his little feet were kicking. Then the doctor stuck the \n     scissors in the back of his head, and the baby's arms jerked \n     out, like a startle reaction, like a flinch, like a baby does \n     when he thinks he is going to fall.\n       The doctor opened up the scissors, and stuck a high-powered \n     suction tube into the opening, and sucked the baby's brains \n     out. Now the baby went completely limp.\n       I was really completely unprepared for what I was seeing. I \n     almost threw up as I watched Dr. Haskell doing these things.\n       Next, Dr. Haskell delivered the baby's head. He cut the \n     umbilical cord and delivered the placenta. He threw the baby \n     in a pan, along with the placenta and the instruments he had \n     just used. I saw the baby move in the pan. I asked another \n     nurse, and she said it was just reflexes.\n       I have been a nurse for a long time, and I have seen a lot \n     of death--people maimed in auto accidents, gunshot wounds, \n     you name it. I have seen surgical procedures of every sort. \n     But in all my professional years, I had never witnessed \n     anything like this.\n       The woman wanted to see her baby, so they cleaned up the \n     baby and put it into a blanket and handed it to her. She \n     cried the whole time. She kept saying, ``I am so sorry, \n     please forgive me.'' I was crying, too. I couldn't take it. \n     That baby boy had the most perfect angelic face I think I \n     have ever seen in my life.\n       I was present in the room during two more such procedures \n     that day, but I was really in shock. I tried to pretend I was \n     somewhere else, to not think about what was happening. I just \n     couldn't wait to get out of there. After I left that day, I \n     never went back. The last two procedures, by the way, \n     involved healthy mothers with healthy babies.\n\n  That was the testimony of the nurse, testimony that has never been \ncontroverted. In fact, I will not take the Senate's time to read this \nin its entirety, but this is the actual paper that Dr. Haskell prepared \nthat has been quoted before in this procedure. It is a paper delivered \nby Martin Haskell, presented at the National Abortion Federation, Risk \nManagement Seminar, September 13, 1992. You can track in Dr. Haskell's \nown words exactly what nurse Shafer said.\n  The doctor uses medical terminology. Part of this has already been \nread today by Dr. Frist, Senator Frist, when he gave his very eloquent \ncomments in opposing the Daschle amendment. I will point out one thing \nthat is very evident when you look at this description by Dr. Haskell \nof what this partial-birth abortion procedure is, that it takes 3 days, \nday 1, day 2, day 3. That was confirmed by what Nurse Shafer said. The \ndilation occurs in the first 2 days. They go in, go back home or go to \na motel, and then come back the third day for the procedure itself. But \nactually the whole procedure takes 3 days.\n  We have also learned not only what the procedure is, we have learned \na lot about why it is done.\n  Again, maybe the best evidence is to listen to the people who perform \nthe abortions.\n  Dr. McMahon has told us, he has said that a number of these were done \nfor nothing more serious than cleft palates. Seven, eight, possibly \nnine, for cleft palates, the life was snuffed out.\n  Dr. Haskell has told us that 80 percent--80 percent--of the abortions \nhe performs are elective. The evidence is overwhelming of why these are \ndone and under what circumstances.\n  Mr. President, during the just concluded debate, a number of my \ncolleagues spoke of how this issue has deeply divided this country. One \neven said that nothing really has divided this country as much as the \nabortion debate has since the debate over slavery prior to and leading \nup to and including the Civil War.\n  I think that is correct. Few issues in our whole country's history \nhave been so divisive. I would argue, Mr. President, this debate over \nabortion has been so protracted and intense because in a sense in a \ngovernment of ``we the people,'' we are still trying to figure out who \n``we''--what that means, who is included.\n  I say, Mr. President, that the vulnerable babies that we have heard \nabout are us. And whether or not we are willing to speak out, whether \nor not we are willing to say enough is enough, not only will determine \nwhether some of these babies will live or die, but it also will \ndetermine what kind of a people we are, what kind of a society we want \nto live in, who we really are, who we are as a people, what do we value \nand what do we not value, what do we become indignant about, and what \ndo we walk away from.\n  How bad do things have to be before we speak up and say enough is \nenough? This is something we simply, even in 1997, this is something we \nwill not tolerate. It is wrong. We will not put up with it. We will not \nallow it to occur in a civilized society. So, in a sense, not only is \nthis a debate about the babies, not only a debate about who will live, \nit is also a debate about who all of us are and what kind of a country \nwe have, what kind of a country we want.\n  I think we have an obligation to speak up. I think that many times \nthe sins that we commit as a people, as individuals, are sins of \nomission, what we do not do when we do not speak up.\n  I would like to quote from my friend, Henry Hyde, from a book that he \nwrote that I think summarizes what I believe. This is what Congressman \nHenry Hyde said:\n\n       I believe . . . that when the final judgment comes--as it \n     will surely--when that moment comes that you face Almighty \n     God--the individual judgment, the particular judgment--I \n     believe that a terror will grip your soul like none other \n     than you can imagine. The sins of omission will be what weigh \n     you down; not the things you've done wrong, the chances \n     you've taken, but the things you failed to do, the times that \n     you stepped back, the times you didn't speak out.\n       Not only for every idle word but for every idle silence \n     must man render an account. I think that you will be \n     overwhelmed with remorse for the things you failed to do.\n\n  Mr. President, let us move to pass this bill. Let us speak out for \nwhat is right. And let us hope that the power of the arguments that \nhave been heard on the floor--no, rather the facts that have been \nclearly disclosed on the floor--will then persuade the President of the \nUnited States to rectify a mistake that he made last year when he \nvetoed this bill. We know more today. Many of the statements that were \nmade by the President in his veto message are clearly, clearly not \ntrue. It was clear to many of us at the time they were not true, but \nnow that we have had the opportunity for more debate, more evidence, it \nis clear that the reasons he gave, the rationales he gave, are simply \nnot there.\n  So let us pass this bill. Let us send it again to the President. And \nlet us pray that the power of the facts will convince our President to \nsign the bill.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/15/senate-section/article/S4582-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4586-S4587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United\n\n[[Page S4587]]\n\nStates submitting sundry nominations which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/15/senate-section/article/S4586-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT ON THE CFE FLANK DOCUMENT--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 35\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport;

It will reaffirm the \nintegrity of one of the CFE Treaty's core provisions and will \nfacilitate progress on CFE adaptation and, thus, NATO enlargement, key \nelements for advancing United States and European security.\n  I must, however, make clear my view of several of the Conditions \nattached to the resolution of advice and consent to ratification, \nincluding Conditions 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9 and 11. These Conditions all \npurport to direct the exercise of authorities entrusted exclusively to \nthe President under our Constitution, including for the conduct of \ndiplomacy and the implementation of treaties. The explicit limitation \non diplomatic activities in Condition 3 is a particularly clear example \nof this point. As I wrote the Senate following approval of the Chemical \nWeapons Convention, a condition in a resolution of ratification cannot \nalter the allocation of authority and responsibility under the \nConstitution. I will, therefore, interpret the Conditions of concern in \nthe resolution in a manner consistent with the responsibilities \nentrusted to me as President under the Constitution. Nevertheless, \nwithout prejudice to my Constitutional authorities, I will implement \nthe Conditions in the resolution.\n  Condition (9), which requires my certification that any agreement \ngoverning ABM Treaty succession will be submitted to the Senate for \nadvice and consent, is an issue of particular concern not only because \nit addresses a matter reserved to the President under our Constitution, \nbut also because it is substantively unrelated to the Senate's review \nof the CFE Flank Document. It is clearly within the President's \nauthorities to determine the successor States to a treaty when the \noriginal Party dissolves, to make the adjustments required to \naccomplish such succession, and to enter into agreements for this \npurpose. Indeed, throughout our history the executive branch has made a \nlarge number of determinations concerning the succession of new States \nto the treaty rights and obligations of their predecessors. The ABM \nSuccession MOU negotiated by the United States effectuated no \nsubstantive change in the ABM Treaty requiring Senate advice and \nconsent. Nonetheless, in light of the exceptional history of the ABM \nTreaty and in view of my commitment to agree to seek Senate approval of \nthe Demarcation\n\n[[Page S4588]]\n\nAgreements associated with the ABM Treaty, I have, without prejudice to \nthe legal principles involved, certified, consistent with Condition \n(9), that I will submit any agreement concluded on ABM Treaty \nsuccession to the Senate for advice and consent.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe partial exclusion from gross income of gain on certain small \nbusiness stock, to provide a rollover of capital gains on certain small \nbusiness investments, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n        THE SMALL BUSINESS CAPITAL GAINS ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Small \nBusiness Capital Gains Enhancement Act of 1997, which will make several \nimportant improvements to section 1202 of the Internal Revenue Code, a \nmeasure I authored in 1993 to provide an incentive for investment in \nentrepreneurial efforts. Section 1202 provides a 50 percent exclusion \nfor capital gains from qualified small business stock held at least 5 \nyears.\n  The purpose of section 1202 is clear. Because small businesses are \ninherently riskier than large businesses,\n\n[[Page S4589]]\n\nmost investors are reluctant to invest in the smaller enterprises. \nThis, obviously, tends to create a dearth of capital for entrepreneurs. \nBut maintaining a healthy investment environment for small businesses \nis extremely important for the well-being of our economy. Most new jobs \ncome from small businesses, not large ones. From 1991-95, businesses \nwith fewer than 500 employees created 22 million new jobs, while \nbusinesses of greater than 500 employees cut 3 million jobs. And it was \nbecause of this dynamic small business impact on our economy that \nCongress passed section 1202 with great bipartisan support in both \nchambers: we wanted to create a capital formation incentive for small \nbusiness.\n  Now, for two reasons, it has become crucial that we make certain \nimprovements to section 1202. First, section 1202 is not adequate. The \nsmall business incentive I originally proposed in 1993 was considerably \nmore extensive than section 1202. After years of discussions among \nentrepreneurs and tax experts regarding what would be helpful and \nworkable, we had determined that the incentive should, for example, \ninclude companies of up to $100 million in assets, allow corporate \ninvestors, and not be subject to the alternative minimum tax. But \nbecause of budget concerns during the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of \n1993, the proposal was scaled back to include only companies of $50 \nmillion or less, allow no corporate investors, and subject 50 percent \nof the benefit to the alternative minimum tax. The bill my cosponsors \nand I are introducing today will expand section 1202 to provide the \nkind of incentive originally envisioned and more.\n  The second reason that today's legislation is crucial is to preserve \nthe incentive in the face of other impending capital gains cuts which \nwould effectively nullify it. As we all know, it appears that we are \nheaded toward an across-the-board capital gains cut following the \nrecent budget agreement between the Clinton administration and \nRepublican congressional leaders. Ironically, an across-the-board cut \ncould obliterate the small business incentive if the latter is not \nadjusted accordingly.\n\n  Here is how that would happen. Under the GOP capital gains proposal \nin S. 2, the top regular capital gains rate will be 19.8 percent, while \nthe top rate for small business capital gains will remain at 14 \npercent. In other words, an investor could buy stock in, say, \nMicrosoft, hold that stock 1 year, sell the stock, and, if a gain were \nrealized, pay a maximum tax of 19.8 percent. Alternatively, the \ninvestor could make that investment in, say, a new biotech firm, hold \nthat stock 5 years, sell the stock, and, if a gain were realized, pay a \nmaximum tax of 14 percent. The logical choice would be clear: the \ninvestor would choose the big business over the small business. After \nall, who would choose a risky 5-year small business investment over a \n1-year Microsoft investment for a tax differential of only 5.8 percent? \nClearly, a major across-the-board tax cut without a corresponding \nincrease in the exclusion for small business investments will \nobliterate section 1202's effectiveness. Small business will be left \nwithout a viable capital gains incentive.\n  Not only would the situation described above nullify the small \nbusiness incentive for the future, it would be unfair to those who have \nalready made small business investments based on section 1202--those \nwho accepted the risk of investing in a small business stock for the \npromise of preferential capital gains treatment. We would be saying, \n``Thanks for taking a risk with your small business investment, but \nwe've decided to change the rules. We're gonna give you about the same \ntax rate we give other people for their less-risky Fortune 500 \ninvestments.'' As a matter of fairness to those who have already \ninvested in a small business based on section 1202, we must maintain a \nsubstantial difference between small business and big business capital \ngains taxes. This bill will make that adjustment by increasing the \nexclusion for small business capital gains from 50 percent to 75 \npercent.\n  Here is a list of all the improvements our legislation would make to \nsection 1202. Increase the small business deduction from 50 percent to \n75 percent; increase the asset limit for ``qualified small businesses'' \nfrom $50 to $100 million; make the incentive available to corporate \ninvestors; exempt the incentive from alternative minimum tax \ncalculations; change the working capital spend-down period (intended to \nprevent abuse through inactivity) from 2 years to 5 years to allow \ncompanies to raise adequate capital before beginning to spend it; \nincrease the per-taxpayer benefit limit to $20 million or 10 times \ninvestment. Presently, the limit is $10 million or 10 times investment; \nand allow the tax-deferred rollover of capital gains from one qualified \nsmall business to another.\n\n  Although we have not yet received a Joint Tax Committee revenue \nestimate on this measure, it would appear from previous estimates to \ncost under $500 million over 5 years and under $1 billion over 10 \nyears. Compared to the cost of an across-the-board capital gains tax \ncut and other major tax cuts being considered by this Congress, this is \na pittance.\n  Mr. President, section 1202 is the major, if not the only, capital \nformation incentive for small business in the entire Tax Code. It would \nbe a tragedy and a slap in the face of America's entrepreneurs if we \nfail to maintain this measure in viable form.

Mr. President, I rise this morning, to join my good \ncolleague from Arkansas in support of the Small Business Capital Gains \nEnhancement Act of 1997.\n  Today, our country's economy is more robust and is growing faster \nthan it has in the last decade and maybe even the last several decades. \nFostering this growth is crucial to sustain the great and important \nstrides that our economy has made in these past years and I believe \nthat this legislation will go a long way to improving incentives for \ninvestment in small businesses. Cutting the capital gains tax in this \ntargeted fashion is something that small businesses have time and again \nasked for because they know, as we all do, that investing in small \nbusinesses and providing capital for that investment creates growth \nand, more importantly, jobs.\n  Small businesses have had a striking impact on Georgia's economy. \nThey are vital as job creators, and their diversity and composition \nprovide a work force with endless opportunities and are easily the envy \nof the country.\n  Mr. President, according to the SBA, 97.6 percent of the business \nfirms in Georgia are small businesses. Women-owned businesses have \nincreased 62.7 percent since 1987. African American owned firms have \nincreased 79.8 percent between 1987 and 1992. Hispanic firms, including \npart-time businesses, grew 184.9 percent in the same period of time. So \nthe impact of this legislation is huge. These figures are numbers that \ncorporate investors cannot--cannot--\n\n[[Page S4591]]\n\nignore, but if section 1202 of the Internal Revenue Code doesn't allow \nthem to invest in these small businesses, then I believe we are missing \nout on far more than the taxes that we collect as the law is now. We \nmust make certain that these investors have every opportunity to become \ninvolved in the growing of small businesses. These are the ideal \ninvestors, they recognize that, and so should we, Mr. President.\n  I wish to add support to my colleague's comments that across-the-\nboard cuts, while they may sound wonderful, can in fact have a negative \nimpact toward small businesses as they compete with big businesses for \ninvestment dollars. It is important to maintain the differences between \nsmall business and big business capital gains taxes. Making adjustment \nin the present law and fine tuning where needed is smarter, in my \nopinion, than the alternatives of wide ranging or all encompassing \nlegislative action.\n\n  This is an affordable tax cut and one that puts important capital \ndollars in the coffers of the men and women of this country who are \ncreating jobs, creating economic opportunity, and giving hope to the \ncountry and I believe hope to our great future. I believe many of our \ncolleagues will join us in our commitment to the small businesses of \nthis country. I thank my friend from the wonderful State of Arkansas \nfor his leadership and the opportunity to participate here with him \nthis morning. This is a great opportunity that I look forward to \nsupporting.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and any time that may remain.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN:\n  S. 746. A bill to reaffirm and clarify the Federal relationship of \nthe Burt Lake Band as a distinct federally recognized Indian tribe, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n         The Burt Lake Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians Act\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nreaffirm the Federal recognition of the Burt Lake Band of Ottawa and \nChippewa Indians. This legislation will reestablish the government-to-\ngovernment relations of the United States and the Burt Lake Band. This \nis the same legislation which I introduced last Congress and which was \noriginally introduced in the 103d Congress by my friend and colleague, \nSenator Donald Riegle.\n  Federal recognition for Burt Lake is vitally important for a variety \nof reasons. With this process completed the Band can move on to the \ntasks of improving the economic and social welfare of its people. More \nimportant however, passage of this legislation will clarify that the \nBurt Lake Band is a historically independent tribe.\n  The Band is named after Burt Lake, a small inland lake about 20 miles \nsouth of the straits of Mackinac. The Band already had deep roots in \nthe area when a surveyor named Burt inspected the area in 1840. During \nthe 1800's, the Burt Lake Band was a signatory to several Federal \ntreaties, including the 1836 Treaty of Washington and the 1855 Treaty \nof Detroit. These treaties were enacted for the purpose of securing \nterritory for settlement and development.\n  During the mid-1800's, the Federal Government turned over to the \nState of Michigan annuity moneys on the Band's behalf in order to \npurchase land. This land was later lost by the Band through tax sales, \nalthough trust land is nontaxable. The Band was subsequently evicted \nfrom their village. In 1911, the Federal Government brought a claim on \nbehalf of Burt Lake against the State of Michigan. The autonomous \nexistence of the Band at this stage is clear.\n  Although the Band has never had its Federal status legally \nterminated, the Bureau of Indian Affairs since the 1930's has not \naccorded the Band that status nor treated the Band as a federally \nrecognized tribe. The Burt Lake Band, as well as the other tribes \nlocated in Michigan's lower peninsula were improperly denied the right \nto reorganize under the terms of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 \neven though they were deemed eligible to do so by the Indian Service at \nthat time.\n  My Michigan colleague, Congressman Dale Kildee, has sponsored a \nsimilar piece of legislation. I look forward to the consideration of \nthis legislation by the respective committees in both the Senate and \nthe House and its enactment into law. I also ask unanimous consent that \na copy of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 746\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Burt Lake Band of Ottawa and \n     Chippewa Indians Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Burt Lake Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians are \n     descendants and political successors to the signatories of \n     the treaty between the United States and the Ottawa and \n     Chippewa nations of Indians at Washington, D.C. on March 28, \n     1836 (7 Stat. 491 et seq.), and the treaty between the United \n     States and the Ottawa and Chippewa Indians of Michigan at \n     Detroit on July 31, 1855 (11 Stat. 621 et seq.);\n       (2) the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, \n     the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, and the Bay \n     Mills Band of Chippewa Indians, whose members are also \n     descendants of the signatories to the treaties referred to in \n     paragraph (1), have been recognized by the Federal Government \n     as distinct Indian tribes;\n       (3) the Burt Lake Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians \n     consists of over 650 eligible members who continue to reside \n     close to their ancestral homeland as recognized in the \n     reservations of lands under the treaties referred to in \n     paragraph (1) in the area that is currently known as \n     Cheboygan County, Michigan;\n       (4) the Band continues to exist and carry out political and \n     social activities with a viable tribal government;\n       (5) the Band, along with other Michigan Odawa and Ottawa \n     groups, including the tribes described in paragraph (2), \n     formed the Northern Michigan Ottawa Association in 1948;\n       (6) the Northern Michigan Ottawa Association subsequently \n     submitted a successful land claim with the Indian Claims \n     Commission;\n       (7) during the period between 1948 and 1975, the Band \n     carried out many governmental functions through the Northern \n     Michigan Ottawa Association, and at the same time retained \n     control over local decisions;\n       (8) in 1935, the Band submitted a petition under the Act of \n     June 18, 1934 (commonly referred to as the ``Indian \n     Reorganization Act'') (48 Stat. 984 et seq., chapter 576; 25 \n     U.S.C. 461 et seq.), to form a government on behalf of the \n     Band;\n       (9) in spite of the eligibility of the Band to form a \n     government under the Act referred to in paragraph (8), the \n     Bureau of Indian Affairs failed to act on the petition \n     referred to in that paragraph; and\n       (10) from 1836 to the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     Federal Government, the government of the State of Michigan, \n     and political subdivisions of the State have had continuous \n     dealings with the recognized political leaders of the Band.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend trade laws and related provisions to clarify \nthe designation of normal trade relations; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                   normal trade relations legislation\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to clarify \nthe meaning of the term, ``most-favored-nation trading status.'' I do \nso because the term gives the false impression that MFN is some sort of \nspecial privilege or reward.\n  In fact, MFN is not a special privilege or reward. It designates the \nmost ordinary, most normal trading relationship among countries. Since \nthe founding of our Republic, the principle of nondiscrimination \nembodied in MFN has served as the cornerstone of U.S. international \ntrade policy.\n  In its most basic trade application, this principle requires a \ncountry to apply the same tariff duty rate on a particular product from \none country as it applies to imports of the same product from all other \ncountries.\n  For example, if the U.S. tariff on imported clock radios is 5 \npercent, all clock radios imported from countries with MFN status are \nsubject to a 5-percent tariff. Imports from countries that do not have \nMFN status--and there are only six countries that fall into this \ncategory--are subject to far higher duty rates.\n  Another important point about MFN is that it is not a one-way street. \nWhen we give MFN status to a particular country, that country, in \nreturn, gives the United States most-favored-nation status.\n  Therefore, because we give Singapore MFN status, the clock radios we \nimport from that country are subject to the same tariff rates as clock \nradios from Thailand, Spain, or any other country to which we extend \nMFN.\n  In return, when Singapore imports our computer chips, it imposes the \nsame tariff on United States chips as those imported from Japan, Korea, \nGreat Britain, or any other country to which it extends MFN.\n  What does the United States get out of all this? American companies \nget to compete on fair and equal terms with their foreign rivals.\n  Let me emphasize again: MFN status does not confer--let alone imply--\nspecial treatment.\n  In fact, when we decide to give special treatment to imports from \nother countries--as Congress has expressly chosen to do for certain \nproducts from over 130 nations--those imports are subject to tariff \nrates substantially below the MFN rate. Sometimes we even allow \nspecified countries to export products to the United States duty free.\n  In short, MFN status denotes the standard, not the exceptional, \ntrading relationship. Ending this standard trading relationship by \nrevoking MFN is an extreme measure. In fact, because MFN is so \nfundamental to trade relations among countries, some correctly liken \nits withdrawal to a declaration of economic war.\n  Because of the confusion created by the phrase, ``most-favored-nation \ntrading status,'' Senator Moynihan and I and virtually all the Members \nof the Finance Committee have agreed to introduce legislation to \nreplace the phrase wherever appropriate in U.S. trade law with a more \nsuitable term--``normal trade relations''--a term that underscores the \nunexceptional nature of the MFN concept. I believe that if we adopt \nthis legislation, we will all better understand the issue, and our \ndiscussions on extending normal trade relations to various countries \nwill be more constructive.\n  It should be clear to our trading partners that creating this new \nterm will not alter our international rights and obligations. Rather, \nin choosing the term ``normal trade relations'' we aim to describe more \naccurately the nondiscriminatory principles underlying U.S. trade law \nand policy.\n  Last year, similar legislation passed the Senate unanimously. I ask \nmy colleagues to do the same again this year.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join once again with the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, to \nreintroduce legislation that will, we believe, help to dispel the fog \nthat sometimes shrouds our discussions of trade policy. This bill \nwould, simply and directly, replace the term ``most favored nation'' \nwith the phrase ``normal trade relations''--a more accurate, less \nmuddled phrase that better describes this fundamental principle of \ntrade policy.\n  The concept is well established. It has been traced by historians to \nthe 13th century. More particularly, to a clause in the treaty of \nNovember 8, 1226, in which the Emperor Frederick II conceded to the \ncity of Marseilles the privileges previously granted to the citizens of \nPisa and of Genoa. Not greater privileges, but merely the same as had \nbeen extended to others.\n  The term itself--``most favored nation''--dates to the end of the \n17th century. And has been nearly as long a\n\n[[Page S4593]]\n\ncornerstone of American trade policy. Since the 18th century, our trade \npolicy has been grounded on the principle of nondiscrimination: the \nvast majority of our trading partners receive treatment equal to the \ntreatment we give every other trading partner. In no sense can this \nfairly be characterized as most favored treatment; rather it is the \ntreatment that we normally accord our trading partners.\n  And yet we continue to use that 17th century term in treaties and \nagreements, in executive orders and in trade laws, a term that, even at \nthe beginning, was a misnomer. There is, Mr. President, no single most \nfavored nation. There never really was.\n  As noted in a 1919 report to the Congress by the United States Tariff \nCommission, known today as the United States International Trade \nCommission:\n\n       It is neither the purpose nor the effect of the most-\n     favored-nation clause to establish a ``most favored nation''; \n     on the contrary its use implies the intention that the \n     maximum of advantages which either of the parties to a treaty \n     has extended or shall extend to any third State--for the \n     moment the ``most-favored''--shall be given or be made \n     accessible to the other party.\n\n  That is, the most favored nation is not the nation with which we are \nnegotiating, but rather a third nation altogether that happens to \nbenefit at the moment from lower tariffs or other preferences with \nrespect to some particular product. The most-favored-nation principle \nmeans merely that we will grant to our negotiating partner the same \nterms that we have given to that third country, for the moment more \nfavored.\n\n  Little wonder, then, that the term has created confusion. And yet we \nmust continue to discuss the concept for the simple reason that there \nexists still, in U.S. law, a very unfavorable tariff--the Smoot-Hawley \ntariff (stemming from the 1930 act of the same name). This was the last \ntariff schedule enacted line-by-line by the Congress and it produced \nthe highest tariff rates, overall, in our history. It is still on the \nbooks, though it applies only to a handful of countries.\n  In response to the disaster that followed enactment of the Smoot-\nHawley tariff, which, at the time applied to all of our trading \npartners, Congress authorized the Roosevelt administration to negotiate \na series of trade agreements aimed at reducing tariffs worldwide. These \nefforts culminated in a series of trade agreements with individual \ncountries, and ultimately paved the way for a series of broad \nmultilateral negotiations under the auspices of the General Agreement \non Tariffs and Trade that reduced American tariffs, just as they \nslashed tariffs worldwide. These much lower tariff rates are the \ntariffs that we call our most-favored-nation tariff rates and they \napply, in fact, to the vast majority of countries. They are thus the \nnorm, and not in any way more favorable tariffs.\n  They are, indeed, not the lowest tariff rates that the United States \napplies. We have free-trade arrangements with Canada, Israel, and \nMexico that call for the complete elimination of tariffs. We have \neliminated tariffs on certain imports from developing countries under \nthe Generalized System of Preferences, from Caribbean nations under the \nCaribbean Basin Initiative and from Andean countries under the Andean \nTrade Preferences Act. The tariff rates under these regimes are, in all \ncases, lower than what we now call our most-favored-nation tariff \nrates. Hence the confusion, and hence the need to find a more apt \nphrase.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will be familiar to most of my \ncolleagues. The identical bill was introduced in the 104th Congress \nwith the cosponsorship of the entire Finance Committee and it passed \nthe Senate by unanimous consent. I expect that we will be able to \nrepeat that victory in the 105th Congress, and I hope that we can do so \npromptly.\n  Let me underscore that this legislation in no way alters the bedrock \nprinciples of equal treatment or nondiscrimination. It merely drops an \noutdated term in favor of one that ought to help make our trade policy \nmore comprehensible to the American public.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today Senators Roth, Moynihan, and I, \nalong with others on the Finance Committee, are introducing legislation \nto clarify the meaning of most favored nation [MFN] trading status--a \nchange I have advocated for some time.\n  Over the past few years, MFN has gained notoriety as a special favor \nthat the U.S. grants to other nations. Not true. Indeed, MFN is a \nmisnomer if there ever was one.\n  Rather, MFN refers to a centuries-old concept used by all trading \nnations--the concept that no nation shall be granted trade treatment \nless favorable than that granted to the most-favored-nation. In other \nwords, no playing favorites! Every nation is to receive equal treatment \nwhen it comes to the terms of trade.\n  Thus, the MFN concept represents the lowest common denominator of \ntrade status.\n  Over the centuries, this simple non-discrimination concept came to be \nknown as most favored nation status. Frankly, that is unfortunate. That \nparticular terminology has fostered the mistaken view that MFN is a \nspecial treatment granted only to a privileged few. Yet just the \nopposite is true: MFN, as the basic trading status between nations, is \ngranted to virtually all nations with whom the U.S. trades. The \nexceptions can almost be counted on one hand: Serbia, Laos, \nAfghanistan, Vietnam, Cuba, and North Korea.\n  In sum, while the concept of MFN is sound, the term used to denote \nthat concept is misleading and has resulted in a good deal of \nmischief--a fact that Senators Moynihan and I have lamented often \nduring Senate Finance Committee hearings. It is high time that we \ncalled the MFN nondiscrimination concept by a term that more accurately \nrepresents its meaning.\n  Therefore, today my colleagues and I are introducing this bill to \namend U.S. law, where appropriate, to replace the term ``MFN'' with the \nterm ``NTR''; normal trade relations. From this point on, we will \ndiscuss legislation and hold debate on the nondiscrimination concept \nusing the term ``NTR'' in place of MFN.\n  Will the concept of MFN remain the same? Yes. Are we signalling a \nchange in domestic policy, or modifying our international obligations \nin any way? No. But we are making perfectly clear to everyone the true \nmeaning and purpose of this centuries-old concept. And it is my hope \nthat our legislation will result in a better understanding of \ninternational trade relations, both here in the Congress and in the \neyes of the public.\n  Last year, Senators Roth, Moynihan, and I introduced a virtually \nidentical bill, again with the support of Finance Committee members. \nThat bill sailed through the Senate unanimously, and was sent to the \nHouse of Representatives. However, the house was not able to act on the \nbill prior to the date of adjournment of the 104th Congress. It is my \nhope that by introducing this bill tody, there will be more than enough \ntime this year to move the measure through both chambers and send it to \nthe President for his signature. I therefore urge swift consideration \nof our legislation by the Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mrs. Hutchison, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \n        Bumpers, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Robb):\n  S. 748. A bill to provide for college affordability and high \nstandards; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n        the college affordability and high standards act of 1997\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, during the last few years, many of us \nhave been trying to figure out how to solve some of the troubling \nquestions surrounding public education. These issues include two core \nquestions, one about inadequate academic standards and the the other \nabout the skyrocketing cost of going on to college.\n  What can we do to improve the standards of academic performance in \nour schools and, how can we make college more affordable to more of our \nstudents?\n  One very straightforward answer is to expand the number of advanced \nplacement courses taught in our schools and to increase the number of \nstudents who have the opportunity to take those courses.\n  Let me briefly describe what an advanced placement, or AP, course \nreally is. The AP program is a set of college-level courses that are \nusually taught to high school juniors and seniors for college credit. \nThey are taken on a voluntary basis. These courses are now\n\n[[Page S4594]]\n\ntaught in a majority of our high schools. They use locally developed \nmaterials. However, the year-end AP exams are evaluated on a uniform \nbasis, making test scores comparable nationwide. Overall, there are 30 \ndifferent AP courses, although most students take them in the areas of \nmath and history and science and English.\n  Today, I rise to introduce the College Affordability and High \nStandards Act of 1997, which is also being cosponsored by Senators \nHutchison, Mikulski, Bumpers and Collins. This legislation will allow \nthousands of additional high school students to participate in AP \ncourses. The bill focuses on low-income and minority students who often \nattend school in less affluent or in isolated areas.\n  I am introducing this bill based in part on several recent visits to \nNew Mexico high schools, where I learned that what students want is \nmore well-trained teachers. They are asking for more challenging \nacademic work. In my home State, in schools like West Mesa High School \nin Albuquerque and Las Cruces High School, AP students told me they \nnever thought they could succeed in classes that are this challenging. \nThere is great satisfaction and pride, evidenced by their ability to \nsucceed.\n  While it may seem new, this is not an entirely new approach to \nraising academics and lowering college costs. In fact, we have had \nlegislation proposed before by Senator Kassebaum and a bipartisan group \nof other Members, which became law in 1992 and is still in effect. We \nare just building on this approach. In addition, Secretary Riley, the \nlate President of the AFT Al Shanker, and Boston Schools Superintendent \nTom Payzant have spoken out on this.\n  Most importantly, 23 States today provide some type of incentive \nprogram to encourage more AP participation. I have a chart I want to \nshow my colleagues to make the point, which shows where there are \ninitiatives to promote AP instruction.\n  The States in white do not have an incentive program in place. We \nneed to supplement the 23 States listed on this map with AP programs in \nthe other 27 States, and we need to have every State in the Union \npromoting more advance placement courses. In essence, that is the \npurpose of this legislation.\n  There is a long-outdated myth that I want to address very briefly \nabout what type of students take these AP courses. There has been in \nthe past the impression that AP courses are only for the elite. The \ntruth is, more and more students from minority groups from various \nbackgrounds are taking AP courses today, as this chart shows, with out \na decrease in rigor or quality.\n  Roughly 1.5 million students participated--80 percent from public \nschools, 55 percent female, and 30 percent minority.\n  Almost 60 percent of all high schools offered AP courses, and over \n800,000 exams were taken.\n  As a result of this growth, the AP program is the most widely \naccepted program of high academic standards in the nation.\n\n\n                  THE BENEFITS OF PARTICIPATING IN AP\n\n  Participation is skyrocketing and States are spending funds on AP \nlargely because of the benefits of the program:\n  AP test scores of 3 or better are valuable because they are accepted \nfor credit at nearly 3,000 colleges and universities nationwide.\n  AP programs raise academic standards in schools and improve students' \nacademic performance in college.\n  For students who plan to go directly to work, AP programs provide a \nworld-class education with high-level skills that can be easily \ncompared among prospective job candidates.\n\n\n                    GROWTH IN MINORITY PARTICIPATION\n\n  Largely as a result of the 23 State AP incentive programs, overall \nparticipation and in particular the number of minority participants \nhave increased tremendously:\n  The overall number of exams taken by minorities has increased to over \n200,000 students in 1996--an increase of 36,000 students--21 percent--\nin just 2 years.\n  Minority participation in the New Mexico program increased 74 percent \nfor Hispanic students and 950 percent for native Americans from 1994 to \n1996.\n  Participation among Hispanics in Texas nearly tripled over the last 4 \nyears, from under 2,000 students to over 5,000.\n  These figures are showing us that low-income and underserved students \nhave the same ability to meet the academic challenge and the same need \nto lower college costs.\n\n\n                             STATE PROGRAMS\n\n  Each of the States trying to increase AP participation does it a \nlittle bit differently, with annual budgets that range from $50,000 to \nover $2 million.\n  Some States focus more on training more AP teachers, some on helping \nschools with start-up funding for new classes and labs, and others on \nsubsidizing part of the AP test fee for some students.\n  However, despite the growing number of State programs, AP programs \nare still often distributed unevenly among regions, States, and even \namong high schools in the same districts.\n  Some States like Texas are quickly catching up to the rising national \nparticipation rate by dedicating a significant amount of consistent \nState funding.\n  Meanwhile, other States such as New Mexico are struggling to keep up, \nwith relatively small annual budgets that rise and fall each year.\n\n\n                       WHAT THE LEGISLATION DOES\n\n  The legislation I am introducing today will both help the remaining \nStates start new programs and help the States that are already involved \ncontinue and expand their efforts.\n  To help expand access to these courses more evenly, this legislation \nis designed to accommodate the variety of programs that States have \ndesigned.\n  At its core, the bill focuses on supporting State programs that help \nincrease AP participation among underserved groups of students, and \nhelping pay for part of the AP test fees for low-income students.\n  In addition, it would help make AP programs a part of other federal \neducation initiatives, encouraging States and districts to use \neducation technology and teacher training funds to provide AP courses \nto underserved areas.\n  Several Star Schools and State Eisenhower Program grantees are \nalready taking this approach, with tremendous success being reported.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n  Let me conclude by pointing out that this approach has a long, \nbipartisan history, and was originally advocated by Members including \nSenators Stevens, Kassebaum, and Seymour, as well as Congressmen \nCunningham, Goodling, Owens, Becerra, and Miller.\n  Having seen from New Mexico's experience what tremendous good can \ncome out of even a small investment in AP incentives.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to consider the many benefits \nof this approach and support this legislation and the $6 million \nappropriations request for 1998 that has already been made by the \nadministration.\n  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation \nas the session proceeds.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 748\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``College Affordability and \n     High Standards Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) far too many students are not being provided sufficient \n     academic preparation in secondary school, which results in \n     limited employment opportunities, college dropout rates of \n     over 25 percent for the first year of college, and \n     remediation for almost one-third of incoming college \n     freshmen;\n       (2) there is a growing consensus that raising academic \n     standards, establishing high academic expectations, and \n     showing concrete results are at the core of improving public \n     education;\n       (3) modeling academic standards on the well-known program \n     of advanced placement courses is an approach that many \n     education leaders and almost half of all States have \n     endorsed;\n       (4) advanced placement programs already are providing \n     almost 30 different college-level courses, serving almost 60 \n     percent of all secondary schools, reaching a 1,500,000 \n     student population (of which 80 percent attend public \n     schools, 55 percent are females, and 30 percent are \n     minorities), and providing test scores that are accepted for \n     college credit at\n\n[[Page S4595]]\n\n     almost 3,000 colleges and universities, every university in \n     Germany, France, and Austria, and most institutions in Canada \n     and the United Kingdom;\n       (5) 24 States are now funding programs to increase \n     participation in advanced placement programs, including 19 \n     States that provide funds for advanced placement teacher \n     professional development, 3 States that require that advanced \n     placement courses be offered, 10 States that pay the fees for \n     advanced placement tests for some or all students, and 4 \n     States that require that their universities grant uniform \n     academic credit for scores of 3 or better on advanced \n     placement tests; and\n       (6) the State programs described in paragraph (5) have \n     shown the responsiveness of schools and students to such \n     programs, raised the academic standards for both students \n     participating in such programs and other children taught by \n     teachers who are involved in advanced placement courses, and \n     shown tremendous success in increasing enrollment, \n     achievement, and minority participation in advanced placement \n     programs.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to encourage more of the 600,000 students who take \n     advanced placement courses but do not take advanced placement \n     exams each year to demonstrate their achievements through \n     taking the exams;\n       (2) to build on the many benefits of advanced placement \n     programs for students, which benefits may include the \n     acquisition of skills that are important to many employers, \n     Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT) scores that are 100 points \n     above the national averages, and the achievement of better \n     grades than the grades of students who have not participated \n     in the programs;\n       (3) to support State and local efforts to raise academic \n     standards through advanced placement programs, and thus \n     further increase the number of students who participate and \n     succeed in advanced placement programs;\n       (4) to increase the availability and broaden the range of \n     schools that have advanced placement programs, which programs \n     are still often distributed unevenly among regions, States, \n     and even secondary schools within the same school districts, \n     while also increasing and diversifying student participation \n     in the programs;\n       (5) to build on the State programs described in subsection \n     (a)(5) and demonstrate that larger and more diverse groups of \n     students can participate and succeed in advanced placement \n     programs; and\n       (6) to provide access to advanced placement courses for \n     secondary school juniors at schools that do not offer \n     advanced placement programs, increase the rate of secondary \n     school juniors and seniors who participate in advanced \n     placement courses to 25 percent of the secondary school \n     student population, and increase the numbers of students who \n     receive advanced placement test scores for which college \n     academic credit is awarded.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide for more effective management of the \nnational grasslands, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n\n\n                 THE NATIONAL grasslANDS MANAGEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the National \nGrasslands Management Act. I introduced this bill in the 104th Congress \nas well. This bill applies primarily to the grasslands in the Dakotas \nand half a dozen other States. I want to explain briefly what the \nobjective of this bill is and how it came about. North Dakota has been \nparticularly concerned about management reform because it embraces over \n25 percent and 1.2 million acres of all national grasslands. Many North \nDakota ranching families have earned their livelihood on these lands \nfor several generations.\n  For several years, however, the ranchers in western North Dakota have \nbeen asking for a less cumbersome approach to management of the \ngrasslands and both chambers of the 1995 legislature passed a \nresolution unanimously asking for management reform on the grasslands \nas well. Here is why.\n  The current regulatory regime is cumbersome mainly because the Forest\n\n[[Page S4597]]\n\nService must manage the grasslands under the same framework as it does \nthe rest of the National Forest System. It doesn't handle efficiently \nthe day-to-day problems of the ranchers and grazing associations. For \nexample, ranchers have had to wait for as long as 2 to 3 years to get \napproval for a stock tank because of the labyrinth of regulations that \nthe Forest Service overlays on the management of the grasslands. This \nlegislation will change that by removing the national grasslands from \nthe National Forest System and creating a new structure of rules \nspecifically suited to the ecology of the grasslands.\n  However, it is not only the rancher's needs that my bill addresses. \nIt will also protect a broad range of uses on the public lands. All \nhunting, fishing, and recreational activities will continue as before \nand environmental protections will continue actually be strengthened. \nFurther, it is my intention that the public must be involved in the \ndecisionmaking process as these new rules are implemented. Only by \nworking together can we solve the problems on the grasslands.\n  Let me reassure the conservation community that this bill, which was \noriginally incorporated as part of a larger grazing package during the \n104th Congress, will not make grazing the dominant use of the public \nlands at the expense of other uses. This bill includes specific \nprovisions to protect hunting and fishing, and preserves the multiple \nuses of the national grasslands, preserves public participation in the \nmanagement of the grasslands and keeps the link between the Grasslands \nand major environmental laws such as the Endangered Species Act, the \nClean Air Act, and the Clean Water Act.\n  I have worked diligently with the ranchers, environmentalists, and \nother recreational users of the grasslands to ensure a balanced \napproach to grasslands management. The result of that work is the \nNational Grasslands Management Act that I am introducing today.\n  The legislation explicitly states that there will be no diminished \nhunting or fishing opportunities, that all applicable environmental \nlaws will apply to those lands, and that the grasslands will be managed \nunder a multiple use policy. The bill directs the Secretary to \npromulgate regulations which both promote the efficient administration \nof livestock agriculture and provide environmental protection \nequivalent to that of the National Forest System.\n  In short, I believe that the National Grasslands Management Act is a \nsolid piece of legislation that will make the administration of the \ngrasslands more responsive to the people who live there, without \ndiminishing the rights and opportunities of other multiple users of \nthis public land. It will help to preserve the historic ranching \neconomy and lifestyle of western North Dakota and other areas in the \nWest will be protecting the environment. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this initiative.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 750. A bill to consolidate certain mineral interests in the \nNational Grasslands in Billings County, North Dakota, through the \nexchange of Federal and private mineral interests to enhance land \nmanagement capabilities and environmental and wildlife protection, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                      Mineral Exchange Legislation\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that will \nfacilitate a mineral exchange in western North Dakota. I introduced \nthis bill at the end of the last Congress and hope to move forward in \nthis Congress with a proposal based on that effort. The purpose of this \nmineral exchange is to consolidate certain mineral estates of both the \nU.S. Forest Service and Burlington Resources, formerly known as \nMeridian Oil. This consolidation will produce tangible benefits to an \neconomically distressed region in North Dakota and also protect \nenvironmentally-sensitive areas.\n  For years, the land and mineral ownership pattern in Western North \nDakota has been extremely fragmented. In many cases the Forest Service \nowns and manages the surface land while private parties, such as \nBurlington Resources, own the subsurface mineral estates. This \nfragmentation has not only frustrated the management objectives of the \nForest Service, it has also inhibited mineral exploration and \ndevelopment.\n  The bill will definitely promote environmental protection. By \nconsolidating the mineral estates, the Forest Service will have the \nopportunity to protect the view-shed along the wonderfully scenic \nLittle Missouri River, creating a more attractive hunting, fishing, and \nhiking area. Further, the mineral exchange will protect certain bighorn \nsheep lambing areas. The area protected by the mineral exchange is one \nof the last places that provides adequate habitat and escape cover for \nbighorn sheep. The Forest Service and Burlington have already signed a \nmemorandum of understanding which will bolster the protection of \nwildlife and wildlife habitat after the exchange is concluded. The \nexchange is also supported by all major environmental groups in the \nstate, the Governor of North Dakota, and the Bureau of Land \nManagement's Dakotas Resource Advisory Council.\n\n  The bill will also strengthen the regional economy. Burlington \nResources supports this legislation. Burlington will have better \nopportunities for mineral exploration and development within its \nconsolidated mineral estates. This increased development will benefit \nnot only Burlington, but also Billings County and the State of North \nDakota through increased tax revenues.\n  One point that I would like to make clear is that this mineral \nexchange should in no way be seen as affecting the multiple uses of the \nland. Current multiple uses, such as recreation, livestock grazing, \nwatershed protection or fish, and wildlife purposes, will continue as \nbefore. This is not a wilderness bill, but a proposal to swap mineral \nrights in order to enhance the environment and to stimulate economic \nactivity in a depressed area. I do not favor the designation of \nwilderness within Billings County.\n  May I further underscore that this mineral exchange costs the U.S. \ntaxpayer nothing. The bill provides for an exchange of about the same \nnumber of acres with equivalent monetary values. Yet, this no-cost \ntransaction will yield substantial economic, environmental, and \nmanagement dividends.\n  Further, the bill does not rely on the government imposing a \nsolution. Rather, this voluntary agreement embodies a consensus reached \nbetween the affected parties, the mineral holders, the state and its \ncitizens, the environmental organizations, and the U.S. Forest Service.\n\n  Finally, may I stress that there is an urgent need for action on the \nexchange. I would ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, \nletters of support from the Governor of North Dakota, the Bureau of \nLand Management's Dakotas Resource Council, and the Sierra Club, and \nthe memorandum of understanding signed by the Forest Service and \nBurlington Resources be entered into the Record in order to aid my \ncolleagues in their deliberations on the bill. In turn, I urge my \ncolleagues to support timely passage of this bill.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 750\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXCHANGE OF CERTAIN MINERAL INTERESTS IN BILLINGS \n                   COUNTY, NORTH DAKOTA.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to consolidate \n     certain mineral interests in the Little Missouri National \n     Grasslands in Billings County, North Dakota, through the \n     exchange of Federal and private mineral interests in order to \n     enhance land management capability and environmental and \n     wildlife protection.\n       (b) Exchange.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law--\n       (1) if, not later than 45 days after the date of enactment \n     of this Act, Burlington Resources Oil & Gas Company (referred \n     to in this section as ``Burlington'' and formerly known as \n     Meridian Oil Inc.), conveys title acceptable to the Secretary \n     of Agriculture (referred to in this section as the \n     ``Secretary'') to rights and interests identified on the map \n     entitled ``Billings County, North Dakota, Consolidated \n     Mineral Exchange--November 1995'', by quitclaim deed \n     acceptable to the Secretary, the Secretary shall convey to \n     Burlington, subject to valid existing rights, by quit-claim \n     deed, all Federal rights and interests identified on that \n     map; and\n       (2) if Burlington makes the conveyance under paragraph (1) \n     and, not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of \n     this Act,\n\n[[Page S4598]]\n\n     the owners of the remaining non-oil and gas mineral interests \n     identified on that map convey title acceptable to the \n     Secretary to all rights, title, and interests in the \n     interests held by them, by quitclaim deed acceptable to the \n     Secretary, the Secretary shall convey to those owners, \n     subject to valid existing rights, by exchange deed, all \n     Federal rights, title, and interests in National Forest \n     System lands and National Grasslands in the State of North \n     Dakota as are agreed to by the Secretary and the owners of \n     those interests.\n       (c) Leasehold Interests.--As a condition precedent to the \n     conveyance of interests by the Secretary to Burlington under \n     this section, all leasehold and contractual interests in the \n     oil and gas interests to be conveyed by Burlington to the \n     United States under this section shall be released, to the \n     satisfaction of the Secretary.\n       (d) Approximate Equal Value of Exchanges With Other \n     Interest Owners.--The values of the interests to be exchanged \n     under subsection (b)(2) shall be approximately equal, as \n     determined by the Secretary.\n       (e) Land Use.--\n       (1) Exploration and development.--The Secretary shall grant \n     to Burlington, and its successors and assigns, the use of \n     Federally-owned surface lands to explore for and develop \n     interests conveyed to Burlington under this Act, subject to \n     applicable Federal and State laws.\n       (2) Surface occupancy and use.--Rights to surface occupancy \n     and use that Burlington would have absent the exchange under \n     this Act on its interests conveyed under this Act shall apply \n     to the same extent on the federally owned surface estate \n     overlying oil and gas rights conveyed to Burlington under \n     this Act.\n       (f) Environmental Protection for Environmentally Sensitive \n     Lands.--All activities of Burlington, and its successors and \n     assigns, relating to exploration and development on \n     environmentally sensitive National Forest System lands, as \n     described in the ``Memorandum of Understanding Concerning \n     Certain Severed Mineral Estates, Billings County, North \n     Dakota'', executed by the Forest Service and Burlington and \n     dated November 2, 1995, shall be subject to the terms of the \n     memorandum.\n       (g) Map.--The map referred to in subsection (b) shall be \n     provided to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of \n     the Senate and the Committee on Resources of the House of \n     Representatives, kept on file in the office of the Chief of \n     the Forest Service, and made available for public inspection \n     in the office of the Forest Supervisor of the Custer National \n     Forest within 45 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (h) Other Laws.--The exchange under subsection (b)(1) shall \n     be deemed to meet the requirements of all other Federal laws, \n     including all land exchange laws, environmental laws, and \n     cultural laws (such as the National Historic Preservation Act \n     (16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.)), and no further compliance with any \n     other law shall be required in order to implement the \n     exchanges.\n       (i) Continuation of Multiple Use.--Nothing in this Act \n     shall limit, restrict, or otherwise affect the application of \n     the principle of multiple use (including outdoor recreation, \n     range, timber, watershed, and fish and wildlife purposes) in \n     any area of the Little Missouri National Grasslands. Federal \n     grazing permits or privileges in areas designated on the map \n     entitled ``Billings County, North Dakota, Consolidated \n     Mineral Exchange--November 1995'' or those lands described in \n     the ``Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Certain Severed \n     Mineral Estates, Billings County, North Dakota'', shall not \n     be curtailed or otherwise limited as a result of the exchange \n     authorized by this Act.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                      Bismarck, ND, July 25, 1996.\n     Hon. Byron L. Dorgan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dorgan: The State of North Dakota supports the \n     introduction of a bill which would implement a proposed \n     mineral exchange between the United States Forest Service and \n     Meridian Oil, Inc. This effort will advance our ``2020'' \n     program to plan and implement sound management of the \n     Badlands well into the future.\n       Current land and mineral ownership patterns in the Bullion \n     Butte and Ponderosa Pine areas of the Little Missouri \n     National Grasslands are fragmented, thereby complicating \n     management of surface and mineral resources.\n       The proposed exchange is an opportunity to consolidate \n     ownership, enhance natural badlands habitat adjacent to the \n     Little Missouri River and facilitate mineral development \n     while reducing conflict by competing activities.\n       Finally, I have included a summary describing more \n     completely, the intended exchange and its effect.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Edward T. Schafer,\n                                                         Governor.\n       Enclosure.\n\n   Legislation To Effect an Exchange of Mineral Rights in the Little \n               Missouri National Grasslands, Billings, ND\n\n       For over a decade, the United States Forest Service (USFS) \n     and Meridian Oil, Inc. (Meridian) have been considering a \n     possible exchange of oil and gas rights in the Bullion Butte \n     and Ponderosa Pine areas of the Little Missouri National \n     Grasslands in North Dakota. The land ownership pattern in \n     those areas is very fragmented, with both federal and \n     privately owned mineral rights and federal surface and \n     private subsurface estates. This lack of unity between the \n     surface and subsurface estates and intermixture of public and \n     private mineral rights have complicated both effective \n     management of surface resource values and efficient \n     extraction of minerals. The USFS views an exchange to \n     consolidate mineral ownerships as an opportunity to protect \n     bighorn sheep and their habitat and the viewshed in the \n     Little Missouri River corridor. Meridian expects an exchange \n     to facilitate exploration for and development of oil and gas \n     by reducing the conflict such activities would have with \n     other sensitive Grasslands resources.\n       At the urging of Senator Dorgan and Governor Schafer, the \n     USFS and Meridian reached an agreement last year on an \n     exchange of certain federal and private mineral rights and \n     the imposition of certain constraints on Meridian oil and gas \n     activities. The agreement would be implemented by this \n     legislation.\n       What the legislation does. The legislation would accomplish \n     the following:\n       Direct the completion of the transfer of Meridian's mineral \n     rights in approximately 9,582 acres to the USFS for federal \n     oil and gas rights in 8,796 acres, all in Billings County, \n     North Dakota, within 45 days of enactment.\n       Authorize the exchange of any other private mineral rights \n     in the same area for federal mineral rights within 6 months \n     of enactment.\n       Deem the mineral rights to be transferred in the USFS/\n     Meridian exchange to be of equal value (since the two parties \n     have already negotiated the exchange and are of the informed \n     opinion that the values are equivalent) and require that the \n     other mineral rights to be transferred be of approximately \n     equal value.\n       Require Meridian, as a condition for the exchange, to \n     secure release of any leasehold or other contractual rights \n     that may have been established on the Meridian oil and gas \n     interests that will be exchanged.\n       Assure Meridian that it will have access across federal \n     lands to be able, subject to applicable federal and State \n     laws, to explore for and develop oil and gas on the interests \n     it will receive in the exchange and that it will have the \n     same surface occupancy and use rights on the interests it \n     will receive that it now holds on the interests to be \n     surrendered.\n       Find that the USFS/Meridian exchange meets the requirements \n     of other federal exchange, environmental, and cultural laws \n     that would apply if the exchange were to be processed without \n     Congressional approval and direction.\n       Assure that no provision of the legislation can be \n     interpreted to limit, restrict, or otherwise affect the \n     application of the principle of multiple use (including such \n     uses as hunting, fishing, grazing and recreation) in the \n     Grasslands.\n       In addition to facilitating the exchange, the legislation \n     would memorialize a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) also \n     negotiated and executed by the USFS and Meridian concerning \n     management of certain Meridian oil and gas properties that \n     will remain in Grasslands' areas with high surface resource \n     values. In particular the MOU, adopted by reference in the \n     legislation, obligates Meridian to make its best efforts to \n     locate any oil and gas facilities and installations outside \n     of the 1/4 mile view corridor on either side of the stretch \n     of the Little Missouri River being considered for designation \n     as a Wild and Scenic River and to access certain other \n     property adjacent to an important bighorn sheep lambing area \n     only by directional drilling.\n       Equally important is what the legislation does not do. It \n     does:\n       Not increase the amount of surface which the USFS controls. \n     The USFS currently controls the surface on essentially all \n     the land involved in the exchange, and this will not change \n     since only mineral interests will be transferred.\n       Not decrease the federal land available for oil and gas \n     development. To the contrary, in the exchange the federal \n     government will receive a net gain of almost 800 acres in \n     mineral rights that may be leased for exploration and \n     development by other parties. And, by consolidating federal \n     mineral rights which now are scattered in a checkerboard \n     pattern, access to them should be improved. The extent to \n     which existing and new federal mineral rights are leased to \n     private parties will be decided by the USFS in the ongoing \n     planning and Environmental Impact Statement for the Southern \n     Little Missouri Grasslands. The ``multiple use'' provision of \n     the legislation makes certain the legislation will not affect \n     that decisionmaking process.\n       Not decrease revenue to the county, state, and federal \n     governments. For the same reason that the exchange would not \n     decrease land available for oil and gas development, the \n     economic interests of taxing entities and the oil and gas \n     industry should not be affected significantly by the \n     exchange. In fact, with Meridian consolidating its mineral \n     holdings in a more manageable and less sensitive unit, area \n     oil and gas activity should increase and produce a net \n     positive economic effect.\n       Not provide either Meridian or USFS with mineral rights of \n     greater value than those they now hold. The USFS with the \n     assistance of the Bureau of Land Management, has\n\n[[Page S4599]]\n\n     reached the conclusion that the mineral rights to be \n     exchanged between the USFS and Meridian are of equal value. \n     Some additional value will accrue to both sets of mineral \n     rights transferred by the exchange because of the greater \n     ease of access and management that will result from \n     consolidation. The legislation requires that any other \n     mineral rights exchanged by other parties under the \n     legislation be of approximately equal value.\n       Not resolve the issue of wilderness designation. Some \n     parties desire wilderness protection for the area. Other \n     parties, including Meridian, oppose wilderness designation, \n     and the USFS has not indicated any intent to establish a \n     wilderness. The legislation would not increase, or decrease, \n     the prospect for wilderness designation since wilderness may \n     be designated whether the mineral rights are privately or \n     publicly owned, the designation can only be accomplished by a \n     separate Act of Congress, and the legislation's ``multiple \n     use'' language makes clear the intent of Congress that the \n     exchange is not intended to affect the wilderness issue.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  Dakotas Resource\n\n\n                                             Advisory Council,\n\n                                Dickinson, ND, September 13, 1996.\n     Hon.

Byron Dorgan,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dorgan: I am writing to convey the Sierra \n     Club's support for the ``agreement in principle'' for a \n     mineral exchange between Meridian Oil Inc. (MOI) and the \n     Bureau of Land management (BLM) / United States Forest \n     Service (USFS). This agreement follows extensive negotiations \n     between MOI, USFS, BLM, the North Dakota Game and Fish \n     Department (NDGF) and local conservation organizations.\n       It is my understanding that there are two components to the \n     agreement. Part One involves the actual exchange of the \n     mineral estate. Part Two outlines a Memorandum of \n     Understanding (MOU) between the USFS and MOI to protect the \n     viewshed of the Little Missouri State Scenic River while \n     still allowing MOI to access their minerals. The MOU also \n     addresses a plan to directionally drill an oil well to \n     protect a bighorn sheep lambing area.\n       I have also contacted the enclosed list of conservation \n     organizations and they have also stated their support for \n     Parts One and Two of the agreement as proposed. I join them \n     in urging you to introduce enabling legislation at the \n     earliest opportunity. Your efforts throughout this process \n     have been very much appreciated. Please contact me if there \n     is anything conservationists can do to facilitate this \n     mineral exchange.\n\n\n     conservation organizations in support of the mineral exchange\n\n       Dacotah Chapter of the Sierra Club.\n       National Wildlife Federation.\n       National Audubon Society.\n       Clean Water Action.\n       North Dakota Chapter of the Wildlife Society.\n       Bismarck Mandan Bird Club.\n       Lewis and Clark Wildlife Club.\n                                  ____\n\n\nMemorandum of Understanding Concerning Certain Severed Mineral Estates, \n                     Billings County, North Dakota\n\n       The Memorandum of Understand (MOU) is between Meridian Oil \n     Inc. (Meridian) with offices in Englewood, Colorado and the \n     U.S. Forest Service, Custer National Forest (Forest Service).\n       The intent of the MOU is to set forth agreement regarding \n     development of certain oil and gas interests beneath Federal \n     surface. This MOU is in addition to, and does not abrogate, \n     any rights the United States otherwise has to regulate \n     activities on the Federal surface estate or any rights \n     Meridian otherwise has to develop the oil and gas interest \n     conveyed.\n       The provisions of this MOU shall apply to the successors \n     and assigns of Meridian.\n       The MOU may be amended by written agreement of the parties.\n       Section A. View Corridor--Little Missouri River\n       Includes the following land (Subject Lands) in Township \n     137N., Range 102W.:\n       Section 3: Lots 6, 7, 9-12, 14-17 (+) River Bottom 54.7 \n     acres\n       Section 10: Kits 1-4, N\\1/2\\, N\\1/2\\SE\\1/4\\, SE\\1/4\\SE\\1/4\\ \n     (+) River Bottom 7.3 acres\n       Section 14: Lots 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, NW\\1/4\\NE\\1/4\\., NW\\1/\n     4\\SW\\1/4\\, S\\1/2\\S\\1/2\\ (+) River Bottom 41.4 acres\n       Section 24: Lots 1-9, NE\\1/4\\, S\\1/2\\NW\\1/4\\, NE\\1/4\\NW\\1/\n     4\\ (+) River Bottom 75.84 acres\n       1. The purpose of this Section is to set forth the \n     agreements that Meridian and the Forest Service have made \n     concerning reasonable protection of the view from the Little \n     Missouri River which has been identified as potentially \n     suitable for classification as a Wild and Scenic River under \n     the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. This section of the MOU shall \n     remain in effect as long as the Forest Service maintains a \n     corridor for this purpose.\n       2. The Forest Service has designated a \\1/4\\ mile corridor \n     on either side of the River for protection of the view from \n     the River, and this Section applies to the location of \n     permanent improvements within said corridor and not to \n     temporary activities such as seismic operations within said \n     corridor.\n       3. Meridian agrees to use its best efforts to locate \n     permanent production facilities, well sites, roads and other \n     installations outside the \\1/4\\ mile corridor on the Subject \n     Lands. However, such facilities may be located within the \\1/\n     4\\ mile corridor if mutually agreed to by the parties in \n     writing.\n       4. The Forest Service agrees that Meridian may access its \n     minerals within or without the \\1/4\\ mile corridor of the \n     subject lands from a well or wells whose surface location is \n     on adjoining lands in which Meridian owns the severed mineral \n     estate.\n       Section B.

A bill to protect and enhance sportsmen's opportunities and \nconservation of wildlife, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n                 Sportsmen's Bill of Rights Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr President, today, I am pleased to join my colleagues \nand fellow Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus cochairs Senators Burns, \nCraig and Murkowski in introducing the Sportsmen' Bill of Rights Act of \n1997.\n  Hunting and fishing are traditions that have been an integral part of \nour history since the inception of our Nation and are among the most \nbasic of our heritage. Through the ages, sportsmen have shown a deep \nrespect and appreciation for the land and have made a concerted effort \nto wisely use our Nation's renewable natural resources. All across this \ncountry, very successful alliances have been formed between hunting and \nfishing enthusiasts and conservationists. Both are very concerned about \nprotecting natural habitats, and when working together their force \nincludes some 70 percent of the U.S. population.\n  Today, millions of Americans participate in these venerable pastimes. \nOver 60 million Americans enthusiastically participate in fishing \nactivities and 14 million citizens are licensed hunters. These \nrecreational activities are a significant boost to many local and State \neconomies, as well as the Nation. Sportsmen spent more than $67.9 \nbillion last year on goods and services\n\n[[Page S4600]]\n\nsupporting an industry that employs more than a million people across \nthe country. When discussing the contributions sportsmen have made to \nour Nation, often overlooked is the fact that sportsmen have carried \nthe burden of financing fish and wildlife management and preservation \nthrough the years.\n  America owes our sportsmen a debt of gratitude for their pioneering \nachievements on behalf of wildlife and habitat conservation. The \nSportsmen's Bill of Rights recognizes the important role fishing and \nhunting play in our society by providing anglers and hunters with \nexplicit access to public lands; opening the process of wildlife \nmanagement and protecting the integrity of the sportsmen's trust funds. \nThis bill ensures that hunting and fishing opportunities are considered \nin Federal land management decisions, and provides a clear procedure \nfor Federal agencies to follow in their management of our Federal \npublic lands.\n  For too long, sportsmen have been unduly penalized from equitably \nsharing public land. This bill mandates that Federal agencies analyze \nthe effects of potential hunting and fishing limitations prior to \nenacting new land use policies. Hunters and anglers should be granted \nthe right to intervene in any civil action where law would limit the \nuse of land for hunting and fishing. The provisions in the sportsmen's \nbill of rights assure that Federal agencies support, encourage and \nenhance the opportunities for fishing and hunting.\n  While this bill promotes access to public lands, it recognizes the \nneed for exceptions and exclusions due to national security concerns, \npublic safety matters, emergency situations and policy reasons that are \nincompatible with hunting or fishing. This act cannot be used to force \nthe opening of National Parks or monuments administered by the National \nPark Service to fishing or hunting and this legislation is not intended \nto place fishing and hunting above other land management priorities. \nThe sportsmen's bill of rights is aimed at setting forth tangible \nmanagement guidelines.\n  Additionally, this year marks the 60th anniversary of one of our \nNation's most successful Federal restoration programs, the Pittman \nRobertson Act. P-R, as it is often referred to, is a partnership \ncreated by the State fish and wildlife agencies and the funds provided \nby the anglers and hunters. Sportsman across the land have sponsored, \nsupported and maintained the integrity of P-R throughout the last 60 \nyears. The funds are raised through an excise tax on sportsman's goods \nand subsequently, placed in a fund to be allocated to the States yearly \nin accordance with statutory formulas. Today $357 million is raised for \nwildlife restoration through P-R funds in conjunction with the Dingell-\nJohnson Act and the Wallop-Breaux Act.\n\n  Due to the congenial partnership of our Nation's hunters and anglers \nwith Federal-State agencies, America's wildlife is thriving. For every \ntaxpayer dollar invested in wildlife conservation, sportsmen and women \ncontribute $9 dollars. At the turn of the century, only 41,000 elk were \ncounted across our Nation. While the Nation's population soared and \nmassive development occurred, sportsmen's conservation initiatives have \nenable the elk population in just 10 western States to increase to \napproximately 810,000. Similar stories can be applied to numerous \nspecies including the white-tailed deer, the Canada goose, and the wild \nturkey. Hunters and anglers have been and will continue to be the \nchampions of wildlife and habitat conservation. These examples just \nbegin to demonstrate the value of anglers and hunters to our society.\n  The sportsmen's bill of rights will protect and enhance sportsmen's \nopportunities and enhance the conservation of wildlife. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me by cosponsoring this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THURMOND (for himself, Mr. Coats, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Helms, \n        Mr. Faircloth, and Mr. Hutchinson):\n  S. 752. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to modify the \nminimum allocation formula under the Federal-aid highway program, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                     highway trust fund legislation\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nrevise the formula by which the highway trust fund is apportioned and \ndistributed to the States under the Federal Aid to Highways Program. \nThis measure is cosponsored by Senators Coats, Hollings, Helms, \nFaircloth, and Hutchinson from Arkansas.\n  The current formula was established in 1956 to support the building \nof a nationwide, interstate highway system. At that time, it was \nnecessary to redistribute the tax revenues from some States to those \nwith large land areas and low population. As it exists now, the present \nformula is inefficient and unfair. It is inefficient because it is \nbased upon population statistics that were current in 1980. There is no \nallowance for population shifts in the future and, as a result, high \ngrowth areas of the country are left on their own to provide the \ninfrastructure to support growing populations. It is unfair because the \ndisparity in the rates of return creates a policy that, in effect, \nvalues a mile of road in one State three times as much as a similar \nmile of road in another State.\n  Mr. President, the interstate highway program has been an enormous \nsuccess and is now virtually complete. However, the circumstances which \ngave rise to the present formula have changed and it is now time for a \nnew one. Our legislation corrects both the inefficiency and unfairness \nof the current formula. It amends the law to provide that the minimum \nannual allocation to each State from the highway trust fund be equal to \nthat State's share of contributions to the fund. This formula will \nallocate funds where they are most needed. The General Accounting \nOffice, in a November 1995 study, noted that highway trust fund \ncontributions bear a high correlation to the need for highway funding \nin a given area. Moreover, under this new formula, as population grows \nand economic activity increases, additional infrustructure funding will \nbe available.\n  Mr. President, this bill presents a fair and workable formula for \ndistributing funds under the next highway bill. I urge my colleagues to \njoin us in support of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 752\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. MINIMUM ALLOCATION.\n\n       (a) Fiscal Year 1998 and Thereafter.--Section 157(a) of \n     title 23, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n       ``(5) Fiscal year 1998 and thereafter.--In fiscal year 1998 \n     and each fiscal year thereafter, on October 1, or as soon as \n     possible thereafter, the Secretary shall allocate among the \n     States amounts sufficient to ensure that a State's percentage \n     of the total apportionments in each fiscal year and \n     allocations for the prior fiscal year from funds made \n     available out of the Highway Trust Fund is not less than 100 \n     percent of the percentage of estimated tax payments \n     attributable to highway users in the State paid into the \n     Highway Trust Fund in the latest fiscal year for which data \n     are available.''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 157(a)(4) of title 23, \n     United States Code, is amended by striking the paragraph \n     designation and all that follows before ``on October 1'' and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(4) Fiscal years 1992-1997.--In each of fiscal years 1992 \n     through 1997,''.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today I am proud to join Senator \nThurmond in introducing legislation to bring fairness to Federal \ntransportation funding. This legislation would guarantee that the \nFederal Government would return to each State the same share of gas tax \nfunds that it had paid into the transportation trust fund.\n  In 1991, I voted against the current transportation law, known as \n``ISTEA.'' Supporters advocated the legislation as a forward-looking \nconsolidation of Federal highway programs, but the heart of the bill--\nthe way it distributed money--looked backward in every sense. It \ntightly tied each State's future funding to past funding levels. It \nused old census data. It used old formula factors which do not even \npass the ``straight face'' test. As the GAO reported, ``the Congress \nelected not to change the basic formula structure'' and thus the key \nfactors in\n\n[[Page S4601]]\n\nthe formula are ``irrelevant'' and ``divorced from current \nconditions.'' In other words, we are currently targeting more than $20 \nbillion of taxpayer funds to the wrong places for the wrong reasons.\n  South Carolina bears the brunt of this inequity. In 1995, South \nCarolina received only 52 cents back for each dollar it paid to the \nhighway trust fund. Over the period of ISTEA, South Carolina received \nonly 70 cents back on the dollar. Let me add that I am not unaware of \nthe overall Federal funding situation in South Carolina. South Carolina \ngets back more Federal tax money than its citizens contribute. Mr. \nPresident, that is as it should be. We are one Nation, and some parts \nof the Nation have lower average incomes. That is no excuse for \ntargeting highway funds in a way that an objective study found to be \n``irrelevant'' and ``divorced from current conditions.''\n  It is rare that a $20 billion problem has a simple solution. I refer \nagain to the independent assessment of the GAO, which said that basing \nFederal payments to States on the amounts States paid in would, would \nmeet two major, commonsense objectives of any highway program:\n  First, it would be a ``relatively simple and direct method of fund \ndistribution.''\n  Second, it would ``tend to correlate highly with highway needs, \nparticularly for major highways.''\n  Furthermore, the GAO found that basing funding on gas tax paid in \nwould effectively kill two birds with one stone by accounting for \nhighway needs and for equity between States with one formula factor.\n  Mr. President, a program that does not target funds to today's needs, \nand which mires States and the Congress in arcane complexity, cries out \nfor revision. The legislation we introduce here today is a good \nstarting point to better address our Nation's highway needs. I urge my \ncolleagues to join us in supporting this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MACK (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Brownback):\n  S. 753. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor individuals who are residents of the District of Columbia a maximum \nrate of tax of 15 percent on income from sources within the District of \nColumbia, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             the district of columbia economic recovery act\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce along with my \ncolleague Senator Lieberman the District of Columbia Economic Recovery \nAct. The social, administrative, and fiscal problems of our Nation's \ncapital are well documented. The District of Columbia is facing its \ngreatest economic crisis since its establishment in 1790. Congress has \ntaken major steps, including the creation of a financial control board, \nto assist the city during this current financial crisis. Despite \nefforts by the District's Government and Congress to manage these \nproblems, the city has a long way to go to achieve economic self-\nsufficiency.\n  Mr. President, at the root of the District's problems is an \nevereroding middle class. Since 1950, Washington's population has \ndeclined by nearly 250,000 residents; 68,000 left between 1988 and 1993 \nalone. The vast majority of these people were middle-class families \nwhose taxes funded the city's operations. Historically, the District of \nColumbia has tried to offset this decline by raising taxes, leading to \neven more residents leaving the city in search of lower tax rates, \nbetter schools and safer streets.\n  We believe that the best way to help the District is to promote \neconomic growth, and the best way to promote economic growth is to \nsignificantly reduce the tax burden on its residents. Economic growth \nwill mean more jobs, more opportunity, greater private sector \ninvestment and ultimately a better quality of life in the Nation's \ncapital.\n  The DCERA is an important step in luring taxpayers back to the \nDistrict of Columbia. It provides tax incentives, including a 15-\npercent flat income tax rate for all District resident and deductions \nof: $15,000 for individual filers; $25,000 for head of household \nfilers; and $30,000 for married filers.\n  Many critics of the flat rate argue that it is a bonanza for the rich \nand the poor, but does little to address the needs of the middle class. \nWe have added several incentives designed specifically to assist the \nmiddle class. First, the bill includes a $5,000 first time home buyers' \nprovision designed to assist middle-class families in purchasing homes \nwithin the District of Columbia. Second, the bill maintains the current \nhome mortgage and charitable deductions. Finally, we have included a \nzero capital gains tax rate to help spur investment by District and \nnon-District residents. Middle class residents should benefit \nsignificantly from this provision because it encourages them to invest \ntheir earnings and it offers a generous reward if and when a middle-\nclass resident sells their homes. Besides these incentives we have \nincluded a brownfields provision that encourages companies to clean up \nenvironmentally damaged land that is sure to improve the quality of \nlife for District residents and their families.\n  This bill also provides an opportunity for all Americans to \nparticipate in the economic stability of the District of Columbia by \nallowing them to have a zero capital gains rate for investments made \nwithin the District. We believe that Americans everywhere have great \npride in this city and truly want it to represent all the best aspects \nof this Nation, including a vibrant economy. For too long the city's \neconomy has been linked with the growth and declines of the Federal \nGovernment. I believe that the capital gains provisions will encourage \nnongovernmental economic investment in the District of Columbia.\n  Washington, DC is not only home to the people who live here, it is \ntruly the Nation's city.\n  We believe that these incentives, along with responsible and sensible \nfinancial management, are just what this great city needs to regain its \npast glory.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am delighted to join with Senators \nMack, Lott, and Brownback as an original cosponsor of this important \nlegislation, the District of Columbia Economic Recovery Act of 1997 \n(DCERA).\n  The District of Columbia belongs to each and every one of us. As \ncitizens of the United States, we have a stake in the successes, and a \nstake in the failures, of Washington, DC. It is America's city. But, \nfor a variety of reasons, not all of them easily explained, Washington \nis in desperate financial straits. The here and now financial prospects \nare grim for the city, and the future gets grimmer. This is largely \nbecause middle-class families, the backbone of any successful \ncommunity, are fleeing the District in alarming numbers.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would instantly transform \nour Nation's capital, making it a more appealing place to live, to \ninvest, to build, to buy, and to work. This bill is designed to reverse \nthe flow of businesses and the middle-class residents who currently are \nfleeing the city for the suburbs. Those still in the District would \nhave new incentives to stay. And many others now living elsewhere would \nhave a very strong incentive to move into the District with their \nfamilies and with their businesses.\n  We cannot make the schools better in the District overnight. We \ncannot promise crime-free streets overnight. We cannot promise a \nrevitalized economy overnight. What we can do is provide middle-class \ntax relief in the District, and as a way to lure these middle-class \ntaxpayers to the District as a way to reestablish a tax base in the \nDistrict. And once we bring these people back, safer streets and better \nschools can follow.\n  This legislation is modeled on legislation that has been introduced \nin the House with broad, bipartisan support, by Representative Eleanor \nHolmes Norton. Both the House and the Senate version of the DCERA \nestablish a maximum Federal tax rate of 15 percent. Both bills double \nthe personal exemption, which would eliminate Federal income taxes for \nsingle residents who make up to $15,000 a year and married couples \nfiling jointly who make up to $30,000 a year. At the same time, the \nbill retains the mortgage and charitable deductions and would allow a \ntaxpayer to file under the old system, if that is what they prefer to \ndo. In contrast to Representative Norton's bill, which provides capital \ngains tax relief only to D.C. residents, our legislation\n\n[[Page S4602]]\n\nestablishes a zero capital gains rate for D.C. investments held by D.C. \nor non-D.C. residents for 3 years. We believe that the broader \nexemption is necessary to spur as much investment in the District as \npossible. Also in contrast to the House DCERA, our bill includes a \n$5,000 credit for first time District home purchases and includes a \nprovision to clean up abandoned brownfields within the District. \nMembers of Congress not representing the District could not take \nadvantage of the tax incentives in the bill, and the District already \nhas enacted legislation ensuring that it would not take advantage of \nthe Federal tax incentives in this bill by raising local taxes.\n\n  I very much see this bill as a first step. Some of the urban problems \nWashington faces are unique to Washington because Washington has no \nState, no broader tax base, to draw on. At the same time, many of \nWashington's problems are problems that are faced by cities all across \nthis country. If this approach works in Washington, I hope we can try \nit in Bridgeport, New Haven, and Hartford as well.\n  I should note that, unlike some proponents of this legislation, I am \nat best an agnostic on a flat tax. I believe progressivity in our tax \nrates is inherently fair and am pleased that the legislation we are \nintroducing today has elements of that progressivity by providing such \na generous personal exemption. At the same time, a good number of our \ncities are facing the loss of their middle-class population and the \nonly way to rebuild that base may be through bold measures like a flat \ntax which has clear and compelling benefits for the middle class. The \npeople we are really anxious to bring back to our cities are the 28 \npercenters. Under the current Tax Code a typical family in the 28-\npercent bracket would be a couple with two children who make roughly \nbetween $39,000 and $95,000 after deductions. Our bill would create a \nvery favorable tax incentive for these people to stay in, or move to, \nthe District.\n  Mr. President, the most important thing there is to say about urban \npolicy in this country is that we really do not have an urban policy. \nWe know what has not worked; today we are introducing legislation that \nwe believe will work and there is no better place to start than in \nWashington, DC, a city that belongs to all Americans. I urge my \ncolleagues to join us in cosponsoring this important legislation.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my \ndistinguished colleagues today to introduce the District of Columbia \nEconomic Recovery Act, a bill which would jumpstart the District's \neconomy and set in motion a commercial, social, and cultural \nrenaissance that will once again make all Americans proud of their \nCapital.\n  I am delighted to find that the District's City Council shares my \nbelief that the enactment of this legislation will be very good for the \ncity. On May 9, 1997, in a resolution to accompany its qualified \nendorsement of the administration's bailout plan, the Council stated \nthat ``. . . the District of Columbia Economic Recovery Act . . . would \nprovide the jolt that is desperately needed to expand the District's \nrevenue base by reversing the hemorrhaging of residents and jobs from \nthe District.''\n  Although this legislation represents a good start toward the \nresolution of the city's problems, much more needs to be done. As \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, \nRestructuring and the District of Columbia, I have just concluded 2 \nmonths of oversight hearings on the District's many problems, including \nthe poor performance of the schools, the high crime rate, and the \ncity's reputation for low quality services. While each of these \nproblems are being addressed in some fashion by the Control Board, they \nare far from being solved, and the city remains desperately in need of \na renewal of its spirit.\n  In the coming weeks I will be exploring with my colleagues, with city \nofficials, and with the administration a series of additional reform \noptions that will help lead to this renewal, and to the recreation of a \nCapital City worthy of a great Nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself, Mr. Inouye, and Mr. Domenici):\n\n  S. 754. A bill to amend the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency \nPrevention Act of 1974 to provide for direct assistance to Indian \ntribes for juvenile justice and delinquency prevention programs, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n       THE INDIAN JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION ACT\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I, along with Senators Inouye and \nDomenici, introduce legislation which will reform the existing Native \nAmerican Pass-Through Program administered by the Office of Juvenile \nJustice and Delinquency Prevention [OJJDP], within the Department of \nJustice, and will create a grant program that will provide direct \nfunding to eligible tribes for the purpose of addressing juvenile \njustice needs in Indian country.\n  Juvenile delinquency is an enormous problem faced by both State and \ntribal governments. A February 1997 report, issued by OJJDP, indicated \nthat law enforcement agencies around the country made an estimated 2.7 \nmillion arrests in 1995 of persons under age 18. This accounted for 18 \npercent of all arrests made during that year. OJJDP also reported that \nwhile the total number of juvenile arrests for violent crimes decreased \nin 1995, the total number of arrests is considerably higher than they \nwere in 1992 and 67 percent higher than the 1986 level.\n  Unfortunately, there are no complete and accurate sets of statistics \navailable on the rate of juvenile delinquency among the American Indian \nand Alaskan Native population as a whole. In spite of this, I think it \nis fair and accurate to say that the threat of an increased rate of \njuvenile delinquency is great in Indian country due to the large and \ngrowing population of Indian youth under the age of 18.\n  In fact, in a hearing conducted by the Senate Committee on Indian \nAffairs on April 8, a representative of the Department of Justice \nstated that ``while violent crime is falling in American cities, it is \nrising on American Indian reservations.'' Despite this, there are still \nabout half as many police officers in Indian country on a per capita \nbasis.\n  Currently, tribal governments which perform law enforcement functions \nare eligible to receive grants through the Native American Pass-Through \nProgram, established through the 1988 amendments to the Juvenile \nJustice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974. Under this program, \nStates must make available to tribes a minimum amount of funding based, \nin part, upon the ratio of the number of Indian juveniles within a \nState's boundaries compared to the total number of juveniles within \nthat State. This funding may go toward a variety of juvenile \ndelinquency prevention, control, or reduction efforts.\n  Based upon the comments of representatives of tribal governments, \nState advisory groups, the National Coalition for Juvenile Justice, and \nState governments, it has become clear to me that the Pass-Through \nProgram is simply not meeting the needs of tribes. First, the minimum \namount of funding each State must make available to tribes is, on \naverage, so minimal that it fails to appropriately address the needs of \nthe tribes. While many States do award grants in excess of the \nrequirement, the amounts tribes receive are often too small to initiate \na program of any magnitude. In addition, many tribes do not even apply \nfor these grants, because the cost of preparing a grant application \nwould exceed the amount of funds awarded. More importantly, the Pass-\nThrough Program exists in conflict with the Federal-tribal government-\nto-government relationship, by requiring tribal governments to depend \nupon the States. If a State chooses not to participate in the program \nor does not meet certain requirements, tribes located within that \nState's boundaries will not receive funds under the act. Because of \nthese and other concerns raised by tribes and juvenile justice \nofficials, I am introducing the Indian Juvenile Justice and Delinquency \nPrevention Improvement Act. This proposal seeks to eliminate the Native \nAmerican Pass-Through Program and replace it with a discretionary grant \nprogram that will provide direct Federal grants to Indian tribes. \nConsistent with the Pass-Through Program, these funds will be used to \nplan and develop programs to prevent and reduce juvenile crime as well \nas to improve the tribal government's juvenile justice system.\n\n[[Page S4603]]\n\n  More specifically, this legislation will require tribes to submit \nprogram plans as part of their grant application to the Administrator \nof OJJDP. Tribes must comply with certain core requirements in order to \ndemonstrate an ability to administer and account for the quality of the \njuvenile justice programs. Finally, this legislation includes a \nreporting requirement similar to the one mandated in the Indian Self-\nDetermination Act.\n  On the administrative side, the legislation directs OJJDP to take \ninto account certain important factors when awarding grants such as a \ntribe's available resources and the population of Indian youth who \nreside within the tribe's jurisdiction. It is also important to note \nthat this legislation in no way prevents tribes from entering into \ncooperative agreements with States or units of local government. Tribes \nare still able to enter into these agreements and apply for State \nfunding should they desire to do so.\n  The prevention, control, and reduction of juvenile delinquency should \nbe one of the top priorities of this Nation. With this legislation, we \nhave the opportunity to provide a better mechanism to deliver funds to \ntribes for the purpose of addressing juvenile justice needs, a much \nbetter mechanism than we currently have.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 754\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to restore the \nprovisions of chapter 76 of that title (relating to missing persons) as \nin effect before the amendments made by the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 1997 and to make other improvements \nto that chapter; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n            THE MISSING PERSONS AUTHORITIES IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, with the approach of Memorial Day, we \nare reminded of the millions of American men and women who have \ndedicated and sacrificed their lives in service to the U.S. Armed \nForces. And for far too many, it is a day to remember those service \nmembers who have yet to return home from the wars they valiantly fought \nmany years ago.\n  During the last Congress, we passed the Missing Service Personnel \nAct. Specifically, this bill created a framework of accountability \nwithin the Department of Defense to establish the status and location \nof our missing Armed Forces personnel. Until this legislation was \nintroduced in 1995, the procedures for handling missing service \npersonnel had remained unchanged for more than 50 years. This \nlegislation improved procedures for reviewing POW/MIA cases and \nprotected the missing service member from being declared dead solely \nbased on the passage of time. Gathering 47 cosponsors in the Senate and \nachieving unanimous passage in the House, the bill became law in \nFebruary 1996. However, an amendment to the 1997 Defense Authorization \nConference Report repealed its strongest provisions.\n  Today, I am introducing The Missing Persons Authorities Improvement \nAct of 1997 in an effort to restore not only those lost provisions but \nto also offer a sense of accountability for our missing service \npersonnel and their loved ones. A companion bill has already been \nintroduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Ben Gilman of \nNew York.\n  One major provision to be restored requires that military unit \ncommanders report and initiate a search within 48 hours from the time a \nperson has been deemed missing. Right now, a soldier can be missing for \nup to ten days before a report and search must be made.\n  Another restored provision protects civilian defense employees and \ncontractors who become missing as a result of hostile action. These \ncivilians who serve with, or accompany the Armed Forces in the field \nunder orders and place their lives in danger, should be entitled to the \nsame protection that is given to uniformed soldiers.\n  This bill also includes a provision which requires that if remains \nare recovered and are not identifiable through visual means, \ncertification must be made by a forensic scientist that the remains \nrecovered are, in fact, the missing person. In the past, hasty and \nspeculative conclusions have often lead to misidentification and \nultimately, undue emotional hardship for MIA families. It is our \nobligation to take full advantage of our current technological \ncapabilities and provide the families of missing service personnel with \ncertain, respectful closure in every case possible.\n  As a veteran who served in Korea, I am especially proud to also \ninclude an additional provision that calls for the establishment of \npersonnel files for Korean conflict cases. Under this provision, if any \nnew information is discovered that indicates that the soldier may not \nhave been killed during the Korean War, a new case must be opened or an \nexisting one must be reviewed. There are currently some 8,000 of my \nKorean war colleagues who have never been accounted for. The recent \nefforts by the many families of Korean War MIA's to learn the fate of \ntheir loved ones only reinforce the necessity for this provision. These \nfamilies deserve our respect and attention.\n  This legislation is supported by numerous veterans' service \norganizations such as the American Legion, the Disabled American \nVeterans, the Korean and Cold War Families Association, and the \nNational League of POW/MIA Families.\n  This bill asks the Department of Defense only to make the best \npossible effort to recover and return our missing personnel. It is the \nleast we owe our soldiers, past and present, who endanger their lives \nin defense of our country. It is the very least we owe the families who \nhave and will endure the pain and uncertainty of a loved one left \nunaccounted for at a time of war.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record. I also ask unanimous consent that Senator Ford be included \nas an original cosponsor to this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 755\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the health, education, and welfare of \nchildren under 6 years of age; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/15/senate-section/article/S4588-8", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4606-S4611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, no issue is more important in America than \nfocusing on the urgent needs of young children. This country must \nrededicate itself to investing in children, an investment which will \nhave tremendous returns. Early intervention can have a powerful effect \non reducing government welfare, health, criminal justice, and education \nexpenditures in the long run. By taking steps now we can significantly \nreduce later destructive behavior such as school dropout, drug use, and \ncriminal acts. A study of the High/Scope Foundation's Perry Preschool \nfound that at-risk toddlers who received preschooling and a weekly home \nvisit reduced the risk that these children would grow up to become \nchronic lawbreakers by a startling 80 percent. The Syracuse University \nfamily development study showed that providing quality early childhood \nprograms to families until children reached age 5 reduces the \nchildren's risk of delinquency 10 years later by 90 percent. It's no \nwonder that a recent survey of police chiefs found that 9 out of 10 \nsaid that America could sharply reduce crime if government invested \nmore in these early intervention programs.\n  These programs are successful because children's experiences during \ntheir early years of life lay the foundation for their future \ndevelopment. Our failure to provide young children what they need \nduring this period has long-term consequences and costs for America. \nRecent scientific evidence conclusively demonstrates that enhancing \nchildren's physical, social, emotional, and intellectual development \nwill result in tremendous benefits for children, families, and our \nNation. The electrical activity of brain cells actually changes the \nphysical structure of the brain itself. Without a stimulating \nenvironment, the baby's brain suffers. At birth, a baby's brain \ncontains 100 billion neurons, roughly as many nerve cells as there are \nstars in the Milky Way. But the wiring pattern between these neurons \ndevelops over time. Children who play very little or are rarely touched \ndevelop brains 20 to 30 percent smaller than normal for their age.\n  Mr. President, reversing these problems later in life is far more \ndifficult and costly. I want to discuss several examples.\n  First, poverty seriously impairs young children's language \ndevelopment, math skills, IQ scores, and their later school completion. \nPoor young children also are at heightened risk of infant mortality, \nanemia, and stunted growth. Of the 12 million children under the age of \n3 in the United States today, 3 million--25 percent--live in poverty.\n  Second, three out of five mothers with children younger than 3 work, \nbut one study found that 40 percent of the facilities at child care \ncenters serving infants provided care of such poor quality as to \nactually jeopardize children's health, safety, or development.\n  Third, in more than half of the States, one out of every four \nchildren between 19 months and 3 years of age is not fully immunized \nagainst common childhood diseases. Children who are not immunized are \nmore likely to contact preventable diseases, which can cause long-term \nharm.\n  And fourth, children younger than 3 make up 27 percent of the 1 \nmillion children who are determined to be abused or neglected each \nyear. Of the 1,200 children who died from abuse and neglect in 1995, 85 \npercent were younger than 5 and 45 percent were younger than 1.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, our Government expenditure patterns are \ninverse to the most important early development period for human \nbeings. Although we know that early investment can dramatically reduce \nlater remedial and social costs, currently our Nation spends more than \n$35 billion over 5 years on Federal programs for at-risk or delinquent \nyouth and child welfare programs.\n  Today we seek to change our priorities and put children first. I am \nintroducing the Early Childhood Development Act of 1997 to help empower \nlocal communities to provide essential interventions in the lives of \nour youngest at-risk children and their families. I am delighted that \nSenators Rockefeller, Murray, Kennedy, Hollings, Wellstone, Moseley-\nBraun, and Harkin are joining me as cosponsors of this bill.\n  This legislation seeks to provide support to families by minimizing \nGovernment bureaucracy and maximizing local initiatives. We would \nprovide additional funding to communities to expand the thousands of \nsuccessful efforts for at-risk children ages zero to six such as those \nsponsored by the United Way, Boys and Girls Clubs, and other less well-\nknown grassroots organizations, as well as State initiatives such as \nSuccess By Six in Massachusetts and Vermont, the Parents as Teachers \nProgram in Missouri, Healthy Families in Indiana, and the Early \nChildhood Initiative in Pittsburgh, PA. All are short on resources. And \nnowhere do we adequately meet demand although we know that many States \nand local communities deliver efficient, cost-effective, and necessary \nservices. Extending the reach of these successful programs to millions \nof children currently underserved will increase our national well-being \nand ultimately save billions of dollars.\n  The second part of this bill would provide funding to States to help \nthem provide a subsidy to all working poor families to purchase quality \nchild care for infants, toddlers, and preschool children. We would not \ncreate a new program but would simply increase resources for the \nsuccessful Child Care\n\n[[Page S4607]]\n\nand Development Block Grant (CCDBG). Child care for infants and \ntoddlers is much more expensive than for older children since a higher \nlevel of care is necessary. Additional funding would also pay for \nimproving the salaries and training level of child care workers, \nimproving the facilities of child care centers and family child care \nhomes, and providing enriched developmentally appropriate educational \nopportunities.\n  The bill would also establish a scholarship fund for child care \nworkers who earn a degree in early childhood development and then work \nwith infants and toddlers in child care settings for 2 years. Child \ncare providers now are underpaid and frequently receive inadequate \ntraining, which causes higher turnover and lower quality care for \nchildren.\n  The bill would also expand the uses of time allowed under the Family \nand Medical Leave Act [FMLA] to promote parental involvement in schools \nand child care centers. Parents or guardians would be allowed to use up \nto 24 hours per year of FMLA time to participate in school and center \nactivities such as parent-teacher conferences, interviewing for a new \nschool or child care center, and getting an assessment for services in \na family literacy program. This leave would be within the maximum 12 \nweeks of time currently allowed under the FMLA.\n  Finally, the bill would increase funding for the Early Head Start \nProgram. The successful Head Start Program provides quality services to \n4- and 5-year-olds. The Early Head Start Program, which currently is a \nmodest program funded at $200 million annually, provides comprehensive \nchild development and family support services to infants and toddlers. \nExpanding this program would help more young children receive the early \nassistance they need.\n  I was delighted to be joined yesterday by Governor Dean of Vermont \nand Governor Romer of Colorado in announcing this legislation. I also \nam happy to have a wide range of groups and individuals endorsing this \nbill including the Association of Jewish Family and Children's \nAgencies, Boys and Girls Clubs of America, Catholic Charities USA, \nChildren's Defense Fund, Child Welfare League of America, Coalition on \nHuman Needs, Jewish Council for Public Affairs, National Black Child \nDevelopment Institute, Inc., National Center for the Early Childhood \nWork Force, National Council of Churches of Christ in the USA, \nReligious Action Center of Reform Judaism, and Rob Reiner of the I Am \nYour Child Campaign.\n  Children need certain supports during their early critical years if \nthey are to thrive and grow to be contributing adults. I look forward \nto working with both sides of the aisle to pass this legislation and \nensure that all children arrive at school ready to learn.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 756\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings--\n       (1) The Nation's highest priority should be to ensure that \n     children begin school ready to learn.\n       (2) New scientific research shows that the electrical \n     activity of brain cells actually changes the physical \n     structure of the brain itself and that without a stimulating \n     environment, a baby's brain will suffer. At birth, a baby's \n     brain contains 100,000,000,000 neurons, roughly as many nerve \n     cells as there are stars in the Milky Way. But the wiring \n     pattern between these neurons develops over time. Children \n     who play very little or are rarely touched develop brains \n     that are 20 to 30 percent smaller than normal for their age.\n       (3) This scientific evidence also conclusively demonstrates \n     that enhancing children's physical, social, emotional, and \n     intellectual development will result in tremendous benefits \n     for children, families, and our Nation.\n       (4) Since more than 50 percent of the mothers of children \n     under the age of 3 now work outside of the home, our society \n     must change to provide new supports so young children receive \n     the attention and care that they need.\n       (5) There are 12,000,000 children under the age of 3 in the \n     United States today and 1 in 4 lives in poverty.\n       (6) Compared with most other industrialized countries, the \n     United States has a higher infant mortality rate, a higher \n     proportion of low-birth weight babies, and a smaller \n     proportion of babies immunized against childhood diseases.\n       (7) National and local studies have found a strong link \n     between increased violence and crime among youth when there \n     is no early intervention.\n       (8) The United States will spend more than $35,000,000,000 \n     over the next 5 years on Federal programs for at-risk or \n     delinquent youth and child welfare programs, which address \n     crisis situations which frequently could be avoided or made \n     much less severe with good early interventions.\n       (9) Many local communities across the country have \n     developed successful early childhood efforts and with \n     additional resources could expand and enhance opportunities \n     for young children.\n                 TITLE I--ASSISTANCE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN\n\n     SEC. 101.

ACCESS CHARGES FOR USE OF \n                              THE INTERNET\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself and Mr. Leahy) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation:\n\n                               S. Res. 86\n\n       Whereas with the enactment of the Telecommunications Act of \n     1996 (Public Law 104-104), Congress sought to stimulate \n     through the competitive marketplace the rapid deployment of \n     new communications technologies at the lowest possible cost \n     to the customers;\n       Whereas the Internet is the most noteworthy example of the \n     development of an advanced communications network, having \n     expanded from the four linked sites of its precursor network \n     in 1969 to become the first ubiquitous, interactive advanced \n     communications network today;\n       Whereas the Internet is a digital electronic environment \n     where different forms of multimedia flow freely and \n     efficiently;\n       Whereas over 15,000,000 households are currently connected \n     to the Internet and 43,000,000 households are expected to be \n     so connected by the year 2000;\n       Whereas the Internet is an invaluable tool for personal \n     communications, education, telemedicine, and better \n     integrating the elderly, the disabled, and individuals living \n     in remote locations into the life of the Nation;\n\n[[Page S4612]]\n\n       Whereas the development of an electronic marketplace over \n     the Internet will be a competitive stimulus to the national \n     economy, with the amount of electronic commerce expected to \n     grow to $80,000,000,000 by the year 2000;\n       Whereas commerce over the Internet will empower consumers \n     by offering a myriad of options for comparison shopping \n     information gathering, and purchasing opportunities;\n       Whereas commerce over the Internet has also proven an \n     important start-up mechanism for small businesses by \n     providing minimal barriers to entry and by acting as a \n     ubiquitous, cost-effective distribution system;\n       Whereas innovative companies in all economic sectors have \n     tied their economic future to the continued growth and \n     success of the Internet;\n       Whereas the Internet is the medium of choice for electronic \n     commerce, electronic mail, multimedia, and corporate \n     Intranets;\n       Whereas the Internet has succeeded as a result of its \n     responsiveness to technical challenges unencumbered by any \n     preconceptions imposed by regulation relating to its \n     development; and\n       Whereas the imposition of telephone access charges by \n     regulation would inhibit the development of the Internet and \n     discourage the use of the Internet at a time when the \n     national policy should be to promote the development of \n     advance telecommunications networks such as the Internet: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     telecommunications policy of the United States should support \n     the continued unfettered growth of the Internet by--\n       (1) encouraging greater dialogue between the Local Exchange \n     Carriers and the Internet community in the effort to reach a \n     mutually beneficial resolution to the issues relating to \n     connecting to the internet; and\n       (2) encouraging the removal of impediments to the \n     introduction of competition, and in particular, in the \n     provision of new technologies and services to connecting to \n     the internet and other advanced networks.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nregarding access charges on the Internet. This resolution conveys the \nsense of the U.S. Senate that telephone access charges for Internet use \nwill impede the Internet's continued growth and development and, \ntherefore, should be discouraged.\n  The rise of the Internet has been truly phenomenal. From the four \nlinked sites of its 1969 precursor, the Internet has developed into an \nadvanced telecommunications network that was unimagined only a decade \nago. Today, over 15,000,000 households are currently connected to the \nInternet, and some industry analysts expect this number to rise to \n43,000,000 by the year 2000. These new users will continue to find an \nincreasing amount of options and assistance available to them online. \nWhether the Internet is used to meet new friends, do online banking, \ncompare medical or scientific research or do shopping, as services \nincrease, the Internet will become an indispensable part of everyday \nlife.\n  Personal uses aside, many believe the Internet's greatest growth \npotential lies in the evolution of online commerce. The Internet is \nclearly the technology of the future and innovative companies are \nstaking their future on the public's increased access to this network. \nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, online commerce was estimated at \n$518 million in 1996 and is expected to reach $1.14 billion in 1997.\n  Not surprisingly though, the surge of Internet use has led to some \nunexpected difficulties. Industry studies indicate that Internet usage \nis growing at up to 42 percent per year, and some Local Exchange \nCarrier's [LEC] contend this increasing traffic could exceed the \ncurrent phone system's capacity. While studies differ on the scope or \nextent of this problem, it seems clear that, ultimately, a significant \ninvestment in the telephone infrastructure will be required if gridlock \nis to be avoided. To fund this infrastructure, some of the LEC's \nsupport an Internet user fee to help fund the installation of new \ncircuits designed to head-off any congestion problems.\n  Rather than install more, inefficient analog switches, however, it is \nmy hope that the Local Exchange Carriers will work to upgrade their \ntelephone systems to digital transmissions just as satellite \ntransmitters, wireless, and long-distance companies have undertaken the \ntransition to digital. Last year, a coalition of high-technology \ncompanies in support of this concept organized to oppose traditional \ntelephone fees for Internet use. Consumers, they argue, will be \nreluctant to use the Internet if new fees are imposed without such \nproduct improvement. I agree. The Nation's telephone system needs \nimprovement in order to meet the challenges of 21st century technology \nand consumer expectations. For this to happen, the telephone \ninfrastructure will require technological improvements, not just \nadditional capacity.\n  In my opinion, if we are to maximize the potential for this new \ntechnology, it is important that we recognize the exciting \ntechnological changes ongoing in communications. In particular, when \naddressing problems caused by the surge in Internet use, I believe \nAmerica should focus on ways to optimize this medium's efficiency. \nCharging additional regulatory fees for access to the Internet, I fear, \ncould have the unintended consequence of limiting the public's ability \nand desire to connect. If, as a result of some new form of access fee, \nless people use the Internet, then we will have passed up a great \nopportunity to advance the public's investment and involvement in one \nof the truly revolutionary technological advancements of this century. \nI hope that the advanced-technology companies which depend on the \nInternet and the local carriers which help provide service can come to \na mutually beneficial agreement on Internet services absent the \nimposition of additional fees for Internet use.\n  The likelihood of such an agreement was probably heightened by last \nweeks announcement by the Federal Communications Commission that it \nwill not permit the Local Exchange Carriers to charge user fees for \nconnecting to the internet. This resolution demonstrates congressional \nsupport for the FCC position. This sense of the Senate resolution \noutlines the dramatic growth of the Internet, spells out the benefits \navailable online and recognizes the potential for digital commerce. \nMore importantly, the resolution demonstrates that it is time for the \nInternet providers and the local phone companies to work together to \nresolve this conundrum before it becomes a real problem.\n  With so many different issues surrounding the Internet today, it is \neasy to lose track of the industries' latest developments. This \nlegislation, however, addresses what I believe to be the most \nfundamental Internet issue: affordability. All of the amazing tools \nprovided by the Internet and all its conveniences will be meaningless \nif, in our zeal to control the Internet, we price its access beyond the \nreach of average Americans. This nonbinding resolution expresses the \ndesire of the Senate to avoid such a mistake, and I urge my colleagues \nto support it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor this resolution \nwith Senator Abraham. I feel strongly that the Senate needs to speak \nout on the importance that our future telecommunications policy will \nplay in the growth of commerce on the Internet.\n  The Internet was born in 1974, but I missed the birth announcement. \nLike many who later would become avid Internet users, I let several \nyears slip by before realizing the incredible potential of this new \ntool--that computers could virtually connect you to anyone, anywhere, \nanytime.\n  The Internet is changing more than the speed of communications; it is \nchanging the very dynamics of communication. Though still in its \ninfancy, it already is beginning to change the way we do business. Over \nthe past 2 years, sales generated through the Web grew more than 5,000 \npercent. And Net merchants are expected to sell billions of dollars \nworth of goods by the end of the century. This is a tremendous \npotential market for businesses.\n  While Internet growth has been explosive, concrete standards for \nInternet commerce have not been set. Most online users still do not buy \nand sell goods over the Internet because they are afraid online hackers \nwill steal their financial information. These are legitimate concerns \nthat still have to be addressed by emerging security technologies.\n  That is why I have worked with industry leaders during the past two \nyears to find ways to promote more secure encryption technology. Better \nencryption means safer online commerce. We should be working with the \nprivate sector to help set standards that provide a secure Internet \nwhere people are safe paying their bills from their home computers. We \nshould also encourage greater dialogue between Local Exchange Carriers \nand the Internet community. We do not want\n\n[[Page S4613]]\n\nto choke Internet growth with excessive phone charges for Internet \naccess.\n  I use the Internet on a daily basis for anything from finding the \nlatest Batman movie clips to online chats with Vermont schools. My work \non Internet issues has earned me the nickname of ``the Cyber Senator.'' \nI have had many nicknames in my life. Some have been better than others \nbut I am proud of this nickname because as the Cyber Senator, I can \nhelp Vermonters. That is why the Internet is so important to me.\n  In two key ways, the opportunities opened by the Internet are a \nperfect match for Vermont.\n  First, cyber-selling compliments our community-centered, \nenvironmentally-conscious style. In the past 25 years, Vermonters have \nshown uncommon stewardship in preserving our State's quality of life. \nOther States that only now are discovering these values will have \ntrouble recapturing what already has eroded. Since the Internet allows \nanyone to work anywhere in the world, why not in Vermont where you can \nenjoy a unique lifestyle?\n  Second, throughout this century, we Vermonters have been held back \nbecause we are not geographically near any major markets to sell our \ngoods. Now, through the Internet, we can sell our goods in the blink of \nan eye to anyone in the world.\n  Some pioneering Vermont businesses are already venturing into \ncyberspace. My home page on the World Wide Web is linked to Web sites \nof more than 100 Vermont businesses, ranging from the Quill Bookstore \nin Manchester Center to Jay Peak Ski Resort. For instance, The Flying \nNoodle in Waterbury Center now sells about 30 percent of its gourmet \npasta and sauces over the Internet and has regular customers in Japan, \nGuam, Germany, France, and South Korea.\n  We all have visions of what we want for Vermont as we enter the 21st \ncentury. My vision is that the Internet will unlock the potential for \nany Vermonter--and especially, our children--to stay in our beautiful \nstate to earn a living. The Internet is a place where Vermonters can \nexchange ideas with people across the world with the stroke of a key or \nthe click of a mouse.\n  Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Michigan for submitting \nthis resolution. It is strongly supported by the American Electronics \nAssociation, Business Software Alliance, and many other groups devoted \nto the growth of Internet commerce. I urge my colleagues to support our \nresolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/15/senate-section/article/S4611-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4613-S4614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               THE FAMILY FRIENDLY WORKPLACE ACT OF 1997\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       JEFFORDS AMENDMENT NO. 280\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. JEFFORDS submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe amendment No. 244 submitted by Mrs. Murray to the bill (S. 4) to \namend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to provide to private sector \nemployees the same opportunities for time-and-a-half compensatory time \noff, biweekly work programs, and flexible credit hour programs as \nFederal employees currently enjoy to help balance the demands and needs \nof work and family, to clarify the provisions relating to exemptions of \ncertain professionals from the minimum wage and overtime requirements \nof the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, and for other purposes; as \nfollows:\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC.   .

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Comprehensive Abortion Ban \n     Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) As the Supreme Court recognized in Roe v. Wade, the \n     government has an ``important and legitimate interest in \n     preserving and protecting the health of the pregnant woman . \n     . . and has still another important and legitimate interest \n     in protecting the potentiality of human life. These interests \n     are separate and distinct. Each grow in substantiality as the \n     woman approaches term and,\n\n[[Page S4615]]\n\n     at a point during pregnancy, each becomes compelling''.\n       (2) In delineating at what point the Government's interest \n     in fetal life becomes ``compelling'', Roe v. Wade held that \n     ``a State may not prohibit any woman from making the ultimate \n     decision to terminate her pregnancy before viability'', a \n     conclusion reaffirmed in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern \n     Pennsylvania v. Casey.\n       (3) Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. \n     Casey also reiterated the holding in Roe v. Wade that the \n     government's interest in potential life becomes compelling \n     with fetal viability, stating that ``subsequent to viability, \n     the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of \n     human life may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, \n     abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical \n     judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the \n     mother''.\n       (4) According to the Supreme Court, viability ``is the time \n     at which there is a realistic possibility of maintaining and \n     nourishing a life outside the womb, so that the independent \n     existence of the second life can in reason and all fairness \n     be the object of State protection that now overrides the \n     rights of the woman''.\n       (5) The Supreme Court has thus indicated that it is \n     constitutional for Congress to ban abortions occurring after \n     viability so long as the ban does not apply when a woman's \n     life or health faces a serious threat.\n       (6) Even when it is necessary to terminate a pregnancy to \n     save the life or health of the mother, every medically \n     appropriate measure should be taken to deliver a viable \n     fetus.\n       (7) It is well established that women may suffer serious \n     health conditions during pregnancy, such as breast cancer, \n     preeclampsia, uterine rupture or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, \n     among others, that may require the pregnancy to be \n     terminated.\n       (8) While such situations are rare, not only would it be \n     unconstitutional but it would be unconscionable for Congress \n     to ban abortions in such cases, forcing women to endure \n     severe damage to their health and, in some cases, risk early \n     death.\n       (9) In cases where the mother's health is not at such high \n     risk, however, it is appropriate for Congress to assert its \n     ``compelling interest'' in fetal life by prohibiting \n     abortions after fetal viability.\n       (10) While many States have banned abortions of viable \n     fetuses, in some States it continues to be legal for a \n     healthy woman to abort a viable fetus.\n       (11) As a result, women seeking abortions may travel \n     between the States to take advantage of differing State laws.\n       (12) To prevent abortions of viable fetuses not \n     necessitated by severe medical complications, Congress must \n     act to make such abortions illegal in all States.\n       (13) abortion of a viable fetus should be prohibited \n     throughout the United States, unless a woman's life or health \n     is threatened and, even when it is necessary to terminate the \n     pregnancy, every measure should be taken, consistent with the \n     goals of protecting the mother's life and health, to preserve \n     the life and health of the fetus.\n\n     SEC. 3. ABORTION PROHIBITION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Title 18, United States Code, is amended \n     by inserting after chapter 73 the following:\n\n                   ``CHAPTER 74--ABORTION PROHIBITION\n\n``Sec.\n``1531.

Mr. President, I rise today to welcome Jose Ramos-\nHorta to California. In recognition of his indefatigable efforts on \nbehalf of the people of his native East Timor, Mr. Ramos-Horta was \ncoawarded the 1996 Nobel Prize for Peace. He will be in San Francisco \nin June to participate in a 3-day conference on peacemaking. There he \nwill be joined by numerous national and world leaders including fellow \nNobel laureates, the Dalai Lama of Tibet and Rigoberta Menchu of \nGuatemala.\n  The issue of East Timor has a special relevance in California, which \nis home to the largest concentration of Portuguese-Americans in the \nUnited States. Shortly after Portugal took steps in 1974 to end \npolitical oppression at home, it withdrew from most of its foreign \nterritories, including East Timor. Although Portugal ceased to exercise \ncolonial influence over East Timor in the midseventies, it has remained \nan important voice of conscience regarding East Timor ever since.\n  As may be expected at the conclusion of 500 years of foreign rule, a \nbrief period of struggle ensued between rival factions in East Timor. \nFor many, the pain of this civil strife was tempered with optimism over \nthe prospect of imminent, peaceful self-rule. Exiled by colonialist \nauthorities for his early proindependence stance, Mr. Horta was \nparticularly encouraged by events.\n  This hope of a budding nation was crushed when troops from \nneighboring Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975. Annexation followed \nthe next year and so began a period of often brutal occupation. \nRegrettably, over 20 years later, for many East Timorese the dream of \npolitical independence has been replaced, at least in the short term, \nby the struggle for the most basic of human rights.\n  In self-imposed exile since the invasion, Jose Ramos-Horta has never \nforgotten his homeland and its desire for peace and freedom. He \ntravels, writes, and speaks continually about what has occurred and \nwhat is occurring in East Timor. It is testament to his passion and the \nresilience of his countrymen\n\n[[Page S4617]]\n\nthat the troubles of this small island no longer fester in obscurity.\n  Jose Ramos-Horta is the latest in a distinguished succession of \nmodern leaders who have sacrificed and continue to sacrifice much for \nthe causes of peace and justice. I know I join many of my colleagues \nand millions of others when I say that it is my hope that, like Nelson \nMandela, Lech Walesa, and Andrei Sakharov, Mr. Ramos-Horta's crusade \nmeets with rapid success and spurs further advances in human rights \nacross Asia and the world.\n  He and his words of peace and dignity are always welcome in \nCalifornia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/15/senate-section/article/S4616-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        IN RECOGNITION OF JEWISH HERITAGE WEEK, MAY 11-18, 1997\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is with great pride and pleasure \nthat I rise today to call my colleagues' attention to President \nClinton's proclamation designating May 11-18, 1997, as Jewish Heritage \nWeek.\n  Jewish Heritage Week was initiated in 1976 by the Jewish Community \nRelations Council to celebrate the significant contributions Jewish \npeople have made to American history and culture. It is observed every \nspring, during the season in which Jewish people commemorate Passover, \nYom Hashoah (Holocaust Memorial Day) and Yom Ha'atzmaut (Israel \nIndependence Day). In my home State of Michigan, a number of displays \ncelebrating the week are on display in libraries in Oakland County on \nthe theme ``These Jewish Americans Have Made This Country and the World \na Better Place.'' The achievements of notable Jewish-Americans are \nhighlighted, such as Dr. Jonas Salk, who discovered the polio vaccine, \nNathan Straus, who introduced pasteurized milk in America, movie \nlegends Samuel Goldwyn and Steven Spielberg, Nobel prize winners Henry \nKissinger and Saul Bellow, and musical giants George Gershwin and \nIrving Berlin, among many others.\n  I would like to recognize the efforts of the artists and organizers \nof these exhibits, who have helped to bring the spirit of Jewish \nHeritage Week to Michigan. They include Ann Barnett, Maynard Feldman, \nHoward Fridson, Julian Lefkowitz, Helen Naimark, and Sara Schiff.\n  In his proclamation last year, the President eloquently stated that \n``Jewish-Americans have infused our Nation with a powerful faith, a \ncommitment to family and community, and a devotion to scholarship and \nself-improvement. We can draw strength and inspiration from the \nenduring lessons of Judaism and it is entirely fitting that we honor \nthe great traditions of its followers.'' I hope my colleagues will join \nme and the millions of others who are celebrating the achievements of \nJewish-Americans during Jewish Heritage Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/15/senate-section/article/S4617-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE COURT IN THE SCHOOLS/CRITICAL LIFE CHOICES PROGRAM\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an \ninnovative anti-crime program in my State targeted toward young people. \nEstablished in 1993 by Judge Michael A. Martone of the 52d District \nCourt in Troy, MI, the Court in the Schools/Critical Life Choices \nProgram is an admirable and effective effort to teach middle and high \nschool students how to make the right choices in life.\n  In part one of this two part program a middle or high school's \nauditorium or cafeteria is transformed into a courtroom. Judge Martone, \nif in his own jurisdiction, or a local judge, then try actual pending \ncases involving youthful, nonviolent misdemeanors, such as first and \nsecond offense drinking and driving cases, controlled substance cases, \nand shoplifting cases, in front of the assembled students.\n  In part two of the program, Judge Martone interacts with the students \nto coach them on how to intelligently analyze risks and make critical \nlife choices. With the aid of television news segments and taped video \nvignettes of tragedies resulting from youthful indiscretion, the \nstudents and Judge Martone engage in an insightful and constructive \ndialog.\n  To date, over 15,000 students have participated in the program. This \nlow-cost, high-impact program is making a difference in young people's \nlives. When students see for themselves a defendant handcuffed and \ntaken into custody, Judge Martone says student response is measured by \nbeing able to hear a pin drop.\n  I commend Judge Martone for his tireless work on behalf of America's \nchildren. In fact, Judge Martone maintains a standing offer to help \nother communities, both in Michigan and across the Nation, to develop \nand implement their own Court in the Schools/Critical Life Choices \nprograms. I urge all my colleagues to consider the benefits of \nutilizing such a program in their own respective States, and, if \ninterested, either contact the Troy Community Coalition for the \nPrevention of Drug and Alcohol Abuse at 248-740-0431, or \nrepresentatives in my office for further information.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/15/senate-section/article/S4617-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ROY ROGERS AND DALE EVANS 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to two \nof my heroes, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans and to congratulate them on \ntheir year-long 50th wedding anniversary celebration. Roy Rogers and \nDale Evans, the world's most popular cowboy and cowgirl ever, have \ninspired and entertained millions of Americans during the span of their \ncareers.\n  Roy Rogers has appeared in more than 100 films since his debut in \n1935, starring in most of them. During the peak of his career, from the \nearly 1940's to the mid-1950's, he drew film audiences of about 80 \nmillion Americans per year and inspired fans around the world to \norganize record-size clubs. Roy moved on to other media in the 1950's, \nstarring with his wife, Dale, in ``The Roy Rogers Show'' on television \nand in several long-running radio variety shows.\n  In whatever venture they have pursued, Roy and Dale have served as \nwonderful, positive examples to all of us. It is with great admiration \nand respect that I congratulate Roy Rogers and Dale Evans on their 50th \nanniversary year. I thank Roy and Dale for teaching us that the good \nguys do win.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/15/senate-section/article/S4617-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       DEPUTY JASON HENDRIX: LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER OF THE YEAR\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to extend my most sincere \ncongratulations to Deputy Jason Hendrix of the San Bernardino County \nSheriff's Department on being honored today by the American Police Hall \nof Fame as its ``1997 Law Enforcement Officer of the Year.'' We are \nextremely fortunate to have an officer of Deputy Hendrix's caliber and \ncommitment, and I commend him for the outstanding act of bravery that \nresulted in receipt of this award.\n  While off duty in March of last year, Deputy Hendrix observed an \narmed man holding two employees hostage in front of a crowded store. \nAfter sending his fiancee to dial 911, Hendrix startled the suspect and \npromptly secured the release of the hostages. An exchange of gunfire \nfollowed, in which Deputy Hendrix disabled the suspect and was himself \nshot six times. The subject was subdued by another off duty officer and \nstore employees.\n  Few of us can appreciate the perils faced daily by the men and women \nof law enforcement. Each year dozens of peace officers are killed in \nthe line of duty. I am thankful that Deputy Hendrix survived this \nconfrontation, and I know that his family, friends, and colleagues are \ngrateful for his recovery.\n  I commend the selflessness and courage exhibited by Deputy Jason \nHendrix on March 30, 1996. His act of valor almost certainly saved the \nlives of many innocent bystanders. His disregard for his own personal \nsafety in defense of others represents the very best spirit of law \nenforcement. It is fitting that on this occasion, National Peace \nOfficers Memorial Day, we thank Deputy Hendrix and all California \npolice officers who regularly take risks and make sacrifices in service \nto their communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/15/senate-section/article/S4617-4", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4617-S4618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SALUTING IDAHO'S HALL OF FAME JOCKEY\n\n Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise to salute an outstanding \nyoung man who has made his mark as a professional athlete--jockey Gary \nStevens, a native Idahoan.\n\n[[Page S4618]]\n\n  Gary Stevens won the Kentucky Derby on Silver Charm earlier this \nmonth, becoming the only active jockey to win the Derby three times. \nGary won it on Winning Colors in 1988 and Thunder Gulch in 1995. Gary \njoins a select group of jockeys as three-time Derby winners.\n  Gary Stevens' accomplishments are worthy of Hall of Fame \nconsideration. And indeed, Gary was recently elected to the National \nThoroughbred Racing Hall of Fame. At 34, he is one of the youngest to \nwin election to the Hall.\n  A native of Caldwell, Idaho, Gary Stevens attended Capital High \nSchool in Boise. He won his first race at the age of 16 riding at Les \nBois Park in Boise. Even at such an early age, it was clear to racing \nfans that he had a gift and his talents would lead to something \nspecial. Horse racing experts say Gary is a master of pace--once he \ngets a horse in the lead, he has the ability to get the horse to relax \nand pace itself so it has enough to win the race.\n  If needed, he can come from behind, as he did in the Derby. Gary says \nonce he got Silver Charm in the lead, the horse's ears popped up, and \nGary said he knew his colt was relaxed and in good position.\n  Over his career, Gary Stevens has won over four thousand races and \nmore than one hundred million dollars in purses. For all his success, \nhe remembers his roots. Sportswriters heard him say after the Derby, \n``The kid from Idaho can still do it.'' And his family and friends in \nIdaho are rooting for him. Thousands of fans at Les Bois Park cheered \nhim on as they watched the Derby simulcast. They will always remember \nhim as ``their'' jockey. His peers also recognize Gary's special \ntalents and personality. He was elected this year as President of the \nJockey's Guild, an honor because his fellow riders have chosen him to \nrepresent their profession.\n  I know that every Idahoan joins me in congratulating Gary Stevens for \nwinning his third Kentucky Derby and for his election to the Hall of \nFame. I also want to acknowledge his parents, Ron and Barb, for their \ncontributions to horse racing in Idaho and for raising such a fine son. \nRon still trains horses at Les Bois Park, so the Stevens family remains \na part of Idaho's racing scene.\n  So, Mr. President, I am pleased to wish Gary good luck this weekend \nat the Preakness Stakes, where he will once again ride Silver Charm. \nGary Stevens is a winner--a winner I am proud to say who is also an \nIdahoan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/15/senate-section/article/S4617-5", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           JUDGE DAMON KEITH\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my congratulations \nto Federal appellate Judge Damon J. Keith, recently named the 1997 \nrecipient of the American Bar Association's Thurgood Marshall Award.\n  Judge Keith was born on Detroit's west side and attended Northwestern \nHigh School. After graduation from West Virginia State College, service \nin the U.S. Army during World War II, and graduation from Howard \nUniversity Law School, Keith returned home to Detroit and set up a law \npractice. President Lyndon Johnson appointed Keith to the U.S. District \nCourt in 1967 where he served until 1977, when he was appointed to the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. He took senior status in \n1995.\n  Mr. President, I join all his well wishers in saluting Judge Damon \nKeith and his illustrious career, and I ask that the following \neditorial from the May 12, 1997 Detroit Free Press be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n      Damon Keith: Award Recognizes His Gifts of Justice, Service\n\n       Congratulations to federal Judge Damon Keith on being named \n     the 1997 winner of the American Bar Association's Thurgood \n     Marshall Award. It is a richly deserved honor that reflects \n     not only the high esteem in which he is held by his peers but \n     also the commitment to social justice and equality to which \n     he has dedicated his life.\n       The award, named in honor of the late Supreme Court justice \n     and the first African American to serve on that court, goes \n     annually to a nominee with a history of substantial and long-\n     term contributions to the advancement of civil rights, civil \n     liberties and human rights in the United States. Judge Keith \n     is the sixth recipient since the award was conceived and \n     first given to Justice Marshall himself in 1992.\n       A senior judge in the 60th Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge \n     Keith has served 30 years on the trial and appellate benches. \n     His rulings on civil liberties, civil rights and equal \n     protection have given hope to many previously disfranchised \n     Americans.\n       Like his mentor, Justice Marshall, Judge Keith is a patriot \n     of the first order. His commitment has never wavered to a \n     vision of America that lives up to the demands of the Bill of \n     Rights and treats each citizen with the dignity and respect \n     due him or her regardless of race, sex or social status. His \n     contributions offer promise of a society we have yet to \n     become but, with his leadership, will one day achieve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/15/senate-section/article/S4618-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4618-S4619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION--AN EFFECTIVE VOICE FOR SMALL \n                               BUSINESS?\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to call on the Small \nBusiness Administration (SBA) to fulfill its role as advocate for the \nhardworking men and women who have made small business the backbone of \nour nation's economy. As Chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I \nhave heard countless hours of testimony from small businesses who look \nto the SBA for information assistance and advocacy.\n  The SBA's role as an effective voice for small business within the \nexecutive branch recently came under fire during the final days of the \nOffice of Management and Budget's (OMB) review of an Environmental \nProtection Agency (EPA) regulation to expand the number of industries \ncovered by the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) reporting requirements. \nThe proposed inclusion of two industries, comprised predominantly of \nsmall businesses, was brought into question by the SBA and numerous \nMembers of Congress. The affected small businesses had data to support \ntheir case for exclusion, and some of the data on which EPA had based \nits proposed rule was inaccurate. Despite the strength of their case, \nthese small businesses found their views unwelcome at EPA. They \nappropriately turned to SBA to articulate the small business views to \nthe administration.\n  As the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business, I was \ndismayed when effective advocacy by the SBA on behalf of small business \nwas criticized as improper. In a letter sent to SBA Administrator Aida \nAlvarez, efforts to communicate the small business perspective were \ncharacterized as ``elements within [SBA] . . . actively working to \nundermine [the TRI] initiative.'' The important working relationship \nbetween SBA and its small business constituency was alleged to be an \nimproper use of ``taxpayer funds to conduct lobbying efforts on behalf \nof private lobbyists. . . .'' In response to this criticism, the SBA \ntemporarily removed staff from working on TRI and asked the Inspector \nGeneral to review the matter.\n  The Ranking Minority member on the Committee, Senator Kerry, joined \nme in sending a letter to the Administrator of the SBA, expressing our \nsupport for the Office of Advocacy and the SBA's role on behalf of \nsmall businesses. I ask that the text of our letter and the response I \nrecently received from James F. Hoobler, Inspector General for the SBA, \nbe printed in the Record. I am delighted to say that the role of the \nSBA, the Office of Advocacy and the individual staff member, whose \ndedication to the cause of small business was unfairly criticized, were \nfound to have ``acted properly and ethically.'' The Inspector General \nadded, ``SBA is statutorily mandated to support and speak up for the \ninterests of small business. . . . To do otherwise would be contrary to \nits mandated responsibilities.''\n  The SBA worked closely with the affected small businesses in an \neffort to ensure that their side of the story was heard. The SBA's \nvoice apparently caught the ear of OMB, which prolonged its \nconsideration of the rule beyond the usual 90-day review period. The \ndebate that ensured on the merits of the rule and the basis for \nregulating the small employers is exactly the type of policy discussion \nthe SBA should facilitate. In fact, during her confirmation hearing \nbefore the Committee on Small Business, SBA Administrator Aida Alvarez \nannounced her commitment to being an effective voice for small business \nwithin the Administration. Ms. Alvarez pledged to carry the views and \nconcerns of small business to the agencies involved and to be an \nadvocate for small business at the Cabinet table and in her \ninteractions with the President. I sincerely hope Administrator Alvarez \nwill keep to her word.\n\n[[Page S4619]]\n\nOn the TRI rule, however, the Clinton administration did not. No \naccommodation, such as a threshold for reporting to cover only those \nsectors of the industry that arguably merited coverage, was made for \nthe small businesses in the affected industries.\n  Mr. President, it is well known that federal regulations have \nhistorically imposed a disproportionate burden on small business. Last \nyear, we enacted the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness \nAct--better known to small businesses as the Red Tape Reduction Act--to \nprovide tools to ensure that small businesses get a fair shake in \nagency rulemakings and enforcement actions. As the author of the Red \nTape Reduction Act and Chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I \nam committed to ensuring that small businesses have the opportunity to \nuse the tools provided by Congress, including access to and effective \nrepresentation by SBA. The SBA and its Office of Advocacy has an \nimportant advocacy role to play on behalf of the hardworking men and \nwomen whose entrepreneurial spirit makes the small business sector so \nvibrant. In addition to providing information and assistance, the SBA \nmust rededicate itself to being an effective voice for small business.\n  The material follows:\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Small Business,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 16, 1997.\n     Hon. Aida Alvarez,\n     Administrator, U.S. Small Business Administration, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Administrator Alvarez: Questions have been raised \n     regarding the activities of the Small Business \n     Administration's Office of Advocacy. As the Chairman and \n     Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business, we \n     would agree that any credible allegations of improper conduct \n     should be looked into. We are equally convinced, however, \n     that being a determined advocate for the concerns of small \n     businesses is not improper conduct by the Chief Counsel of \n     Advocacy or his employees. The statutory role of SBA as the \n     voice for small business within the executive branch, a role \n     that has been enhanced after last year's passage of the Small \n     Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, must not be \n     compromised.\n       As the Administrator of SBA, you are keenly aware that the \n     Office of Advocacy is expected to work with and on behalf of \n     small business and their representatives as an essential part \n     of its statutory mission. The effectiveness of SBA on behalf \n     of our nation's small entrepreneurs and employers depends on \n     communication with individual small businesses, their trade \n     associations and other representatives. We trust that as SBA \n     Administrator you will reject any attempt to chill proactive \n     advocacy for small businesses by the Chief Counsel and others \n     at SBA. To do otherwise would send a clear and alarming \n     signal to small businesses, and would call into question the \n     ability of SBA to carry out the critical responsibilities \n     given to it under SBREFA and other laws.\n       We hope you share our commitment to ensuring that the \n     unique concerns and interests of small businesses are given \n     appropriate consideration by executive branch agencies. We \n     look forward to learning what efforts you will take to \n     support the important role historically played by the SBA and \n     its Office of Advocacy as an effective voice for small \n     business.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Christopher S. Bond,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           U.S. Small Business Administration,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 29, 1997.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Small Business, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Bond: Thank you for your and Senator Kerry's \n     supportive letter of April 16, 1997, to SBA Administrator \n     Alvarez. In view of your strong conviction in the role of the \n     SBA as a voice for small business, I believe you should be \n     aware of the results of a recent investigation conducted by \n     my office.\n       Subsequent to receipt of a complaint about possible \n     improper activity by SBA's Office of Advocacy in connection \n     with proposed expansion of the Toxic Release Inventory, my \n     Investigations Division conducted a thorough inquiry into the \n     allegations. We found that the Office of Advocacy acted \n     properly and ethically. Moreover, as you pointed out, SBA is \n     statutorily-mandated to support and speak up for the \n     interests of small business. During the matter in question, \n     the Office of Advocacy was carrying out its mission in \n     support of small business. To do otherwise would be contrary \n     to its mandated responsibilities.\n       Again, thank you for the vote of confidence, and, rest \n     assured, my office would not hesitate to take action if SBA \n     activities were improper. Should you, or your staff, have any \n     questions, please contact Assistant Inspector General for \n     Investigations Steve Marica at (202) 205-6220 and refer to \n     Office of Inspector General file number 07-0497-03.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 James F. Hoobler,\n     Inspector General.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/15/senate-section/article/S4618-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4619-S4620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO GEORGE J. COLLINS\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nGeorge J. Collins, a resident of Springfield, VA, who died March 23, \n1997. Mr. Collins had a distinguished career of public service at the \nGovernment Printing Office [GPO]. At the time of his death, Mr. Collins \nwas manager of the GPO's Quality Control and Technical Department, with \nresponsibility for the development of product standards and quality \nattributes, testing, and inspection, as well as the supply of inks, \nadhesives, and other materials used in Government printing.\n  A native of Springfield, OH, Mr. Collins served in the U.S. Marine \nCorps. He received his bachelor of arts degree from Wittenberg College \nand pursued additional studies at the University of Cincinnati, \nPennsylvania State University, North Dakota State College, the National \nCash Register [NCR] Co., and with international correspondence schools. \nHe earned certification in a variety of technical specialties, \nincluding high polymers, paint technology, water and waste treatment, \nindustrial chemistry, and statistical methods.\n  Before entering Government service, Mr. Collins worked at NCR as \nsenior research chemist in charge of their polymer group. Earlier \nexperiences included service as a research chemist with the \nCommonwealth Engineering Co. of Ohio, the Chadaloid Corp., and New \nWrinkle, Inc. He also worked for the city of Springfield, OH, and the \nOliver Corp. as a laboratory technician.\n  Mr. Collins began his career at the GPO in 1963 as supervisory \nchemist in the ink and reprography division of the Quality Control and \nTechnical Department. He was promoted to deputy manager of the \ndepartment in December 1974 and to manager in 1982. During his service \nwith the GPO, Mr. Collins contributed to the development of plastic \nprinting rollers, automated bank checks, and U.S. mail processing based \non tagged inks. He chaired the interagency task group that developed \nthe Federal Information Processing [FIPS] Standard for optical \ncharacter recognition [OCR] form design, which proved to be the most \npopular FIPS standard ever published.\n  Mr. Collins initiated the GPO's environmental testing and control \nprogram. He established the organization that promulgated the GPO's \nQuality Assurance Through Attributes [QATAP] Program. The QATAP Program \nwas a singular achievement that resulted in the use of quantifiable \nattributes for measuring quality in Government printing, and it is \ncentral to the GPO's program of procuring more than 75 percent of all \nprinting annually from the private sector.\n  Mr. Collins served on the Joint Committee on Printing's Advisory \nCouncil on Paper Specifications, which establishes standards for the \nacquisition of printing and writing papers for Government use, \nincluding recycled paper. In 1994 he assisted the enactment of \nlegislation requiring that all Federal lithographic printing be \nperformed utilizing vegetable oil-based inks. Today, the Congressional \nRecord and other congressional information products are produced on \nrecycled paper with vegetable-based inks, products that Mr. Collins was \ninstrumental in helping to introduce for Government use. He also worked \non increasing the use of permanent papers for the production of records \nwith enduring educational and research value.\n  Mr. Collins was a member of numerous professional and industry \ngroups, and he represented the GPO on several advisory boards and \ncommittees. He was affiliated with the Franklin Technical Society of \nWashington, DC, the National Association of Litho Clubs [NALC], the \nTechnical Association of the Graphic Arts [TAGA], the Technical \nAssociation of the Pulp and Paper Industry [TAPPI], the American \nChemical Society [ACS], Toastmasters International, and the Committee \nfor Graphic Arts Technologies and Standards [CGATS]. He was the \nrecipient of various awards for his professional activities, including \nthe Award of Excellence from the Printing Institute of America's \nExecutive Development Institute, and several GPO awards.\n  Mr. Collins was a devoted husband to his wife Eleanor, father to 5 \ndaughters, and grandfather to 14 grandchildren.\n\n[[Page S4620]]\n\n  Throughout his career, Mr. Collins exemplified skill in his \nprofession and dedication to public service, and his contributions have \nmade Government printing more cost-effective, efficient, and \nenvironmentally sound. I join with the employees of the Government \nPrinting Office in expressing my sincere condolences to Mr. Collins' \nwife Eleanor and his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/15/senate-section/article/S4619-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   APPOINTMENTS BY THE VICE PRESIDENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have spoken many times in recent \nmonths on my concerns for the growing threat to our kids from drug use. \nAll of our early warning systems are sounding the alarm. All our major \nnational reviews of drug trends indicate the emerging pattern. What \nthey show is that month by month, day by day, minute by minute, drug \nuse among our young people is on the rise. They also make clear that \nattitudes among young people about the dangers of drugs are changing--\nfor the worse. More and more kids, some as young as 10 and 11, are \nseeing drug use as OK, as no big deal.\n  Let's stop for a minute and reflect on just what these facts mean. \nFor those of us who remember how the last drug epidemic in this country \ngot started, the present trend is truly disturbing. Think for a moment \non what happened and how it happened. In the late 1970's and early \n1980's, we saw the streets of our inner cities become battlegrounds. We \nsaw many of our communities, our schools our public and private spaces \noverwhelmed with violence, addiction, and abuse. We saw families \ndestroyed and individual lives shattered. The problem became so serious \nthat the public demanded action. The Congress responded with \ncomprehensive drug legislation in 1986 and 1988. We supported massive \nincreases in public funding to fight back. We still do. To the tune of \nsome $16 billion annually at the Federal level alone.\n  That problem, the one we spend all this money on, began with our \nkids. It began because we as a country allowed people to sell us on the \nidea that drugs were OK. We bought the idea that individuals could use \ndangerous drugs responsibly.\n  The consequence was the drug epidemic of the 1970's and 1980's. An \nepidemic whose long-term effects we are still coping with. Let's remind \nourselves who the principal audience was that was listening to all the \ntalk about responsible drug use. It was kids. It was the baby boom \ngeneration in their teens who heard the message and took it to heart. \nIt was a generation of young people who bought the message. It did not \ntake them long to translate the idea that they could use drugs \nresponsibility into the notion that they had a responsibility to use \ndrugs.\n  As a result, today, a large percentage of baby boomers have tried \ndrugs. Many of those are today's drug addicts and dealers. Many of them \nare today's parents who feel disarmed in talking to their own kids \nabout drug use.\n  Today, we are on the verge of making the same mistake again. After \nyears of progress in reducing drug use among kids, it is this very \npopulation that is at risk. Once again, we are seeing the glorification \nof drug use. Increasingly the music our kids are listening to conveys a \ndrugs-are-okay message. The normalization of drug use is creeping back \ninto movies, advertising, and TV. And who do you think is listening? \nThe answer is in the numbers.\n  Teenage drug use is now in its fifth year of increases. And the age \nof onset of use is dropping. Our last epidemic started with 16 and 17 \nyear olds. Today's ``at-risk'' population, the age of onset, is 12 and \n13 year olds.\n  One of the major reasons for this is that we have lost our message. \nWe have in recent years been inconsistent. And, we are seeing a more \nsophisticated effort by some to once again promote the idea that drug \nuse is okay. And they are targeting our young people.\n  Nothing brings this home better than an item in the Washington Post \non 27 April.\n  The Sunday's Outlook section had a piece by a young woman in a New \nYork City high school. She wrote about a recent drug lecture in her \nhealth science class. The article, entitled ``Lessons You Didn't Mean \nto Teach Us,'' is arresting. I invite all my colleagues to read the \npiece. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion or of my remarks.\n  The Article official without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The article is based on a letter this young woman wrote \nto her teacher. She felt compelled to write following a lecture to her \nclass by what was billed as a former drug addict. As she says, she \nexpected to hear about the dangers of drug use. What she and the class \ngot, however, was very different.\n  In this case, a very clean-cut looking young man, identified as a \nformer addict, spoke. While the teacher was present, the speaker \nevidently did talk about the problems of his personal drug use. Once \nthe teacher left the room, though, the message changed. Instead of an \nanti-message, the lecture became a mini-course on drugs, drug use, and \nhow to make a killing selling drugs. Among the things the speaker \npassed on was a recipe for a stronger form of cocaine. The speaker \nextolled the virtues of being stoned. He ``raved'' about the incredible \namounts of money to be made peddling drugs. He left the class with the \nadvice that since no one could drug test for alcohol, that it was okay \nto drink.\n  The teacher in this particular class, based on negative feedback, has \ndecided not to leave classes alone with future guest speakers. \nUnfortunately, as the young woman who wrote about this incident notes, \nthe damage is done.\n  Mr. President, if you, or any of my colleagues, have not yet read \nthis letter, I encourage you to do so. The story that it tells is very \npoignant, and very disturbing. We know that there is a growing \nacceptance of drug use among our children. We can see the reports and \nthe story they tell. But what we don't always appreciate is why.\n  As this letter makes clear, the drugs-are-okay message is back. I \nwould hope that this lecture by this individual was an accident and a \none-time occurrence. But I am concerned that it is representative of a \ngrowing effort to influence the young. His talk apparently\n\n[[Page S4621]]\n\nhad everything but free samples. As the author of this letter tells us, \n``. . . the way in which he spoke of drugs made them seem appealing and \nbeneficial.'' This type of message is not isolated.\n  From music to videos to movies and advertisement, we are seeing \nefforts once again to glamorize drugs. We have seen initiatives in \nseveral states to push drug legalization under various disguises. Just \nrecently a micro-brewery in Maryland has begun to market a beer made \nwith marijuana seeds under the title ``Hempen.''\n  Not too long ago some of our major fashion industry folks began to \nuse models with the ``Heroin Chic'' look. We are seeing opinion leaders \nand members of our cultural elite portray drug use as simply a personal \nchoice that is harmless and benign. Many of these individuals act as if \nthe only issue is for responsible adults to decide for themselves. They \nspeak as if it is only adults that we need to think about. This, \nhowever, is not in fact the case.\n  If you do not believe this, talk to parents. Talk to teachers. Talk \nto the health and law enforcement professionals who daily see the \nconsequences. Visit the emergency room of your local hospital and talk \nto the doctors and nurses who see every day the effects of drug use.\n  Go to a treatment center and sit and talk to some of the patients, \nlisten to their stories of how drug use has destroyed their lives, \ntheir families.\n  But most important, listen to what kids are telling us about what is \nhappening in their schools. To their friends. Ask them where they get \ntheir information, and who they listen to. If this letter tells us \nanything, it is that we must listen to our kids, if for no other reason \nso we know whom they are listening to. Above all, we need to do a \nbetter job at delivering a clear, consistent, no-use message to our \nkids.\n  As we move into the appropriations cycle, we need to keep that need \nfirmly in mind. We cannot repeat the mistake that we made in the 1960's \nand 1970's. Last time we had a drug epidemic we could claim ignorance. \nWe don't have any excuses if we let it happen again.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                  Lessons You Didn't Mean To Teach Us\n\n       After a former drug abuser came to speak to four 10th-grade \n     health classes at a suburban New York City high school, 16-\n     year-old Victoria Slade sent this letter anonymously to her \n     teacher. The teacher subsequently told the classes that, \n     because of negative feedback, she would not leave guest \n     speakers alone with students. Slade has since told the \n     teacher that the letter was from her. It is being reprinted \n     with Slade's permission.\n       I am a student in one of your health classes this semester. \n     As a transfer student from a very small private school, I am \n     daily finding out shocking things about the various actions \n     and addictions of my peers. I am currently drug-free, \n     alcohol-free, pot-free, smoke-free, etc. The solid background \n     I received from my previous school ensures that I will remain \n     thus, but I am extremely concerned about my classmates, many \n     of whom I fear are already trying drugs and alcohol. For this \n     reason, I was glad when you announced that the surprise guest \n     speaker was someone who had been addicted to cocaine and \n     marijuana. I expected that seeing what happens to you when \n     you get into drugs would make many students reconsider what \n     they were doing. However, I was sadly mistaken in this \n     assumption.\n       The guest speaker entered as a well-dressed, good-looking \n     individual. He was relatively well-spoken and complemented \n     his serious discussion with occasional light humor. He was \n     described as a good student who got into trouble and was \n     saved by his loving teachers. In our eyes, he became the \n     victim of a corrupt police force and government. Soon \n     forgotten was the fact that he got himself into this trouble \n     through the sale and consumption of illegal substances. While \n     you were present in the room, the young man acted in \n     accordance with your wishes: we could relate to him, and so \n     we listened attentively to the important lesson he was \n     teaching us.\n       However, once you left the room, this tragic figure opened \n     with the line: ``So, do you guys have any questions? I can \n     tell you anything you want to know about drugs.'' He \n     continued in the same manner, describing the different \n     effects of different drugs: which were best, which made you \n     able to concentrate better, how cocaine kept him awake so he \n     could study. When asked if you could remember what you \n     studied the next day, he responded with an emphatic \n     affirmative. He mentioned that if you studied while under the \n     influence of marijuana, you wouldn't do well on the test \n     unless you were high again while taking it, in which case \n     you would perform to the best of your ability. His \n     explanation for this phenomenon was that you are on a \n     different level of consciousness while high. Furthermore, \n     he assured us that being high on marijuana has no effect \n     on your ability to drive, as your reaction time is not \n     altered by the drug. He described the various types of \n     Ecstasy, explaining that he took the 70-percent drug-\n     content one once and became very ill. However, he soon \n     canceled this out by describing the type with 30 percent \n     drug content as ``nice.'' Also, he gave us a recipe for a \n     different, stronger form of cocaine.\n       The pleasing physical effect of drugs was not the sole \n     topic of conversation. At one point, someone asked him why he \n     would get into drugs if he was doing well in school and \n     getting good grades. This question led him into a 10-minute \n     exaltation of selling drugs for a living. He raved about the \n     incredible amounts of money he made, mentioning more than \n     twice the fact that he had four nice cars. We were all \n     impressed when he said that he made over $500,000 in just \n     four years of selling drugs. I's sure that those of us who \n     work were thinking contendedly--of our five-dollar-an-hour \n     jobs cleaning the toilets and places like McDonald's and \n     Boston Market.\n       Our new role model summed up his report on the world of \n     drugs by telling us that he was still smoking weed until just \n     a few days before. He said he wanted to smoke as much as he \n     could before he had to be clean for the Navy drug test. Also, \n     he informed us that if he had not been caught, he would \n     definitely still be using and dealing drugs now. One of his \n     final bits of advice was that they couldn't screen you for \n     alcohol, so it is okay to drink.\n       There were many other appalling statements made by this \n     gentleman which quite disturbed me. As I mentioned earlier, \n     many students at this school are into drugs and alcohol. I \n     think that the idea behind this visit was good: We could live \n     vicariously through this young man, whose life is (or should \n     be) all but destroyed because of drugs. However, the way in \n     which he spoke of drugs made them seem appealing and \n     beneficial. It upsets me to think of how many classes of \n     impressionable youths were influenced by this man--how many \n     minds were made up by his wonderful tale. I hope that you do \n     not promote future visits with this particular guest speaker \n     and thank you for your attention.\n           Sincerely,\n     A Concerned Student.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/15/senate-section/article/S4620-4", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4621-S4622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS I\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the House is in the process of taking \nsteps to alter fundamentally the annual certification process for \ndrugs. In addition, there have been a number of statements in the press \nand elsewhere by Members of Congress and others on problems with \ncertification. Individuals in the Administration, including the Drug \nCzar, have also broached the idea of change. I agree that some form of \nstrengthening of the certification process is needed. Indeed, I offered \nmy ``Three Strikes and you're out'' bill last year with the idea of \nmaking the certification process tougher. I also suggested some fixes \nthis last February in the debate over Mexico. But I also think that it \nis important to take a hard look at what the certification process is \nbefore we tinker with it.\n  The recent discussion of the certification process is born out of \nfrustration over the decision on Mexico. I share some of these concerns \nand the frustration. But the present effort is little more than an \nattempt to water down congressional oversight of US narcotics policy. \nIt does so in the name of flexibility. It does so/so that we won't be \ntoo hard on our international partners. I believe this approach is \nwrong. And I will vigorously oppose efforts to short change the \npublic's interest in upholding tough standards for certification.\n  Since much of the discussion in recent weeks on certification is \nbased on a series of myths about it, I think it is useful to review \nsome of these misconceptions.\n  The principal myth is that the certification process unfairly brands \nother countries for drug supply problems. It also maintains that this \nis unfair while the United States does nothing to deal with its demand \nproblem.\n  There are several things wrong with this view. First, even if the \nUnited States did nothing about demand, we have a right and an \nobligation to do something about supply. This is especially true since \nmost of the dangerous, illegal drugs used in this country are produced \noverseas. These drugs are then smuggled into the United States, often \nwith the collusion of public officials in other countries.\n  Our right to stop this flow stems from the fact that we and virtually \nevery other country in the world are signatories of international \nagreements. These agreements bind us and them to action to stop drug \nproduction, trafficking, and money laundering. Moreover, most of these \nsame\n\n[[Page S4622]]\n\ncountries--including the ones we certify--have made drug production, \ntrafficking, and money laundering illegal under their own laws. And, \nmany of these countries have bilateral agreements with the United \nStates that commit them to take meaningful action against drugs. Thus, \ncountries are bound to act in terms of international law. They are \ncommitted to binding agreements with the United States. And they have \nobligations in terms of their own domestic legal frameworks.\n  It is neither unfair nor presumptuous for the United States to expect \nother countries to abide by laws and commitments that they have made. \nNor are we being a busybody or arbitrary when we expect and require \ncountries to uphold appropriate international standards of conduct. \nIndeed, it is only by insisting that such principles of conduct be \nobserved that we have any hope of sustaining respect for and observance \nof international law. This is understood when it comes to judging other \ncountries on their compliance with a host of other international \ncanons.\n  After all, we expect countries to observe principles governing human \nrights, sound environmental practices, fair trade, counterterrorism, \nand intellectual property rights, to name but a few. The United States \nhas been a leader in promoting respect for these areas of concern.\n  Congress has passed a host of certification requirements regarding \nthem. In part, this is because we recognize that failure to uphold \nthese principles in the face of willful or negligent disregard is to \nabandon the idea of standards altogether. And it makes at least as much \nsense to hold other countries responsible for trafficking in dangerous \ndrugs as it does to scold them for trafficking in pirated CD's.\n  As I said, we also have an obligation to uphold these standards. Our \nobligation is to the American people and to the policies we promote in \ntheir interest. Protection the citizens of this country from enemies, \nforeign and domestic, is one of our most important responsibilities. \nStopping dangerous drugs coming to this country from abroad falls \nsquarely into this category.\n  If we are prepared to enforce sanctions for violations of \nintellectual property rights, it is hardly excessive to judge \ncooperation by other countries to stop the flow of illegal drugs. After \nall, not one American has died from Chinese counterfeit CDs. China \nWhite heroin, on the other hand, has killed countless of our fellow \ncitizens and ruined the lives of tens of thousands more. This points up \nour obligation to uphold international standards of conduct.\n  Somehow, though, when it comes to the drug issue, many seem to \nbelieve that expecting good conduct is wrong. They seem to hold to the \nnotion that it is unfair. They act as if it is unkind to expect \ncountries to comply with international law, solemn agreements, and \ntheir own legal requirements.\n  Some seem to believe that it is outrageous that we also take steps to \nprotect our national interest. Now, since many of the people who voice \nthis latter concern are the leaders of drug producing and transit \ncountries, we can take their complaints with a grain of salt. But the \ndomestic critics are a different matter. To them, all I have to say is \nthat it would be irresponsible for the United States to put the \nconcerns and interests of other countries before those of the American \npeople. Period.\n  As I said, we would be justified in certifying other countries on \ndrug cooperation even if we did nothing at home. But we in fact do a \ngreat deal. Out of a $16 billion counter-drug budget, less than 10 \npercent is spent on actions outside the United States.\n  Over 90 percent is devoted to domestic programs, many of these \nefforts to control demand. And this is just at the Federal level. \nStates, local communities, and private organizations spend this much \nand a great deal more on demand reduction. Thus, we spend annually more \nthan $32 billion to deal with our demand problem. There is not another \ncountry in the world that devotes such resources to the problem at \nhome.\n  I remind my colleagues and the critics of the certification process \nthat the standard for certification is not unconditional success. This \nis true whether we are talking about Mexico or California. To get a \npassing grade on drug cooperation does not mean that a country has to \nhave totally eliminated drug production or trafficking, or, for that \nmatter, use.\n  It requires a good faith effort. The certification law takes into \nconsideration the many problems with stopping drug production and \ntransit. Thus, it is not unexpected that individuals can disagree on \nthe results. It is not a sign of failure if the Congress and the \nPresident should disagree. Nor should such disagreements be the \noccasion for throwing overboard the very process we have for ensuring \ncooperation. And it does do this. Over the course of the certification \nprocess, we have seen more countries take the issue seriously. They do \nthis because they are aware that we take it seriously. We have taught \nour own administration and other countries that cooperation on drugs is \nimportant. To now abandon the chief tool that we have is to run from \nour responsibilities at the first sign of unpleasantness.\n  Certification is not perfect. No legislative tool is. We must, \nhowever, not expect more than is realistic. The present process clearly \nindicates Congress' expectation that countries, including our own, will \ndemonstrate serious commitment. That commitment requires more than \npious words. It expects action and demonstrable results. Failing that, \nit is wholly within our right to judge and to take appropriate steps. \nIt is also an obligation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/15/senate-section/article/S4621-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
