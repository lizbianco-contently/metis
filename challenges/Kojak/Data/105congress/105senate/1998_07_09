Mr. President, I have just returned after spending a week \nin my home State of North Dakota. On six previous occasions, I have \ncome to the floor to describe to my colleagues what is happening there. \nI have described it as a stealth disaster. Last year, we faced a \nremarkable set of disasters, with the worst winter in our history, \nfollowed by the most powerful winter storm in 50 years, followed then \nby the 500-year flood, and, in the midst of all that, an outbreak of \nfire that destroyed much of downtown Grand Forks.\n  Those disasters received enormous attention. Daily, the national news \nmedia covered what was happening, so people all across America saw what \nwas happening in North Dakota, and the people of the United States \nmoved to respond. They responded with extraordinary generosity. We \ndeeply appreciate what the people of this country did for North Dakota \nlast year.\n  Mr. President, the disaster continues this year. Only this year, it \nis attended by almost no national news coverage and there is very \nlittle understanding of the depths of the crisis. This is a disaster \nnonetheless. This disaster is not as visible because it is a disaster \noccurring on the 30,000 farms of the State of North Dakota. From 1996 \nto 1997, according to the Government's own figures, farm income in \nNorth Dakota dropped 98 percent. That is not a misstatement, that is \nwhat the Government's own figures reveal, that farm income from 1996 to \n1997 dropped 98 percent in the State of North Dakota. We led the Nation \nin farm income decline. And, by whatever measure one takes, this is a \ndisaster.\n  It is a disaster caused by bad prices, bad weather, and bad policy. \nWe have the lowest prices on record when adjusted for inflation. We \nhave a continuation of the weather cycle that led to the incredible \nstorms and flooding of last year. Now we are caught up in a wet weather \ncycle that has led to an outbreak of disastrous disease--scab infects \nthe crops of North Dakota. Last year, it cost about a third of the \ncrop. But not only did it damage the crop, it also reduced the grade of \nthe grain that we produce, so that farmers got a lower price. That, in \nthe midst of the weakest prices, adjusted for inflation, that we have \nseen in the grain markets for 30 years.\n  The result is, farmers cannot cash-flow. The result is, farmers are \nbeing forced off the land. The result is, we have massive auction sales \nall across the State of North Dakota. The result is, farmers coming to \nme and bankers coming to me and Main Street business people coming to \nme saying, ``Senator, there is something radically wrong, and something \nhas to be done or we are going to lose a vast number of our farmers.'' \nMr. President, we now start to see that prophecy unfold.\n\n  I brought with me upcoming auctions that appeared in the local \nnewspaper. These auctions tell a story. These auctions are of farm \nafter farm after farm being put up for sale because the farmers cannot \ncash-flow.\n  This starts on Monday, March 9, at 11 a.m. and runs right through \nMarch. Every day there is sale after sale after sale of farms in North \nDakota. I just had farmers tell me that for the first time in 100 \nyears, there is land that will not be farmed.\n  Some say, ``Well, North Dakota is a marginal State. North Dakota has \nmarginal weather to begin with.'' That is true in part of North Dakota, \nbut this is happening in the richest part of North Dakota. This is \nhappening in the Red River Valley of North Dakota. This is the richest \nfarmland in the world. I grew up being told there had never been a crop \nfailure in the Red River Valley. Never in history had there been a crop \nfailure. For the last 5 years, farmers have not had a normal crop in \nthe Red River Valley of North Dakota.\n  I just went through the southeastern corner of our State. What I saw \nin six counties was extraordinary. They are under water. They have 2 \nand 3 feet of water in the fields. They have had more rain in the first \n6 months than they normally get in a year and a half. There is not \ngoing to be a normal crop in those six counties, and that is the \nsoutheastern part of the State. It has been the northeastern part that \nhas been so hard hit in the last year.\n  This weather pattern seems to be expanding, taking in more and more \nland, more and more farms inundated, more and more farmers who aren't \ngoing to have a crop or going to have a badly diminished crop and, on \ntop of that, are going to have very weak prices. The result will be \neven more auctions.\n  Already we anticipate losing one in every 10 of our farmers this \nyear. Experts that we met with when the Secretary of Agriculture came \nto North Dakota 3 weeks ago told us next year we might anticipate \nlosing one of every three farmers. This is a disaster of enormous \nscope, Mr. President, and I hope I can convince my colleagues that it \nis critically important that we respond.\n  This chart shows 141 farm auctions scheduled between the beginning of \nMarch and the end of June. That is nearly two auctions every day for 4 \nmonths.\n  Who are these farmers who are advertising auctions? I am very sorry \nto report to my colleagues that these are not farmers of retirement \nage. Many of these farmers are young farmers who simply can't take the \ndebt load; they simply can't take being in a circumstance of bad \nweather, bad prices and bad policy. The result is they are leaving \nfarming.\n  One has to ask, Who is going to farm this land in the future? Who is \ngoing to provide the food stocks for the American people, because if \nthere is ever a breadbasket State, it is North Dakota. We are No. 1 in \nthe production of crop after crop after crop. We are No. 1 in durum \nthat goes to produce pasta. Over 65 percent of the durum wheat produced \nin the United States is produced in North Dakota; No. 1 in barley; No. \n1 in sunflower; No. 1 in canola; No. 1 in many of the other wheat \ncategories. North Dakota literally is a breadbasket State, and North \nDakota is in disaster. There is no other way to describe it. The result \nis going to be a calamity unless there is a response.\n  We see these auctions. This is a typical one: April 14, 1998. This \nfellow is going to have an auction. It says:\n\n       Darryl has rented out the farm and, therefore, will \n     liquidate the following large line of top quality equipment \n     by public auction.\n\n  If you look at what is being auctioned, it is very revealing: A 1995 \nrow crop drill; 1996 row lifter; 1996 cultivator; 1997 field sprayer.\n  What does that tell us? Farmers thinking they are going out of \nbusiness are not buying new equipment in 1997. They are not buying new \nequipment in 1996. They are not buying new equipment in 1998. They have \nbeen hit by a calamity, a calamity that is forcing them off the land \nand out of business. No one who is planning to quit in 1998 buys a \nsprayer in 1997.\n  Another auction advertisement states that two farmers have \ndiscontinued their farming operations. Again, we see new equipment \nbeing sold. Again, we find that this is, as described in the ad, \nsingle-owner equipment, and yet they have equipment purchased as \nrecently as 1997.\n  These are not small investments. Many of these pieces of equipment \ncost $50,000, $60,000, $70,000, and they just bought them last year and \nthey are going out of business this year. Not one, not two, but \nhundreds and hundreds and thousands, and it is because there is a \ncollapse of farm income. There is a collapse of production, and we \ndon't have a safety net in place.\n  It is very interesting if you compare what we are doing in this \ncountry to what our chief competitors are doing.\n\n[[Page S7707]]\n\nOur chief competitors are the Europeans. They are spending $50 billion \na year supporting their farmers--$50 billion, 10 times as much as what \nwe are spending. We spend $5 billion a year. As I have said to my \ncolleagues many times, the Europeans have a plan, and they have a \nstrategy. Their plan and their strategy is to dominate world \nagricultural markets. Why? Because the Europeans have been hungry \ntwice, and they never intend to be hungry again. They understand full \nwell the importance of agricultural dominance, and they are ready to do \nwhat it takes. They are doing it the old-fashioned way: They are buying \nthe markets.\n  We are sending our farmers out saying, ``You go compete against the \nFrench farmer and the German farmer.'' Fair enough. We are ready to \ncompete against any farmer anywhere, anytime. But in addition, we are \nsaying to our farmers, ``While you are at it, you go compete against \nthe French Government and the German Government and good luck,'' \nbecause those countries have decided they are going to stand with their \nproducers, and they are going to fight, and they are going to win. If \nyou look at what is happening in world agriculture, you can see that \nstrategy and that plan is working, because the Europeans are on the \nascent while the United States is descending. They are going in the \nright direction; we are going in the wrong direction, and we wonder \nwhy.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield? I \ndon't want to lose my time. We were allocated a few minutes before we \nvote on cloture. The Senator is into, I think, my segment of the 9:15-\nto-9:30 time. I don't want to disturb the distinguished Senator, but I \ndon't want to lose my time. Is that the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order was for the Democratic \nleader to control half of the 1-hour time; that is 30 minutes. The \nSenator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, did the Democratic leader distinguish \nhow that time would be divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, he did not.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would be glad to enter an agreement \nright here with my colleague so that the Senator from South Carolina \nwould have time before the cloture vote and so my colleague from New \nJersey would have time. I would be happy to wrap up very quickly so \nthey can have sufficient time before the cloture vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Sufficient time is 15 minutes. I am almost down to 10 \nminutes. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to speak for 15 \nminutes prior to the cloture vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is objection.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Well----\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me reclaim my time, and let me just \nend so the Senator from South Carolina has as much time as he can \nremaining. My understanding was that I had 15 minutes this morning.\n  But I would be glad to wrap up and simply say that what I have \ndescribed this morning is an ongoing crisis in my State. And I am going \nto be asking my colleagues to respond, as they so graciously responded \nlast year. Let me say, it is just not my State, because what is \nhappening in my State is an early warning signal to others as to what \ncan happen. We are headed for a calamity in my State. Others will \nexperience the same thing unless we find a way to fix it.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor so that my colleagues can have \nthe remaining time.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 13 minutes 11 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Thirteen minutes. I offer to the Senator from South \nCarolina to divide the time. I don't see any other choice. I would be \nglad at this point to divide the time with the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I appreciate the distinguished Senator from New Jersey \npermitting me that opportunity.\n  What really happened is I was told from 9:15 to 9:30. And I will try \nto wrap it up as quickly as I possibly can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/09/senate-section/article/S7706-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7707-S7710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PRODUCT LIABILITY REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, what really occurs is we are back now--\nthe leadership says after 10 years--really after 20 years. And much has \noccurred during that 20-year period. Practically all of the States have \nfaced up--the State of Oklahoma, the State of South Carolina have all \nenacted product liability reform. It is not a particular problem. The \nsmall businesses, for example, are enjoying the best of investment, the \nbest of new initiatives in small business.\n  The small business folks, the National Federation of Independent \nBusinesses, are really quoted as saying here that--and I quote an \neconomist for the NFIB--``Far from worrying that the expansion has just \nabout played itself out, more and more small-business owners feel that \nthe best is yet to come.'' So the small businesses really are not \nhaving any problem.\n  The idea of the litigation explosion has been answered, that you \ncould not get insurance to get insurance. Foreign competition--the \nforeign companies are flowing into America without any problem of \nproduct liability. So now they try to say it is the small business \nthing. And, of course, the small businesses say the best is yet to come \nand they are having one of the finest clips that they have ever had. So \nthey are not having problems.\n  We searched Lexis-Nexis to find where these egregious verdicts are \nthat this particular measure would take care of. They are nonexistent. \nSo we looked at the bill itself. And you find out really what is a \npolitically rigged instrument to take care of the political needs, not \nthe business needs, of America, whereby you take a poll and kill all \nthe lawyers. And we have been into that.\n  The lawyers have become unpopular until everybody needs one. And the \nbest of the best lawyers, who have been bringing these cases and \nsucceeding and everything else, are to be sidelined in this drive by \nbig business, all under the cover of small business.\n  The bill itself, Mr. President, is an atrocity. I say that because \nnow the plea, in the preamble of the Rockefeller-Gorton measure, is \nuniformity. And they start off immediately saying, with punitive \ndamages, those States who regulate the punitive damages or control them \nare not applied to by this particular measure; but those States that \nhave it, this bill would apply. So there is no uniformity on the very \nface or attempt to get uniformity itself. It is not just for small \nbusinesses. That is for all businesses, large and small, relative to \nthe matter of uniformity and relative, of course, to the matter of \nsmall businesses itself.\n  But we come, Mr. President, with the phone ringing all during the \nweekend and last night with respect to the sellers being exempted under \nthis bill. They know what they are doing. There are dozens and dozens \nof cases up in New York to the effect that the sellers--only one--the \nhospital, where they have incurred AIDS, hemophiliacs have incurred \nAIDS, through tainted blood transfusions or otherwise. And obviously \nthey cannot find out the individual, but you know it is applied by the \nhospital. You want to get the safety practice by the hospital or the \nseller. Now, this vitiates dozens and dozens of cases over the country, \nand particularly in the New York area.\n  Again, with respect to asbestos cases, they know exactly what they \nare writing. They are saying, with respect to toxic materials, that, of \ncourse, this does not apply to toxic materials, that the asbestos is \nexempted from the 18-year statute imposed because the reference is to \nthe exclusion of toxic harm. But, of course, asbestos is not toxic in \nthe eyes of the Owens Corning counsel. He announced asbestos is not \ntoxic, so they get rid of that group of cases.\n  Otherwise, they really come with the statute of repose, which is the \nmost egregious thing I have ever seen. Here we are trying, in product \nliability, to protect consumers and individuals, and they say now that \nthey would exempt an injured person from a defective product; but the \npurchaser or owner of\n\n[[Page S7708]]\n\nthat particular product for whom the injured person is working, he or \nshe or it can sue that manufacturer. So the rights of businesses are \nprotected to the detriment of injured consumers in America. The \nunmitigated gall of including that particular provision in this bill, \ntalking about product liability is just unheard of.\n  But in any event, the lower-income worker, the matter of the punitive \ndamages of $250,000 or less--you can well see that lower-income worker \nfrom McDonald's who is making $15,000 or $17,000 a year--double the \neconomic injury; namely, double that salary loss of $34,000 for a \nDalkon Shield user, that we have the Dow Chemical implant on the front \npage, the settlement, this morning, $3.2 billion. But under the Dalkon \nShield here, that particular individual----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We still have until half past the hour, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. What time has expired? I got 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. There was \nagreement to divide the time equally that was remaining. That was 13 \nminutes. Your time has expired.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I would question the ruling of the Chair. I was told I \nwould have the 15 minutes. I don't know how the Chair can change that \nruling. That was the understanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was objection to your unanimous consent \nrequest. That was not the case.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I am sorry I could not sneak in the majority leader's \nhandwritten amendment. He can amend but we can't.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. The Senate will soon be considering the product \nliability legislation. If enacted, the Senate would be continuing an \nunfortunate practice in this country where manufacturers of firearms \nhave some special protection outside of consumer products.\n  Mr. President, as indicated by this chart, for many years this \ncountry has regulated the manufacture and the sale of consumer \nproducts, items as seemingly as innocent as teddy bears, for recall, \nsafety standards. And yet firearms were outside the design \nrequirements, the safety requirements, and the recall requirements.\n  This issue comes before the Senate again under product liability, \nbecause it is my intention, with the Senator from California, Mrs. \nFeinstein, to offer an amendment to exempt gun manufacturers from the \n$250,000 punitive damages protection.\n  Through all these years, the Congress has failed--by design \nrequirements for safety, for distribution requirements--to ensure that \nfirearms get to legitimate owners, to provide the American people with \nreal protection. What the Congress has failed to do, the courts have \nbegun to recognize. Suits are being filed across America by parents \nwhen they lose their children to weapons that get in illegitimate \nhands, by neighborhoods, by police officers, by cities, seeking damages \ncaused by weapons that could have been designed more safely, with child \nrestraint provisions. If, indeed, this product liability legislation is \nenacted without our amendment, those suits will not proceed.\n  Yesterday at a press conference in the Senate, we heard from a Steven \nYoung, a father of a murdered teenage boy in the streets of Chicago. He \nhas joined with three families to sue gun manufacturers because, in his \njudgment, they knowingly allow these weapons to be sold to criminals. \nThe families of the young people killed in Jonesboro, AR, in a school \nshooting are planning to file suit because those weapons had no safety \nmechanisms on them. Mayor Rendell of Philadelphia and Mayor Daley of \nChicago are both preparing suits on behalf of the citizens of their \ncities to recover the costs from gun violence because manufacturers \nhave not been responsible in design and manufacture. If this Senate \ndoes not enact this amendment and, indeed, tries to prohibit it by \nvoting cloture shortly, the suits may never happen.\n  Families and cities, the people of our country, are in a similar \nposition with gun manufacturers to where we were 40 years ago with the \ntobacco companies. Congress has not acted, so people pursue the law in \nthe courts. Indeed, it took 40 years and hundreds of cases before \ntobacco companies began to understand they needed to act responsibly. \nIf these cases can proceed against gun manufacturers, there will be \ndiscovery, documents will be produced. As liability mounts, gun \nmanufacturers will be careful who sells these weapons, who is able to \nbuy these weapons, that the law is complied with, and that there is \nevery possible safety feature built into these weapons. The liability \nof the gun manufacturers can work to protect our families. Thirty-six \nthousand people died from gun violence last year. This is the leading \ncause of death among young people in our cities. We ask the Congress to \ndo nothing but to allow the courts to proceed in offering people \nprotection.\n  The shield that would be offered to gun manufacturers involves many \nof the weapons sold in this country. Twenty-three percent of all 38-\ncaliber pistols, 2 of the 10 guns most often found at crime scenes, are \nmade by small manufacturers who would be protected under product \nliability. One company alone, Davis Industries, produces 50,000 \nSaturday-night specials a year. In all, 20 percent of the weapons \nproduced in America will be shielded from any liability above the \n$250,000 in punitive damages if we enact this product liability reform \nwithout our amendment.\n  It has often been said by the National Rifle Association that it is \ntheir responsibility to protect gun owners. If the National Rifle \nAssociation opposes this measure, they will be taking a clear stand \nagainst gun owners. It is gun owners who will have the right to go to \ncourt if a product is improperly sold, improperly manufactured. The \nonly people who will be jeopardized are people who are either victims \nof these guns or own these guns. This is a chance for the gun lobby to \ndo something responsible. They claim they want to be on the side of the \ngun owner and law enforcement and innocent victims--take a stand.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat the cloture motion, allow us to \nproceed on the amendment, and offer this protection to the American \npeople.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes of my leader time in \naddition to the 8 minutes that Senator Hollings has in the remaining \npart of our morning business time to Senator Hollings.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time remaining.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. As I understood it, Senator Hollings had 8 minutes \nremaining. If he does not, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from South \nCarolina from my leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished leader.\n  Mr. President, what I was trying to emphasize was the particular so-\ncalled compromise. I know the plea is, wait a minute here, we have been \ntrying and trying and trying and trying, and of course as long as \nVictor Schwartz and that crowd is paid, they will continue to try.\n  But the fact of the matter is, there is no need. The States object to \nthis particular mode. The Republican contract objects to this \nparticular thing. They are trying to put and retain things back at the \nStates when it comes to crime. They want the particular States to take \ncare of it. When it comes to education, they want to do away with the \nDepartment, let the States handle it. They want to do everything else, \nexcept when you get with all the lawyers and, namely, the injured \nparties in America, which are bringing this magnificent safety record.\n  So what happens is that without any demand from the States, but, \nrather, the opposition of the States--I ask unanimous consent that a \nletter from the National Conference of State Legislatures dated last \nyear, October 27, 1997, be printed in the Record with the updated \nletter from the National Conference of State Legislatures, June 18, \n1998.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S7709]]\n\n\n                                            National Conference of\n\n\n                                           State Legislatures,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 27, 1997.\n     Hon. Ernest F. Hollings,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hollings: As you know, product liability \n     legislation, in some form, may come to the Senate floor \n     before Congress adjourns in November. I urge you, on behalf \n     of the National Conference of State Legislatures, to vote \n     against any such bill, for the simple reason that this is an \n     issue best resolved by state legislatures.\n       A good deal of lip service is given today to the advantages \n     of our constitutional system of federalism and to the \n     advantages of devolving authority to the states, But, from \n     the point of view of state legislators, this rhetoric belies \n     the reality of an accelerating trend toward concentration of \n     power in Washington. Every year, Congress passes more laws \n     and federal agencies adopt more rules that preempt state \n     authority. Little consideration is given to the cumulative \n     effect of preemption piled upon preemption. Little thought is \n     given to the shrinking policy jurisdiction of state \n     legislatures.\n       Moreover, little consideration is given to whether state \n     legislatures are responsibly exercising their authority. The \n     threat to preempt state product liability law, for example, \n     comes at a time when state legislatures have been \n     particularly active in passing reform bills. As the attached \n     article from the June issue of The States' Advocate shows, \n     over the past ten years, thirty-three product liability \n     reform bills have been enacted in the states. In addition, \n     states have been reforming their tort law generally. As of \n     December 1996, 34 states had revised their rules of joint and \n     several liability and 31 had acted to curb punitive damages.\n       Just as the preemption contemplated by a national products \n     law is unprecedented, so the intrusion on the operation of \n     state courts is both unprecedented and disturbing. National \n     products standards would be grafted onto state law. In a \n     sense, Congress would act as a state legislature to amend \n     selected elements of state law, thus blurring the lines of \n     political accountability in ways that raise several Tenth \n     Amendment issues. Given the Supreme Court's recent \n     interpretation of the Tenth Amendment in Printz v. United \n     States, the legislation might even be unconstitutional.\n       Our constitutional tradition of federalism deserves more \n     than lip service. It's time to vote ``no'' on product \n     liability and similar proposals to unjustifiably preempt \n     state law.\n           Sincerely,\n     Richard Finan,\n       President, Ohio Senate, President, NCSL.\n     Dan Blue,\n       North Carolina House of Representatives, President-elect, \n     NCSL.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            National Conference of\n\n\n                                           State Legislatures,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 18, 1998.\n     Hon. Ernest F. Hollings,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hollings: I write on behalf of the National \n     Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) in opposition to S. \n     2236, a bill that would supplant state product liability laws \n     with federal standards.\n       For NCSL, this is a simple matter of federalism and states' \n     rights. Tort reform is an issue for state legislatures, not \n     Congress. There is no precedent for such a federal intrusion \n     into such an important area of civil law. Moreover, we regard \n     it as highly inappropriate and perhaps unconstitutional for \n     the state courts to be commandeered as instruments of federal \n     policy in the fashion contemplated by S. 2236.\n       The states have made considerable progress in reforming \n     their tort law, including product liability law, over the \n     past decade. State legislatures are in a good position to \n     balance the needs of the business community and those of \n     consumers, not just in the abstract but in a way that \n     reflects local values and local economic conditions. This is \n     as the Founders intended it when they established a federal \n     republic rather than a unitary state.\n       The issue then is not finding the right compromise between \n     consumer and business interests in crafting the language of \n     S. 2236. The issue is whether we will take a giant step \n     toward nationalizing the civil law, to the detriment of our \n     constitutional system of federalism. Again, please oppose S. \n     2236.\n     Sincerely,\n     Donna Sytek,\n       Speaker, New Hampshire House of Representatives, Chair, \n     NCSL Assembly on Federal Issues.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, again, it is not a national problem, as \nI have emphasized.\n  From July 1, 1998, I ask unanimous consent that the American Bar \nAssociation letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         American Bar Association,\n\n\n                                  Governmental Affairs Office,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 1, 1998.\n       Dear Senator: We understand that on July 7, broad federal \n     product liability legislation will be the subject of a \n     cloture vote on the Senate floor. I am writing to you to \n     express the American Bar Association's opposition to S. 648, \n     the bill reported by the Commerce Committee, and S. 2236, the \n     compromise proposal introduced by Senators Gorton and \n     Rockefeller. The ABA believes that improvements in the tort \n     liability system should continue to be implemented at the \n     state level and not be preempted by broad federal law.\n       S. 648 and S. 2236, which would federalize portions of tort \n     law, would deprive consumers in the United States of the \n     guidance of the well-developed product liability laws of \n     their individual states. This legislation would also deprive \n     the states of their traditional flexibility to refine \n     carefully the product liability laws through their state \n     courts and state legislatures.\n       The ABA has worked extensively to improve our civil justice \n     system, including developing extensive recommendations on \n     punitive damages, and on other aspects of the tort liability \n     system, for consideration at the state level. Broad federal \n     product liability legislation, however, would constitute an \n     unwise and unnecessary intrusion of major proportion on the \n     long-standing authority of the states to promulgate tort law. \n     Such preemption would cause the whole body of state tort law \n     to become unsettled and create new complexities for the \n     federal system. Unequal results would occur when product \n     liability litigation is combined with other types of law that \n     have differing rules of law. An example of this would be a \n     situation where a product liability claim is joined with a \n     medical malpractice claim. If state tort laws differ from the \n     federal law in areas such as caps on punitive damages, \n     conflicts and uncertainty would likely result; one defendant \n     in an action could well be treated entirely differently than \n     another. Having one set of rules to try product liability \n     cases and another set of rules to try other tort cases is not \n     consistent with the sound and equitable administration of \n     justice.\n       The ABA opposes the product seller provisions of Section \n     103 of S. 648 and S. 2236 because those provisions remove the \n     motivation of the only party with direct contact with the \n     consumer, the seller, to ensure that the shelves in American \n     businesses are stocked only with safe products. Seller \n     liability is an effective way of maintaining and improving \n     product safety. Manufacturers traditionally rely on sellers \n     to market their products. Through their purchasing and \n     marketing power, sellers have influenced manufacturers to \n     design and produce safer consumer goods.\n       Ambiguity in the language of S. 648 and S. 2236 may result \n     in unintentionally eliminating grounds for liability which \n     promote safety. For example, the two bills expressly \n     eliminate a product seller's liability for breach of warranty \n     except for breach of express warranties. The Uniform \n     Commercial Code, long regarded as a reasonable, balanced law, \n     holds sellers responsible for breach of implied warranties as \n     well. By their vague and ambiguous language, S. 648 and S. \n     2236 may result in preempting these long established grounds \n     of liability.\n       We urge you to vote no on broad federal product liability \n     legislation as it is an unwise and unnecessary intrusion on \n     the long-standing authority of the states to promulgate tort \n     law.\n           Sincerely,\n\n\n                                              Robert D. Evans,\n\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Reading one line:\n\n       The ABA believes that improvements in the tort liability \n     system should continue to be implemented at the state level \n     and not be preempted by broad federal law.\n\n  So, they are talking about the compromise, and after all this give \nand take, and it is not quite an orderly bill, but those things that \noccur in time are compromises--not to mitigate against uniformity in \nthe name of uniformity where they apply punitive damages to one group \nof States and not to the other group of States, not in the name of \nsmall business when they apply to big business where they were sneaked \nin--oh, no, we will have cloture; you can't offer any amendments. We \nare steamrolling this thing. Here we go. We are going to have a little \nhandwritten amendment, by the majority leader, sneaked in at the last \nminute.\n  We saw this occur with the tobacco bill where they sneaked in an \namendment that had been before the Agriculture Committee, the Lugar \nbill, that never was reported out of the Agriculture Committee, but \nthey sneaked that in. Now they want to sneak in an amendment not just \nto take care of small business but large business. I refer to this \nmorning's headline of the New York Times: ``Don't Amend This Bill, Lott \nSays,'' and then proceeds to weigh in.\n  So you have a little handwritten amendment here that the majority \nleader sneaked in--he can really take and amend his own bill, but this \nis a compromise worked out with the White House. This is a conspiracy \nin the U.S. Senate. I am not part of that conspiracy. I am for the \nconsumers. I am for\n\n[[Page S7710]]\n\nsafety in America. I can tell you here and now, this is the most \negregious conduct I have ever seen.\n  Finally, with respect to the poor stay-at-home moms, because I see my \ndistinguished colleague from Texas, who has got everyone sitting around \nthe kitchen table time and, again, and stay-at-home moms. So the stay-\nat-home mom can get at the most, $250,000 or double, or less than that, \nwhatever is less. I don't know what she gets when she stays at home and \ndoesn't have any economic damage.\n  Or take the employee at McDonald's, a young woman who gets $15,000 or \n$17,000 a year working away, just married, taking the Dalkon Shield, \ntotally injured, can't reproduce, her life is ruined. Oh, we are going \nto be liberal here. We will protect the small business and not the \ninjured party and go right to the heart of the matter and give her \ntwice her economic damage, twice $17,000, or $34,000, and the companies \nwill write that off in a flash. We know it. You know it and I know it. \nIt will just be a cost of doing business. And safety in America is \nreally downgraded.\n  We have the most interesting safe operating businesses in the country \nas a result of this product liability.\n  There is not an explosion, Mr. President. All the reports before the \ncommittee say, wait a minute, there has been an explosion in business \nsuing business--Pennzoil suing Texaco in Texas for a verdict of $12 \nbillion. But, no, that is the consummate verdicts of all the product \nliability cases put together. There are businesses suing businesses all \nover. That is fine business. But when the poor injured party comes, and \non a contingent basis finds a lawyer willing to take her case, do the \ninvestigating, do the trial, appeal work, and win a percentage if \nsuccessful, oh, that is terrible for the economy in America; it is \nterrible for international competition.\n  Mr. President, in this global economy American firms contend at home \nand abroad against competitive foreign firms which operate in America. \nWe have over 100 German plants, and over 50 Japanese plants. We have \nthe BMWs, the Fuji Films, the Hoffman-Laroches--all these industries \nare coming to South Carolina, and not one is saying anything about \nproduct liability. They like what the States are doing, but we find a \npolitical problem because we have a representative downtown who is \nretained to get to the Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable, \nthe conference board, and now the National Federation of Independent \nBusiness, saying this is just a small business. Oh, boy, it is not for \nlarge injury, I can tell you that. It is not for large injury. It is \nnot for the consumer, Mr. President. The whole setup here is ramroded \nthrough.

The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/09/senate-section/article/S7707-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7710-S7713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE AFRICAN GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the African Growth and \nOpportunity Act which has passed the House in March and is now before \nthe Finance Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee. I am the \nprincipal Senate sponsor of the bill which I introduced some fourteen \nmonths ago. There are ten co-sponsors.\n  I introduced the Africa bill because I believe that our policy \ntowards sub-Saharan Africa should be revised to reflect changing global \nand regional realities. For too long, our policy has been based on \ncountry-by-country aid relationships and devoid of any comprehensive \nstrategy towards the continent. As important as our child survival, \nhealth, agriculture, educational and humanitarian programs have been, \nthey have not promoted much economic development, political stability \nor self-reliance. Nor have they benefitted the American economy. For \nthat reason, it is time to re-evaluate our policy. That is the purpose \nof the African bill.\n  The African Growth and Opportunity Act is the first serious attempt \nto formulate a new American strategy towards Africa. It provides a \ngeneral road map for expanding economic engagement and involvement in \nAfrica through enhanced trade and investment. It seeks to establish the \nfoundation for a more mature partnership with those countries in Africa \nundertaking serious economic and political reforms.\n  I'm pleased to note that virtually all African Ambassadors have \nendorsed this bill. It has wide support in the American business \ncommunity, non-governmental organizations, the African-American \ncommunity, and the Administration. Indeed, President Clinton mentioned \nthe bill in his State of the Union address in January and Secretary of \nState Albright included it in her list of the top four leadership \nchallenges for l998.\n  Let me summarize the bill.\n  First, it urges the President to negotiate free trade agreements with \nAfrican countries with the ultimate goal of a U.S.-Sub-Saharan Africa \nFree Trade Area. The President will need Fast Track authority to \nnegotiate this and other free trade measures and I strongly support \nthat effort as well.\n  The bill establishes a US-Africa Economic Cooperation Forum to \nfacilitate senior level discussions on trade and investment. No such \ndialogue now exists and there exists no long term agenda involving the \nprivate sectors here and in Africa. Doing business in Africa will \nrequire high-level dialogue and this Forum will signal to the \ninvestment and trading communities that we take Africa seriously.\n  Africa lacks the infrastructure needed to promote and sustain \neconomic growth and development. The bill establishes two privately-\nmanaged funds to leverage private financing for small and medium sized \ncompanies. The two funds would operate under OPIC guidelines and \nrequire no official USG appropriations. One is a $150 million equity \nfund, the other a $500 million infrastructure fund. Given the enormity \nof the needs, these are modest sized funds.\n  Each of these initiatives will take time to mature. They have worked \nin other parts of the world.\n  The initiatives in the bill that would bring more immediate economic \nbenefits to Africa and the United States would provide greater access \nto our markets for African exports. The bill authorizes the President \nto grant duty-free treatment for products now excluded from the GSP \nprogram--subject to a sensitivity analysis by the International Trade \nCommission. It extends the GSP program to Africa for 10 years, which is \nimportant for business planning and predictability.\n  The bill also eliminates quotas on textiles and apparel from Kenya \nand Mauritius, the two countries in sub-Saharan Africa which do not \nhave quota-free access to the United States. They would receive this \nstatus only after adopting a visa system to guard against illegal \ntranshipment of goods. Since global textile quotas are scheduled to \ndisappear in the year 2005 under terms of the GATT, our bill merely \ngives Africa a small head start in a more competitive textile market of \nthe future.\n\n  Some have argued that granting quota-free and duty-free access to \nAmerican markets will weaken our domestic textile industries. If that \nwere true, I would not be advocating this provision. African imports of \ntextiles and apparel now account for less than one percent of our total \ntextile imports. The International Trade Commission looked at this \nissue and concluded that enactment of our bill would increase U.S. \nimports of textiles and apparel from Africa to between one and two \npercent of our total textile and apparel imports, a negligible impact.\n  While this amount is small in terms of our overall textile and \napparel imports, it can have sizable benefits for Africa. The lower \ncosts of African textiles will also benefit American retailers and \nAmerican consumers.\n  Warnings about the illegal transhipment of Asian-origin garments \nthrough Africa, under liberalized arrangements, are false alarms. The \nHouse strengthened these safeguards substantially during its \nconsideration of the bill.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that we have an historic \nopportunity to help integrate African countries into the world economy \nand to\n\n[[Page S7711]]\n\nwind down our excessive dependency on public assistance as the \nsignature of our ties with Africa. Africa is one of the last frontiers \nof untapped markets in the world. There are nearly 700 million people \nin sub-Saharan Africa. Yet, 33 of the world's forty-eight least \ndeveloped countries are in Africa. Despite this, prospects for enhanced \ntrade and investment are bright. Our exports now are twenty percent \ngreater than to all the states of the former Soviet Union combined. \nEconomic growth in Africa will create new markets and new opportunities \nfor U.S. goods but that won't happen if we don't act to make it happen.\n  We now have an opportunity to help strengthen civil societies and \npolitical institutions and to assist African societies on the path to \ngreater self-reliance, economic growth and political stability. Nearly \nthirty countries in the region have conducted democratic elections.\n  Private investment tends to follow good governance and economic \nreform but the private sector takes cues from government policies and \ninvolvement. It is very much in our interest to play a constructive \nrole in the evolving political and economic transition in Africa.\n  That transition is taking place and must continue. If we had ignored \nTaiwan and Korea in the l960s when they were at stages of economic \ndevelopment comparable to many African societies today, we would have \nmissed enormous opportunities in East Asia. Years from now, I hope we \ncan look back and be able to say that we were there at a crucial \njuncture in Africa's growth and development, that we played a \nconstructive role in that change and that we did the right thing at the \nright time.\n  Mr. President, if the United States is a major player, a pro-active \nplayer in Africa's economic and political development, we will also be \na major beneficiary.\n  I'm pleased the Finance Committee will be marking up the African bill \nlater this month. I hope this bill will be brought to the floor as soon \nas possible for full Senate consideration.\n  I urge all members to take a close look at the Africa Growth and \nOpportunity Act, look at the mutual long-term benefits it brings to \nAfrica and to our country and support this important bill when it \nreaches the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from \nIndiana in urging the Senate to move forward on the Africa trade bill. \nWho among us has not stood on the floor of the Senate when we voted on \nforeign aid and watched hundreds of millions of dollars spent by our \ngovernment, knowing that this money was probably not going to be used \nin the end to help people, but instead would likely have a net product \nthat was either crony capitalism or socialism, who among us has watched \nsuch a vote and not wished for an alternative?\n  We have an alternative today. That alternative is trade. The \nwonderful thing about trade is that it makes people equal in free \ntransactions of buyers and sellers, producers and consumers. It creates \njobs and opportunities, and we benefit together with those who are \nengaged in trade with us.\n  What we have in the Africa trade bill is a very modest proposal. The \nbill would allow the President, in those cases where a country in Sub-\nSaharan Africa has taken steps toward establishing a market-based \neconomy, where a country is not engaged in a violation of human rights, \nand where a country is not engaged in activities contrary to the U.S. \nnational security and foreign policy interests, to expand our markets \nand increase out trade with that country.\n  I think it is clear that there are business opportunities in Africa. \nI would like to see us as leaders in the effort to expand our mutual \nbusiness relations. But the bottom line is we are dealing with \ncountries that are hopelessly poor, and where poverty is a crushing \npresence in everyday life. We have an opportunity by expanding trade to \nhelp lift that weight of poverty, promote free enterprise, democracy, \nand the things that we believe in here at home, the things that we want \npeople around the world to benefit from.\n  There are those who will oppose this bill because it will mean that \npeople in Africa will be producing textiles to sell in the United \nStates.\n  First of all, we must understand that today we do not have limits on \ntextile imports from any of the countries in this region of Africa \nexcept two. Second, I think it is important to note, as Senator Lugar \nmentioned, that currently all of Sub-Saharan Africa sells to us less \nthan two-thirds of 1 percent of all the textiles we import. The \nInternational Trade Commission has estimated that under the best of \ncircumstances, where this region of Africa experienced as much \ninvestment in producing textiles as possible, their degree of exports \ncould never exceed, in the period of time we are talking about under \nthis bill, about 3 percent of our textile import market.\n  Here is the question: Is it worth it to us to open up trade, and in \nthe process bring goods into our country that our consumers can choose \nto buy or not buy if they believe that those goods are better or \ncheaper, and in the process make it possible for 750 million of our \nfellow human beings on this planet to have some of the opportunities we \nhave?\n  Quite frankly, while the President went to Africa, gave a lot of \nspeeches, did a lot of photo-ops, he has done far too little to push \nthe passage of the Africa trade bill. Most of the opponents of this \nbill are in the President's party.\n  My basic position is this: I am tired of giving away foreign aid that \ndoes not work, that does not help anybody. We have an opportunity to \nlet people produce products to sell on the world market. The worst \nthing that could happen to us from the provisions of this bill is that \nsome poor working family in America would have lower priced textile \nproducts, could buy a shirt that is cheaper, or a shirt that they \nwanted more.\n  It seems to me that we ought not to allow greedy special interests \nwho are already ripping off the American consumer--as we are paying \nmore than the world market prices for textiles every single day in \nevery store in America--we ought to be ashamed of ourselves to let a \nsmall number of special interest groups prevent a very modest bill from \npassing, a bill that could literally represent a turning point for 750 \nmillion human beings on this planet.\n  So I feel strongly about this bill. I think it is outrageous that we \nare not moving ahead on it. It does so little already that there can be \nno good objection to taking this very modest step.\n  I remind my colleagues that under the current agreements we have \nunder the World Trade Organization, in the year 2005 all these textile \nquotas are coming off anyway. So all we are trying to do with this bill \nis help this continent, which is so poor, which has so much \nhopelessness, get a head start in producing textiles. We can help them \nlift themselves out of their grinding poverty.\n  There are some who will say, ``OK; great. Let's let them. Let's make \nthem use American cloth, and let's make them use American thread.'' The \nproblem is that the costs in this competitive industry are such that \nyou cannot ship all of this thread and fabric to Africa and have \nproducts produced there, and bring them back here to compete with \nproducts from those who are doing the same thing in Mexico for \nvirtually no transportation costs.\n  So I urge my colleagues, when we are talking about nothing in terms \nof impact on our domestic textile market, when at worst we as American \nconsumers will benefit, let us take this opportunity to try to open up \ntrade with Africa, to let people enjoy the one system we know works--\ntrade, economic growth, economic freedom.\n  I hope we will move ahead on this bill. It is going to be my goal, if \nwe cannot get this bill to the floor through the committee, to offer it \nas an amendment on some other bill. I want us to vote on Africa trade, \nand move ahead.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Indiana \nand the distinguished Senator from Texas raised the question of the \nsub-Sahara bill. I had heard the expression that ``trade,'' says the \nSenator from Texas, ``makes people equal,'' and then went on, of \ncourse, to say that the sub-Sahara bill should not be blocked by \n``greedy special interests''; they shouldn't prevent the passage of the \nbill; ``special interests,'' namely, of course, the textile industry.\n\n[[Page S7712]]\n\n  What happens, in all candor, is almost like the Community Chest and \nthe United Fund, ``giving at the office,'' doing your fair share.\n  This started way, way back in the 1950s. This particular Senator \nappeared as Governor back before the International Tariff Commission at \nthe time that Tom Dewey represented the Japanese industry, and chased \nme around the hearing at that particular time whereby we were concerned \nthat 10 percent of the consumption of textiles and apparels in America \nwas represented by imports. And they had a provision in law under the \nnational security section that you had to find before a President could \ntake action, that there be a finding that the particular product was \nimportant to our national security.\n  President Kennedy, when he took office, appointed his Secretaries of \nState, Labor, Commerce, Defense, and Treasury--Secretary Dillon, at \nthat particular time, Secretary Goldberg, Secretary Dean Rusk, \nSecretary Hodges, and then, of course, Secretary Freeman from Labor. \nAnd we presented the witnesses. The findings were that next to steel \ntextiles was the second most important to national security; that we \ncouldn't send them to war in a Japanese uniform.\n  Since that time, of course, there have been various initiatives \nwhereby we have given more than ``at the office.'' We have given more \nthan our ``fair share,'' so that in the limited time let me \ncategorically state that two-thirds of the clothing in this Chamber \nthis minute is imported. We gradually are going out of business, and \nmore particularly, since NAFTA, have gone out of business.\n  What happens in my State, so as to understand, is that we have lost \n24,000 textile and apparel jobs since the enactment of NAFTA in the \nState of South Carolina. We actually had 1 million apparel workers over \nthe country when President Clinton came in, and we are down now to \n781,000 in 1998. We have lost 219,000.\n  Rather than being ``greedy,'' Mr. President--that is what I really \nwant to correct--the textile industry is geared up competitively.\n  You ought to go into one. Incidentally, calling them ``greedy,'' I \nhave been through, I think, 13 of the Milliken plants. There is no \nbigger Republican than Roger Milliken. So you don't want to go around \nsaying ``greedy'' Republican interests. Let's get away from that \nconnotation, because the truth of the matter is you will find no more \ncompetitive industry than Milliken Textiles. They have won the Baldrige \nAward. They have set the pace for modernization, computerization, \nmechanization, and otherwise, electronically controlled. You ought to \nvisit those people. They have cut back and downsized, and are extremely \ncompetitive, with the industry itself investing over $2 billion a year \neach year for the past 10 years, and trying to stay competitive and \nexist as an industry--not ``greedy'' at all.\n  But what really happens is that these jobs are extremely important to \nour economy. They average around $7 to $10. It is up to $10 now.\n  I am showing you a headline of Thursday, July 9, on breaking news in \nSouth Carolina.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  South Carolina's Factory Workers Lowest Paid in Southeast Economic \n                                 Grade\n\n       Columbia, SC (AP)--For years, South Carolina has sold \n     itself as a low-cost, low-wage place for businesses to expand \n     or locate factories, College of Charleston economist Frank \n     Hefner says.\n       ``The kind of industry that comes . . . creates low-wage \n     jobs,'' he said.\n       South Carolina doesn't win the engineering-intensive and \n     research-and-development jobs that surround corporate \n     headquarters. ``We're the piece shop,'' Hefner said.\n       But factory workers do not appear to have shared equally in \n     the state's much-heralded economic boom, according to federal \n     statistics that rank them the worst paid in the Southeast.\n       Still, there is some good news in the wage numbers. The \n     factory jobs ``pay higher wages higher wages than farm \n     workers and service workers,'' Hefner said.\n       Between 1990 and 1998's first quarter, the average wages of \n     South Carolina factory workers grew by 17 percent to $10.44 \n     an hour. During the same period, average factory wages \n     increased 24 percent in the Southeast to $11.68 an hour>\n       As he seeks re-election, Republican Gov. David Beasley has \n     proclaimed his administration successful in attracting new \n     and higher-paying jobs to the state. His opponent, Democrat \n     Jim Hodges, says workers have missed out on the economic good \n     times.\n       The Hodges campaign this week pointed to an annual economic \n     development study that graded South Carolina an F in economic \n     performance.\n       However, the latest figures from the Corporation for \n     Enterprise Development show South Carolina has improved to a \n     C.\n       The 1998 study said strong employment conditions were key \n     to the recovery. South Carolina had the third-fastest \n     employment growth over the preceding year and the 13th-lowest \n     unemployment rate.\n       Beasley says since his 1995 inauguration, South Carolina \n     has attracted $16.5 billion in economic investment, creating \n     80,000 jobs. His administration, however, has been unable to \n     provide documentation for some of its economic development \n     numbers.\n       Some of the promised investments, for instance, may not be \n     fulfilled for years and the state has said it does not check \n     which ones actually are completed. It also has refused to \n     identify all the companies doing the investing, thwarting \n     easy checks.\n       Those new jobs largely have paid more than the state's low \n     average manufacturing wage, Beasley spokesman Gary Karr said.\n       ``The jobs we've announced over the last two or three years \n     are getting close to $30,000 a year,'' Karr said. ``That's a \n     huge increase (compared with) the average wage.''\n       The national average for manufacturing workers is $36,000 a \n     year, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n       Karr said the bureau numbers miss the point. The low \n     average factory wage does not reflect that higher-wage jobs \n     are growing more rapidly than lower-wage jobs, he said.\n       First Union economist Mark Vitner agrees.\n       ``The majority of (job) growth is occurring in industries \n     that pay 20 percent above the average manufacturing wage,'' \n     Vitner said. At the same time, the state is losing low-paying \n     manufacturing jobs, particularly in textiles and apparel.\n       Still, low-paying textile companies with a total of 77,500 \n     workers represent about one-fifth of South Carolina's \n     manufacturing work force.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Chair.\n  ``South Carolina's factory workers lowest paid in SoutheastEconomic \nGrade.''\n  So, on the one hand, we are ``greedy,'' because we are not giving our \njobs to the Sub Sahara Africa bill. And, on the other hand, we are low \npaying and slovenly because we are not paying them enough as the \nindustry and labor sees it.\n  So the textile manufacturers are caught between a rock and a hard \nplace. There is no question that they are just as competitive as all \nthat get out.\n  But Washington should sober up from this global competition singsong. \nSpecifically, let's go to Oneita, a manufacturing plant in Andrews, SC, \nthat made T-shirts. They had 487 workers. They closed down because they \nwent to Mexico because anybody can make a T-shirt.\n  What happens, as we politicians say, ``Wait a minute.'' Before you \nopen Oneita, you have to have clean air, you have to have clean water, \nSocial Security, Medicare, Medicaid, minimum wage, plant-closing \nnotice, parental leave, safe workplace, safe working machinery. All of \nthat goes into the cost of the product. You go down to 58 cents an hour \nin Mexico and have none of those requirements. So if your competition \nleaves, you have to leave. So you are losing the jobs.\n  So the stance of the textile industry and the concern over the sub-\nSahara bill is not ``greed;'' so-called ``trade'' makes people equal. \nTrade makes people unemployed.\n  That is what has occurred. We are here to represent the industrial \nbackbone, the manufacturing backbone of this Nation. As Akio Morita \nsaid some years back, talking about Third World countries, they have \ngot to develop a strong manufacturing sector in order to become a \nnation state. And then, looking at me, he said, ``Senator, that world \npower that ceases to have its manufacturing capacity will cease to be a \nworld power.''\n  So we have the three-legged stool. On the first leg, the one of \nvalues, we are strong; the second leg, the one of military, we are \nstrong; but the third leg over the past 50 years has been fractured \neconomically. It has shortened. And that is the danger to the Nation's \neconomy, and not just to the textile workers of South Carolina. It is a \nfundamental concern that these excellent jobs and excellent industries \nreceive fair treatment.\n  We have done more than our fair share to spread capitalism in the \nPacific rim, into Korea and everywhere else, down to Mexico, over into \nEurope initially after the Marshall Plan, and\n\n[[Page S7713]]\n\nnow to Africa. But let's see that we contain that industry in America's \neconomic self-interest.\n  I yield the floor and thank the distinguished Chair.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are about to vote on cloture on a \nproduct liability bill, a product liability bill worked out with great \ncare over the course of the last year and a half by the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia, Mr. Rockefeller, and myself, and the White \nHouse, to meet all of the objections contained in the President's veto \nmessage on the bill passed on the same subject about 2 years ago. \nNevertheless, the demand to party loyalty on the part of the minority \nleader will almost certainly defeat this vote for cloture. That is \nhighly regrettable as the arguments against it are entirely devoid of \nmerit.\n  Just a few minutes ago you heard the junior Senator from New Jersey \nprotest about the fact that cloture would prohibit the bringing of \nlawsuits based on gun violence. That is entirely specious for two \nreasons. The first is the amendment on that subject that is at the desk \nwill be germane after cloture and can be debated and voted on. \nSecondly, and more importantly, the lawsuits by various States against \ngun manufacturers based on the tobacco litigation are not product \nliability lawsuits. Tobacco litigation was not a product liability \nlawsuit at all, and neither are these lawsuits. They simply are not \naffected by this legislation.\n  The real protest was outlined a couple of nights ago by the minority \nleader who said, ``I hope that we have a good debate about how good or \nbad this legislation is. I hope we have an opportunity to propose \namendments to this litigation.''\n  Yesterday, about an hour before the time ran out for the filing of \namendments, the majority leader came to the floor when only two or so \namendments had been filed to ask unanimous consent for further time to \nput in amendments. The minority leader's representative objected to \nadding to that time. Nevertheless, there are 38 amendments on the desk \non this bill, 28 of them by Democrats, 10 by Republicans. Many of those \namendments, including several by the Senator from South Carolina, are \ngermane and can be debated on and voted on after cloture.\n  Yesterday afternoon the majority leader offered to extend the time \nfor this vote so that there could be debates on amendments before \ncloture took place. The minority leader turned down that informal \nrequest. In other words, there is no desire on the part of the \nopponents of this bill to debate amendments to the bill, amendments \nfurther restricting it or amendments on any other element of the \nsubject. None whatsoever. It is a simple smokescreen to persuade \nMembers who would otherwise be willing to vote for cloture and vote for \nthe bill not to do so.\n  Night before last, other Members on that side of the aisle complained \nbitterly about their inability to debate totally irrelevant matters to \nproduct liability. They mentioned campaign finance laws. We had 2 weeks \nof debate on that subject. They mentioned tobacco legislation. We \ndebated that subject for 4 weeks. They mentioned education reform. We \ndebated that subject for 2 weeks and passed a bill which has now gone \nto the President of the United States. And they spoke of health care \nreform on which they have already rejected offers for debate but will \nprobably accept some next week.\n  No, the claim that there has not been an opportunity to debate this \nlegislation is based on one fact and one fact only--the desire to \npersuade Members who would otherwise vote for this bill to vote against \nthe cloture motion and therefore to kill the bill. They will probably \nsucceed in doing so, and it is a paradox that a bill that is much more \nnarrow than the one passed by a significant majority of Members of this \nbody 2 years ago and vetoed by the President, which now meets all of \nthe requirements of the President, will be opposed by some Members \namong those who voted for the bill 2 years ago. It is, I regret to say, \npure politics and has very little to do with the merits of the bill \nitself.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the Senator notes it is after 10 \no'clock. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Chair.\n  I had very much hoped that the argument of politics would not be used \nin discussing this. I agree with much of what my distinguished \ncolleague over these many years has said. But I think, frankly, that on \nthe question of product liability tort reform there has been enough, \nsort of acting and sort of wanderlust faith on both sides of the aisle \nthat we don't need to point fingers at each other.\n  My view towards this is that I would like to see, as the Senator from \nWashington indicated, a very modest bill which would be signed by the \nPresident to go forward. And I, after 11 years of working on this, am \nnot willing to give up. I am not willing to say that I am going to put \nproduct liability to death. I am not going to be a part of that.\n  I will, therefore, vote no on this cloture vote because I still think \nthat, arguments about politics to the contrary, neither side having \ntotally clean hands on all of this, the controlling factor ought to be \nthe substance of the bill, which I think is good, and that the \ncontrolling factor on a vote ought to be how one feels about whether or \nnot one can continue to debate product liability and hope that the \nleadership will come together in some kind of an arrangement, as, \nindeed, in this sort of Kabuki dance there has been.\n  The majority leader last night vitiated cloture for today. The \nminority leader objected. The majority leader yesterday said there \nwould be a period for filing of votes. A Democrat objected. On the \nother hand, there have been many problems on the other side.\n  So what I am trying to do is to promote product liability in a very \nmodest form which will be signed by the President. And, therefore, I \nhope my colleagues will vote no on the pending cloture motion so we \nmight have a chance to continue this discussion and hopefully work out \nsomething on this modest but helpful bill.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/09/senate-section/article/S7713-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7713-S7717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PRODUCT LIABILITY REFORM\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this nation needs legal reform. This bill \nbefore us--if passed into law--will deliver exactly that. While this \nlegislation is not perfect, it does a great deal for small businesses \nacross this nation. And for that reason, it should be supported and I \nhope it will become law.\n  Before I discuss this matter further, I want to thank Senator Gorton \nfor his tireless pursuit of legal reform in the area of product \nliability. Senator Gorton has worked hard on this important legislation \nfor many years. I also want to thank Senator Rockefeller for all his \nefforts.\n  Mr. President, I do have concerns regarding this bill. My primary \nconcern with this measure is the narrow nature of the reforms it would \ninstitute. I had\n\n[[Page S7714]]\n\nhoped we could pass a broader bill that would do more. But again, I \nwant to repeat, the proposal has important features that would improve \nsome imperfections in our legal landscape.\n  I am especially encouraged that the bill before the Senate includes, \nas Title II, legislation that I introduced with Senator Lieberman to \nensure the continued access to biomaterials. Biomaterials are used to \nproduce implantable medical devices that both enhance and extend the \nlives of so many Americans.\n  I am also pleased with other provisions taken from the bill as \nreported by the Commerce Committee. Those provisions include valuable \nrevisions to the liability rules applicable to product sellers, \nrenters, and lessors; a limitation on the amount of punitive damages \nthat may be awarded against small businesses; and a provision to \nprovide for the reduction of damages when a product has been misused or \naltered.\n  My concern is not so much with what is in this compromise but in what \nit does not contain. The bill reported by the Commerce Committee has \nbeen significantly narrowed to appease the Administration. For example, \nthe compromise would not provide a statute of repose applicable to all \nproducts, it would not reform joint and several liability, and it would \nnot limit the amount of punitive damages that may be awarded certain \nsized business enterprise.\n  The compromise proposal would provide limited reforms in the area of \nproduct liability. Those reforms, although limited, may be valuable and \nworth doing but they do not constitute comprehensive reform of product \nliability.\n  I know that comprehensive product liability reform is not politically \npossible in this Congress due to the Administration's opposition. That, \nhowever, does not change the fact that comprehensive product liability \nreform is essential for America's consumers and for our businesses both \nlarge and small. Comprehensive product liability reform would make a \nlarger array of products available to consumers at a lower price. \nComprehensive product liability reform would create more jobs for \nAmerican workers and make American businesses more competitive in \ninternational markets.\n  General aviation is the best example of the benefits of legal reform. \nThe general aviation industry was nearly dead in the United States. \nProduction of new airplanes was declining steeply, and new technology \nwas not being incorporated into the planes that were being built. As a \nresult jobs were lost and consumers were deprived of better and safer \nairplanes. The General Aviation Revitalization Act rescued this \nindustry by instituting a very narrow statute of repose. Due to this \nreform, thousands of new jobs have been created and more advanced \nairplanes are now available to the flying public.\n  To best bring the advantages of legal reform to all consumers and \nindustries, the country desperately needs product liability reform. \nComprehensive reform would include common sense revisions to joint and \nseveral liability, limitations on punitive damages, and a statute of \nrepose applicable to all products. All of these reforms were contained \nin the bill as reported by the Senate Commerce Committee.\n  My deepest concern about the compromise proposal that Senator Gorton \nhas negotiated is a fear that once Congress has acted on this \ncompromise, the public will assume it is comprehensive legislation and \nthe drive for additional necessary reforms will be hampered. I fear \nthat a narrow product liability bill that makes incremental \nimprovements will be used by the powerful interests that oppose any \nlegal reform to claim that the narrow bill was supposed to solve all \nthe problems and thereby condemn any further reform.\n  But that fact withstanding, I still strongly support the bill before \nus. Obviously, a narrow bill cannot solve all of the numerous problems \nin our current system. I believe a narrow bill can make significant \nheadway on some of those problems. As I began, this bill will help \nreform the legal system and will greatly benefit small business. I hope \nthat its passage of this bill is the first step in a process of reform, \nnot the beginning of the end. This measure deserves our support and I \nhope we will act quickly to pass it and send the bill to the President \nfor his signature.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the Product \nLiability Reform Act of 1998. I understand the concerns raised by a few \nwell-publicized cases of outsized punitive damages awards in product \nliability cases. In seeking to address those concerns, however, this \nbill simply goes too far. It overly restricts an injured person's right \nto seek legal redress from the makers and sellers of dangerous \nproducts, and tramples on states' rights in the process.\n  In fact, this legislation could leave consumers with a more dangerous \nmarketplace. The bill caps punitive damages at the lesser of $250,000 \nor twice an individual's loss for smaller businesses. This cap will \nallow a company to calculate with a much greater degree of certainty \nthe economic cost of placing a dangerous product into the market. If \nthat cost is less than the cost of the design or manufacturing changes \nnecessary to make the product safe, companies may choose to sell the \ndangerous product and rely on the damages cap in this legislation to \nlimit their losses when people are hurt and file claims.\n  I am at a loss to understand the need for such drastic reform. The \nSenate just concluded debate on a tobacco bill that would not have \noccurred but for an individual's ability in the current civil justice \nsystem to recover punitive damages against the maker, in this case, of \na killer product. Individual states have recovered billions of dollars \nin damages from the tobacco industry in the same system. Despite all of \nthe high-minded rhetoric of the tobacco industry, the threat of \npunitive damages was a key factor in bringing the companies to the \ntable.\n  Mr. President, the civil justice system works. The threat of punitive \ndamages should be preserved as a powerful deterrent to manufacturing \ndangerous products. Damage awards should not be a calculable, fixed \nbusiness expense to be coldly measured against the consumer's welfare.\n  If the concern is frivolous lawsuits, we do not need federal \nlegislation. Federal and state court judges already have the power to \ndismiss such actions under Rules 12 and 56 of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure and similar state procedural rules. The Supreme Court's \nDaubert decision has established rigorous standards for the \nadmissibility of expert testimony in product liability cases.\n  In addition, many states already have enacted comprehensive tort \nreform laws of their own that include product liability provisions. If \nthe Vermont State Legislature wants to enact restrictions on product \nliability lawsuits or caps on punitive damages, then they are free to \ndo so. And the Vermont State Legislature is free to not change \nVermont's civil justice system.\n  And that's as it should be. The law of torts has always been the \nprovince of the states. This bill, though, would inject a federal \nstandard into every state's negligence law and into every state's \npunitive damages proof threshold. The federal government should not \ndictate state tort law standards in any event, and particularly in this \ncase, as states already have taken many steps to reform their own \nproduct liability laws.\n  Why do we now want to pass a Federal law to override these State laws \nthat have addressed product liability reforms? Do we in the United \nStates Senate now know better than our state legislatures? What \nhappened to state's rights?\n  I do not believe the false threat of frivolous lawsuits justifies \nthis bill. Instead, this bill is a solution in search of a problem. \nThere is no product liability litigation crisis in Vermont or the rest \nof the country. In fact, less than one percent of new case filings in \nstate courts are brought by injured consumers in products liability \nlawsuits.\n  And while the bill restricts consumers' rights and imposes tort \nstandards on states, the legislation will not apply to lawsuits \ninvolving commercial interests--what hypocrisy! While consumers may \nhave their hands tied, businesses will be free to pursue their claims \nwithout any limitations. Because almost half of all civil litigation is \ncommercial in nature, almost half of all civil litigation will be \ncompletely unaffected by this bill. If the problems in product \nliability litigation truly are\n\n[[Page S7715]]\n\nserious enough to warrant handcuffing consumers and dictating tort law \nto the states, then businesses should be bound by this bill's \nrestrictions as well.\n  In what appears to be the height of corporate welfare, a new \nparagraph has been slipped into this bill that grants immunity from \nproducts liability lawsuits for a Mississippi medical products company, \nBaxter International, Inc. This new paragraph would exempt from \nproducts liability lawsuits any manufacturers who make the raw \nmaterials used in intravenous bags, which just happens to benefit \nBaxter International, Inc.\n  Mr. President, the civil justice system is not perfect, but it works. \nThis legislation would not improve the system. Rather, it will make it \nmore difficult for consumers to fight against unsafe or dangerous \nproducts, and may result in a more dangerous marketplace overall. I \nurge my colleagues to reject this bill.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I am appalled that the special \ninterests and their Senate retainers triumphed again in their efforts \nto extend the ``trial lawyer tax'' imposed on the American people. The \nultimate Washington special interest--the trial lawyers--will continue \nto line their pockets at the expense of American consumers and small \nbusinesses.\n  As you know, I continue to advocate broad civil justice reform, and \nthis was just a start. I want to recount a recent case that underscores \nthe need for greater reform than the bill that we considered earlier \ntoday. A group of trial lawyers filed a class action lawsuit against \nthe Bank of Boston over credits for mortgage escrow balances. This \ncase, however, exposes the outrageous greed that motivates these trial \nlawyers eager to don the cloaks of the ``consumer advocate.'' The \n715,000 depositors each received $2.19 in back interest from the \nlawsuit, but the current mortgage holders footed the bill for the \nlawyers to the tune of $91.33 each. That's right, Mr. President, they \nreceived $2.19 but their accounts were debited $91.33 for lawyers fees.\n  I also read a 1995 gasoline price-fixing case in which 19 lawyers who \nwon a $1 judgment were actually awarded more than $2 million in \nlawyers' fees in an Alabama federal court. This is outrageous!\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I remain committed to broad and \ncomprehensive civil justice reform. This was a modest bill, too modest \nin my opinion, but it was a first step. However, as the Majority Leader \nsaid, the trial lawyers control the modern Democratic Party. There is \nno other explanation for the stalwart liberal opposition to the most \nmodest reforms to help American consumers and small businesses. The \ntrial lawyers are the most powerful and feared special interest in \nWashington.\n  Can you imagine Senators voting against this bill for any other \nreason? This was the essence of modest reform.\n  This bill would have prevented litigation against retailers and \nwholesalers unless they altered products. It would have barred damage \nawards if the product was misused or altered by the consumer or if the \nuser was influenced by drugs or alcohol. It would have limited punitive \ndamages, but its limits on punitive damages would apply only to small \nbusinesses, which it defined as companies with fewer than 25 employees \nor with annual revenues of less than $5 million. It would have allowed \npunitive damages only where there was evidence of ``conscious, flagrant \ndisregard\" for safety by the manufacturer and set limits at $250,000 or \ntwice the actual damages a person suffered.\n  Not exactly radical legislation, Mr. President, just common sense \nreform of a system run amok.\n  We need to repeal, not just cut, the ``trial lawyer tax.'' The tort \nsystem that costs American consumers more than $132 billion per year. \nThis is a 125% increase over the past 10 years. In fact, between 1930 \nand 1994, tort costs grew four times faster than the growth rate of the \neconomy.\n  Mr. President, this tort tax costs the average American consumer $616 \nper year, and it establishes the trial lawyers as tax collectors. These \ntrial lawyers often sue under a contingent fee arrangement, an \narrangement that remains illegal in England due to its dubious ethical \nbasis, so the trial lawyers are bounty hunters.\n  I am just increduous that we are unable to relieve the ``trial lawyer \ntax'' and to let the American people keep more of what they earn, \nbecause it is their money, not the trial lawyers' money! The trial \nlawyers are the most powerful special interest in Washington and I, for \none, will continue to fight for the American people. I stand with the \naverage American, Mr. President, not the well-heeled trial lawyer \nlobbyists and their big campaign checks.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my strong support \nfor the pending amendment and for the substitute Product Liability \nReform Act of 1998, S. 2236. This is a good bill, and I am proud to be \none of its original co-sponsors. It is the product of incredibly hard \nwork and tremendous dedication by Senator Rockefeller and Senator \nGorton, and I want to congratulate--and thank--them and their staffs \nfor what they have been able to achieve. I also want to thank the \nPresident for his willingness to work with us to come up with a package \nthat now has his full support.\n  I, frankly, would have liked a stronger bill, like the one we passed \nlast Congress, but the President vetoed that bill. That is something \nthat I think all those of us who support reform have to keep in mind as \nwe move forward with this bill. Because even if it doesn't incorporate \neverything we wanted, this bill does offer much--together with the \npromise of the President's signature.\n  The President's promise is important not just to those of us who have \nlong supported legal reform. It also should be important to my \ncolleagues who have not. I hope it prompts them to take a serious look \nat this bill--to put aside preconceived notions they may have of \nproduct liability reform, and to take a fresh look at what we have \ndone. Many of the provisions they have complained about in the past are \ngone--the bill does nothing to limit joint and several liability, for \nexample, and it does not impose any caps on punitive damages for any \nbut the smallest of businesses.\n\n\n                     PROBLEMS WITH THE LEGAL SYSTEM\n\n  But it does, Mr. President, offer some small, incremental steps \ntowards legal reform--towards fixing a tort system that is not working \nas it should be. That system is supposed to be a place where people \ninvolved in accidents can go to get a fair and impartial judgment as to \nwho should, in the words of a great lawyer and judge from Connecticut, \nbear the cost of accidents. The tort system is supposed to act fairly--\nto make sure that companies or individuals at fault who wrongly cause \nan injury bear the responsibility for the harm they have done, but also \nto make sure that no one--whether it be an individual or a company --be \nheld accountable or forced to pay for something that was not their \nfault.\n  Unfortunately, a system that is intended to fairly determine fault \nand to efficiently provide for those deserving of compensation has, in \nmany cases, been converted into something quite different. Instead of \nreflecting that bedrock American value of fair and neutral justice, we \nnow have a system that too often arbitrarily imposes costs on innocent \nindividuals and businesses, just because they may have deep pockets \nwith some money in them.\n  Whenever someone is injured, it seems, a lawsuit gets filed against \neveryone in sight, without regard to whether there really is \njustification for that suit. And, unfortunately, the tort rules in \nplace in many cases make it so costly for many to defend against those \nsuits that many companies just choose to pay costly settlements to get \nrid of a case. Other times, otherwise legitimate suits yield damages \nawards--particularly punitive damage awards--that are far greater than \nnecessary to compensate the plaintiff and that are wildly out of \nproportion to any wrong done by the defendant.\n  This has costs for us all. By imposing high insurance costs and legal \nfees on businesses, it drives up their costs, which means that all of \nus pay more for the products we buy. It stifles innovation by making \ncompanies unwilling to bring new products to the market, which means we \ndon't have products we should have. And by diminishing the value our \nnation places on taking responsibility for our own actions and not \nseeking to profit unfairly at the expense of others, it has a demeaning \nand degrading effect on the moral fiber of our society.\n  These are points that my constituents continually drive home to me as \nI\n\n[[Page S7716]]\n\ntravel around my home state of Connecticut. Small businesspeople--the \nbedrock of the American economy--tell me about the constant fear they \nhave of lawsuits, and the truly harmful effects those fears have--in \nstifling innovation, in increasing a company's cost of doing business, \nin increasing the cost of products.\n  Mr. President, this bill is a balanced and fair response to those \nproblems. It offers meaningful and fair reform of our legal system to \nredress these abuses while at the same time protecting consumers' \nrights. It makes sure that those deserving of compensation get it, but \nit also makes some changes--small changes--aimed at bringing fairness \nback into the system. My colleagues Senators Gorton and Rockefeller \nalready have gone over the bill's main provisions, but let me touch on \na couple of its highlights.\n\n\n                            PUNITIVE DAMAGES\n\n  One of the most important provisions offers a uniform standard for \nawarding punitive damages, requiring anyone trying to get punitive \ndamages in a product liability lawsuit to prove by clear and convincing \nevidence that the defendant acted with a conscious, flagrant \nindifference to the rights or safety of others. That provision applies \nto all defendants. The bill also limits punitive damages against small \nbusinesses--those with annual revenues of less than $5 million and \nfewer than 25 employees.\n  Now, I have heard some say that this is unfair--that these provisions \nlimit the ability of plaintiffs to be made whole. But, Mr. President, \npunitive damages have nothing to do with making plaintiffs whole--that \nis what we have compensatory damages for, and this bill allows full \nrecovery of those damages. What punitive damages are for is to punish--\nto say that a particular defendant's conduct is so wrong, so outrageous \nand beyond acceptability that the defendant not only should have to \ncompensate a plaintiff, but should also be punished as well.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, in many places, punitive damages no \nlonger are reserved for that purpose. Instead, plaintiffs claim them \nwilly-nilly, knowing that putting a claim for punitive damages in a \ncomplaint--offering the threat of an enormous punitive verdict that \ncould put a company out of business--is enough to force companies into \nsettlements regardless of whether those settlements--or the amounts of \nthem--are deserved. By making clear that punitive damages should be \nassessed only when a defendant truly has acted in a manner deserving of \npunishment, this bill will make sure that punitive damages are awarded \nonly when they should be. At the same time, it also makes sure that the \nthreat of punitive damages remains available to deter companies from \nengaging in behavior deserving of punishment.\n\n\n                              BIOMATERIALS\n\n  The bill also contains the provisions of the Biomaterials Access \nAssurance Act--a bill that I am proud to co-sponsor with Senator \nMcCain. The Biomaterials bill is the response to a crisis affecting \nmore than 7 million Americans annually who rely on implantable life-\nsaving or life-enhancing medical devices--things like pacemakers, heart \nvalves, artificial blood vessels, hydrocephalic shunts, and hip and \nknee joints. They are at risk of losing access to the devices because \nmany companies that supply the raw materials and component parts that \ngo into the devices are refusing to sell them to device manufacturers. \nWhy? Because suppliers no longer want to risk having to pay enormous \nlegal fees to defend against product liability suits when those legal \nfees far exceed any profit they make from supplying the raw materials \nfor use in implantable devices.\n\n  Let me emphasize that I am speaking here about--and the bill \naddresses--the suppliers of raw materials and component parts--not \nabout the companies that make the medical devices themselves. The \nmaterials these suppliers sell--things like resins and yarns--are \nbasically generic materials that they sell for a variety of uses in \nmany, many different products. Their sales to device manufacturers \nusually make up only a very small part of their markets--often less \nthan one percent. As a result--and because of the small amount of the \nmaterials that go into the implants--these suppliers make very little \nmoney from supplying implant manufacturers. Just as importantly, these \nsuppliers generally have nothing to do with the design, manufacture or \nsale of the product.\n  But despite the fact that they generally have nothing to do with \nmaking the product, because of the common practice of suing everyone \ninvolved in any way with a product when something goes wrong, these \nsuppliers often get brought into lawsuits claiming problems with the \nimplants. One company, for example, was hauled into to 651 lawsuits \ninvolving 1,605 implant recipients based on a total of 5 cents worth of \nthat company's product in each implant. In other words, in exchange for \nselling less than $100 of its product, this supplier received a bill \nfor perhaps millions of dollars of legal fees it spent in its \nultimately successful effort to defend against these lawsuits.\n  The results from such experiences should not surprise anyone. Even \nthough not a single biomaterials supplier has ultimately been held \nliable so far--let me say that again: Not a single biomaterials \nsupplier has ultimately been held liable so far--the message \nnevertheless is clear for any rational business. Why would any business \nstay in a market that yields them little profit, but exposes them to \nhuge legal costs? An April 1997 study of this issue found that 75 \npercent of suppliers surveyed were not willing to sell their raw \nmaterials to implant manufacturers under current conditions. That study \npredicts that unless this trend is reversed, patients whose lives \ndepend on implantable devices may no longer have access to them.\n  What's at stake here, let me be clear, is not protecting suppliers \nfrom liability and not even just making raw materials available to the \nmanufacturers of medical devices. Those things in and of themselves \nmight not be enough to bring me here. What's at stake is the health and \nlives of millions of Americans who depend on medical devices for their \nevery day survival. What's at stake are the lives of children with \nhydrocephalus who rely on brain shunts to keep fluid from accumulating \naround their brains. What's at stake are the lives of adults whose \nhearts would stop beating without implanted automatic defibrillators. \nWhat's at stake are the lives of seniors who need pacemakers because \ntheir hearts no longer generate enough of an electrical pulse to get \ntheir heart to beat. Without implants, none of these individuals could \nsurvive.\n  We must do something soon to deal with this problem. We simply cannot \nallow the current situation to continue to put at risk the millions of \nAmericans who owe their health to medical devices.\n  Senator McCain and I have crafted what we think is a reasonable \nresponse to this problem. The Biomaterials provisions of this bill \nwould do two things. First, with an important exception I'll talk about \nin a minute, the bill would immunize suppliers of raw materials and \ncomponent parts from product liability suits, unless the supplier falls \ninto one of three categories: (1) the supplier also manufactured the \nimplant alleged to have caused harm; (2) the supplier sold the implant \nalleged to have caused harm; or (3) the supplier furnished raw \nmaterials or component parts that failed to meet applicable contractual \nrequirements or specifications.\n  Second, the bill would provide suppliers with a mechanism for making \nthat immunity meaningful by obtaining early dismissal from lawsuits. By \nguaranteeing suppliers in advance that they will not face needless \nlitigation costs, this bill should spur suppliers to remain in or come \nback to the biomaterial market, and so ensure that people who need \nimplantable medical devices will still have access to them.\n  Now, it is important to emphasize that in granting suppliers \nimmunity, we would not be depriving anyone injured by a defective \nimplantable medical device of the right to compensation for their \ninjuries. Injured parties will still have their full rights against \nanyone involved in the design, manufacture or sale of an implant, and \nthey can sue implant manufacturers, or any other allegedly responsible \nparty, and collect for their injuries from them if that party is at \nfault.\n  We also have added a new provision to this version of the bill, one \nthat resulted from lengthy negotiations with representatives of the \nimplant manufacturers, the American Trial Lawyers\n\n[[Page S7717]]\n\nAssociation--ATLA--the White House and others. This provision responds \nto concerns that the previous version of the bill would have left \ninjured implant recipients without a means of seeking compensation if \nthe manufacturer or other responsible party is bankrupt or otherwise \njudgment-proof. As now drafted, the bill provides that in such cases, a \nplaintiff may bring the raw materials supplier back into a lawsuit \nafter judgment if a court concludes that evidence exists to warrant \nholding the supplier liable.\n  Finally, let me add that the bill does not cover lawsuits involving \nsilicone gel breast implants.\n  In short, Mr. President, the Biomaterials provisions of this bill \nare--and I am not engaging in hyperbole when I say this--potentially a \nmatter of life and death for the millions of Americans who rely on \nimplantable medical devices to survive. This bill would make sure that \nimplant manufacturers still have access to the raw materials they need \nfor their products, while at the same time ensuring that those injured \nby implants are able to get compensation for injuries caused by \ndefective implants.\n  In closing, let me once again congratulate Senator Rockefeller, \nSenator Gorton and the President for their success in forging this \ncompromise bill. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/09/senate-section/article/S7713-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nvote on the adoption of the conference report to accompany H.R. 2676, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Conference report to accompany H.R. 2676, an act to amend \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, to restructure and reform \n     the Internal Revenue Service, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the conference report.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to express my gratitude to \nall of our colleagues, Democratic and Republican, who have worked so \nhard for so long on the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring Act of \n1998. This bipartisan legislation builds on the recommendations of the \nyear-long National Commission on Restructuring of the IRS and addresses \nmany of the concerns raised during Congressional hearings. These \nreforms have been a long time coming, and I am pleased to support them \ntoday on the last leg of their journey through the legislative process.\n  We would not be here today, poised to enact the most sweeping \nrestructuring of the Internal Revenue Service in living memory, if it \nwere not for the vision, diligence, and persistence of the senior \nSenator from Nebraska, Bob Kerrey. Today's vote represents nearly three \nyears of concerted effort on the part of Senator Kerrey. He developed \nthe legislation to create the commission in 1995, co-chaired its \nproceedings to a successful conclusion in 1997, and has worked \nassiduously since then with Members of Congress and the Administration \nto shepherd the legislation to today's final vote. On behalf of the \nSenate and taxpayers across the country, I thank Senator Kerrey for his \ninspired public service.\n  This legislation has two essential goals: to make the IRS more \naccountable to private citizens and to transform its culture into one \nthat resembles the customer service orientation of a well-run business.\n  Too often lately, South Dakota business owners, farmers and others \nhave told me stories that make IRS tax collectors sound a lot more like \na team of overzealous special prosecutors. With this agreement, we send \na strong message that the abuse, intimidation, harassment, quota \nsystems, and patterns of targeting middle and lower-income people--or \nany segment of the public--will no longer be tolerated. IRS reform will \nensure that taxpayers receive the fair and equal treatment they \ndeserve. It will also pave the way for restoring the public's \nconfidence in our Nation's tax collector.\n  I support this conference report because it will make the IRS more \naccountable to, and respectful of, taxpayers.\n  The extensive public hearings held by the Commission and \nCongressional committees have highlighted management problems within \nthe IRS as well as individual cases of abuse and harassment by some IRS \nemployees. The new IRS Commissioner, Charles Rossotti, has begun to \nimplement significant changes to the structure and culture of the \nagency. By approving the conference report, the Senate can at last give \nhim the tools he needs to expedite these necessary changes.\n  The bill establishes a new series of taxpayer rights, including one \nthat places the burden of proof on the IRS in disputes before the tax \ncourt. It also permits a taxpayer to sue for civil damages if any IRS \nemployee, in connection with any collection activity, negligently \ndisregards the law. I am also pleased that the legislation provides a \nnumber of specific protections for taxpayers subject to audit or \ncollection activities and establishes a private board of directors to \noversee the IRS.\n\n[[Page S7718]]\n\n  In addition, the conference agreement begins the important process of \ncoming to grips with the complexity of the tax code. Thanks to this \nlegislation, in the future, Congress will have an opportunity to hear \nfrom IRS technical experts concerning the likely compliance \ndifficulties posed by individual tax legislation proposals. I am \nhopeful that involving these IRS tax experts early in the drafting \nprocess will help us attain our ultimate goal of a simpler and less \nburdensome tax law.\n  Nevertheless, there is one aspect of this conference agreement I find \nwholly unbecoming of a piece of legislation intended to protect \ntaxpayers. Mr. President, we should be paying for this bill just like \nevery other tax bill. Regrettably, the conference report fails to \nuphold the spirit of fiscal responsibility that brought us last year's \nhistoric balanced budget agreement. Our Republican colleagues have \nchosen to employ a blatant gimmick to cover the costs of the bill over \nthe 10-year period required by budget rules by pushing the costs out \nbeyond that 10-year period. In so doing, they tarnish an otherwise \nimportant victory for taxpayers.\n  Protecting taxpayers is not limited to improving the fairness and \nefficiency of their tax collection system; it also involves maintaining \ndiscipline in government finances. There is no good reason why these \ntwo goals could not have been achieved simultaneously.\n  Specifically, the Roth IRA revenue offset in the conference report \nraises revenue for only 3 years. Thereafter, it loses more revenue than \nall the other revenue raisers in the bill combined. Indeed, this bill \nwill drain more than $30 billion from the Treasury in the second 10 \nyears following enactment. This burden on the federal government's \nfinances will occur at precisely the time baby boomers begin to retire \nin large numbers, Medicare is projected to become insolvent, and the \nSocial Security system's finances come under pressure. I will vote for \nthe conference report because of the many good things in it. \nNevertheless, I hope that at the next opportunity Congress will correct \nthis serious flaw in the legislation.\n  I am also disappointed that the conference report to the IRS reform \nbill includes the technical corrections for the new surface \ntransportation law. Like many veterans' advocates, I had hoped the \nRepublican leadership would allow the Senate to debate this matter \nseparately and reconsider its unwise and unfair decision to use $17 \nbillion set aside for veterans' disability compensation to pay for new \ntransportation projects.\n  As I have stated many times, I strongly believe that veterans \nsuffering from smoking-related illnesses as a result of their military \nservice should be compensated. That is why I voted against efforts to \neliminate this compensation during consideration of the Republican \nBudget Resolution earlier this year. And that is why I supported the \npoint of order that was raised by Senator Patty Murray on this matter \nyesterday. Although both efforts were narrowly defeated, I look forward \nto continuing to work with Senator Murray, Senator Rockefeller, the \nranking member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, and others in \nan effort to ensure that veterans receive the disability compensation \nthey deserve.\n  Mr. President, despite my objections to these particular provisions, \nmy vote in favor of this conference agreement comes down to what I \nbelieve is in the best interests of working families. The American \npeople deserve some assurance that, if they work hard and play by the \nrules, they can expect fair treatment from the IRS. I am convinced this \nlegislation can make a difference for honest taxpayers who come into \ncontact with our tax collectors. We should pass the conference report \nin order to give Commissioner Rossotti the authority he needs to carry \nout his plans to restructure this troubled agency as rapidly as \npossible. I have been attempting to expedite passage of this \nlegislation since January, and I believe that American taxpayers should \nnot have to wait one day longer.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, there are more than 168 ways that this \nbill makes the IRS more service oriented, and taxpayer friendly. It \ncracks down on abuses highlighted in the hearings. It corrects some \nproblems called to my attention by constituents. Chairman Roth and the \nFinance Committee should be commended for the fine job they did on this \nbill.\n  Often when we pass legislation, I ask the question: Who cares?\n  I can assure you that this is one piece of legislation that everyone \ncares about. No agency touches more Americans than the IRS. As I said \nbefore one out of two Americans said they would rather be mugged than \nbe audited by the IRS. This bill should reverse that prevailing view. \nAmong the key provisions the bill strives for better management; better \nuse of technology; reinstatement of a checks and balances system so \nthat the IRS will no longer be the judge, jury and executioner; \ndiscipline for rogue IRS agents; taxpayer protections including the \nright to a speedier resolution of a dispute with the IRS; fundamental \ndue process and a long overdue reorganization. Hopefully, these reforms \nwill change the environment and change the culture at the IRS.\n  The bill prohibits the IRS from contacting taxpayers directly if they \nare represented by a lawyer or an accountant. The IRS called this \npractice by bypassing the tax professional and visiting the taxpayer at \nwork or at dinner ``aggressive collection'' techniques, my constituents \ncalled it harassment.\n  The bill attempts to make the IRS employees more accountable for \ntheir actions by putting their jobs on the line when they deal \nabusively with taxpayers.\n  The bill requires the IRS to terminate an employee if any of the \nfollowing conduct relating to the employees official duties is proven \nin a final administrative or judicial determination:\n  Failure to obtain the required approval signatures on documents \nauthorizing the seizure of a taxpayer's home, personal belongings, or \nbusiness assets.\n  Falsifying or destroying documents to conceal mistakes made by the \nemployee with respect to a matter involving a taxpayer.\n  Assault or battery on a taxpayer or other IRS employee.\n  Under the bill, the IRS will no longer be allowed to send out tax \nbills with huge penalties compounded with interest and cascading \npenalties just because the IRS was years behind in its work.\n  If the IRS does not provide a notice of additional taxes due, a \ndeficiency, within 18 months after a return is timely filed, then \ninterest and penalties will not start to be assessed and compounded \nuntil 21 days after demand for payment is made by the IRS. This \nexcludes penalties for failure to file, failure to pay, and fraud. It \nis not fair for the IRS to wait years before contacting a taxpayer who \nhonestly believes he has paid the correct amount, only to deliver to \nhim years later a tax bill with interest and penalties that dwarfs the \noriginal underpayment. I had a constituent who was told he owed an \nadditional dollar--one dollar--in taxes but owed more than $2,500 in \npenalties and interest! The IRS agent's response when asked about it \nwas, ``Well, I guess we gotch ya good.''\n  Small businesses have been the target of some of the worst abusers. I \nwill always remember the day a good friend, a restaurant owner in New \nMexico called my office, justifiably hysterical. The IRS had just \npadlocked her restaurant. What was she to do? What could I do?\n  This bill codifies the proposition that all men and women, even if \nthey work for the IRS, shall follow fundamental due process \nrequirements. Padlocks and raids should be a last resort under this \nbill.\n  The bill requires the IRS to provide notice to taxpayers 30 days \nbefore the IRS files a notice of Federal tax lien, levies, or seizes a \ntaxpayer's property.\n  The bill gives taxpayers 30 days to request a hearing. No collection \nactivity would be allowed until after the hearing.\n  The bill requires IRS to notify taxpayers before the IRS contacts or \nsummons customers, vendors, and neighbors and other third parties.\n  The bill requires the IRS to implement a review process under which \nliens, levies, and seizures would be approved by a supervisor.\n  The bill legislates common sense. It prohibits the IRS from seizing a \npersonal residence to satisfy unpaid liabilities less than $5,000, and \nprovides that a principal residence or business property should be \nseized as a last resort.\n  In addition, the bill expands the attorney client privilege to \naccountants and other tax practitioners.\n\n[[Page S7719]]\n\n  Under this bill, the IRS could no longer insist that a taxpayer waive \nhis rights. In particular, the IRS could no longer insist that a \ntaxpayer waive the statute of limitations before the IRS would settle a \ncase. The bill requires the IRS to provide taxpayers with a notice of \ntheir rights regarding the waiver of the statute of limitations on \nassessment.\n  If the IRS cannot locate the taxpayer's file, the bill prohibits the \nIRS from rejecting the taxpayer's offer-in-compromise based upon doubt \nas to the taxpayer's liability. I have known constituents who are left \nin an IRS twilight zone because the IRS lost their file. I know of one \nconstituent who had his file lost five times. Fortunately, he kept a \ncopy of the file himself, and worked next door to a Kinko's copying \ncenter.\n  This bill allows for a prevailing taxpayer to be reimbursed for his \nor her costs and attorney's fees if the IRS is found not to be \nsubstantially justified. The substantially justified standard is \nconsistent with the little-guy-can-fight-the-federal-government-and-win \nphilosophy. I am glad this standard is being expanded, and incorporated \ninto this bill. Originally, the notion that a citizen should be able to \nrecoup attorney's fees and costs when the Federal Government was not \nsubstantially justified was a concept in the Equal Access to Justice \nAct which I authored in the early 1980's. It is historically \ninteresting to note, and perhaps prophetic, that the IRS lobbied very \nhard to be exempt from that law. In fact, the IRS was exempt when the \nbill was first enacted. When the Equal Access to Justice was \nreauthorized 5 years later, Senator Grassley and I worked to include \nthe IRS. It was a big fight but Congress prevailed and got the IRS \nunder the Equal Access to Justice Act's umbrella. The Federal \nGovernment with its deep pockets shouldn't be allowed to simply \n``outlast'' the average American taxpayer. That isn't what our justice \nsystem is about.\n  The bill also clarifies that attorney fees may be recovered in a \ncivil action in which the United States is a party for unauthorized \nbrowsing or disclosure of taxpayer information. I have heard a lot \nabout this abuse both from constituents and from the witnesses in the \ncampaign finance investigation.\n  If a taxpayer makes an offer to settle his or her tax bill and the \nIRS rejects it and the IRS ultimately obtains a judgment against the \ntaxpayer in the amount equal to, or less than the amount of the \ntaxpayer's statutory offer, the IRS must pay the taxpayer's fees and \ncosts incurred from the date of the statutory offer. I am pleased this \nprovision is included in this bill. The offer and settlement provisions \nare patterned after the securities litigation reform bill which Senator \nDodd and I authored last Congress.\n  I can't believe we have to pass a Federal statute to accomplish this \nnext task but apparently we do.\n  The bill requires all IRS notices and correspondence to include the \nname, phone number, and address of an IRS employee the taxpayer should \ncontact regarding the notice. To the extent practicable and if \nadvantageous to the taxpayer, one IRS employee should be assigned to \nhandle a matter until resolved.\n  In New Mexico, a notice can come from the Albuquerque, Dallas, \nPhoenix, or Ogden IRS center. Taxpayers are often left with no option \nbut to contact my office asking for help in simply identifying who they \nshould talk to at the IRS to settle their tax matter. The caseworkers \nare experts, but it would take them 2 days to track down the right IRS \noffice so that the constituent could try and solve their problem. It \nwas so commonly befuddling to constituents that my caseworkers asked \nthat this identification provision be included in this bill.\n  Movie stars, rock singers, and hermits like, and need unlisted phone \nnumbers. The same is not true for Federal agencies. The bill also \nrequires the IRS to publish their phone number in the phone book along \nwith the address. We have a beautiful new IRS building in Albuquerque, \nbut the only phone number for the IRS is the toll free number that is \ntoo frequently busy. If you did not know the IRS building in \nAlbuquerque existed, you would not find a clue of its location in the \ntelephone book.\n  I am pleased that the Senate was willing to accept a Domenici \namendment, cosponsored by Senators D'Amato, and McCain that requires \nIRS helpslines to include the capability for taxpayers to have their \nquestions answered in Spanish.\n  In addition, the bill establishes a toll free number for taxpayers to \nregister complaints of misconduct by IRS employees and publish the \nnumber.\n  The bill requires the IRS to place a priority on employee training \nand adequately fund employee training programs. The IRS is making \nprogress. The accuracy of the advice that taxpayers received when they \ncalled the IRS was very bad. For example, in 1989, the advice was \ncorrect only 67 percent of the time. The accuracy has fortunately \nimproved. Training is the key.\n  The bill requires the Treasury to make matching grants for the \ndevelopment expansion or continuation of certain low-income taxpayer \nclinics.\n  The bill requires at least one local taxpayer advocate in each state \nwho has the authority to issue a ``Taxpayer Assistance Order'' when the \ntaxpayer advocate believes it is appropriate.\n  Mr. President, many, in fact most, IRS employees work very hard and \ndo a good job. Perhaps the best way to reform the IRS is to reform the \ncode to make it simpler. The doubling from $100 billion to $195 billion \nof the tax gap--the difference between the amount of taxes owed and the \namount actually paid--is evidence that the system is breaking down.\n  I am also pleased that the bill simplifies the capital gains holding \nperiod and makes it easier for taxpayers to calculate their capital \ngains.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the IRS Restructuring Act of \n1998.\n  Ten years ago, I worked with former Senator Pryor on the Taxpayer \nBill of Rights. That legislation grew out of hearings before the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee which highlighted abuses by IRS \nemployees against the taxpayers they are hired to serve. The Taxpayer \nBill of Rights was landmark legislation that outlined the rights \ntaxpayers have when dealing with the IRS including the right of the \ntaxpayer to legal representation and the right to recover civil damages \nand attorneys fees from the IRS where they have engaged in abusive \npractices.\n  While that legislation and the subsequent Taxpayer Bill of Rights II \naddressed some of the most egregious abuses, some abuses continue. The \nFinance Committee hearings have again shed light on abuses of taxpayer \nby some overzealous employees. While all of us want the IRS to be \ndiligent in their collection of taxes owed to the federal government, \nwe don't want the IRS to abuse its authority. This legislation is \nanother step in the right direction.\n  The bill contains an IRS Oversight Board which is intended to bring \nsome private sector management and customer service expertise to the \nIRS. This Board is made up of nine members, six of whom are from the \nprivate sector and have an expertise in management of large \norganizations, tax laws, information technology and the concerns of \ntaxpayers. The Board will review and approve strategic plans, \noperational functions and plans for major reorganization. In addition \nthey will review operations at the IRS to monitor the Agency's \ntreatment of taxpayers in general.\n  The Taxpayers Bill of Rights II contained an office of Taxpayer \nAdvocate. The Taxpayer Advocate has the responsibility of aiding \ntaxpayer in their disputes with the IRS and reporting to Congress \nannually with suggestions outlining the most serious problems faced in \nworking with IRS. Taxpayers can request that the taxpayer advocate \nissue a taxpayer assistance order if the taxpayer is suffering or about \nto suffer a significant hardship as a result of the manner in which the \ntax laws are being administered. A taxpayer assistance order may \nrequire the IRS to release property, cease any action or refrain from \ntaking action. The bill before us expands the circumstances when a \ntaxpayer assistance order may be issued.\n  Currently, the direct point of contact for taxpayers seeking taxpayer \nassistance orders is a problem resolution officer appointed by a \nDistrict Director. This bill replaces the present law problem \nresolution system with a system of local Taxpayer Advocates who report\n\n[[Page S7720]]\n\ndirectly to the National Taxpayer Advocate. Under the bill, the local \nTaxpayer Advocate will have a phone number published and available to \ntaxpayers, they must tell taxpayers that they are operated \nindependently of any IRS office, and they are required to tell \ntaxpayers that they do not disclose any information from the taxpayer \nto the IRS. In addition, the IRS is required to publish the right to \ncontact the local Taxpayer Advocate on the statutory notice of \ndeficiency.\n  The Taxpayer Advocate will be required to publish an annual report to \nidentify areas of the tax law that impose significant compliance \nburdens on taxpayers and the IRS, including recommendations and \nidentify the ten most litigated issues for each category of taxpayer \nincluding recommendations on how to mitigate those problems.\n  The bill contains other provisions that will improve the management \nof the agency. It also includes innocent spouse relief for those \nspouses who find themselves liable for taxes, interest or penalties due \nto the actions of their spouse. There's increased protections for \ntaxpayers in the area of interest and penalty charges as well as in \naudit and collections. I am also especially encouraged by the stronger \nrequirements imposed on the IRS to provide taxpayers with better \ninformation in regards to taxpayers rights, the appeals and collection \nprocess and potential liabilities when filing joint returns.\n  While all of these reforms are steps in the right direction, there is \nnothing in this bill to simplify the tax code. Since the 1986 Tax \nReform Act, Congress has amended the tax code 63 times. Just this past \nyear, Congress passed and the President signed a tax bill which \ncontained over 800 changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Now that this \nlegislation is prepared to move to the President's desk for signature, \nit is time that we set our sights on tax simplification.\n\n\n                           tefra partnership\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I'm glad to see Section 3507 regarding tax \nmatters partners in the conference report. It strikes me as unfair that \nthe IRS has not been notifying partners of a TEFRA partnership when the \nIRS appoints a successor tax matters partner. Under the effective date \nprovision, Section 3507 applies to selections of tax matters partners \nmade by the IRS after the date of enactment. Does the enactment of \nSection 3507 create any inference that the IRS is not required to give \nsuch notice to partners of TEFRA partnerships under the due process \nclause of the United States Constitution?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The effective date provision creates no such inference.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to support the Internal Revenue \nService Restructuring and Reform Act conference report that is before \nus today. I supported the Senate bill in May and, although this report \nhas unrelated items that should be debated on their own merits, I will \nsupport this conference report because it will change the culture of \nthe IRS by focusing on customer service. This new culture will improve \nthe way the IRS interacts with individual taxpayers, IRS employees, and \ntax-exempt groups.\n  As we know from our constituents, the IRS has engaged in some \nhorrible management practices. It has been rightfully described as an \nagency out of control. I am particularly furious about the documented \nharassment of taxpayers. In my state of Maryland, I have heard from \nmany Veterans groups across the state and a volunteer fire company in \nWestern Maryland about harassment at the hands of the IRS.\n  Let me give you some examples. The Veterans of Foreign Wars and the \nAmerican Legion Posts in my state have been systematically audited over \nthe past five to six years because they sell drinks and food to \nmembers' guests. The Veterans groups tell me that their sign-in book \nwas confiscated, people were subpoenaed, and IRS agents threatened to \nlock them up. Amazingly, the American Legion was told by the IRS that \nthey could not hire an attorney or a CPA out of Post funds to help them \nwith the audits!\n  These Posts offer our vets fellowship, entertainment, and a place to \nbring their families for an affordable meal. Yet, their very existence \nhas been put in doubt by the actions of the IRS. What is their crime? \nThey sell drinks and food to their post members and their guests, a \nlittle beer and a little bingo and a lot of the IRS. Let me tell you, \nthis has got to end.\n  In Frederick County, the Emmitsburg volunteer fire company used ``tip \njars'' to raise money to purchase a fire truck. The Frederick County \nCommissioners passed a local gaming law that makes it legal and less \nbureaucratic for non-profits like the fire company to place ``tips \njars'' in local taverns by eliminating the need for county tax \nprocessors to get involved. However, the fire company was audited by \nthe IRS and was told it owes close to $29,000 in back federal taxes \nbecause the money raised was not funneled through the local county tax \nauthority in the customary manner.\n  I find it very troubling that any of our government agencies would \naccuse the men and women who protected our country of being tax evaders \nand tax cheaters. I take much satisfaction that these methods will not \nbe tolerated in the new IRS. After we pass this legislation, the IRS \nwill be a more customer focused organization and will have a separate \ndivision dedicated solely to working with members of the tax-exempt \nsector, like our veterans groups and volunteer fire companies.\n  Mr. President, I also want to recognize the hard work of many at the \nInternal Revenue Service. We need to recognize that most IRS workers \nare good, faithful employees, doing their best to serve the public. \nMany employees at the IRS are my constituents. I know that every day \nthey go to work, do a good job, and then return to their families, \ntheir neighborhoods and their communities throughout Maryland.\n  In light of all the negative talk about the IRS recently, I want them \nto know that I value their work as faithful employees and I thank them. \nI realize that the front-line employees of the IRS often receive little \nrecognition and little thanks. It pleases me that this legislation will \nhelp the employees at the IRS make their voices heard, and to receive \nthe updated technology they need to allow the cultural and \ntechnological changes to succeed at the new IRS.\n  Finally, I wish to address what I consider to be a major abuse of the \nlegislative process that I mentioned before. As we all know and are \nsuppose to respect, the purpose of a House-Senate conference is to \nproduce a report that irons out the differences between similar \nlegislation passed by the two houses of Congress. It is not intended to \nbe a backdoor, behind-the-scenes, under-the-table method of getting \ncontroversial items passed on popular bills. There are two such \nprovisions included in this conference report today and that's why I \nsupported Senators Dorgan and Murray in their efforts to recommit the \nconference report back to conference.\n  The first goes against one of my principles for maintaining our \nrobust economy. I believe that we should reward patient capital. We \nshould discourage the two-hour investments in hot IPOs and encourage \nthe two-year or longer investments in start-up biotech firms that are \nimportant for our new global economy. That's why I was pleased that the \n1997 Taxpayer Relief Act included a lower capital gains rate for assets \nheld for 18 months or longer. I am disappointed that this IRS reform \nconference report includes language that will remove that important \neconomic incentive.\n  The other provision that was inserted in the legislative darkness was \na backdoor way of preventing serious debate on technical corrections to \nthe ISTEA legislation. Many of us in the Senate are concerned because \nthe ISTEA bill deprived our Veterans of important benefits. It was \nagreed that these benefits should be restored in a corrections bill. \nHowever, the leadership thought it would be best to include these \n``corrections'' in this conference report, where they can't be amended. \nBut our veterans will be harmed by this backdoor strategy and I will \njoin with my colleagues to restore these benefits to our honored \nveterans who served their country.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased this conference report to \nrestructure the Internal Revenue Service has arrived. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation so that every American taxpayer \nis treated with respect and dignity when dealing with the Internal \nRevenue Service.\n\n[[Page S7721]]\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for Senate \napproval of the conference report on the Internal Revenue Service \nRestructuring and Reform Act. This landmark legislation, which is the \nproduct of years of hard work by many parties, will make long-overdue \nreforms to the IRS. As a member of the Conference Committee responsible \nfor crafting this agreement, I believe we have made great strides in \ndeveloping a statutory framework to increase the accountability of the \nIRS and to protect the rights of taxpayers in their dealings with the \nIRS.\n  There have been numerous congressional hearings over the past year \nthat have clearly highlighted the need to overhaul IRS operations. In \nthe course of these hearings, Congress has reviewed all aspects of the \nService's operations and found an agency in serious need of reform and \nrepair, especially in the area of taxpayer service.\n  As the Chairman of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, I had a \nparticular interest in how the IRS's management structure could be \nimproved to better serve the American public. To that end, I am pleased \nthat this conference agreement will overhaul the structure of the IRS \nand provide significant new management and personnel tools to assist \nthe IRS Commissioner in restructuring the Service. Commissioner \nRossotti has demonstrated his commitment to working with Congress to \nmeet this mandate.\n  The conference agreement creates a new Oversight Board for the IRS to \ndirect these reform initiatives. The Board is composed primarily of \nprivate individuals with expertise in the areas of management, customer \nservice, information technology and taxpayer compliance, and it has \nbeen granted wide-ranging authority to oversee management of the IRS \nand the administration of tax laws.\n  Of great interest to me have been the issues surrounding membership \non the Oversight Board of an IRS employee or employee representative. \nThe conference agreement does provide for an IRS employee or employee \nrepresentative to serve on the Oversight Board, and I am pleased that \nthe conferees adopted my proposal to eliminate the Senate bill's \nblanket waiver of criminal conflict of interest ethics laws as they \napplied to the employee representative on the Board. However, I still \noppose Congress giving the President the authority to waive these \ncriminal laws for the employee board member. There are many individuals \nqualified to be an effective employee representative who would not need \nto be exempted from federal ethics laws in order to serve on the Board. \nWaiving criminal laws in order to accommodate one member of the Board \nestablishes a troubling and dangerous precedent.\n  The conference agreement also grants significant new personnel \nauthorities to the IRS. These new authorities are intended to help \nCommissioner Rossotti bring in high-quality private sector \nprofessional, administrative and technical personnel to address the \nmany management problems facing the agency. These authorities break new \nground in terms of federal personnel pay and management policies. By \ngranting these authorities to the IRS, Congress will have high \nexpectations that the reform agenda is indeed carried through.\n  Mr. President, the provisions I have noted are only a part of the \nimportant reforms contained in this restructuring bill. The conference \nagreement also contains many changes that will directly affect the \nrelationship between the IRS and taxpayer to provide greater \nprotections of the rights of taxpayers. For example, this legislation \nwill shift the burden of proof in tax disputes from the taxpayer to the \nIRS, and it will increase penalties against the IRS for violations of \nthese rights. The conference agreement would provide relief to so-\ncalled ``innocent spouses'' who, under current law, can be held \nresponsible for huge tax bills incurred by a former spouse. The \nagreement also provides significant relief to taxpayers with regard to \ninterest and penalties that are applied by the IRS.\n  Finally, it should be noted that this legislation provides further \ntax relief for Americans. The conference agreement will eliminate the \n18 month holding period that was included in the Taxpayer Relief Act of \n1997 for assets in order to qualify for the lowest tax rate on capital \ngains. Under this agreement, any gain realized on the sale of assets \nheld for at least one year will be taxed at a rate of 10 percent for \ntaxpayers in the 15 percent tax bracket, and at a rate of 20 percent \nfor all other taxpayers. In addition to reducing the tax burden on \nAmericans, this provision will simplify the unnecessarily complex \ncapital gains provision that was included in the 1997 bill.\n  Mr. President, enacting these far-reaching reforms is only one step \nCongress can take to provide relief to taxpayers. Next, we need to do \naway with the current complex tax code and replace it with one that is \nsimpler and fairer. In approving these reforms, we should also keep in \nmind that our ultimate goal is to reduce the tax burden on hard-working \nAmerican families.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \nconference report on the IRS reform legislation, but also to raise \nconcerns about several provisions in the bill.\n  Mr. President, I believe this legislation goes a long way in making a \nnumber of important organizational and management reforms at the IRS \nthat will enable the agency to become more efficient and taxpayer-\nfriendly. Such steps are welcome and should help to address the \nconcerns of millions of taxpayers. In addition, the bill includes \nprovisions to encourage electronic filing and promote the use of \ndigital signatures--advances which will substantially improve tax \nadministration for filers and the IRS.\n  However, Mr. President, I am concerned about the long-term cost of \nprovisions in the bill that will make it easier for the wealthiest \nAmericans to convert traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs which allow tax-free \nwithdrawals. Under last year's budget agreement, individuals with an \nannual adjusted gross income of less than $100,000 are permitted to \nconvert traditional IRAs into Roth IRAs. Currently, individuals over \nthe age of 70\\1/2\\ must withdraw a minimum amount from an IRA each year \nand these withdrawals count toward the income threshold for conversion \nto a Roth IRA. Provisions in the conference report, however, would \nexclude required annual withdrawals when determining an individual's \neligibility to convert a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA. As a result, \nsome of America's wealthiest will be able to rollover large IRA \nbalances into Roth IRAs, thus exempting themselves and their heirs from \nfuture taxes.\n  While the Roth IRA provisions will raise tax revenues initially \nbecause they will encourage taxable conversions, the long-term costs \nresulting from foregone revenue will be significant. In fact, in \nrecognition of this issue, the conferees delayed implementation of the \nconversion provision until 2005, thereby putting the revenue losses \noutside of the 10-year budget scoring window.\n  Mr. President, I am also concerned about provisions that reduce the \nholding period for investments from 18 months to 12 months to qualify \nfor a lower capital gains rate. In the Taxpayer Relief Act passed in \n1997, Congress reduced the capital gains tax rate, but lengthened the \nholding period necessary to take advantage of the new lower rate. It \nwas thought that lengthening the holding period would discourage \nchurning, and encourage long-term savings and investment. By reducing \nthe holding period, we are abandoning one important condition of last \nyear's capital gains reduction, and we may be encouraging short-term \nprofit-taking at the expense of long-term investment. I believe such a \nprovision is unwise and costly in view of the dismally low savings rate \nwhich currently exists in the U.S.\n  Finally, I am concerned that the conferees knowingly failed to close \na loophole accidentally created in the Taxpayer Relief Act which \nbenefits several hundred of the wealthiest Americans. Specifically, the \nloophole benefits the heirs of individuals whose estates are worth more \nthan $17 million, saving each estate approximately $200,000 in taxes. \nThe cost of this loophole is $880 million over 10 years. In view of its \nsignificant cost and limited benefit, I believe the conferees should \nhave used the IRS reform legislation as an opportunity to close this \nloophole, not affirm it.\n  Again, Mr. President, on balance I believe this is a good bill. \nHowever, I would hope that my colleagues consider the concerns I have \nraised when\n\n[[Page S7722]]\n\nthe Senate debates tax legislation in the future.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the conference \nreport for H.R. 2676, the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and \nReform Act of 1998. I commend my colleagues on the Senate Finance \nCommittee, namely Chairman Roth and Senator Moynihan for crafting a \nbill that takes an important step forward in the effort to protect the \nrights of our nation's taxpayers.\n  The IRS is an agency that has earned widespread, deeply felt, and \nentirely justified criticism. For too long the IRS has permitted \npractices that harass rather than help taxpayers. In my view, a full-\nscale, top-to-bottom overhaul of this agency is long overdue.\n  Recent Congressional hearings have chronicled a litany of official \nneglect, heavy-handed threats, and outright abuse of innocent citizens. \nClearly, Mr. President, no one likes to pay taxes. But that duty should \nnot be made even more difficult by the unacceptable behavior of the \nagency responsible for collecting those taxes.\n  Many of my constituents in Connecticut have sought assistance from my \noffice in their efforts to remedy what they feel is unhelpful, \nunpleasant, and at times unfair treatment by officers of the IRS.\n  I heard from one gentleman who went to the IRS to pay several hundred \ndollars he owed in back taxes--only to be handed a tax bill that, with \npenalties and interest, totaled upwards of $30,000. Other Connecticut \nresidents have told me stories of the IRS losing their tax payments--\nand then charging them interest and penalties on the very funds that \nthe agency lost. They have told of calling the IRS and finding it \nimpossible to locate a person who will simply answer their questions.\n  The list goes on and on, Mr. President, and the more people you talk \nto, the more nightmares you hear. The problems at the IRS, however, go \nfar beyond the actions of a few agents at the IRS. For years, the \nagency has fostered a climate where taxpayers feel scorned rather than \nserved, and that is why the IRS reform legislation before us today is \nso important.\n  This legislation contains more than 50 new taxpayer rights and \nprotections. Most importantly, it will shift the burden of proof away \nfrom the taxpayer and onto the IRS. Today, when someone is accused of a \ncrime like bank robbery, they're presumed to be innocent until proven \nguilty. Yet, if the IRS says you didn't pay enough taxes, you're \npresumed guilty until proven innocent. That, Mr. President, is wrong.\n  For too long we've seen a ``shoot first, ask questions later'' \napproach to enforcement by the IRS. By shifting the burden of proof, \nthis bill will require that the IRS prove its allegations with \nevidence. It will help ensure that the IRS exercises appropriate \ncaution and consideration prior to commencing an enforcement action \nagainst any taxpayer.\n  This reform bill also protects people from paying penalties and \ninterest that they should never have been required to pay. Under \ncurrent law, taxpayers must pay penalties and interest whether or not \nthey knew that back taxes are due. As a result, some taxpayers were \nassessed hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars in fines without ever \nhaving actually been told by the IRS that money was owed. This bill \nsuspends penalties if the taxpayer has not been appropriately notified \nof the debt. It also requires that each penalty notice include a \ncomputation itemizing the penalties or interest due. It's only fair \nthat a taxpayer should have adequate notice of any financial liability \nand know exactly why he or she is paying a fine.\n  The bill also offers relief to an innocent spouse who would otherwise \nbecome liable for his or her ex-spouse's tax obligations. I'm sure that \nmany of my colleagues have heard stories similar to those I've heard in \nConnecticut, about people who have become financially wiped out when \nthey find themselves liable for taxes, interest, and penalties because \nof actions by their then-spouse of which they were unaware. The \ninnocent spouse provisions of the bill would help prevent such \nscenarios from occurring in the future. It's a matter of simple \nfairness: a spouse who did not know of an ex-spouse's misdeeds should \nnot be held liable for them.\n  In addition, this legislation requires the IRS Commissioner to fire \nemployees for certain egregious violations--especially those that \nmistreat taxpayers. This provision will send a clear message to agency \nemployees that neglect and abuse of taxpayers will simply not be \ntolerated.\n  Lastly, the bill contains a modest tax cut for people who own stocks, \nbonds, and other assets. I don't object to this provision itself. I do, \nhowever, wish that the Congress had considered additional tax relief \ntargeted to working families--such as expanding the child care tax \ncredit. I hope that such relief will be on the Congressional agenda in \nthe future.\n  I would be remiss if I did not comment about the fact that the \nconferees added a title to this conference report containing the \ntechnical corrections to the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \nCentury, which was signed into law several weeks ago.\n  That law contains a provision affecting Veterans Administration \nbenefits for veterans with smoking-related illnesses. I was concerned \nthat by adopting these technical corrections in the IRS conference \nreport, we would lose a valuable opportunity to restore some or all of \nthese benefits for deserving veterans.\n  It is well known that during their time of active service, many of \nthese individuals received free cigarettes from the federal government \nand were thereby encouraged to smoke. As a result, many of these \nindividuals developed smoking-related illnesses. For that reason, I \nsupported Senator Murray's motion to remove this extraneous title from \nthe legislation we considered today. Unfortunately, this motion was \ntabled by a vote of 50 to 48. It is my hope, however, that the Senate \nwill continue to seek ways to ensure that the government fulfills its \nobligation to help veterans with smoking-related ailments.\n  Overall, Mr. President, I am very pleased to support the legislation \nbefore us today which enjoys broad, bipartisan support. In my view, it \nis a tremendous step forward in our effort to protect the rights of our \nnation's taxpayers. Our nation's taxpayers deserve an IRS that meets \nthe highest standards of efficiency, competence, and courtesy. This \nlegislation takes a major step forward in achieving that goal.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I want to make just a brief statement to \nemphasize my strong support for the IRS Reform bill which passed the \nSenate earlier today. Many thanks to Senators Roth and Moynihan and the \nFinance Committee members for their efforts, and especially Senator Bob \nKerrey, whose year long effort on the Restructuring Commission made \nthis reform package possible.\n  The IRS Reform bill contains significant measures that will improve \nthe life of every American by improving an agency that touches the \nlives of every American. The bill will reform IRS management by \nenhancing private sector input through the creation of the Oversight \nBoard. It will also strengthen internal IRS management by providing \nincreased flexibility to hire the best people, recognize those IRS \nemployees who do their jobs well and fire those who do not.\n  Perhaps most importantly, the IRS Reform Bill is grounded in the \nprinciples of consumer protection and accountability. We all agree that \nthe IRS should run more like a business, focusing on management \nefficiency and high standards of performance. But businesses answer to \nshareholders and the bottom line. The IRS must answer to the American \npeople. And for too long, the agency has operated as if it answered to \nno one.\n  We have witnessed this regrettable circumstance in my home state of \nWisconsin where for two and a half years we have worked to address \nallegations of misconduct and discrimination at the Milwaukee-Waukesha \nIRS Offices. These allegations were so serious that some IRS employees \nfelt the need to sneak into my office in Milwaukee to report on abuses. \nI am pleased that the debate on IRS reform allowed us to move forward \nin our attempts to address the Milwaukee situation and am convinced \nthat in approving this historic legislation, we will be taking \nsignificant steps to prevent similar incidences from occurring in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, I do want to mention my regret at the decision to \ninclude\n\n[[Page S7723]]\n\nthe tax policy change involving Roth IRA conversion rules. While I \nsupport the IRS reform bill, I disagreed with the policy decision to \nloosen the conversion rules so that it will be easier for wealthy \nretirees to convert from traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs. This may cover \nthe cost of the IRS bill and generate income for the Treasury in the \nshort term, but it will cost the Treasury and the American taxpayer \ndearly in the long run. This change, which is really just an accounting \ngimmick, will benefit those who do not need help and may undermine our \nefforts to maintain the progress we've made in balancing the budget. In \naddition, it may jeopardize other pressing long term issues such as \nmaking sure that social security is available to needy retirees in \nyears to come.\n  That said, however, I am still pleased to have been part of the \ncreation of a more consumer-friendly, efficient and responsible IRS.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I want to just take a few seconds to thank \nmy colleagues for their support in this most important initiative. It \nhas been less than a year that we have really been dealing with this \nproblem. Today, we have seen the enactment of truly historic \nlegislation.\n  It is my firm conviction that because of this reform legislation, it \nwill mean a new day for the American taxpayer. And the reason I think \nthis legislation has had such broad support is that it is not only good \nfor the American taxpayer, but it is good for the agency itself, it is \ngood for the employees who work there. All we seek is an agency that \nprovides service, stability, and fairness to the American people.\n  I can tell you that we would not have succeeded in this effort if we \nhad not had bipartisan support.\n  I particularly want to pay my respect and thanks to the ranking \nmember, Pat Moynihan, who is a joy to work with, and who always is able \nto help move along desirable legislation. It was not only due to his \nefforts, but to many others too many to enumerate. But I particularly \nwant to thank the staff of the Finance Committee, both Republican and \nDemocrat, and of the Joint Committee on Taxation for their \ncontribution. I can tell you that much of the staff worked day in and \nday out, night after night, and on weekends to make this possible \ntoday.\n  I, again, want to thank all those who contributed so much. We look \nforward to seeing an agency that is reformed become service-oriented.\n  I believe, I say to Senator Moynihan, that we have given the tools to \nthe new Commissioner, Rossotti, that will enable him to make the \nchanges we all seek in a bipartisan fashion.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I first thank our esteemed chairman \nfor his characteristically generous remarks, and all involved--to agree \nwith him; to point out that this is the first such legislation since \nthe Internal Revenue Service was established under Abraham Lincoln in \n1862. Our purpose was to renew the 19th century agency, to invigorate \nit, and to give to the employees, the public servants, the respect to \nwhich they are entitled as public servants. Respect is one of the \nprincipal rewards for public service. I hope we have done that with the \noverwhelming support here on the floor, and the unanimous vote in the \nFinance Committee.\n  Once again, our chairman has managed to bring us together and produce \nyet another major legislation out of the Finance Committee unanimously, \nwhich presents itself so clearly to the entire Senate floor.\n  I would not want to close without mentioning again the role of \nSenators Kerrey and Grassley in the commission that preceded our work, \nand the staff that did heroic work. I would particularly mention on our \nside Mark Patterson, and Nick Giordano, whose encyclopedic knowledge, \nin fact, made our contribution hopefully of substance.\n  So concludes a long year's work. I say well done to the chairman. I \nthank the chairman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/09/senate-section/article/S7717-4", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    VISIT TO THE SENATE BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF POLAND, JERZY BUZEK\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

GRANTS TO STATES FOR WORKPLACE AND COMMUNITY \n                   TRANSITION TRAINING FOR INCARCERATED YOUTH \n                   OFFENDERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Over 150,000 youth offenders age 21 and younger are \n     incarcerated in the Nation's jails, juvenile facilities, and \n     prisons.\n       (2) Most youth offenders who are incarcerated have been \n     sentenced as first-time adult felons.\n       (3) Approximately 75 percent of youth offenders are high \n     school dropouts who lack basic literacy and life skills, have \n     little or no job experience, and lack marketable skills.\n       (4) The average incarcerated youth has attended school only \n     through grade 10.\n       (5) Most of these youths can be diverted from a life of \n     crime into productive citizenship with available educational, \n     vocational, work skills, and related service programs.\n       (6) If not involved with educational programs while \n     incarcerated, almost all of these youths will return to a \n     life of crime upon release.\n       (7) The average length of sentence for a youth offender is \n     about 3 years. Time spent in prison provides a unique \n     opportunity for education and training.\n       (8) Even with quality education and training provided \n     during incarceration, a period of intense supervision, \n     support, and counseling is needed upon release to ensure \n     effective reintegration of youth offenders into society.\n       (9) Research consistently shows that the vast majority of \n     incarcerated youths will not return to the public schools to \n     complete their education.\n       (10) There is a need for alternative educational \n     opportunities during incarceration and after release.\n       (b) Definition.--For purposes of this part, the term \n     ``youth offender'' means a male or female offender under the \n     age of 25, who is incarcerated in a State prison, including a \n     prerelease facility.\n       (c) Grant Program.--The Secretary of Education (in this \n     section referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall establish a \n     program in accordance with this section to provide grants to \n     the State correctional education agencies in the States, from \n     allocations for the States under subsection (i), to assist \n     and encourage incarcerated youths to acquire functional \n     literacy, life, and job skills, through the pursuit of a \n     postsecondary education certificate, or an associate of arts \n     or bachelor's degree while in prison, and employment \n     counseling and other related services which start during \n     incarceration and continue through prerelease and while on \n     parole.\n       (d) Application.--To be eligible for a grant under this \n     section, a State correctional education agency shall submit \n     to the Secretary a proposal for a youth offender program \n     that--\n       (1) identifies the scope of the problem, including the \n     number of incarcerated youths in need of postsecondary \n     education and vocational training;\n\n[[Page S7757]]\n\n       (2) lists the accredited public or private educational \n     institution or institutions that will provide postsecondary \n     educational services;\n       (3) lists the cooperating agencies, public and private, or \n     businesses that will provide related services, such as \n     counseling in the areas of career development, substance \n     abuse, health, and parenting skills;\n       (4) describes the evaluation methods and performance \n     measures that the State correctional education agency will \n     employ, which methods and measures--\n       (A) shall be appropriate to meet the goals and objectives \n     of the proposal;

and\n       (7) describes how students will be selected so that only \n     youth offenders eligible under subsection (f) will be \n     enrolled in postsecondary programs.\n       (e) Program Requirements.--Each State correctional \n     education agency receiving a grant under this section shall--\n       (1) integrate activities carried out under the grant with \n     the objectives and activities of the school-to-work programs \n     of such State, including--\n       (A) work experience or apprenticeship programs;\n       (B) transitional worksite job training for vocational \n     education students that is related to the occupational goals \n     of such students and closely linked to classroom and \n     laboratory instruction;\n       (C) placement services in occupations that the students are \n     preparing to enter;\n       (D) employment-based learning programs;

\n     and\n       (2) is 25 years of age or younger.\n       (g) Length of Participation.--A State correctional \n     education agency receiving a grant under this section shall \n     provide educational and related services to each \n     participating youth offender for a period not to exceed 5 \n     years, 1 year of which may be devoted to study in a graduate \n     education degree program or to remedial education services \n     for students who have obtained a secondary school diploma. \n     Educational and related services shall start during the \n     period of incarceration in prison or prerelease and may \n     continue during the period of parole.\n       (h) Education Delivery Systems.--State correctional \n     education agencies and cooperating institutions shall, to the \n     extent practicable, use high-tech applications in developing \n     programs to meet the requirements and goals of this section.\n       (i) Allocation of Funds.--From the amounts appropriated \n     pursuant to subsection (j), the Secretary shall allot to each \n     State an amount that bears the same relationship to such \n     funds as the total number of students eligible under \n     subsection (f) in such State bears to the total number of \n     such students in all States.\n       (j) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this section $14,000,000 for \n     fiscal year 1999 and such sums as may be necessary for each \n     of the 4 succeeding fiscal years.\n\n                     PART F--EDUCATION OF THE DEAF\n\n     SEC. 761.

GNMA GUARANTEE FEE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 306(g)(3)(A) of the National \n     Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1721(g)(3)(A)) is amended by striking \n     ``No fee or charge'' and all that follows through ``States)'' \n     and inserting ``The Association shall assess and collect a \n     fee in an amount equal to 9 basis points''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall take effect on October 1, 2002.\n\n     SEC. 797. PROTECTION OF STUDENT SPEECH AND ASSOCIATION \n                   RIGHTS.\n\n       (a) Protection of Rights.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     no student attending an institution of higher education on a \n     full- or part-time basis should, on the basis of \n     participation in protected speech or protected association, \n     be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, \n     or be subjected to discrimination or official sanction under \n     any education program, activity, or division of the \n     institution directly or indirectly receiving financial \n     assistance under the Higher Education Act of 1965, whether or \n     not such program, activity, or division is sponsored or \n     officially sanctioned by the institution.\n       (b) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed--\n       (1) to discourage the imposition of an official sanction on \n     a student that has willfully participated in the disruption \n     or attempted disruption of a lecture, class, speech, \n     presentation, or performance made or scheduled to be made \n     under the auspices of the institution of higher education; or\n       (2) to prevent an institution of higher education from \n     taking appropriate and effective action to prevent violations \n     of State liquor laws, to discourage binge drinking and other \n     alcohol abuse, to protect students from sexual harassment \n     including assault and date rape, or to regulate unsanitary or \n     unsafe conditions in any student residence.\n       (c) Definitions.--For the purposes of this section:\n       (1) Official sanction.--The term ``official sanction''--\n       (A) means expulsion, suspension, probation, censure, \n     condemnation, reprimand, or any other disciplinary, coercive, \n     or adverse action taken by an institution of higher education \n     or administrative unit of the institution; and\n       (B) includes an oral or written warning made by an official \n     of an institution of higher education acting in the official \n     capacity of the official.\n       (2) Protected association.--The term ``protected \n     association'' means the joining, assembling, and residing \n     with others that is protected under the first and 14th \n     amendments to the Constitution, or would be protected if the \n     institution of higher education involved were subject to \n     those amendments.\n       (3) Protected speech.--The term ``protected speech'' means \n     speech that is protected under the first and 14th amendments \n     to the Constitution, or would be protected if the institution \n     of higher education involved were subject to those \n     amendments.\n\n     SEC. 798. BINGE DRINKING ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Collegiate Initiative To Reduce Binge Drinking''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Many college president rank alcohol abuse as the number \n     one problem on campus.\n       (2) Alcohol is a factor in the 3 leading causes of death \n     (accidents, homicides, and suicides) for individuals aged 15 \n     through 24.\n       (3) More than any other group, college students tend to \n     consume large numbers of drinks in rapid succession with the \n     intention of becoming drunk.\n       (4) 84 percent of college students report drinking alcohol \n     during the school year, with 44 percent of all college \n     students qualifying as binge drinkers and 19 percent of all \n     college students qualifying as frequent binge drinkers.\n       (5) Alcohol is involved in a large percentage of all campus \n     rapes, violent crimes, student suicides, and fraternity \n     hazing accidents.\n       (6) Heavy alcohol consumption on college campuses can \n     result in drunk driving crashes, hospitalization for alcohol \n     overdoses, trouble with police, injury, missed classes, and \n     academic failure.\n       (7) The secondhand effects of student alcohol consumption \n     range from assault, property damage, and unwanted sexual \n     advances, to interruptions in study or sleep, or having to \n     ``babysit'' another student who drank too much.\n       (8) Campus binge drinking can also lead to the death of our \n     Nation's young and promising students.\n       (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, \n     in an effort to change the culture of alcohol consumption on \n     college campuses, all institutions of higher education should \n     carry out the following:\n       (1) The president of the institution should appoint a task \n     force consisting of school administrators, faculty, students, \n     Greek system representatives, and others to conduct a full \n     examination of student and academic life at the institution. \n     The task force should make recommendations for a broad range \n     of policy and program changes that would serve to reduce \n     alcohol and other drug-related problems. The institution \n     should provide resources to assist the task force in \n     promoting the campus policies and proposed environmental \n     changes that have been identified.\n       (2) The institution should provide maximum opportunities \n     for students to live in an alcohol-free environment and to \n     engage in stimulating, alcohol-free recreational and leisure \n     activities.\n       (3) The institution should enforce a ``zero tolerance'' \n     policy on the illegal consumption of alcohol by students at \n     the institution.\n       (4) The institution should vigorously enforce the \n     institution's code of disciplinary sanctions for those who \n     violate campus alcohol policies. Students with alcohol or \n     other drug-related problems should be referred for \n     appropriate assistance.\n       (5) The institution should adopt a policy of eliminating \n     alcoholic beverage-related sponsorship of on-campus \n     activities. The institution should adopt policies limiting \n     the advertisement and production of alcoholic beverages on \n     campus.\n       (6) The institution should work with the local community, \n     including local businesses, in a ``Town/Gown'' alliance to \n     encourage responsible policies toward alcohol consumption and \n     to address illegal alcohol use by students.\n\n     SEC. 799. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING HIGHER EDUCATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Higher education must be kept affordable for all \n     families as the number of students attending institutions of \n     higher education in the 1995-1996 academic year reached \n     19,400,000 students at all levels.\n       (2) According to the College Board's Annual Survey of \n     Colleges, 1997-1998 undergraduate students at United States \n     colleges will pay on average, approximately 5 percent more \n     for the 1997-1998 academic year in tuition and fees at 4-year \n     institutions of higher education than the students paid for \n     the 1996-1997 academic year, and from 2 to 4 percent more for \n     the 1997-1998 academic year in tuition and fees at 2-year \n     institutions of higher education than the students paid for \n     the 1996-1997 academic year.\n       (3) From academic years 1980-1981 to academic years 1994-\n     1995, tuition at 4-year public colleges and universities \n     increased 234 percent, while median household income rose \n     only 82 percent, and as a result, families now spend nearly \n     twice as much of their income on college tuition as families \n     did in 1980.\n       (4) A college education has become less affordable as \n     undergraduate public school tuition has increased \n     substantially in the years preceding 1998.\n       (5) In the 1997-1998 school year, average undergraduate \n     tuition and fees--\n\n[[Page S7778]]\n\n       (A) for public 4-year institutions of higher education were \n     $3,111, representing a 97 percent increase from the 1988-1989 \n     school year; and\n       (B) for private 4-year institutions of higher education \n     were $13,664, representing an increase of 71 percent from the \n     1988-1989 school year.\n       (6) In the 1996-1997 academic year--\n       (A) over $580,000,000 in Federal Supplemental Educational \n     Opportunity Grants were disbursed to more than 990,000 \n     students;\n       (B) $760,000,000 in Federal funds supported more than \n     700,000 students in the Federal Work-Study Program; and\n       (C) more than 700,000 students borrowed approximately \n     $940,000,000 in Federal Perkins Loans.\n       (7) In the 1996-1997 academic year, Federal loan programs \n     provided over $30,000,000,000 in financial aid to students.\n       (8) Student financial aid in the form of loans is \n     disproportionate to the amount of financial aid received \n     through grants. In 1980, approximately 40 percent of Federal \n     student financial aid was distributed through loans. In the \n     1996-1997 academic year, 60 percent of Federal, State, and \n     institutional student financial aid was distributed through \n     loans.\n       (9) As the proportion of Federal grants continues to \n     decline, students and families will have to consider \n     alternative ways to finance a college education.\n       (10) In the 1970s, Federal Pell Grants financed \\3/4\\ of \n     the costs at a public 4-year institution of higher education \n     and \\1/3\\ of the costs at a private 4-year institution of \n     higher education. In contrast, in the 1996-1997 academic \n     year, Federal Pell Grants financed \\1/3\\ of the costs at a 4-\n     year public institution of higher education and \\1/7\\ of the \n     costs at a private 4-year institution of higher education.\n       (11) While student dependence on Federal loans programs has \n     increased, the default rate on those loans has decreased. \n     According to the Department of Education, in fiscal year \n     1990, the national default rate on federally insured student \n     loans was 22.4 percent. In fiscal year 1994, the national \n     default rate declined to 10.4 percent.\n       (12) The National Commission on the Cost of Higher \n     Education concluded in the report of the National Commission \n     that Federal student aid grants have not contributed to \n     increases in tuition while the evidence is inconclusive \n     regarding the impact of Federal student loans on increases in \n     tuition.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the cost of tuition at institutions of higher education \n     continues to increase at a rate above the Consumer Price \n     Index, affecting the nearly 20,000,000 students at all \n     levels, resulting in an increase in the number of students \n     seeking Federal loans and Federal grants;\n       (2) efforts should be made to address the disproportionate \n     share of Federal student aid in the form of Federal student \n     loans compared to Federal student grants available for \n     students at institutions of higher education; and\n       (3) Federal incentives provided to public and private \n     institutions of higher education may be an effective way to \n     limit tuition growth.\n\n     SEC. 799A. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING TEACHER EDUCATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the education of teachers is a university-wide \n     responsibility requiring the integration of subject matter \n     and teacher education course work across faculties with \n     multiple site-based clinical learning experiences;\n       (2) teachers well prepared in both subject matter and good \n     professional practice are essential to raising the \n     achievement levels of our Nation's students, especially in \n     mathematics and the sciences;\n       (3) teacher educators, substantive experts, and \n     kindergarten through grade 12 teachers need to interact with \n     one another through shared experiences that incorporate \n     school-site-based knowledge into the teacher preparation \n     curriculum;\n       (4) partnerships between practitioners and academics \n     working together in all phases of teacher education improve \n     the quality of such education and create incentives for \n     teachers to pursue excellence in their teaching;\n       (5) individuals may be more likely to choose teaching as a \n     career if more flexible teacher preparation programs, \n     tailored to the needs and experiences of the individuals, \n     with multiple entry points and pathways into the teaching \n     profession, are made available;\n       (6) strong leadership skills of school principals are \n     essential to improving the quality of teaching and academic \n     achievement of all students;\n       (7) collaboration among teacher educators, other university \n     faculty, elementary and secondary schools, and community \n     colleges facilitate, strengthen, and renew all the \n     individuals and entities participating in the collaboration.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) Federal programs, including the Federal Work-Study \n     Programs, should encourage students, particularly prospective \n     teachers, to become involved in supervised tutoring and \n     mentoring activities in kindergarten through grade 12 \n     schools;\n       (2) institutions of higher education, kindergarten through \n     grade 12 schools, local educational agencies, States, and the \n     Department of Education should enter into partnerships to \n     identify and prepare promising candidates as future education \n     leaders and to provide continuing professional development \n     opportunities to current principals and other education \n     leaders;\n       (3) options for access to teacher preparation programs and \n     new avenues to careers in teaching should be expanded to \n     reach professionals seeking second careers and individuals \n     whose prior experiences encompass critical subject areas such \n     as mathematics and the sciences;\n       (4) partnerships between institutions of higher education \n     and kindergarten through grade 12 schools should emphasize \n     contacts between faculty and the business community to align \n     expectations for academic achievement to create a more \n     seamless transition for students from secondary to \n     postsecondary schools and to the workplace; and\n       (5) Congress should focus on identifying, replicating, and \n     facilitating the expansion of exemplary partnerships between \n     institutions of higher education and kindergarten through \n     grade 12 schools, with particular emphasis on partnerships \n     targeted toward fostering excellence in kindergarten through \n     grade 12 school leadership, attracting and preparing \n     qualified professionals for new careers in teaching, helping \n     teachers incorporate technology into curricula, and aligning \n     the curricula and expectations for student achievement in \n     secondary schools and institutions of higher education, and \n     for the workplace.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the floor\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Pam Moran, \na fellow with the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, be allowed \nthe privileges of the floor during consideration of S. 1882, the Higher \nEducation Amendments of 1998.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased that the Senate \nis considering S. 1882, the Higher Education Amendments of 1998. This \nlegislation extends for 5 years the authorization of programs under the \nHigher Education Act and makes significant improvements in student \nbenefits and in the operation of these programs.\n  The Higher Education Act is among the most significant statutes under \nthe jurisdiction of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources. Since \nits inception in 1965, the Act has been focused on enhancing the \nopportunities of students to pursue postsecondary education. This \nlegislation will make college more accessible for more Americans by \nincreasing the amount of Pell grants and lowering interest rates for \nstudent loans. By increasing the access and quality of higher \neducation, this bill will help ensure that our nation remains a leader \nin educational excellence for all of our citizens. By giving more \nstudents the ability to attend college, we are giving them the \nopportunity to pursue their dreams.\n  136 years ago this week, Senator Justin Smith Morrill from Vermont \nled the effort in the United States Senate to pass the Land Grant \nCollege Act of 1862, which opened the doors of higher education to all \nAmericans. Today, I am proud to follow in Justin Smith Morrill's \nfootsteps and urge the Senate to pass this important bipartisan \nlegislation which will make the dream of getting a college education \nbecome a reality for millions of students across this nation.\n  Over the years, the federal effort in this area has been substantial \nand will continue to be so. The Higher Education Act currently provides \n$48.5 billion in student financial assistance for 8.5 million students \nand $216 million for institutional development. In 1995-96, 55 percent \nof undergraduate students received financial aid under this Act. Over \nthe next ten years, the Federal Government will guarantee over 88 \nmillion student loans--totaling over $383.5 billion. Over the next five \nyears, the Federal Government will provide more than 25.4 million Pell \nGrants.\n  The reauthorization bill we are considering today preserves the focus \non students--who are the primary reason we have a Higher Education Act \nin the first place. Students now in school will be assured of receiving \nthe lowest interest rate in nearly two decades on their loans. Students \nnow in high school who aspire to a college education will benefit from \nan expanded early intervention program known as CONNECTIONS, as well as \ncontinuing to receive services from the time-tested and highly regarded \nTRIO programs.\n  Students who have graduated and are faced with exceptionally high \nloan burdens will be able to take advantage of extended repayment \noptions under the\n\n[[Page S7779]]\n\nguaranteed loan program. Recognizing the toll which ever increasing \ncollege costs are placing on students, the bill builds on \nrecommendations of the National Commission on the Cost of Higher \nEducation so that students and their families can obtain useful cost \ninformation.\n  This bill reflects a strong commitment to the maintenance of two \nviable loan programs--the guaranteed or Federal Family Education Loan \nProgram (FFELP) and the Direct Loan Program. Among the most challenging \ntasks facing the committee was developing a student loan interest rate \nwhich could offer the lowest viable interest to students while assuring \nsufficient lender participation to preserve full access to loans. After \nnearly a year of consultation with students, lenders, representatives \nof the higher education community, the administration and financial \nservices experts, the committee developed a compromise interest rate \npackage. Lender yield is reduced by 30 basis points while students \nreceive the significant interest rate reduction they have anticipated. \nThis solution is by no means perfect, but it promises to preserve the \nstability of the FFEL program for the nearly 4 million students and \ntheir families who depend upon these loans each year.\n  The legislation also includes a new guaranty agency financing model--\nthe goal of which is to achieve cost savings and efficiencies in the \ndelivery and administration of student aid while ensuring that \nstudents, lenders, the Federal Government, and institutions of higher \neducation receive high quality service. Additional efforts to improve \nthe delivery of student aid programs include the development of a \nPerformance Based Organization (PBO) to strengthen the management of \nkey systems within the Department of Education. A number of provisions \nin the legislation also pave the way toward taking advantage of the \nefficiencies made possible through electronic processing and other \ntechnological advances.\n  Looking toward the future, the bill contains several provisions \ndealing with the Year 2000 computer problem. The Office of Management \nand Budget has raised serious questions about the Department of \nEducation's ability to meet the timetable outlined by the General \nAccounting Office for the testing of software renovation work. Failure \nto renovate all mission critical systems could result in disruptions in \nthe management and delivery of student financial aid to more than 8 \nmillion students. This is an area in which the committee will be \nfollowing closely in the months ahead.\n  Perhaps the most exciting and far-reaching innovation in this \nlegislation is its provisions dealing with teacher preparation. The \nbill before us eliminates some 15 small, categorical teacher training \nprograms--only one of which receives funding--and replaces them with a \ncomprehensive model for change and improvement. The teacher quality \nprovisions included in Title II of S. 1882 are an important first step \ntowards really improving teacher training. I think it will be viewed as \none of the lasting achievements of this reauthorization.\n  It represents a collaboration of good ideas from many members of the \nLabor and Human Resources Committee, each who spent a great deal of \ntime on this matter. The result is a proposal that breaks away from \n``business-as-usual'' practices, and encourages States and education \npartnerships to reform their efforts to meet the needs of students in \ntoday's classroom.\n  At its foundation, Title II embraces the notion that investing in the \npreparation of our nation's teachers is a good one. Well prepared \nteachers play a key role in making it possible for our students to \nachieve the standards required to assure both their own well being and \nthe ability of our country to compete internationally. In fact, the \ncontinued health and strength of our nation depends on our country's \nability to improve the education of our young people. Integral to that \nis the strength and ability of our nation's teaching force. Without a \nstrong, competent, well prepared teaching force, other investments in \neducation will be of little value.\n  The bill takes a two-pronged approach to helping assure that our \nnation's elementary and secondary school teachers will be thoroughly \nprepared to offer the quality of instruction needed to assure that \nstudents achieve the standards we need and expect. Working at both the \nstate level to promote system-wide reforms and at the local level to \ndevelop partnerships to enhance the quality of teacher training, the \nbill offers a comprehensive and systematic approach to this pressing \nnational need.\n  Title II demands excellence from our teacher preparation programs; \nencourages coordination; focuses on the need for academic content \nknowledge and strong teaching skills; and fosters state innovations in \nestablishing more rigorous standards and exploring alternative \ncertification. These efforts recognize the fundamental connection that \nexists among states, institutions of higher education, and efforts to \nimprove education for our nation's elementary and secondary school \nteachers.\n  The teacher training provisions included in this bill are unique in \nother ways as well. In particular, the committee included very strong \naccountability measures as part of this title. In order to maintain a \ngrant, a State or a partnership will have to show improvement--\nmeasurable results--that go to the heart of learning.\n  It is important to consider the Title II provisions in the context of \neducation reform because, as I have said before, good teachers are at \nthe core of educational improvement.\n  It has been 15 years since the national crisis in education was \nraised by the ``A Nation At Risk'' report. The admonition was given in \nthese terse words: If a foreign government had imposed on us our \neducational system we would have declared it an act of war.\n  Yet little has changed. There is some improvement in science but \nlittle in math. Children are coming to school slightly more prepared to \nlearn, but this is primarily in the area of health.\n  It is obvious that nothing is going to change unless it changes in \nthe classroom. And nothing will change in the classroom until the \nteachers change. And the teachers can't be expected to change until \nthey have help in knowing what is expected of them.\n  In the most recent Goals 2000 Report issued last November, we learned \nthat in more than 40 States there was no change in the percentage of \nteachers who reported that they held a degree or held a teaching \ncertificate in their main teaching assignment. In 33 States no change \nwas reported in the proportion of beginning public school teachers who \nparticipated in a formal teacher induction process.\n  Dindo Rivera, who travels about the county for IBM raising this \nissue, likes to explain it this way: If you were an office worker and \nhad fallen asleep as Rip Van Winkle did for twenty years and walked \ninto a modern office you would go into catatonic shock at trying to do \nanything from answering the phone to typing a letter. However, if you \nwere a school teacher when you walked back into the classroom after \nyour slumber, you'd feel right at home in your subjects.\n  Some changes are occurring. The concept of ``social promotion'' \ninitiated in the 60's is being challenged but creating serious problems \nfor schools requiring remedial help. Literacy programs are being \ninitiated to stop or reduce the inflow of non readers. But as to the \ncrisis of math and science and other critical subjects, we have seen \nlittle in the way of results.\n  Pointing a finger at the colleges of education is not inappropriate. \nThey need to change. They must ensure that graduates are capable of \nfacing today's challenge--not yesteryears. But they are unlikely to \nchange unless the universities that host them pay attention to them. \nOften times, the schools of education are treated as step children. In \nmost cases the degrees issued are not enough to increase their capacity \nto teach updated courses--and these updated courses are sorely needed.\n  We must focus attention on this issue. We should fully fund the new \nTitle II Teacher Quality Program that is included in this bill. We \nshould also call together the presidents of the universities to \nchallenge them to take immediate action to remedy the crisis. We must \nenlist the teachers and the teachers unions and insist that they too \nhelp out.\n  The Higher Education bill before us does make strides in the \ndirection of reform and improvement. Still, we must do even more to \nraise awareness\n\n[[Page S7780]]\n\nof the problem and the need to change. The number of teachers is not as \nimportant as the quality of teachers. On the Federal level we must \nfocus on promoting and ensuring quality. We don't necessarily need \nmillions of new teachers--what we really need are millions of good \nteachers.\n  The need for good teachers has been recognized. The Hunt Commission \nReport, ``What Matters Most: Teaching for America's Future'' has a goal \nof providing 100,000 nationally accredited teachers. But their goal is \ntoo far off into the next century. Their goal would provide one teacher \nfor every school. We need one for every classroom and, most certainly \nevery new teacher graduating must be trained to be a good teacher. \nEvery teacher's college must meet that challenge and every present \nteacher must be given the training to be a good teacher. The present \nbill takes a giant step in that direction.\n  In closing, I would like to acknowledge the long hours and hard work \nof members of the Labor and Human Resources Committee and their staffs \nover the past 18 months as we have worked to develop this legislation. \nEven with the substantial streamlining we have done in the Act, a \nthorough review of all its provisions is a large and challenging task. \nAt this time, I would like to offer particular thanks to the ranking \nminority member, Senator Kennedy, to Senator Coats, and to Senator \nDodd. These three members have gone well beyond the extra mile in \nhelping to forge a bipartisan approach to improving the lives of \nAmerican students. Throughout committee deliberations, there have been \nlegitimate differences of opinion. The spirit of cooperation and the \ncommitment to working through these differences has allowed us to \npresent to the Senate a solid piece of legislation which I believe \nevery member of this body can proudly support.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield for a consent request.\n\n\n                        Privileges of the Floor\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Erin \nShanahan, Sarah West and Micky Holmes, interns and fellows, be allowed \non the floor during the debate and votes on the education bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Privileges of the Floor\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent congressional \nfellow Jennifer Krone and Jim Butler be granted floor privileges.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, at the outset, as we begin this debate on \nthe Higher Education Act, I thank my good friend, the chairman of our \ncommittee, Senator Jeffords, and all of the members of the committee \nfor their broad support for this legislation and for the workmanship \nwhich was reflected in this product over a considerable period of time.\n  This legislation was reported unanimously out of our committee, and I \nthink it reflects the best judgment of the members of the committee. I \nam particularly impressed by the work of our friends and colleagues on \nthe Republican side--Senator Coats, Senator Collins, and many of the \nothers, members who were very, very much involved; and on our side, \nSenator Dodd, Senator Murray, and many, many others whom I will refer \nto in my opening comments as well. This has been really a very strong \nbipartisan effort.\n  Those of us who have had the honor to serve on the Education \nCommittee for a number of years have always felt that education is \nsomething which should have a special position in the thinking of not \nonly the families of America but elected officials in trying to find a \ncommon ground in these areas that are so important to families across \nthis country. This bill reflects that continued effort by the \nmembership of the committee.\n  We have strong differences on some policy issues, which we have seen \nin recent hours and recent days, which we will see coming through these \nnext several weeks, the next 35 days that we are in the Senate. \nThankfully, we have been able to keep that kind of view out of the \nconsideration of this legislation.\n  There will be several amendments from our side and from the \nRepublican side. Those are based upon rather thoughtful consideration \nand thoughtful differences on education policy, but they are certainly \nserious amendments and thoughtful ones, and we look forward to \naddressing these issues as we move ahead.\n  We are very hopeful that we can move this legislation, because of its \nimportance, to an early conclusion with due opportunity for the \nmembership to express their views.\n  I want to pay particular tribute, as I mentioned, to the chairman of \nour committee, Senator Jeffords. He has had a longstanding, continuing \ncommitment to a number of different issues in our Human Resources \nCommittee, but I believe personally the commitment in terms of \neducation generally has been a very special interest. He has been \nabsolutely tireless in working with all the members of the committee to \nbring this product forward. All of us are grateful to him and to his \nstaff for all of the efforts they have made and for the strong and good \nleadership that he has provided in fashioning this legislation.\n  Our goal in this bill is to strengthen the Federal support for higher \neducation. A recent study from the Institute of Higher Education Policy \nsummarizes the public and private benefits of higher education, both \neconomic and social. As you can see on this chart, higher education \nprovides major economic benefits, such as increased tax revenues, \ngreater productivity, increased flexibility in the workforce.\n  We are all mindful that when we had the GI bill after World War II, \nfor every dollar that was invested in the GI bill, more than $8 was \nactually returned by those who participated in those scholarship \nprograms. The Nation benefits, the individuals benefit, our communities \nbenefit, America benefits, and our position in the world and our values \nin the world benefit from the strong investment that we make in \neducation and by the extraordinary talent that we have in the young \npeople of our country.\n  This legislation provides vital social benefits as well. College \ngraduates have greater involvement in their communities, give more to \ncharities. They also show an appreciation of diversity that is vital in \nour increasingly complex society. This legislation expands access to \ncollege for all qualified students. It increases the maximum \nauthorization for Pell grants for the neediest students and expands the \nformula for need analysis to protect more of the income of working \nparents and students.\n  The bill also continues the critical investments in graduate \neducation through the program of Graduate Assistance in Areas of \nNational Need and the portable Javits fellowships for talented students \nin the arts, humanities, and social sciences.\n  The bill also will enable colleges to work with faculty and \nadministrators to improve teaching for students with disabilities. Many \nmore students with disabilities are benefiting from higher education, \nand faculty members often have little experience in teaching these \nstudents. This bill reaches out to all colleges and universities and \nincludes training in this area for graduate teaching assistants--the \nfaculty of the future.\n\n  The bill takes a major step in improving training of teachers. \nSenator Jeffords has spoken to that issue in very considerable detail, \nbut let me underline some points on that subject.\n  Fifty percent of the funding in this category goes to local \npartnerships that include elementary and secondary schools, colleges, \nand even teachers unions, businesses, and community organizations. The \nother 50 percent goes to competitive grants to State education \nagencies.\n  The bill also includes greater loan forgiveness for teachers. It \nforgives up to $8,000 of loans for teachers who teach at least 3 years \nin high-need schools. Many college graduates with heavy debtloads \ncannot afford to go into teaching in schools that need help the most. \nThis program will make it easier for idealistic young men and women to \nwork with the needy children.\n  The bill also includes early intervention initiatives to encourage \nstudents to plan for college as part of their future. One of the \ngreatest tragedies of education today is that so many young students in \nelementary school, middle school, and high school regard college as out \nof reach.\n\n[[Page S7781]]\n\n  I know many of our colleagues have had the opportunity that I have \nhad in going out and talking to middle-school students around our \nStates. You ask those young people, those young students, ``How many of \nyou would want to go to college?'' and almost before the words come out \nof your mouth, every hand goes up in that classroom. There is a great \ndesire, a great interest, on the part of these young students to \ncontinue their education.\n  Then something happens as they go through eighth and ninth grades and \nbegin to become more disillusioned about the possibilities of going on \nto college and continuing their education, perhaps somewhat more \nrealistic about some of the financial obligations that they have. It is \nnot completely separate from the fact that the increased use of drugs \nin the eighth and ninth grades increases about 300 percent to 350 \npercent. The time when kids are beginning to cool off in terms of their \nrealization of the possibilities for their continuing on to higher \neducation corresponds to the period of dramatic increase among young \npeople in terms of substance abuse.\n  Mr. President, the hope and the desire of young students in our \nsociety to go on to higher education is there in the middle schools, \nand so many of them are discouraged from doing so. This happens at a \ntime when there has been a corresponding record of increased use of \nillegal substances. Many people believe it is the increased use of the \nsubstances that have discouraged students.\n  On the other hand, there are many others who believe that these young \nstudents, when they find out they will not have the opportunity to go \non to higher education or continue their education, become discouraged, \nin many instances despondent, lose interest and subject themselves to \nthe adverse behavior that some young people involve themselves in.\n  The whole question in terms of trying to reach out to these students \nin elementary school, middle school, and high school is very, very \nimportant. We need to do what we can to change that distressing \nmindset. This bill is a major step in that direction.\n  The bill also expands the Federal aid for student learning through \ndistance education. The managers' package broadens the demonstration \nprograms, and allows the use of Federal aid for certain distance \neducation certificate programs.\n  Distance learning can open the doors of higher education to many who \ncannot attend classes because they live in remote areas or because of \ntheir job or family responsibilities. Some have some special needs, as \nwell. But we must also ensure that the promise of these programs do not \nlead to abuses. The bill calls for the Department of Education to \nmonitor these changes in distance education, and to report to Congress \non the result.\n  Another important provision in the bill calls for the creation of a \nPerformance Based Organization in the Department of Education. Its goal \nis to streamline and improve the financial aid functions of the \nDepartment, and give it more flexibility to deal with the many aspects \nof Federal aid.\n  The bill also enables guaranty agencies to enter into voluntary \nflexible agreements with the Secretary of Education. It will be more \nbusinesslike and will focus more heavily on preventing defaults. The \nguaranty agency in Massachusetts has been in the forefront of this \nreform.\n  Under these arrangements, guaranty agencies can concentrate on \npreventing defaults instead of simply collecting from students after \nthey have defaulted on their loans. Under current law, these agencies \nare paid too much when the students go into default and they are not \npaid enough to prevent the defaults in the first place.\n  In a pilot project, the Great Lakes Guaranty Agency reduced its \ndefault rate by 96 percent, 96 percent over 18 months by emphasizing \nthe prevention of defaults. This is a win-win-win idea. The student \nborrowers win because they avoid default and ruining their credit. \nGovernment wins because it saves millions in reinsurance payments. The \nlenders win because the loan continues to earn interest in their \nportfolios.\n  This bill accommodates the concerns of many individuals. Senator \nTorricelli in his bill, S. 1534, says students who are called to active \nduty in the Reserves of our Armed Forces will not have to worry about \nrepaying their student loans before they return. Senator Moseley-Braun \nsponsored a program to encourage more individuals from \nunderrepresentative groups to become college professors. Senators \nSarbanes and Mikulski spearheaded efforts to include the Thurgood \nMarshall Legal Education Opportunity Program.\n\n  The major issue in this bill is the interest rate on student loans. \nThe bill reduces the interest rate that students will pay on loans by \nalmost 1 percent, a substantial benefit for students. The average \nborrower with a loan of $12,000 will save $650 in interest payments \nover the 10-year life of the loan. The average master's degree student \nwith a debt of $20,000 will save more than $1,000. For borrowers with \nlarger loans, the savings will be even greater.\n  Unfortunately and unwisely, the bill trims the rates paid to banks \nonly slightly. As in the House bill, students will pay the same lower \ninterest rate to the banks that they pay to the Government in the \nDirect Loan Program. But the bill offers a sweetheart deal to the banks \nby giving the banks a half of a percent interest rate subsidy. This \nsubsidy means that bank receipts will go down only slightly from the \nexcessive receipts they receive under the high interest rates now in \neffect. It is estimated that the average bank return on student loans \nwill be 16 percent--far higher than the average bank return of 12 \npercent on its overall assets since 1970.\n  This interest rate subsidy will be paid by the taxpayers. The \nCongressional Budget Office calculates that the costs will be at least \n$1 billion over 5 years and maybe as much as $3.6 billion. The Office \nof Management and Budget calculates that this subsidy will cost $2.7 \nbillion over that period, a cost that is not paid for under the bill.\n  This failure could trigger a sequester of mandatory inventory \nprograms in October, including Medicare, and we need to deal with this \nproblem more effectively. The best solution is to change the current \nsystem under which Congress sets the interest rates the banks can \ncharge. Instead, we should adopt, I believe, a market-based system for \ninterest rates, not one based on price fixing by Congress.\n  We are considering offering an amendment that allows the Secretary of \nEducation and the Secretary of the Treasury to conduct pilot programs \nusing auctions as an alternative for setting these interest rates. \nCompetition should determine how much of a premium lenders need in \norder to offer and service these loans. The results of the pilot \nprograms would be reported to Congress and full-scale implementation \nwould follow only after a subsequent vote of approval by Congress. \nThese pilot programs will give Congress the information to make a \nsensible decision providing adequate incentives to the banks without \ngouging students or taxpayers.\n  I look forward to final Senate action on this bill. I commend the \nconstructive bipartisan spirit that has brought us to this point. Our \ncolleges and universities deserve no less.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for a period of \nmorning business for the purposes of making a statement for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we have \na Senate agreement we want to propound momentarily regarding an \nemergency piece of legislation that has now been cleared on both sides. \nI don't want to interrupt the Senator from Florida, but we are anxious.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I modify my unanimous consent request to first provide \nfor the Senator from Kentucky to proceed as indicated.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Reserving the right to object, I know we are trying to \nget the opening statements out with respect to this bill. Senator \nCoats, I know, has been waiting. Senator Dodd is also waiting. So at \nthis point I object until at least those two Members are taken care of.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida has the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, it had been my understanding that \nunanimous consent requests could be made after Senator Kennedy's \nstatement, but if the Senator from Vermont would like to have other \nopening statements, I modify my unanimous consent request that I have \n10 minutes of morning business immediately upon the\n\n[[Page S7782]]\n\ncompletion of the statements by the Senators from Indiana, Connecticut, \nMinnesota, and any other members of the committee wishing to do so--\nthat at that point, I have 10 minutes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have been told it is only going to \ntake a minute to run a hotline on the Democratic side, after which I \nwould like to propound, on behalf of myself and Senator Biden, a \nunanimous consent agreement. This whole matter will take just a minute \nor so. I would like to, with the consent of my colleagues, get that out \nof the way here before the debate continues, if the Senator from \nVermont finds that acceptable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senator has this consent request. I \nhope he will offer it and we can consider it, if the leadership so \ndesires. I would certainly support it. Can't we wait until we get the \nagreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida has the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I object then.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, let me restate my unanimous consent, which \nis that upon the completion of the opening statements of the members of \nthe committee, I be allowed 10 minutes as in morning business for a \nstatement on the wildfires in Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will not object. I just say to my \ncolleague, I am pleased to speak right after him. I just ask that other \ncolleagues will speak, and I would like to speak after the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from Florida for \nhis graciousness. For the purposes of getting the opening statements \nout, it is worthwhile to hear those who have worked over the past year \nor more to put this piece of legislation together.\n  Let me begin by commending the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Jeffords of Vermont, and the distinguished ranking \nDemocrat, Senator Kennedy, and my colleague from Indiana, Senator \nCoats, for their tremendous efforts here to put this higher education \nbill together.\n  Mr. President, there are very few pieces of legislation that we will \nconsider in this Congress that are as important to American families as \nthe one we take up today.\n  I see my colleague from Kentucky. Does he wish me to yield?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If the Senator will yield for a moment, the unanimous \nconsent agreement has now been cleared.\n  Mr. DODD. Without interrupting the flow of the debate and without \nyielding my right to the floor, for the purposes of propounding the \nunanimous consent agreement, I will yield to the Senator from Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/09/senate-section/article/S7759-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 2282\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I am here with a sense of disappointment \nin that the President of the United States today is visiting my State \nand, particularly, visiting areas of the State that have recently been \nravaged by an unprecedented series of wildfires. I regret that because \nof the schedule of the Senate, particularly the votes we have just \ntaken this morning and those we will take later in the day, I was \nunable to accept the President's invitation, which he had generously \nextended to my colleague, Senator Mack, and myself. Therefore, I would \nlike to take this opportunity to make a statement to my colleagues as \nto the circumstances in Florida.\n  Mr. President, next month--on August 24--Floridians will observe the \nsixth anniversary of one of the worst natural disasters in recent \nmemory: Hurricane Andrew.\n  Many of my colleagues will remember that Andrew roared ashore in the \nmiddle of the night and vented its fury on the people of South Florida. \nThe storm severely disrupted the lives of thousands of families. It \ndamaged 128,000 homes and left approximately 160,000 people homeless. \nThe insurance industry estimates that Andrew cost our state nearly $30 \nbillion.\n  Perhaps even more sobering than these numbers is the knowledge that \nthe devastation and loss of life would have been even worse had the \nstorm struck just twenty miles to the north, in the heart of downtown \nMiami.\n  These facts demonstrate the unprecedented nature of Hurricane \nAndrew's destructive force.\n  But perhaps even more unprecedented was the tremendous generosity \nshown by people outside of Florida in the aftermath of Andrew's driving \nrains and fierce winds. Americans from every corner of our nation put \ntheir lives on hold to assist those Floridians whose lives had been \nturned upside down by Mother Nature. Some sent food and supplies. \nOthers packed up cars, loaded vans, and boarded buses so that they \ncould join relief efforts.\n  State disaster agencies lent personnel, expertise, and know-how to \nthe Florida Department of Community Affairs in its clean-up efforts.\n  This enormous outpouring of support by Americans for people they had \nnever met and neighborhoods they had probably never visited reaffirmed \nour belief in the vitality and essential goodness of the human spirit.\n  This August, Floridians will remember Hurricane Andrew with another \nnatural disaster on their minds. Since May 24, a deadly combination of \nintense heat and prolonged drought has sparked more than 2,000 forest \nfires in Florida's 67 counties. Even for a state that is experienced in \ndealing with natural disasters, these fires have been spawned during \nwhat may be one of the worst years in Florida meteorological history.\n  In late January and early February--in the midst of our state's dry \nseason--several Northern Florida counties were deluged by massive \nfloods. Not long after, parts of Central Florida were devastated by \nthunderstorms and tornadoes that are more typical in the summer months.\n  The fire crisis is the latest example of our state's climactic \nreversal of fortune in 1998. Florida's hot summer temperatures are \ntypically accompanied by afternoon thunderstorms and tropical weather. \nThis year's heat and drought, and the lush undergrowth and foliage that \nsprung up in the wake of Florida's unusually wet winter, combined to \nfuel the fires that have put the\n\n[[Page S7783]]\n\nstate under a cloud of smoke and chased nearly 112,000 residents from \ntheir homes--7,040 of them into emergency shelters.\n  The numbers that I have just cited, and those that I will provide \nhereafter, are the result of analyses done by local and State emergency \nagencies and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n  These fires have had severe consequences. More than 350 homes, \nbusinesses, or buildings have been destroyed or heavily damaged. Nearly \n100 individuals, mostly brave firefighters battling the blazes, have \nbeen injured.\n  Fortunately, as of today there have been no lives lost directly as a \nresult of the wildfires.\n  A 140-mile stretch of Interstate 95 which was closed for several days \nwas recently reopened. Four hundred and eighty-three thousand acres of \nland have been burned. As of the current estimate of damage, with \nhigher estimates anticipated as a full economic accounting can be \ncompleted, there has been damage sustained of almost $300 million to \nprivate interests and over $100 million in costs to local, State, and \nFederal Governments.\n  In a step never before taken in Florida's long history with violent \nweather, on Friday of last week every one of the 45,000 residents of \nFlagler County, a county that is just north of Daytona Beach, had to be \nevacuated from their homes. That evacuation continued over the \nIndependence Day weekend.\n  I happened to be with Governor Chiles when he made that mandatory \nevacuation order. There is no more difficult requirement of a Governor \nthan to order people out of their homes for their safety. Governor \nChiles was resolute, he was prompt, he was compassionate in that order, \nand it no doubt resulted in substantial saving of lives, of potential \ninjuries, and the homes of those persons who were evacuated.\n  Mr. President, Mother Nature has once again subjected Florida to \nunprecedented weather conditions.\n  But with the memories of recent disasters, such as Hurricanes Opal \nand Andrew, and the aftermath still fresh in our minds, we know that \nthe national response to our pleas for help is anything but \nunprecedented and are moved by the immediacy of America's heartfelt \noffers of assistance.\n  The Clinton Administration and Federal Emergency Management Agency \n(FEMA) moved quickly to ensure that Florida could rely on the federal \ngovernment as a full partner in its battle against the fires. On June \n19, President Clinton declared all 67 Florida counties as a major \ndisaster area and made them eligible for immediate federal financial \nassistance.\n  In the weeks following that declaration, FEMA officials have \nskillfully coordinated relief efforts and worked hard to channel \nadditional aid to the hardest hit areas. We greatly appreciate the \ncontinued efforts of FEMA Director James Lee Witt and his agency. \nDirector Witt has spent much of his six years on the job in the \nSunshine State--responding to Hurricane Opal, floods in North Florida, \ntornadoes in Central Florida, and now fires in every corner of the \nstate.\n  I commend him and his fellow FEMA employees for their long-standing \ndedication to helping Floridians recover from Mother Nature's wrath.\n  But it is not just FEMA that has responded to this crisis. Americans \nfrom 44 states are fighting side-by-side with Floridians to prevent \nthese fires from endangering families and engulfing even more homes, \nbusinesses, and roads. For example, U.S. Marines, National Guardsmen, \nand National Weather Service meteorologists from all over the country \nhave converged on Florida. Two hundred and twenty-six firefighters and \n53 firefighting vehicles have been airlifted from California, Oregon, \nand South Dakota, states whose residents are not strangers to violent \nweather and natural disasters.\n  North Carolina, a state that is even more heavily forested than my \nown, has sent 47 fire trucks and 95 firefighters to Florida.\n  Pennsylvania, which lost more than 2,200 citizens in less than ten \nminutes during the catastrophic Johnstown flood of 1889, has \ncontributed 80 volunteers to combat this natural disaster in 1998.\n  So many states have donated equipment that two-thirds of all the \nfirefighting helicopters in the United States are now working in \nFlorida.\n  Even foreign governments have been eager to lend a hand. As Miami \nHerald Staff Writer Cyril Zaneski reported on July 4th, the Canadian \nprovinces of Quebec and Ontario ``offered firefighting tanker planes \ncapable of dropping about 9,500 gallons of water an hour and refilling \ntheir tanks without landing.''\n  I am pleased to announce that the Herculean efforts of these brave \nfirefighters have not been in vain. The tide is turning.\n  Over the last few days, those Floridians who were forced from their \nhomes have returned. Most of the fires have been brought under control. \nMeteorologists are predicting lower temperatures and more rain in the \ncoming days. We have not reached the end of this crisis--but I am \nhopeful that this good news marks the beginning of the end.\n\n  Before I conclude today, I want to share a story that I think \ndemonstrates why Floridians are so grateful for the efforts of our \nfriends from around the nation.\n  An article in the Columbus Dispatch on July 6 chronicled the efforts \nof two Ohio firefighters in Central Florida. I'd like to read part of \nthat article, and I ask that the full text be included in the Record.\n\n       Around every corner, behind every door and over every store \n     counter, the stories just keep coming--stories of gratitude \n     to the men and women who have come from all over to stare \n     down an inferno.\n       There's the woman originally from Maine who invited all \n     Maine firefighters to stay with her.\n       There's the firefighter from Western Florida who, try as he \n     might, wasn't permitted to pay for a pair of boots at Wal-\n     Mart.\n       There's the laundry owner from nearby DeLeon Springs who \n     offered to wash buckets full of sooty, sweaty socks.\n       And then there's the free eye drops and sunblock, the free \n     bottled water and Gatorade by the truckload, the free food \n     cooked up in every possible pot, from residents' kitchens to \n     popular restaurants.\n       Mark Puhl, a firefighter from Nelsonville, Ohio, who \n     arrived in Deland with a relief crew Saturday night, got an \n     early taste of the appreciation. ``Usually response like this \n     comes through toward the end of a job,'' he said. ``But we \n     had people in the airport thanking us in advance.''\n       His colleague, Lea Ann Parsley of Granville, Ohio, \n     understood. The wildfires she typically fights are in \n     sparsely populated areas out West. ``We're usually protecting \n     timber,'' she said. ``Here we're protecting people's homes. \n     It hits home a lot more.''\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      [From the Columbus Dispatch]\n\n Floridians Tend to Firefighters--From Haircuts to Boots, it's all `on \n                               the House'\n\n       DeLand, Fla. (AP)--Around every corner, behind every door \n     and over every store counter, the stories just keep coming--\n     stories of gratitude to the men and women who have come from \n     all over to stare down an inferno.\n       There's the woman originally from Maine who invited all \n     Maine firefighters to stay with her. There's the firefighter \n     from western Florida who, try as he might, wasn't permitted \n     to pay for a pair of boots at Wal-Mart. There's the laundry \n     owner from nearby DeLeon Springs who offered to wash buckets \n     full of sooty, sweaty socks.\n       And there's the free eye drops and sunblock, the free \n     bottled water and Gatorade by the truckload, the free food \n     cooked up in every possible pot, from residents' kitchens to \n     DeLand's most popular restaurants.\n       ``It's the only fire I've ever fought and gained weight,'' \n     joked Jacob Wilkerson, a 29-year-old DeLand firefighter who \n     has been attacking flames since Memorial Day.\n       DeLand, a town at the edge of disaster, might well adopt a \n     Dalmatian as its mascot. In these jumbled, sweaty, smoky \n     days, it has become a firefighters' community.\n       The town of 16,000, about 30 miles north of Orlando, is \n     just beyond the area that the Florida wildfires have hit the \n     hardest.\n       On the road, practically every third car is an emergency \n     vehicle, some from as far as Canada, Colorado, California. \n     Motels not jammed with evacuees from adjacent Flagler County \n     are filled with firefighters, as are the dorms at Stetson \n     University.\n       Signs--on store marquees and hand-stenciled on plywood, on \n     towels, on bedsheets, on cardboard--are everywhere. Most say \n     thanks; some simply tell firefighters to hang in there.\n       ``We luv ya,'' says the Farm Bureau Insurance sign east of \n     town. ``Thank you for saving our home,'' said another, \n     farther north.\n       It's understandable. DeLand has been choked for days by a \n     haze of acrid smoke. Everyone realizes that if it's this bad \n     here, it's far worse on the fire line.\n       ``If it's difficult for us, what are they facing?'' said \n     Carlos Esquivel, 18, who just graduated from DeLand High \n     School. ``They could die out there.''\n\n[[Page S7784]]\n\n       Similar sentiments are heard in other fire's-edge towns. In \n     Ormond Beach, on the Atlantic Coast, Tim Curtis has turned \n     his restaurant, Houligan's, into a veritable arcade for \n     firefighters, offering everything from massages to haircuts.\n       Here in DeLand, firefighters are astonished at the massive \n     outpouring.\n       ``I've never been to a place where their towns are burning \n     down and they're worried about us,'' said Mike Caldaro, a \n     firefighter from western Florida just back from a 23-hour \n     workday.\n       He is one of 200 firefighters staying at Stetson \n     University, which opened its dormitories for firefighters. \n     His colleague, Edward Osborne, fought fires so hot they \n     melted his thermal boots. When he went to Wal-Mart to buy \n     more, the cashier handed back his money.\n       ``She gave me my boots and she gave me a hug. I needed \n     both,'' Osborne said.\n       Mark Puhl, a firefighter from Nelsonville, Ohio, who \n     arrived in DeLand with a relief crew Saturday night, got an \n     early taste of the appreciation.\n       ``Usually response like this comes through toward the end \n     of a job,'' he said. ``But we had people in the airport \n     thanking us in advance.''\n       His colleague, Lea Ann Parsley of Granville, Ohio, \n     understood. The wildfires she typically fights are in \n     sparsely populated areas out West.\n       ``We're usually protecting timber,'' she said. ``Here we're \n     protecting people's homes. It hits home a lot more.''\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

Mr. President, There are few pieces of legislation as \nimportant to American families as the bill we take up today--the Higher \nEducation Amendments of 1998.\n  I have been pleased and honored to work with the chairman and the \nranking member of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, and with \nSenator Coats of Indiana to put this bill together over the last year. \nI appreciate the tremendous effort of Senator Jeffords, Senator Kennedy \nand Senator Coats on this bill, which is going to move I think rather \nexpeditiously. There will be some amendments, but it is a tribute to \nthe efforts of the membership of this group and their staff that we \nhave reached a point where we have this very, very important piece of \nlegislation that has achieved as much harmony as it has. So I begin \nthese brief remarks by commending them and the staff members who have \nput this bill together. And, together, we bring to the floor today a \nstrong, bipartisan bill--a bill that American families need and \ndeserve.\n  Mr. President, America has long been known as the land of promise. We \ntake great pride in that as Americans. Those words are used at every \nnational holidays--``a land of promise.'' I think the foundation of \nthat promise has been, during the more than two centuries of our \nexistence as a nation, education. A democracy as complicated, as \nsophisticated, and as subtle as ours could not succeed without an \neducated population. Education is also the root of our economic \nstrength. Without an educated population, you cannot remain on the \ncutting edge of industry and business.\n  I think any successful national endeavor you talk about, Education is \na critical factor in its success. It is the central theme that has \ncreated the kind of opportunity and success this Nation has enjoyed for \nso many years--particularly, I would add, higher education. This is no \nsecret. Parents recognize that their child's success is, in no small \nmeasure, dependent on his or her educational achievement. Statistics \nbear this out. A person with a college degree earns twice as much as \none with just a high school education.\n  But this issue is not only a concern of families. Higher education \nhas also, as I said a moment ago, defined and shaped America's economy \nin the post-World War II era. Our economy has grown on the strength of \nknowledge-based, highly skilled industries and workers. This would not \nhave been possible without our unparalleled network of universities and \ncolleges and our Federal commitment to ensuring access to these \ninstitutions of higher learning.\n  Since the GI bill, millions of Americans have been able to attend \ncollege because of the assistance of their Federal Government. Today, \nin fact, 75 percent of all student aid is Federal.\n  Unfortunately, families increasingly worry that college is slipping \nbeyond their grasp as college costs rise and student debt mounts. \nStudies suggest that even with the nearly $35 billion of Federal aid \navailable each year, affordability is a significant factor for those at \nall income levels. For middle-income families, college costs are \nshaping students' decisions about where to attain their higher \neducation and what type of careers they intend to pursue. For the \nneediest of students in our country, affordability of education is \nalready affecting the fundamental decision of whether to attend higher \neducation at all.\n  We cannot discuss the Higher Education Act, which is centrally about \nensuring access to higher education, without discussing cost. I firmly \nbelieve that the choice of an institution, the choice of a career, and \nthe choice of whether to attend college at all should not be based \nalone on the issue of cost--and for too many families today, it is.\n  Let's face it. Families are increasingly unable to cope with the cost \nincreases that we see in higher education. According to a survey \nconducted by the American Council on Education, the public worries a \ngreat deal about the cost of attending college. They believe that \ncollege is too expensive, and they think that the cost can be brought \ndown without affecting academic quality.\n  When asked what concerned them most about their children's well-\nbeing, respondents across this country in all income groups ranked \npaying for college as the second biggest concern. Their largest concern \nwas use of illegal drugs. But right behind that was the cost of a \nhigher education.\n  Today, 4 years at one of our Nation's leading colleges can easily \ntotal well over $120,000. Estimates are that the family of a child born \ntoday who might enter college at age 18 in the year 2016 could easily \nbe looking at a cost of well over $250,000 for 4 years of college \neducation at one of our nation's leading universities. In nearly all \nfamilies, a\n\n[[Page S7785]]\n\nletter offering financial aid is as, if not more, important than the \nactual letter of accepting the student into the college of their \nchoice.\n  In the last 20 years, from 1977 to 1997, college costs--tuition, room \nand board--rose by an astounding 304 percent. During the same period, \ninflation rose by roughly half that figure, 165 percent. Let's look at \njust the tuition over the last 10 years.\n  Mr. President, I want to refer to a chart that will maybe help \nexplain this a bit more graphically. As this chart indicates, while \ninflation between 1987 and 1996 rose by 38 percent, public 4-year \ncollege education rose 132 percent; private 4-year institutions went up \n99 percent; and public 2-year institution's cost rose 85 percent.\n  Again, I come back to the Consumer Price Index. It went up 38 \npercent, and yet you see in tuition and fees rose at a significantly \nhigher rate in every area of higher education, public and private, 2- \nand 4-year institutions as well.\n  As a result of these increases in the price of attending college, \nmore and more students and families are going into debt in order to \nfinance postsecondary education.\n  We take the first important steps in this bill, in my view, to make \nsure that the serious problem of rising college costs does not create a \nnew class of haves and have-nots in terms of access to  postsecondary \neducation.\n\n  In particular, we have adopted many of the recommendations of the \nCost of College Commission formed by Congress last year. We streamlined \nregulatory requirements that may contribute to those costs. Most \nimportantly, we adopted strong new disclosure requirements to assist \nfamilies and policymakers with cost issues.\n  Mr. President, let me tell you, we come back year after year to this \nbill and this issue. And we do what I think we ought to do--we increase \nthe financing for Pell grants, which has been of tremendous help to \nmillions; we try to deal with student loan issues and make these \nnecessary burdens easier to bear.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts, who knows this as well as anyone in \nthis chamber, will tell you that he recalls it was not that many years \nago when we had, in overall terms, 80 percent of our aid in grants; \nmost students did not acquire debt as well as a diploma. We assisted \nstudents because we thought it was the right thing to do; there was a \ndirect investment coming back. And 20 percent of our assistance to \nstudents was in the form of loans.\n  Today, those numbers are reversed. Students now rely on loans for \nover 80 percent of their aid. And so we come back each year. We get \ninvolved in the student aid issue, the Pell grant issue, a lot of other \nfactors. At some point, we have to come back to these institutions and \nsay: Look, how does it happen? How is it that the Consumer Price Index \ngoes up 38 percent and yet your public 4-year institution has risen 132 \npercent in the same 10-year period, in 20 years up 304 percent, as \nopposed to a CPI number of 165 percent?\n  We can't come back here every 5 years and continue to monkey around \nwith the student loan issue and to continue to try to come up with ways \nto meet the needs here as we watch debt accumulate and students making \nthe choice to not go to college. We are seeing that today with a lot of \nneedy students. They just decide they can't take on the financial \nburden. What a great outrage, what a great loss to all of us.\n  So I am not suggesting there is any simple answer to this question, \nbut one of the things that I like so much about this bill we have put \ntogether is that we are going to take a really hard look at this for \nthe first time. This is not to suggest there may be some very clear \nanswers as to why costs are rising. But this bill will finally help \nanswer this central question.\n  We take several specific steps in the key area. First, our bill \nensures that families will have the information they need to become \ngood consumers when it comes to higher education. Today, you may be \nable to find cost figures for different institutions, but often times \nthey don't match up and are hard to compare. The American Council on \nEducation survey also revealed that the public does not know how much \nfinancial aid is available to help pay college bills, where it does \ncome from, or how to get it.\n  These new disclosure provisions will provide families with timely, \nreliable, and comparable information on college costs as well as the \navailability of financial aid and educational loans for students who \nattend each institution so that they can exercise their power as \nconsumers to choose institutions that are of high quality and of \nreasonable cost.\n  Secondly, Mr. President, the bill requires new information for \npolicymakers on costs, including trends across and within sectors. Over \nthe next few years, the National Center for Education Statistics will \nconduct a national study to examine how expenditures at institutions of \nhigher education change over time, how such expenditures relate to \ncollege costs and ultimately the price of tuition for students. This \nstudy will attempt to explain why the price to obtain a higher \neducation for each student has increased so much faster than the price \nfor the institutions to provide an education for each student. Let me \nexplain it in this chart here, if I can. From 1987-1997, the price for \na public institution to instruct each student increased by 57 percent, \nbut during that same period of time the price for each student to \nattend a public institution increased by 132 percent.\n  It is critical that this grave disparity be explained before policy \nmakers can adequately address the issue of containing college costs.\n  Finally, we ask the Bureau of Labor Statistics to establish a market \nbasket for higher education that will finally give us some clue as to \nwhat costs are reasonable.\n  These are crucial first steps that will help fill the knowledge gap \non cost. But we must make sure these disclosure provisions work. The \ncommittee adopted an amendment that I offered to ensure that there are \nstrong enforcement tools, such as a $25,000 fine to ensure that \ninstitutions cooperate in providing accurate information. Again, I \ndon't have any reason to believe they won't. I am confident these \ninstitutions will want to participate in this kind of analysis. But \njust in case there are some who are reluctant, a little incentive is \nnot a bad idea.\n  These provisions on college costs put colleges on notice that we are \nwatching and we are not going to let pricing policies put college \nbeyond the reach of too many Americans. It is far too important to them \nand, quite candidly, as has been said before, it is vitally important \nto all of us in this Nation.\n  This legislation also strengthens Federal financial aid programs \nwhich are lifelines to families who struggle with cost increases. We \nauthorize an increase in the maximum Pell grant award and hope the \nappropriators and the budget committees will follow through with \nadequate funds. We also adjust the treatment of the neediest students' \nearnings to ensure that their families are not penalized in the award \nof aid because the students work, as I recommended in earlier \nlegislation. We also expand campus-based aid programs like College \nWork-Study and low-cost Perkins Loans, to reach more students. We \nimprove Federal student loan programs, providing extended repayment \nperiods for students with large loan balances and by giving colleges \nmore tools to help their students avoid expensive loans.\n  Most significantly, students are also guaranteed a substantially \nlower student loan interest rate. As the average debt of a student \nmounts to nearly $12,000 on average across the country, the relief that \nthis nearly 1 point reduction in interest rates offers should not be \nundervalued. Again, I commend the chairman and the ranking Democrat, \nSenator Kennedy, for being leaders on this issue and making a \ndifference here that is going to save each student borrower in my State \nan average of $640. It could mean as much as $3,200 to those students \nwho borrow for graduate and professional degrees. But for a family \ntrying to make ends meet, $650 a year for a student loan is a lot of \nmoney. This will make a big, big difference.\n  Not surprisingly, the issue of student loan interest rate has been \nthe most controversial and closely followed issue in this bill. I am \nvery pleased that the solution we put forward today ensures that \nstudents will receive the long-term benefit substantially lower rates. \nHowever, I am disappointed that this bill expects taxpayers to bear \nmuch of the cost with a new subsidy to\n\n[[Page S7786]]\n\nbanks. I am unsure whether subsidizing the banks' returns on student \nloans is ultimately the best way to ensure affordability for our \nnation's students.\n  The legislation also takes important steps to address the needs of \nnon-traditional students, whose participation in higher education is \nrising at an impressive rate.\n  We include new authority for the Secretary to explore the potential \nof distance learning. In the past, distance education too often meant \ncorrespondence courses with little merit and high cost. Today, the \nInternet, the World Wide Web and other emerging technologies offer new \nopportunities for quality, interactive learning right from a student's \nhome. However, current law provides little opportunity for institutions \nand their students to explore these exciting opportunities. This bill \nbroadly expands these opportunities and directs the Secretary to \nundertake and carefully monitor a demonstration program in distance \neducation. I think this provision will be vitally important in meeting \nthe needs of nontraditional students pursuing higher education.\n  The bill also includes another important initiative to increase \naccess to post-secondary education--the Child Care Access Means Parents \nin Schools Act, which I authored with Senator Snowe. This bill will \nsupport campus-based child care centers meeting the needs of those \nnontraditional students who have children of their own. The face of \ncollege has changed. One of the key obstacles many of today's students \nface is locating affordable, quality child care. Campuses are a key \nplace to meet this need. In Connecticut--I am sure it is true across \nthe country--when you visit good college campuses, you find they build \nchild care centers right into the campus design. This initiative will \nhelp strengthen these efforts and expand the reach of these critical \nprograms.\n  Finally, this bill addresses the training of teachers. Colleges, of \ncourse, are our Nation's laboratories for teachers. This bill offers \nsignificant new support in this area. We have all worked hard to \nresolve the competing concerns and differing approaches, and the \nresult, I believe, is a strong, comprehensive teacher training program \nthat support state level initiatives and local partnerships. This two-\ntrack approach will ensure that colleges and schools that work together \nto improve teacher training will be rewarded at the state level with \nrecognition for achieving higher standards. In another important \ninitiative for teachers, this bill offers loan forgiveness for teachers \nworking in high poverty schools. This effort will provide high \nqualified teachers with a powerful incentive to share their talents, \nskills and knowledge with the neediest children.\n  Beyond bringing student aid programs in line with today's realities, \nwe take a key step to modernize and to improve the crucial student aid \nprograms with the creation of a Performance-Based Organization within \nthe Department of Education. This office will administer and deliver \nall Federal student aid. At nearly $35 billion a year, the complexity \nof this undertaking demands talent, energy, experience, and \nperformance. This PBO, this Performance-Based Organization, will, I \nbelieve, ensure the Secretary of Education can recruit the best people \nfor this job and retain them based on their performance.\n  It is not a perfect bill. That probably has been said by others. But \nit really is a very sound effort to deal with cost and shore up federal \nfinancial assistance, to deal with the issue of the nontraditional \nstudents, and to deal with the issue of teaching in our country. It \nsets us on the right road for the 21st century--putting in place strong \nfederal policy to help make the promise of higher education a reality \nfor more American families.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator from New Hampshire yield for a brief \nobservation for a minute or two?\n  Mr. GREGG. Without losing the floor, I will yield to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. For purposes of Members' schedules--perhaps after the \nSenator from New Hampshire, to indicate--we have a number of our \ncolleagues here who have been very, very cooperative, working with the \nleadership to try to bring their amendments up. They have been working \nwith us so we could move this along. Now it will be set aside from 2 \no'clock to 4. That includes the Senator from California, Senator \nFeinstein, with whom we have worked. We want to be able to accept her \namendment; Senator Graham as well. Senator Wellstone is prepared to \nmove on ahead.\n  I hope, just without asking consent--I will, if I might, ask that, if \nit is agreeable with the manager--I don't want to foreclose the process \nof moving back and forth--but it would seem, if it was agreeable to the \nfloor manager, after the Senator from New Hampshire is recognized that \nwe move ahead with the Senator from California, the Senator from \nFlorida, and then the Senator from Minnesota, if that is agreeable?\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield to the Senators who are managing the bill for \npurposes of addressing this issue, but I note I am aware the Senator \nfrom Indiana also wishes to speak.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would just say I want to expedite the \nmovement of the bill by all possible means.\n  The people who are here should be recognized in an appropriate order, \nand I have no problem with the suggestion that was made. My good friend \nfrom New Hampshire has worked so long and hard on this bill and has \nbeen an important factor in getting this to a position where it can be \nexpeditiously passed. I look forward to listening to his statement \nfirst.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire--\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Can I ask that as a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield for purposes of propounding a unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Did the Senator from New Hampshire yield?\n  Mr. GREGG. Solely for the purpose of asking consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest made by the Senator from Massachusetts?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I object. I withdraw it. I withdraw it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is withdrawn. The Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, will the Senator from New Hampshire yield \nfor a unanimous consent request for floor privileges?\n  Mr. GREGG. I will yield to the Senator from Florida to make a \nunanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire yields with the \nunderstanding that he retains the floor.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a \ncongressional fellow in my office, Neymi Aponte, and three interns, \nGilberto Sanchez, Rachel Milstein and Jennie Beysolow, be allowed the \nprivilege of the floor for the duration of this speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise in support of this bill and also to \nexpress my appreciation and respect for the leaders of this committee \nin developing this bill. I know Senator Jeffords, Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Coats and Senator Dodd have spent an immense amount of time on \nthis and have done an extraordinarily good job of pulling together a \nstrong bill which will ensure we continue a major commitment--a very \nsignificant commitment--to those people in our Nation who are attending \nschool and use Federal resources to assist them in attending school.\n  We understand rather well that our Nation, especially in the New \nEngland region, depends, for our energy and our productivity, on \nbasically people's creativity and their brain power. In New Hampshire, \nfor example, we don't have any natural resources that produce great \nwealth, such as oil or large farmlands or mineral deposits. Our great \nnatural resource in our State, and much of this country, is the \nwonderful minds of the people who work in our State and who produce \nproducts and, as a result of producing those products,\n\n[[Page S7787]]\n\nwhich are competitive around the world, create prosperity, jobs and a \ngood lifestyle.\n  The key to that, of course, is quality education, and first-class \neducation depends on having students who have the ability to pick and \nchoose among colleges and are able to afford the college of their \nchoice to attend. In order to accomplish that, they have to have \nsupport, in many instances.\n  As the Senator from Connecticut so precisely outlined, the cost of \nquality education is going up dramatically, much faster than the price \nof most products in this country; in fact, almost 100 percent faster \nthan the cost-of-living index over the last few years.\n  What is driving that cost, we are not absolutely sure. There are many \nof us who have opinions on it, but we are not sure. One thing we know \nis because those costs are going up quickly, it is becoming harder and \nharder to pay for college education. This bill is an attempt to address \nthat and make sure students have available to them the resources \nnecessary for a first-class college education.\n  As has been alluded to--this bill is filled with a lot of excellent \nideas and many have already been outlined--but as has been alluded to, \nthe core issue, the most important provision in this bill is the change \nin the student loan interest rates. Students who want to receive a \nhigher education but must take out loans to do so will have a better \nchance in succeeding when they get out of school because the cost of \npaying back those loans will be less because the interest rates will \nhave been cut, and that is a major step, a positive step in the right \ndirection.\n  In addition to cutting the rates, we also cut the amount the Federal \nGovernment pays to support the lenders who supply the loans. As you \nknow, lenders currently make very little money on student loans--many \npeople know this, anyway--and the high cost of administration, however, \nthat is tied to student loans has been reduced in this bill and, as a \nresult, we not only cut the rate that it costs students to borrow money \nto go to college but we also cut the actual amount that lenders are \ngoing to make.\n\n  The big debate was whether or not we would cut it even further. The \nissue really wasn't whether or not these costs of administration should \nbe cut further, the issue really came down to a question of whether or \nnot we were going to shift from a system which had two competing arenas \nin which you could get a loan--a direct loan from the Federal \nGovernment or private loan from a private lender, to a single provider \nof loans--basically the Government.\n  For those of us who have seen the Government function under the \nDirect Student Loan Program, we have seen a dramatic and considerable \nrisk to the entire loan portfolio, the ability of students to get loans \nif they were only given the option of going to the Federal Government. \nWe wanted to make sure that this adjustment in loan rate was done in a \nway that maintained the viable private market.\n  In New Hampshire, for example, 96 percent--96 percent--of all the \nstudents go through a private loan process rather than through the \ndirect loan process. So you can see that if a direct loan is their only \navenue, it will actually create chaos. We know that to be a fact. Just \nlast year when the Direct Loan Program was gearing up and was supposed \nto be ready and able to take care of the amount of activity that was \nbeing applied under the Direct Loan Program, we in the Congress had to \npass an emergency bill to basically bail out the Direct Loan Program of \nthe Federal Government which was already in chaos even though it hadn't \neven gotten up to, I think, much more than 25, 30 percent at that point \nin student loans, which is approximately where it is right now.\n  We know for a fact that the Direct Loan Program has some serious, \nserious problems. Not only that, but we are seeing that some of these \nproblems, independent of the fact that they simply can't handle the \nvolume of loans that will occur were the private sector driven out of \nthe market, part of these problems are tied to their administrative \nactivity.\n  The cost of the administration in the Direct Loan Program has gone up \ndramatically. By ``administration,'' I am talking about compensation, \ntravel and operational costs. It has gone up almost 143 percent, I \nbelieve is the number, even though the number of loans have only gone \nup by something around 35 percent during this same period.\n  The increase in the administrative overhead is a classic example of \nwhat happens, of course, when you have a Federal agency involved, when \nthere is very little accountability in the area of administrative \noverhead and you have a huge bureaucracy which is dominated not by a \ndesire to be efficient, but by a desire basically to create work, in \nmany instances, and to be an agency which covers itself on every issue \nand creates bureaucrats for purposes of watching bureaucrats.\n  The whole issue in this bill, or the core issue in this bill was how \nwe were going to balance private loan programs with the Direct Loan \nProgram. We did finally reach an understanding on that, and it is a \nreasonable understanding. It is going to cost us money, but, in the \nend, it will allow us to give to students the most important item, \nwhich is a lower interest rate, and at the same time maintain a \ncompetitive marketplace where there will be pressure on the Federal \nGovernment's program, the direct lending program, to be more efficient \nbecause it will be competing with the private sector programs which \nhave to be efficient in order to survive. That is a very big plus that \nthat decision was made in this way.\n  There are a couple of other issues that were put into this bill I was \nactively involved in, and I want to address also one the Senator from \nMinnesota brought to our attention. That was the violence on campuses, \nespecially directed at women. He had an amendment in committee that \naddressed this and created a program authorizing, under the Violence \nAgainst Women Act, $10 million to be set aside for the purposes of \nlooking at the problem we now have on colleges.\n\n  Unfortunately, it is a serious problem. It has been seen here in the \nCapital region and the University of Maryland. I doubt there is a major \ncollege in this country that has not experienced a series of violent \nacts relative to women on campuses.\n  So not only did the Senator from Minnesota bring the idea forward, \nbut it seemed to me to be such a good idea in the appropriations bill \nwhich I fund, we are going to be funding the idea. This may be the \nfastest funded authorization that has happened around here in a long \ntime. But there will be $10 million spent relative to violence against \nwomen on campuses.\n  Another issue which is in this bill that I think deserves some \nmention is the fact that it addresses the issue of the use of drugs by \nstudents. The Senator from Connecticut was accurate. He said, in \npolling parents, the concern of the cost of education was listed as \ntheir No. 2 concern relative to how they are going to handle their \nchildren when they are growing up. He also mentioned that the No. 1 \nconcern is if their children will become involved with drugs, and \nillegal drugs specifically.\n  This bill reflects that concern. It says that taxpayers should not be \ncarrying the burden of supporting a student who has taken the \nirresponsible activity of using and being found to be guilty of using \nan illegal drug. Basically, it says that if you are caught using an \nillegal drug, and you are convicted of using an illegal drug, then you \nlose your eligibility for a student loan--on a first offense for 1 \nyear; on a second offense for 2 years; and on a third offense \nindefinitely.\n  You can avoid this if you, as a student, go through a properly \napproved, satisfactory drug rehabilitation program. And the Secretary \nhas the capacity to set up the regulations as to what will be a \nsatisfactory drug rehabilitation program. So you can mute the effect of \nthis, but essentially it sends a very clear message to students that if \nthey are going to obtain the benefit--having the taxpayers of this \ncountry support them when they are in college through giving them \nbasically a subsidized loan--then they are going to have to be \nresponsible in the manner in which they pursue their academic careers \nand not use illegal drugs. This is, I think, a major step forward in \ndelivering the correct philosophical position on the question of using \ndrugs.\n\n[[Page S7788]]\n\n  So this, on balance, is a good bill. It moves in the right direction. \nIt confirms and energizes and reinforces programs which have proven to \nbe extraordinarily successful. Again, I congratulate the leadership of \nthe committee for bringing it forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3107\n\n  (Purpose: To provide the Secretary of Education with discretionary \nauthority to extend, on a case-by-case basis, Federal Pell Grant aid to \n  teaching students enrolled in postbaccalaureate courses required by \n                  State law for teacher certification)\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I join with those who have \ncongratulated the committee for what I consider to be really a fine \nhigher education bill. I want to extend my personal congratulations, \nrepresenting Californians, both to the chairman and the ranking member \nof this committee.\n  This is a bill that really meets the needs of the day with respect to \nhigher education. And I think we can all, hopefully, support it with \ngreat pride and enthusiasm.\n  I have been very involved in education in California because I have \nseen this great State, once in the lead, sink to below mediocrity in \nterms of its K-through-12 education system. And there are many reasons \nfor it that the Federal Government cannot control, decisions that have \nto be made by the State itself, such as eliminating social promotion, \nsetting specific standards of achievement for students in each of the \ngrades, no-nonsense tests, remedial programs, and so on. But one thing \nthe Federal Government can do is provide funds to help with the \ndevelopment of good teachers. And that is what this bill does and does \nso well.\n\n  I want to bring to the attention of the Senate one anomaly which the \namendment I am about to send to the desk seeks to address. And that is \nthat in the Pell grant program, there are two States that require a 5th \nyear of teacher education. One of those States is New Hampshire; the \nother State is California. New Hampshire provides the 5th year before \nthe baccalaureate degree and California requires the 5th year after the \nbaccalaureate degree, ergo, California's higher education students are \nnot currently eligible for Pell grants. And so, if I may, I send an \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself \n     and Mrs. Boxer, proposes an amendment numbered 3107.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 417, line 17, insert ``(i)'' after ``(B)''.\n       On page 417, line 19, insert ``or clause (ii)'' after \n     ``subparagraph (A)''.\n       On page 417, line 23, strike the end quotation marks and \n     ``; and''.\n       On page 417, between lines 23 and 24, insert the following:\n       ``(ii) Notwithstanding subsection (a)(1), the Secretary may \n     allow, on a case-by-case basis, a student to receive a basic \n     grant if the student--\n\n       ``(I) is carrying at least \\1/2\\ the normal full-time work \n     load for the course of study the student is pursuing, as \n     determined by the institution of higher education; and\n       ``(II) is enrolled or accepted for enrollment in a \n     postbaccalaureate program that does not lead to a graduate \n     degree, and in courses required by a State in order for the \n     student to receive a professional certification or licensing \n     credential that is required for employment as a teacher in an \n     elementary school or secondary school in that State,\n\n     except that this subparagraph shall not apply to a student \n     who is enrolled in an institution of higher education that \n     offers a baccalaureate degree in education.''; and\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the clerk.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is sent to the desk on behalf of \nSenator Boxer and myself. Essentially, what this amendment would do is \nauthorize the U.S. Secretary of Education to award, on a case-by-case \nbasis, Pell grants for students taking a 5th year of postbaccalaureate \nteacher education courses in order to get a teaching credential in a \nState that requires a 5th year.\n  This was brought to my attention, Mr. President, by the new \nchancellor of the California State University, Dr. Charles B. Reed. I \nwant to just read an opening paragraph.\n\n       When I came to the California State University in March of \n     this year, I established as a top system priority \n     strengthening and improving the quality of our teacher \n     preparation programs. Over the next decade, in California \n     alone, we will need an additional 250,000 new K-12 classroom \n     teachers. In addition to our changing demographics, the \n     shortage of teachers in California is particularly acute due \n     to the State's classroom size reduction initiative. . . .\n\n  The Governor of our State has quite rightly determined that K through \n3 should have class sizes of not more than 20 students per teacher. \nThis is a real improvement and, of course, it will mean that more \nteachers will be necessary in the future. Additionally, there is an \nextraordinarily large number of teachers who are due to retire over the \nnext 10 to 20 years.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in \nthe Record at the end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. So the amendment simply authorizes the U. S. \nDepartment of Education, on a case-by-case basis, to award a Pell grant \nto a needy student that wants to get a teaching credential, but needs \nthat 5th year required by the state. We all know that even 4 years of \ncollege is costly, and many students cannot afford it. That is the \nrationale, the purpose, and the foundation of the Pell Grant program.\n  Well, if you cannot afford 4 years, you likely cannot afford a 5th \nyear. Therefore, we lose teachers because young people cannot afford \nthat 5th year. And it is one of the reasons why today in California we \nhave 21,000 teachers who are not credentialed. This would permit, on a \ncase-by-case basis, a Pell grant to be granted to a needy student for \nthat 5th year.\n  These students in California would get a bachelor's degree in an \nacademic subject, such as biology or French or whatever it is, and then \ntake a 5th year in teacher education. That 5th year consists of \nlearning teaching methods and of student or practice teaching.\n  The American Council on Education, a consortium of all the higher \neducation groups, has said, ``These students [in California] who want \nto teach are unfairly caught in a state requirement `catch-22' and \nshould not be penalized as a result.''\n  One of the central purposes of the higher education bill is to \nstrengthen teacher education. And it is long overdue; and it is well \nmet by this bill. I think we can all be very proud of the vote we will \ncast.\n  Title II authorizes new grants to States and to institutions to \nreform and toughen teacher training. Once again, California may well be \nleading the way because requiring this fifth year is also a good way to \nstrengthen teacher education.\n\n  According to the National Commission on Teaching, each dollar spent \non improving teacher qualifications nets greater gains in student \nlearning than any other use of the education dollar. This study and \nothers have found that teacher quality is very uneven through this \ncountry. Just last week, in the ranking member's State, Massachusetts, \nthe state Board of Education said that 56 percent of their teachers \nfailed the State's first basic reading and writing test for teachers. \nNationwide, over one-quarter of newly hired teachers lack the \nqualifications for their jobs according, again, to the Teaching \nCommission.\n  Studies also show that unprepared or underprepared teachers simply \ndon't stick it out. They are more likely to leave teaching after a few \nyears. In my State, California, 30 percent of the teachers leave after \ntheir first 2 years; after 5 years, almost half of California's \nteachers have left. A November 1997 report of the California Advisory \nPanel on teacher education found in hard-to-staff schools as many as \nhalf of all beginning teachers leave teaching permanently after only 3 \nyears in the classroom. That is shocking to me. Among underprepared \nteachers, this attrition rate climbs to two-thirds. What this is saying \nis that if a teacher isn't prepared, doesn't have the qualifications, \ndoesn't have the teaching skills and aptitude, two-thirds of them leave \nwithin 3 years. This undermines education.\n  There is a precedent for the approach of this amendment. Congress \ngave the Secretary the authority to award year-long Pell grants, \nsimilar to what this amendment does, in 1992.\n  I want just quickly to make a few other comments on the teacher \nshortage and why this amendment is important. We have, as I said, \n21,000 teachers\n\n[[Page S7789]]\n\nin California on emergency credentials. That is 1 out of every 11 \nteachers. Half of California's math and science teachers didn't minor \nin those subjects in college, but they are still teaching. That is \nwrong. In Los Angeles, according to a U.S. News & World Report article \nlast October, ``New teachers have included Nordstrom clerks, a former \nclown, and several chiropractors.''\n  This is a situation that shouldn't exist. It exists because there are \nnot enough teachers. Therefore, emergency credentials are granted and \nthese credentials can go on for 10 or 15 years and be granted to people \nwho are really not qualified to teach. They are certainly not \ncredentialled to teach.\n  The need for good teachers is exacerbated by the fact that we need \nthese new teachers in the next decade because public school enrollment \nin California is growing at triple the national rate. In California, \nthe need for new teachers is triple the national rate.\n  I am hopeful that this amendment would be accepted by this Senate.\n  The amendment is going to be particularly helpful to prospective \nteachers enrolled at California State University. This is an \ninstitution today which prepares 60 percent of my State's teaching \nforce. At this university, 48 percent of the students are Pell-grant \neligible and the average Pell grant is $1,200 to $1,500. The University \nof California has 1,200 candidates for a teaching credential each year, \nand one-third are eligible for Pell grants. Thus, 400 UC students could \nbenefit from a fifth year Pell grant each year.\n  Essentially, this amendment is going to encourage more needy students \nto stick it out, to get that teaching credential, to do that fifth year \nat the university. That means that our young elementary and secondary \nstudents are going to be better served because they will have a teacher \nin the classroom who is qualified to teach. I, frankly, believe and \nwould propose and urge the California Legislature to eliminate all \nemergency credentials by the year 2005 and be able to provide that the \nCalifornia teacher corps, K-12, is essentially 100 percent \ncredentialled. But they will not be able to get there unless this body \nis willing to pass this amendment today.\n  Again, in summary, California requires a fifth year. These students \nare not eligible for Pell grants for the fifth year. Forty-eight \npercent of the students who would go into teaching need these grants. \nWe need 250,000 new teachers. We currently have 21,000 teachers \nteaching who are not qualified to teach, who are teaching on so-called \nemergency credentials. The quality of education, its excellence and its \naccountability, I believe, will be heightened by this amendment.\n  I thank both the chairman and the ranking member. I am hopeful you \nwill accept the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n\n                              The California State University,\n\n                                     Long Beach, CA, July 8, 1998.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: When I came to the California State \n     University in March of this year, I established as a top \n     system priority strengthening and improving the quality of \n     our teacher preparation programs. Over the next decade, in \n     California alone, we will need an additional 250,000 new K-12 \n     classroom teachers. In addition to our changing demographics, \n     the shortage of teachers in California is particularly acute \n     due to the State's classroom size reduction initiative, \n     together with the large number of teachers who are expected \n     to retire over the next 10-20 years.\n       As you know, one in eleven California teachers is teaching \n     under an emergency certificate or waiver. Although the State \n     of California requires that prospective teachers complete a \n     5th year of classroom preparation and pedagogy following \n     receipt of their baccalaureate degree in order to become \n     fully credentialed, these 5th-year students--who are \n     considered neither undergraduate nor graduate students--lack \n     access to federal grant aid. Your Pell Grant amendment to S. \n     1882 would go a long way to encourage financially needy \n     students to persist in their studies so that they may become \n     fully certified to teach in California's K-12 schools--rather \n     than deferring completion of their requisite 5th year while \n     teaching under an emergency certificate.\n       Indeed, those who enter the classroom without the necessary \n     preparation are more likely to permanently leave the \n     profession. In its November 1997 report to the California \n     Commission on Teacher Credentialing, the Advisory Panel on \n     Teacher Education, Induction and Certification for Twenty-\n     First Century Schools states, ``In many hard-to-staff \n     schools, as many as half of all beginning teachers leave \n     teaching permanently after only three years in the classroom. \n     Among under-prepared new teachers, this attrition rate climbs \n     to two-thirds.''\n       On behalf of the California State University, which \n     prepares more than half of the 18,000 new teachers \n     credentialed in California each year, I wish to express my \n     appreciation for your efforts to ensure that California's \n     21st Century teachers have access to the federal financial \n     assistance they need to become fully prepared to provide all \n     of California's children with the quality education they \n     deserve.\n       With kind regards,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Charles B. Reed,\n                                                       Chancellor.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. First of all, I thank the Senator from California for \nworking closely with us in order for us to help out the State. I \nunderstand the special circumstances involved in the State of \nCalifornia makes it different than the other 49 States in this regard, \nbut the amendment has been carefully crafted so that it is acceptable \nto this side of the aisle.\n  We believe they should have the opportunity to provide Pell Grant \nassistance in the fifth year, which is generally seen, perhaps, now, as \na necessary aspect of getting the teachers fully qualified for many of \nthe areas they teach.\n  I have no objections on this side of the aisle to the amendment. It \nis accepted as far as the majority is concerned.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I urge we accept this amendment. It is \nbasically completely consistent with what we are attempting to do with \nthe legislation; that is, to put a high priority on enhancing teacher \ntraining and the qualification of teachers and enhance educational \nbackground for teachers. That is what this program is directed towards \nwith the program that has been fashioned and shaped in California.\n  This is basically not a graduate school program. It is just a \ncontinuation of a program that happens to take 5 years. There is an \nissue of whether we want to use the Pell funding for graduate \neducation. I think those are policy issues that deserve a good deal of \nconsideration, but this really doesn't fall in that category. It falls \ninto a category where we are getting a very advanced kind of training \nprogram for young people who are going into teaching. This lasts over \nmore of an extended period of time than in other parts of the country. \nThis amendment is fashioned and shaped on a case-by-case method to make \nsure the program is going to be contained and targeted in ways that are \nabsolutely consistent with the legislation.\n  I welcome the opportunity to urge our side to accept the amendment, \nand I thank the Senator from California for bringing it to our \nattention. Obviously, we didn't want those young people disadvantaged. \nWe are, again, talking about needy students who will have gone to \nschool for a long period of time. These are extraordinary young men and \nwomen who will continue over the fifth year to be eligible for Pell \nGrants. These are people who are really dedicated and committed. In \nterms of teaching, I think they are a unique group of young people. We \ncertainly should not discourage them from their careers in education.\n  I urge the Senate to accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nSenator Specter. I believe it is an excellent amendment.\n  First of all, I commend Senator Specter for the tremendous work he \nhas done in the field of education. And as chairman of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee that handles education as well as many \nother very difficult subjects, he has done an extremely capable job of \nensuring a good balance in all of the programs he handles. I commend \nhim and I am pleased to have him back with us in the Senate. He was \nunable to be here at this particular time, so I am offering this \namendment on his behalf.\n\n  Mr. President, since the last reauthorization of the Higher Education \nAct, crime on our college and university campuses has continued to be a \nmajor concern. In a 1997 report on campus crime, the National Center \nfor Education Statistics noted the following:\n\n       During each of the 3 years between 1992 and 1994, \n     institutions reported a total of about 10,000 violent crimes \n     and up to 40,000 property crimes. For 1994, the individual \n     crime composition for violent crimes was about 20 murders, \n     about 1,300 forcible sex offenses, 3,100 robberies, and 5,100 \n     cases of aggravated assault. In the property crime category, \n     institutions reported 28,800 burglaries and 9,000 motor \n     vehicle thefts in 1994. In 1994, institutions reported about \n     20,400 arrests for liquor law violations, and about 7,200 \n     arrests for drug abuse violations, and about 2,000 arrests \n     for weapons possession.\n\n  From 1995 to 1996, for example, reports of murder, sexual offenses, \nand liquor- and drug-related violations for large universities \nincreased substantially. It is not necessarily the case that crimes \nhave gotten worse but perhaps that reporting has gotten better. Reports \nof crimes have continued to grow, but some institutions have still been \nless than diligent in accurately reporting campus crime statistics.\n  Every Member should be greatly concerned by these campus crime \nstatistics. I am pleased that the Senate Labor Committee has made what \nI think are great strides in improving campus crime provisions in the \n1998 Higher Education Act amendments. We have added to the list of \ncrimes to be reported. We have enabled information about students' \ncriminal records to become publicly accessible. We have required \ninstitutions of higher learning to maintain daily logs of crimes on \ncampuses. With the help of Senator Torricelli, we have strengthened the \nreporting of hate crimes on campuses.\n  With the assistance of Senators Gregg and Wellstone, we created a \ncompetitive grant program to help institutions of higher education \ndevelop and strengthen the effective security and investigation \nstrategies to combat violent crimes against women on campuses.\n  The amendment being offered by Senator Specter today provides an \nabsolutely essential addition to the campus crime provisions in the \nHigher Education Act. His leadership on this issue is much appreciated. \nWith his meticulous crafting, he has substantially improved the \ndefinition of ``campus'' for the purpose of reporting campus crime \nstatistics. When Senator Specter held his campus crime hearing, he \ndiscovered that if a crime was committed on a sidewalk within the \nperimeters of a university, that institution was not required to report \nthe incident in their campus crime statistics. Obviously, the law \nneeded clarification, and I applaud Senator Specter in his superb \nefforts. His efforts create a careful balance.\n  This amendment minimizes additional reporting burdens to institutions \nof higher education while at the same time providing students and other \nmembers of campus communities with needed information to help improve \ntheir awareness about campus security issues. Such information, for \nexample, can be used to help people make more conscious decisions about \nwalking alone in particular areas or making sure to walk with a friend \non or near a campus at night.\n  This amendment makes four changes in the statute. As I mentioned, it \nmodifies the definition of ``campus'' to include additional areas that \nmust be included in campus crime statistics. It requires the Secretary \nof Education to report to Congress when institutions of higher \neducation are not in compliance with campus crime reporting \nrequirements. It gives the Department of Education the explicit \nauthority to impose fines if institutions substantially misrepresent \ninformation about campus crimes. And it renames the campus crime \nsection of the bill after Jeanne Clery, the woman who died tragically \nat Lehigh University in 1986 as a result of a brutal campus crime. The \nClery family has been instrumental in creating a national awareness and \nfocus on campus crime over the past decade. Both Senator Specter and I \nare indebted to their service in helping Congress craft these \nprovisions.\n  Mr. President, it is my pleasure to offer this on behalf of Senator \nSpecter. I ask for its adoption.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join in urging adoption of this \namendment. The original campus security amendment was offered by \nSenator Bradley of New Jersey and myself some 6 years ago. This \nrecognizes some of the areas where there have been loopholes in the \ninterpretation of that amendment. Senator Specter has done good work in \nhelping all of us to make sure that\n\n[[Page S7791]]\n\nwe are going to have safe campuses. Students cannot learn unless they \nare have safe campuses. There are important loopholes that Senator \nSpecter has identified and additional kinds of reporting requirements \nand a small enforcement mechanism, but an effective one. This is a \ngood, solid amendment. I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to thank the \nManagers for agreeing to accept my amendment on campus crime reporting, \nwhich is based on legislation (S. 2100) I introduced on May 20, 1998.\n  As a lead sponsor of the Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act of \n1990, I have been very concerned about what I perceive as the \nDepartment of Education's ineffective implementation of the Act's crime \noffense reporting requirements. On March 5, 1998, I held an oversight \nhearing on campus security issues as Chairman of the Senate Labor, \nHealth, and Human Services and Education Appropriations Subcommittee. \nAt that hearing, Assistant Secretary for postsecondary Education David \nLonganecker testified that the Department does not require colleges to \nreport offenses occurring on sidewalks, streets and other public lands \nwithin what ordinarily would be considered a ``campus.'' He also \ntestified that buildings which are owned by a college but used for \ncommercial purposes (such as a leased food court) do not fall within \nthe Department's interpretation of ``campus.''\n  I believe that the omission of such information violates the spirit \nof the law and is a disservice to parents and students because \ncommercial property such as food shops and retail stores and streets \nthread through a campus and must be visited or traveled in the course \nof one's studies. I was further troubled to hear testimony at the \nhearing that the Department has not imposed civil penalties on any \nschool for failure to comply with the Act.\n  The best means of improving the implementation of the 1990 law is the \nenactment of the statutory clarifications included in my amendment, \nwhich redefines ``campus'' and requires the imposition of civil \npenalties where applicable.\n  I am grateful that the Managers have agreed to name these provisions \nof law in honor of Jeanne Clery, the daughter of Howard and Connie \nClery of King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, who was brutally raped and \nmurdered at Lehigh University in 1986. After that tragic incident, the \nClerys founded Security on Campus, Inc., a non-profit dedicated to \nimproving safety on our nation's college campuses. The Clerys brought \nthe campus crime reporting issue to my attention in 1989 and it is \nhighly fitting that after so many years of being inspired by their work \non this issue, Congress will recognize Jeanne Clery in this manner.\n  I am hopeful that my amendment will be preserved in conference with \nthe House and again thank my colleagues for their efforts on this \nissue.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I want to make some brief comments to \ncommend the work of Senator Specter with regard to the inclusion of \nlanguage in the bill to improve public safety on college and university \ncampuses. I am an original cosponsor of the legislation Senator Specter \nintroduced on May 20, 1998, the Campus Crime Disclosure Act.\n  My involvement in this important legislation began earlier this year, \nwhen I met with the Clery family of Palm City, Florida. Their personal \ntragedy, whereby Howard and Connie Clery's daughter Jeanne was brutally \nmurdered in her college dormitory in 1998 at Lehigh University, \nsaddened me. Since her death, her family has kept her memory alive by \nworking to provide parents and students with more and better \ninformation about crimes occurring on college campuses. The result is \nthe important changes to federal law which we are considering here \ntoday.\n  These changes include a modification to the Department of Education's \ndefinition of a ``college campus''. This definition will now include \nsidewalks and other areas adjacent to schools but not owned by the \nschool. The Department had previously interpreted the term ``campus'' \nto exclude these areas. I, like Senator Specter, believe this is an \nincorrect interpretation. The result was that schools were not \nreporting crimes that had taken place on a sidewalk used by students to \nget to class. This legislation will correct that problem.\n  Furthermore, the legislation sets up a stronger but flexible \nenforcement mechanism which provides that the Department can fine \nschools that are not complying with federal reporting laws dealing with \ncampus security. Congress has given the Secretary of Education \nenforcement discretion when a school is found to be in non-compliance \nafter a public hearing is conducted.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that we are taking these important steps \nto ensure safer campuses for college students. I appreciate the fine \nwork of the Chairman, Mr. Jeffords, in including these important \nprovisions. I commend the work of the Clery's in increasing the \npublic's awareness about campus crime, although I realize that this day \nmust be bitter-sweet. I look forward to continuing to work with them in \nthe future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3109) was agreed to.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that now that we \nhave adopted the Specter amendment, Senator Graham be recognized to \noffer his amendment and that there be 30 minutes of debate on the \namendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask that I may follow Senator Graham.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nWellstone be permitted to follow Senator Graham.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3110\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the need analysis calculation regarding certain \n      veterans' educational assistance, and to provide an offset)\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

Mr. President, I rise before you today to offer an \namendment on behalf of myself and Senators Dorgan, Coverdell, Murray, \nand Hagel. I offer this amendment to correct an injustice in our \ncurrent student financial aid policy. Since June 1 of 1987, the \nMontgomery GI bill has guaranteed basic educational assistance for most \npersons who are or have been members of the Armed Forces or the \nselected reserves for significant periods of time.\n  This legislation was created in 1987 to achieve a number of important \nnational objectives. It was to assist veterans in their readjustment to \ncivilian life, to aid in the era of an all-volunteer military, in the \nrecruitment and retention of qualified personnel in the Armed Forces, \nand to develop a more highly educated and productive workforce.\n  Unfortunately, currently, the Montgomery GI benefits are considered\n\n[[Page S7792]]\n\n``other financial aid'' in the determination of a student's need. In \nother words, when a veteran applies for financial aid, colleges and \nuniversities are required to take into account any benefits received \nunder the Montgomery GI bill program in arriving at a judgment as to \nwhat resources that student would be entitled to receive.\n  The ultimate result is that the total financial aid award is \nsubstantially reduced.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan analysis of three typical cases of student aid requests and the \nimpact that the requirement to consider Montgomery GI benefits as a \nresource has on their financial aid.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n     Student A\n       Student is an unmarried male born in 1972 and is \n     independent due to his age and his status as a veteran.

Mr. President, this penalty, which is currently subjected \nto veterans' benefits, does not apply to other analogous benefits.\n  For instance, the current law states that those persons who receive \nbenefits under the National Service Program Educational Award Program, \nwhich is generally known as the AmeriCorps Program, will not have their \nfinancial assistance treated as a deduction in their eligibility for \nother forms of student financial aid.\n  In fact, Mr. President, the amendment I offer is an amendment to \nprecisely that section of the law adding the Montgomery GI bill to the \ncurrent exemption for AmeriCorps as the basis of calculating student \nfinancial aid.\n  Mr. President, this unjust treatment of veterans' benefits has had a \nnumber of perverse affects. Although over 80 percent of persons in the \nmilitary today are applying to become eligible for the Montgomery GI \nbenefits--in fact, the latest statistics from the Department of Defense \nare that 94 percent of veterans are signing up for this program--less \nthan 40 percent are actually using the program. And this discriminatory \ntreatment is cited as a significant reason for that low level of \nutilization. It also is undercutting the ability of those who are \nattempting to recruit persons into the volunteer armed services by \nhaving to state that the real value of these benefits is substantially \nreduced and, therefore, this major inducement--in fact, the major \ninducement for many young people to come into the military--is diluted.\n  Mr. President, I offer this amendment today, which has been costed at \n$85 million over the next 10 years by the Congressional Budget Office, \nand is offset by reducing accounts in the Secretary's discretionary \nfund as a step towards achieving the objectives that this Congress \nsought when it first adopted the Montgomery GI bill in 1987.\n  Mr. President, our country has had a long experience, particularly \nthe experience since the end of World War II, in encouraging returning \nveterans to continue their education. I believe that the GI bill of \n1944 ranks with legislation that has already been referred to by the \nchairman of the committee, the Morrill Act, that established the Land \nGrant College system, and Social Security as premier examples of \ncongressional legislation that has had a positive effect on our Nation.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment which will assure that the full \nbenefits of the Montgomery GI bill, our current national statement of \nappreciation to those who have served in our armed services, that the \ninjustice that is currently attached to that program be eliminated, and \nthat the full benefits of the program be available to not only the \nveterans but to all Americans.\n  Mr. President, that concludes my statement. If there are no other \nstatements, I ask for the consideration of this amendment.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise to speak for a brief moment on \nthe amendment offered by my colleague from Florida to the Higher \nEducation Reauthorization Act. This amendment is a common sense \ncorrection of a barrier veterans face when applying for financial aid \nfrom colleges and universities.\n  Currently, educational benefits veterans receive under the Montgomery \nGI bill count as a financial resource when they apply for financial \naid. The ultimate result is a reduction in the total financial aid \naward a veteran receives to pay for college. I find it ironic, Mr. \nPresident, that the benefits intended to help veterans pay for higher \neducation end up counting against them. Furthermore, the National \nCommunity Service Act of 1990 does not treat a national service \neducational award or post-service benefit as financial assistance. To \npresent a contrasting case, Americorps education benefits are not \ncounted as a resource in financial aid calculations.\n  Veterans who pay for the Montgomery GI bill through paycheck \ndeductions and dedicated service to their country should not be \npenalized when applying for financial aid. Mr. President, we all \nunderstand the value of higher education, and we should work to \neliminate the barriers that prevent people from moving on to college. \nThis was the intent of the Montgomery GI bill, Mr. President--assist \nveterans in their pursuit of higher education. We should honor the \nintent of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to be a part of this effort to help our \nnation's veterans and pleased to serve as an original co-sponsor to the \nbill Senator Graham introudced last evening. I urge my colleagues to \nadopt this important measure.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, we have one Member who would like to \ntalk in support of the amendment who is on his way.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Florida for \nbringing this matter to our attention and for presenting it here on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  As a Member of the Armed Services Committee, I was there at the time \nthe Montgomery educational programs were advanced as a part of the \nexpanded opportunity for young people in the military services. That \nhas been an enormously important program. It has been a vehicle for \ncontinuing education for those that are in the armed services. We have \nbeen encouraging that program for those people in the armed services. \nThere is an incentive program for matching funds from the Federal \nGovernment for those young people who put aside and save their rather \nlimited salaries. It has been very important and very effective.\n  Now we have the accumulation of some of those benefits after the \nyoung people come out and save for themselves and have served in the \nArmed Forces, many of them in very perilous\n\n[[Page S7793]]\n\nconditions, called to serve overseas. Their GI Bill benefits have been \npart of the contract of service. Unless we accept this amendment, we \nare really unduly penalizing young people who have served in the Armed \nForces and set aside some savings of their own in order to carry on \ntheir education.\n  It seems that we ought to take this very reasonable step, as the \nSenator from Florida has suggested, to make sure that those cumulative \nfunds will not reduce the financial aid that these young people are \neligible for.\n  I think that this makes a great deal of sense. I certainly support \nit.\n  One aspect of the proposal seriously concerns me. That is about how \nthe amendment is paid for, because the amendment takes the money from \nthe Department of Education's administrative funds. These funds are \nused for both the Direct Lending Program and the FFEL Program.\n  Last year's bipartisan budget agreement included major cuts in the \nDepartment's administrative fund, and the Department has already had to \nterminate a number of major contracts to live within these reduced \nfunding levels. Funding cuts undermine the Department's efforts to \nmodernize the student aid delivery systems and to address the year 2000 \ncomputer problems.\n  This can potentially hurt students and lenders.\n  We must work in the conference to find a better way to offset the \ncost of this important benefit for veterans. I will work with all of \nour colleagues in the conference to do so.\n  On the substance of the amendment, it makes sense. I thank the \nSenator.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will make the remarks in support of \nSenator Graham's amendment, and I support him.\n  I believe that this takes care of really an important problem which \nsome of our service people have had. Thus, I do not object to it. I did \nhave a problem with the way the offset was chosen originally, which \nwould have put the bill out of balance with the Congressional Budget \nOffice and, therefore, we worked with the Senator from Florida to find \na more acceptable way.\n  I sympathize with the comments of Senator Kennedy in taking it from \nthe discretionary fund of the Secretary. But it is better to do it this \nway and not put the bill out of balance, and to spread it over a number \nof years so that it is not a big hit.\n  I commend him for bringing this to our attention. I thank him for \nallowing us to include in the managers' package language that ensures \nthat in the aggregate, all types of Federal aid for education will not \nexceed the cost of the required levels. The inclusion of this provision \nexpresses the concerns I had, and, therefore, I support it.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I wonder if I might ask my colleague if \nI might make general comments about the bill as we are waiting.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. The Senator from New Hampshire has arrived to comment \non the pending amendment, and then we will be moving to the amendment \nafter that.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is fine.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator in \nallowing me to proceed.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment of the Senator from \nFlorida and to talk a little bit about the payment process on this \namendment--how we pay for this idea, which is an excellent idea, to \nmake sure that the people benefiting from the GI bill don't end up \nbeing penalized for having participated in our military. Ironically, as \nhas been mentioned, we treat people who participate in the AmeriCorps \nbetter than we treat the people who participate in the military.\n  The Senator from Florida corrects this problem. In order to pay for \nthis, he suggested that we reduce the overhead administrative costs \nwithin the 458 account of the direct lending program, and there is \ngreat justification for doing this--great justification for doing this.\n  One of the concerns I think many of us had when the Federal \nGovernment got into the business of lending money for education was \nthat we would end up with a bureaucracy that would end up spending a \nlot of money and maybe not be as efficient as the private marketplaces \nare. That is just inherent in government; government at all levels does \nnot have a profit motive, and therefore efficiency is always \nquestionable, and in many instances efficiency is poor. There are few \nexceptions to that, but for the most part you can say almost as a Black \nrule of law that a government program is going to be less efficient \nthan a private program that is subject to competition.\n  In the instances of direct lending, we are seeing that that appears \nto have been borne out again. We know that the workload, casework load, \nis up from 1992 by about 29 percent. But we see that the administrative \noverhead is up by 143 percent, which is an increase of 120 points more, \nor 115 points more than the workload going up. And we are not talking \nhere about things which are directly student related; we are talking \nmore about things which are tied to inefficiency, in my opinion.\n  We see that, for example, in the data processing area, the cost has \ngone up about 222 percent; in the payroll roll area, the cost has gone \nup 351 percent; in the training area, the cost has gone up 480 percent; \nin the staffing area, the cost has gone up 429 percent--this in \ncomparison, again, to a workload which has only gone up 29 percent.\n  So clearly there is a great deal of expansion in overhead costs here \nwhich is questionable on its face and on a statistical evaluation. So \nthe Senator from Florida has included within his amendment an attempt \nto address this by reducing in the outyears the amount of increase \nwhich will be allowed in the area of administrative costs.\n  I congratulate him for that because I do think that is the right \napproach, and I think it is the way that this amendment should be paid \nfor. I believe it is going to end up benefiting not only the GIs and \nthe members of the service who benefit from the underlying amendment, \nbut I think it is going to benefit the taxpayers generally, because we \nwill be saving money out of administrative costs which are very \nquestionable and applying it to getting people educated, which is the \nkey.\n  So I congratulate the Senator from Florida for his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, to close, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a letter dated July 7 from Mr. Steve A. \nRobertson, director of the National Legislative Commission of the \nAmerican Legion, in which he states, ``The American Legion urges you to \nsupport the Graham amendment to S. 1882, the Higher Education \nReauthorization Act.''\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                          The American Legion,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 7, 1998.\n       Dear Senator: The American Legion urges your support to the \n     Graham amendment to S. 1882, the Higher Education \n     Reauthorization Act,, which will exempt Montgomery GI Bill \n     (MGIB) benefits from being counted as resources when veterans \n     apply for financial aid.\n       According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, over 95 \n     percent of servicemembers entering the military elect to \n     participate in the Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB). Sadly, less \n     than 50 percent of eligible veterans have used their earned \n     MGIB benefit. Because of the high costs associated with \n     college, counting MGIB benefits as resources when applying \n     for other types of federal financial aid, penalizes veterans \n     and prevents many from enrolling in an educational program.\n       Ironically, counting earned benefits as resources only \n     applies to the MGIB and not other federal education programs \n     like AmeriCorps. Under existing law, many non-veterans \n     entering college actually have a larger monetary budget and \n     still receive more financial aid than veterans receiving MGIB \n     benefits. Penalizing veterans for receiving an earned \n     individual benefit sends the wrong message to America's youth \n     and is illogical and counterproductive. The Graham amendment \n     to the Higher Education Reauthorization Act corrects this \n     injustice and helps to restore the integrity and purpose of \n     ``earning an education.''\n       Young servicemembers have long understood the meaning of \n     earning educational benefits and the concept of working, \n     contributing and patiently planning to improve their economic \n     situation. Historically, the MGIB has served as a tremendous \n     recruiting tool for the Department of Defense. Unfortunately, \n     young men and women are less likely to join the military \n     today because of other\n\n[[Page S7794]]\n\n     federal education assistance programs that require little, if \n     any, up front commitment, sacrifice and out of pocket \n     expenses. Your efforts to help correct this trend will \n     provide much needed financial relief to young veterans and \n     their families when trying to transition from the military to \n     the civilian work force and help them realize their \n     educational potential.\n       Once again, The American Legion urges you to support the \n     Graham amendment to the Higher Education Reauthorization Act. \n     The American Legion appreciates your continued leadership and \n     commitment to veterans and their families.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Steve A. Robertson,\n\n                                                Director, National\n                                           Legislative Commission.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be included \nas a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to conclude by recognizing \nthe person who first brought this issue to my attention, Mr. Ron \nAtwell, who is the director of veterans benefits at the University of \nCentral Florida in Orlando, FL. While participating in graduation \nceremonies at the university in May, Mr. Atwell raised with me the \ninequity of this circumstance of veterans having effectively the \nbenefits that they deserved to receive, that they had made a partial \ncontribution towards, be diluted by the manner in which other student \nfinancial aid was calculated.\n  I thank Mr. Atwell. This is an example of a citizen with a legitimate \nconcern who has made a difference in the lives of potentially many \nthousands of future veterans who will get the benefit of this removal \nof an injustice from our student financial aid program.\n  With that, Mr. President, I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3110) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am going to very shortly send an amendment to the \ndesk. I want at the very beginning to just take a couple of minutes to \nthank my colleagues, Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy, for their \nvery fine work. To me, it is a labor of love to be on the Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee, and I want to very briefly talk about the \nHigher Education Act which was first passed in 1965.\n  I want to highlight at the beginning the Pell Grant Program, and I \nwant to pay my respects to one of the Senators whom I have most enjoyed \ngetting to know and to work with. I think he is a giant. I think he \nrepresents civility. And that is Senator Claiborne Pell. When we talk \nabout the Pell Grant Program, I would say to the pages, as you go to \napply for higher education, the Pell Grant Program will be critically \nimportant. This was Claiborne Pell's great contribution.\n  I do believe that eventually--and I think my colleagues agree with \nme; and I am really disappointed that we haven't done this--we ought to \nfully fund the Pell Grant Program. We have bumped it up now to about \n$3,100 or thereabouts, but, frankly, we ought to take it up to $5,000. \nIt is the most cost-effective approach. You reach the most students in \nneed. You reach well into the middle-income range as well. Students \ndon't graduate in such debt. It is absolutely critically important, and \nthat would remain for me kind of the major priority in higher \neducation.\n  I also want to just at the very beginning remind colleagues that I \nstill think, on the Hope scholarship tax credit proposal, we have got \nour work cut out for us, because if it is not refundable, those \nstudents, many of whom are in community colleges, Mr. President, in our \nState of Minnesota, who come from families under $28,000 a year, just \nsimply have no help at all. So the promise of a tremendous amount of \nassistance for 2 years of higher education is not being realized.\n  The average college student today is just so different--I mean is \nreally so different. I sometimes believe the nontraditional students, \nstudents who are older and going back to school, many of them with \nchildren themselves, have become the traditional students. Over 57 \npercent of college students are female--it certainly wasn't that way in \n1965 when we passed the Higher Education Act--37 percent are students \nof color. The average age of a student today in higher ed is 27, and \nmore than 25 percent of college students are over 30. About 1 in 5 are \nmarried, and 1 in 10 are single parents. So it is not just 18- and 19-\nyear-olds living in the dorm any longer. Really, we are talking about a \nvery different situation.\n  I wanted to highlight this, and I will just take a few moments and \nthen get right to the amendment by just some profiles of some of our \nMinnesota students.\n  Tony Rust is a senior at Southwest State University at Marshall, MN, \nand the Minnesota State University Student Association State Chair. He \nreceived the Pell grant his freshman year, only the Perkins loan his \nfirst 3 years, and the Stafford loan all 4 years. During his 4 years of \ncollege, Rust has worked at least 20 hours per week in order to pay for \ntuition and other expenses. His parents have not helped him \nfinancially, but he did, however, receive scholarships during his \nsophomore year. ``I wouldn't have been able to attend college without \nthe Federal financial aid programs,'' Rust said. ``I wouldn't be \ngraduating this weekend if it wasn't for federal programs.'' Rust's \nloan debt will be approximately $20,000.\n  That weekend, of course, goes back to the beginning of June. By the \nway, Southwest State University is one great university. And the thing \nI like about it best, Mr. President--you have probably visited it as \nwell--is the accessibility for those students who are developmentally \ndisabled. It is just an incredible place; it really is.\n  Paula Heinonen, after working for years in a rural hospital and \nraising four children, decided to return to school to enhance her \nskills. A nontraditional student, Paula is a junior at the Center for \nExtended Learning at Bemidji State University at Bemidji, MN. Paula is \na wife, mother, worker, and student.\n  And we have a lot of students like that today on our campuses.\n  Then, finally, Troyce Williams. Troyce is a single mother of four \nchildren who is working hard to complete her studies at Minneapolis \nCommunity and Technical College within the one-year education \nrequirement--which I will come back to in the amendment. Affordable \nhousing and child care are critical to her graduating.\n  Mr. President, there are a couple of things in this bill I \nappreciate. There was an amendment I was proud of that we introduced, \nwe did extend the Pell award for summer semesters, and that will help a \nlot these nontraditional students. I think that was terribly important. \nWe did have increases, not all that we should have, in the Pell grants \nand in the TRIO Program. I don't think I heard a lot of discussion \nabout the TRIO Program, but talk about a heart-and-soul program, I love \nthe TRIO people in Minnesota. It is an effort to reach down in the \npublic school system and attract students of color or ``disadvantaged'' \nstudents, low-income students, to higher education. And then, once \nthere, once they are in our colleges and universities, to provide them \nwith the kind of additional support services that they need. It is just \nwildly successful and, actually, we have strong bipartisan support for \nthe TRIO Program. There was a time when we were fighting for the \nsurvival of the TRIO Program. I am really glad that both parties have \nunited behind it.\n  Senator DeWine and I--and I have enjoyed working with Senator DeWine \nfrom Ohio--we have an amendment in this bill that I feel very good \nabout. What we essentially say is that for those men and women who \ngraduate who go into early childhood development, there will be loan \nforgiveness. That is a really positive incentive. We keep saying we \nhave to get it right for students before kindergarten, but we pay men \nand women in child care miserably low wages. You make half of what you \nmake working at a zoo, if you are working with children.\n  By the way, I think people who work at zoos do very important work. I \nlove zoos. Actually, I think they are precious. But the point is, why \nin the world do we say, ``These early years are so important for the \ndevelopment\n\n[[Page S7795]]\n\nof the brain, as shown in all of the studies, and we have to get it \nright for these children, it has to be intellectually stimulating,'' \nand we have so many people who work for $6 or $7 or $8 an hour, many \nwithout any health care benefits and all? Senator DeWine and I have a \nloan forgiveness provision in the bill which I think at least helps.\n  We have a mental health package which will provide those who are \nchoosing careers in mental health to have research work and internships \non the campus to be considered as study.\n  We have an effort with Senator Kennedy in an area that has \nlanguished, recruiting women into the fields of math and science.\n  We do some things that I think are important with the Fair Play Act, \nwhich would require the university data--I say to the chair of the \ncommittee, don't worry, I am not going to get started on this today, at \nleast--but we have expenditures on all sports to be shared with the \nDepartment of Education, so we can try to figure out why some of these \nminor sports, be they men's sports or women's sports, are being cut.\n  My colleague, Senator Gregg from New Hampshire, is great to work \nwith. I am proud of the amendment we did on campus safety. We want more \naccurate reporting. We have an issue with the Senator from \nPennsylvania, and we have a $10 million grant program for collaboration \nbetween campus police, local law enforcement, and those women who are \nworking in battered women shelters, which I think is extremely \nimportant.\n  Finally, we are going to have an GAO study just look again at some of \nthe cuts in college sports, some of which I think have been arbitrary \nand capricious, and to try to have a little bit more accountability.\n  I thank my colleagues for their work on this bill. I am proud of the \namendments I was able to contribute. I think this is a very good piece \nof legislation.\n  I now will send an amendment to the desk. This amendment I introduce \non behalf of myself, Senator Wendell Ford, Senator Tim Johnson, Senator \nDick Durbin, Senator Carl Levin, Senator Barbara Mikulski and Senator \nCarol Moseley-Braun. A number of these Senators are going to be out on \nthe floor speaking on this amendment. I think it is an extremely \nimportant amendment, colleagues. I believe we can pass it. I hope we \ncan pass it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3111\n\n     (Purpose: To expand the educational opportunities for welfare \n                              recipients)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], for himself, \n     Mr. Ford, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Levin, Ms. Mikulski \n     and Ms. Moseley-Braun, proposes an amendment numbered 3111.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in title VII, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC __. EXPANSION OF EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR WELFARE \n                   RECIPIENTS.\n\n       (a) 24 Months of Postsecondary Education and Vocational \n     Educational Training Made Permissible Work Activities.--\n     Section 407(d)(8) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     607(d)(8)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(8) postsecondary education and vocational educational \n     training (not to exceed 24 months with respect to any \n     individual);''.\n       (b) Modifications To the Educational Cap.--\n       (1) Removal of teen parents from 30 percent limitation.--\n     Section 407(c)(2)(D) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     607(c)(2)(D)) is amended by striking ``, or (if the month is \n     in fiscal year 2000 or thereafter) deemed to be engaged in \n     work for the month by reason of subparagraph (C) of this \n     paragraph''.\n       (2) Extension of cap to postsecondary education.--Section \n     407(c)(2)(D) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     607(c)(2)(D)) is amended by striking ``vocational educational \n     training'' and inserting ``training described in subsection \n     (d)(8)''.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, most of my colleagues who support this \namendment, and I believe there will be bipartisan support, supported \nthe welfare bill. This is not about the welfare bill. Most colleagues \nwho support this amendment were strongly in support of the welfare \nbill.\n  I want to say at the beginning, a few words about that welfare bill \nwhich is a little counterintuitive to what I think people have been \nreading about or hearing about. I want to say, and unfortunately I \nbelieve I can marshal a lot of evidence for this point of view, that \nthe reduction of welfare rolls by some 4 million plus people will be a \ngood thing if what we are talking about is a reduction of poverty. The \nquestion is whether or not it has led to a reduction of poverty. There \nis precious little information out there and we need to understand, \nwhen we say to a family--a single parent, almost always women with \nsmall children--you now are off the rolls, you will be working, the \nquestion becomes what kind of jobs at what kind of wages can they \nsupport their families on? And, when they lose their health care a year \nlater, are they worse off or better off? We have to make sure that \nthese women and these children will be better off and that this will \nlead to a reduction of poverty, economic independence and all the rest.\n  I am not at all sure that is happening. As a matter of fact, I think \nif we were ever to get the data State by State, we would find that many \nof these others and these children are worse off. First point. Then I \nwill get to the amendment.\n  Second point--child care. There are too many stories that too many \npeople are now telling about how, yes, they are working, but it is a 3-\nto-11 job. Where is the child care available for their 3-year-old or \ntheir 4-year-old? There are too many of these families that talk about \nvery ad hoc arrangements, one week it is a cousin, another week it is \nan older brother, but they never know from week to week how they will \nbe able to find the child care.\n  There are too many long waiting lists for affordable child care for \nworking families. Now, you have another group of people who are coming \ninto the workforce. There are too many first and second graders who are \ngoing home alone with no one there at all, and too many 3-year-olds and \n4-year-olds also who are at home alone. That is the truth. Somebody has \nto look at that. I just want to say it on the floor once and then I go \nright on to the amendment. Someone has to look at that.\n  If we are going to say that children are so precious--and we say \nthat--and if we are going to say the children are 100 percent of our \nfuture--and we say that--then these children, even if they are poor \nchildren, matter as much as any other children. They are, all of these \nchildren, are a mother's child and a father's child, and they should \nmatter. Somebody, somewhere, sometime, someplace has to get beyond the \nhype and look at exactly what is happening.\n  Now, for the amendment supported by many colleagues who have a very \ndifferent view about the welfare bill; this amendment is \nstraightforward. What it does is it allows States to permit 24 months \nof vocational and postsecondary education as work activity. I will \nexplain what this means. And, in addition, it removes teens from the 30 \npercent education cap.\n  Two issues: The States have a cap as to how many citizens they can \ncount as working if they are going to school, and teenagers are \nincluded. In a way, the teenagers should not be included because the \ngiven is we want teenagers to complete their high school education. I \nthink that is pretty simple and straightforward, and that will help a \nlot of our States out as they try to work through the work \nparticipation requirements.\n  The second thing this amendment says is, for any State that wants \nto--and there is no mandate at all--for any State that wants to, you \ncan allow a mother to be able to complete 2 years of education.\n  This is extremely important. Senator Levin began this effort last \nsummer when he offered a similar amendment to the Balanced Budget Act. \nHis amendment would have expanded the current law to permit 24 months \nof vocational education. I commend his efforts.\n\n  I remind colleagues that there were 55 votes in favor of the \namendment. Since that time, more data, more reports, more anecdotal \nevidence has emerged reinforcing the need to make this modification. In \nother words, we want to give States more flexibility with their welfare \nplans.\n\n[[Page S7796]]\n\n  We have to make this modification, because right now what is \nhappening is that in too many cases States don't have the flexibility \nand, therefore, women, single parents with small children who are on \nthe path to economic self-sufficiency because they are going to school, \nare essentially being driven out of school. This is crazy. We shouldn't \ndo this.\n  If we can at least put into effect this modification, which I think \nwill have strong support, we will enable these women and these mothers \nto go on through the 2 years of education. We will enable the States to \nhave the flexibility. No State is required to; it is up to the States. \nThese women will be in a much better position to be economically \nsufficient.\n  I will provide a lot of data, I say to my colleagues. If the Senator \nfrom Illinois is here to speak on the amendment--I know he is an \noriginal cosponsor. Has the Senator come to speak on the amendment? I \nwill give an introduction and then defer to my colleague because we are \ngoing to finish up soon.\n  Mr. President, what I am simply saying to colleagues is, I think this \nmodification just makes all the sense in the world. Right now what \nhappens is you have a State that is under pressure with all the work \nparticipation requirements. The State doesn't feel like it has the \nflexibility to give these mothers this option. And so you have this \nkind of bitterly ironic situation where a mother, a single parent, with \ntwo small children in college is forced out of college. She gets a $6-\nan-hour job with no benefits. One year later, she loses her medical \nassistance, and she and her children are far worse off, as opposed to--\nand I will provide a lot of data to support this--as opposed to what \nhappens when this woman, this mother can complete her education.\n  There is no mandate. What we are saying is that if my State of \nMinnesota or the State of Illinois or the State of Vermont or the State \nof Massachusetts or the State of Alabama so desires, or the State of \nKentucky--my colleague, Senator Ford, has been very active on this--\nthen they can do so.\n  The question is, When these mothers are on the path to economic self-\nsufficiency, why do we want to take them off that path? I recently \nheard from a mother, Camille Martinson, who is a single mother with two \nchildren on the verge of completing a nursing degree. But fearing she \nwill be unable to do so--her words best express the frustration she is \nnow feeling and highlights, I think, the importance of the amendment. I \nquote from the letter that Camille sent me:\n\n       With this infant program--\n\n  That is our welfare program in Minnesota--\n\n     They are forcing me to work a $5.15 per hour job. But if I \n     was to graduate as a nurse, I will work for pay of over $10 \n     per hour or higher. I am almost ready to graduate but it's \n     damn near impossible with all these demands on me. If I \n     didn't love my children so much that I want to provide them \n     and give them a good life, I would have quit school and \n     flipped burgers for eternity. I guess that's what the State \n     may be forced to have me do. It sure seems like it. I want to \n     make something out of my life for me and my children and \n     succeed in life but won't at this rate.\n\n  These are her words, a direct quote:\n\n       Please help me with these issues as I see no other way out. \n     It is hell for me. I guess you have to be in my shoes to know \n     exactly how I feel and what I'm going through. I don't like \n     the way this program is set up. It is a lose-lose situation. \n     I can't win no matter what I do. The system I'm currently \n     working on will make me fail no matter what I do. When I \n     speak on these issues I'm not only speaking for myself, but \n     many thousands of others are having similar problems that I \n     do.\n\n  I have a lot to lay out on this amendment. I yield the floor to my \ncolleague from Illinois who was gracious enough to come down and speak \non this.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask for recognition in support of his \neffort. I say to my colleagues in the Senate, we have, in the course of \nthe century, embarked on major undertakings at the Federal level. \nProbably the most historic was the New Deal. The New Deal, which goes \nback some 65 years-plus, was an effort to bring this country out of a \nterrible situation. It was initiated by President Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt, and he tried very many different ideas to try to get America \nmoving again.\n  I thought the hallmark of the New Deal was the willingness to concede \nthat every new idea in the New Deal didn't work. Some of them had to be \njunked; some of them had to be changed substantially.\n  I was one who voted in favor of the welfare reform legislation. I \nbelieved that we needed to change the welfare system in this country, \nto change the mentality of welfare, to break the generational \ndependency that was repeating and repeating.\n  I said as I voted for it, and I repeat today, that bill, as drafted, \nwas not perfect law by a long shot. It didn't reflect the reality of \nchange that would take place across America. So since then, on four or \nfive different occasions, we have modified welfare reform in order to \nbe more responsive to the actual needs of Americans.\n  What the Senator from Minnesota is asking us to do is to open our \neyes, go beyond the stereotypes, go beyond the cliches, look at the \nreal people who are now making the life struggle to come off welfare \nand into an independent state and a state where they can raise their \nfamilies in dignity.\n  I have met women like those who have written to Senator Wellstone. \nOne I can recall is in Springfield. She is coming off welfare, \nattending the community college. Bringing her 12-year-old daughter to \nclass with her because she had no one to watch her, keeping that \ndaughter in class with her during the course of the day, and trying to \nfind her way home in the evening by public transportation was making \nthe ultimate sacrifice. She was going to get that associate degree and \nuse it to improve her life and to help her daughter no matter what. We \nshould never stand in the way of that.\n  What the Senator from Minnesota is saying is let us have the \nflexibility to recognize when people are making an honest and \ndetermined effort. Let us not set up these barriers and walls to \nprogress. Let us join in a partnership and hold our hand out to help \nthese people come up that ladder to success. I think when it comes to \neducation, it should go out without debate and really without \ncontroversy here; that if we have people who are moving on the track to \ntraining and education which liberates them from welfare dependency, we \nshouldn't constrict them with rules or with our laws or our legal \nstereotypes.\n  I gladly support the Senator from Minnesota, and I hope that we can \nprovide this flexibility, and with this flexibility, we can give more \npeople an opportunity to succeed.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague. I know we are going to take a \nbreak in a moment. I say to my colleagues, if you don't have debate and \nwant to support this amendment, I won't talk that long. I am ready to \ngo forward with it. I don't know what my colleagues have heard. I \nbelieve both of them are supporters.\n  I will simply summarize right now. There is a lot of data I can \npresent later on about the difference an associate degree makes in \nterms of an economic situation for a family.\n  I want to pick up on one comment my colleague from Illinois made. I \ncan't even begin to recount the number of community colleges I have \nbeen at where maybe there are 300 students. I know about 20 percent are \nsingle parents, many welfare mothers. Over and over again, the plea \nthat I hear is, ``Please let me finish my education; please let me get \nmy 2-year degree, because I will be in such a better position to \nsupport myself and my children.''\n  I think if a State wants to allow a mother to do so, and her family \nwill be much better off, we ought to give States that flexibility. I \nbelieve our States are saying that, I believe the community colleges \nare saying that and these families are saying that.\n  I have a list of about 70 different organizations--120 \norganizations--that are saying that. So I hope we will adopt this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask the manager, my colleague, the chairman, I have \nmuch to say if we are going on and there is debate. If there is support \nfor this, I am prepared to urge its adoption. Does my colleague know? \nIs there opposition?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I am not at liberty to say at this time. I don't know. \nI suspect there is opposition, but I haven't\n\n[[Page S7797]]\n\nhad anyone come forward who wishes to speak at this point. But since we \nhave reached the magic hour of 2 o'clock, it is best we proceed under \nthe unanimous consent agreement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/09/senate-section/article/S7784-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7797-S7815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 AGRICULTURE EXPORT RELIEF ACT OF 1998\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour of 2 o'clock having arrived, the \nclerk will report S. 2282.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2282) to amend the Arms Export Control Act, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized for 1 \nhour under the previous agreement.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to offer the Agriculture \nExport Relief Act. First, I thank the members of the sanctions task \nforce for their critical contributions to this bill. The staff has met \nseveral times, and I think the concerns which were raised in each \nmeeting have been incorporated in this legislation.\n  Before I describe the bill, I would like to mention a few Members for \ntheir unique role in bringing this bill to the floor and energizing all \nof the interest that has developed around this particular issue.\n  Senator Roberts of Kansas deserves special recognition for his \nleadership in resolving this pressing issue. It was two bills first \nintroduced by Senator Roberts--one dealing with the specific issue of \nlost markets for U.S. farmers and another more important bill dealing \nwith the broader issue of ensuring that the executive branch has the \nflexibility it needs to conduct foreign policy in south Asia--that \nprovided the initial impetus for today's action on this important \nlegislation.\n  Senator Roberts quickly recognized the need to provide additional \nflexibility in dealing with the troublesome relationship between India \nand Pakistan. His legislation to provide that flexibility prompted the \nmajority leader to create the sanctions task force 2 weeks ago. And \ntoday, in the task force's action, the U.S. Senate is preparing to act \non the legislation originally sponsored by Senator Roberts.\n  I am very pleased to associate myself with the work of the Senator \nfrom Kansas. While his efforts to protect and defend America's farmers \nand ranchers are widely appreciated, I am particularly pleased to \nrecognize his strong leadership in the area of U.S. foreign policy and \nin protecting the national security interests of the American people.\n  I also want to take a moment to recognize the work of Senator Conrad \nBurns, Senator Chuck Hagel, and Senator Lugar. Each have been vocal, \neffective advocates for their agriculture communities' interests, which \nI am convinced is why the Senate is acting so quickly today. And, in \naddition to that, Senator Grams of Minnesota and Senator Allard of \nColorado have been particularly active and involved in this issue.\n  Let me outline briefly what I think this bill accomplishes, since we \noperated on a tight deadline and there may be some Members who have not \nhad a chance to review the details. Frankly, it is short and it is \nsimple.\n  As many Members know, current law imposes sanctions on nations which \ntransfer nuclear technology or detonate a nuclear weapon. The law \nexempts from these sanctions intelligence activities and humanitarian \nassistance. This legislation adds one additional category. We have \npermanently exempted financing and credits extended by the Department \nof Agriculture to support the sales of agricultural commodities. We \nhave also clarified that current law exemptions on commercial financing \nextend not only to agricultural commodities but also to fertilizer.\n  The reasoning behind this exemption is simple: Sanctions are supposed \nto squeeze the targeted country, not the American farmer or producer. \nCutting off our sales will not alter or reverse the decision to \ndetonate. Cutting off American export financing will not change any \ngovernment's judgment or, for that matter, change its behavior about \nits nuclear program. There is no leverage in curtailing or cutting off \nour sales; there is only loss of income for our farmers, our ranchers, \nour producers.\n\n  As we discuss this bill, the U.S. agriculture community faces the \npossibility of not being able to bid on a tender of 350,000 tons of \nwheat recently proffered by the Pakistani Government. At a time when \nAsian markets and sales are depressed, this tender is unusually \nimportant. Whether the Pakistanis buy U.S. wheat, Canadian wheat, or \nsome other country's wheat isn't going to make a difference on a dinner \ntable in Islamabad--but it sure will in Topeka. We should not sacrifice \nthe American farmer in our effort to put the nuclear genie back in the \nbottle.\n  This bill is a good first step. But I would like to let my colleagues \nknow it is not as far as most of the members of the task force wanted \nus to go. I think many shared the view that we should exempt from the \nsanctions law all official export promotion support to all American \nbusinesses, especially in view of the enormous pressure many are under \nbecause of the Asian meltdown. In the search for substitute markets, it \nwould have made a real difference to allow the Export-Import Bank and \nOPIC support for a wide range of businesses from aircraft to home \ncomputers. However, given Senator Feinstein's and Senator Glenn's \nobjections, we were not able to proceed with export support.\n  We also could not proceed with language which would give the \nPresident a margin of flexibility to facilitate a reduction of tensions \nin the region. We did not plan to offer a permanent waiver or \nsuspension of sanctions. We were simply going to give the President \nauthority to waive any restrictions until March 1 if doing so would \nproduce some progress.\n  I think many of us are concerned about the possibility of additional \ntests, the prospect of deployment of nuclear weapons, and the transfer \nof fissile material to third parties. I am convinced that there was \nsome merit in providing the President a short period of time to waive a \nrestriction on economic assistance if he could produce meaningful \nresults in enhancing our security interests.\n  Again, objections on the other side of the aisle have prevented us \nfrom offering that option today. We may not have reached as far as most \nof the members of the task force wanted, but we have taken a first, \nconstructive step in defining when sanctions are and when sanctions are \nnot in American interests and changing the law to better reflect those \ninterests. This bill will advance and protect American economic \nsecurity interests.\n  I have been pleased by the cooperative spirit which has characterized \nthis first round in the task force's efforts and the fact that we had a \nvery tough deadline set by the leadership which we were able to meet a \nweek early. We would not have been able to move so quickly without \nSenator Biden's active and thoughtful effort. I thank him for that. We \nhave had a lot of explaining to do, and my colleague has taken on that \nchallenge with expertise and enthusiasm.\n  Mr. President, I do not see Senator Biden here yet. There are a \nvariety of Senators on this side of the aisle who have been heavily \ninvolved in this, many of whom I see on the floor today. Senator Craig \nhas been very, very active and concerned about this issue, and I \nbelieve he was first on the floor. I would be happy to yield to Senator \nCraig 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President let me thank my colleague and chairman, \nSenator McConnell, for working so closely with so many of us to bring \nS. 2282 to the floor. It is important that we act now and that we act \ndecisively to send a very clear message to our producers and to our \nmarkets, both nationally and around the world, that we recognize, \nalthough sometimes the action of Government does not appear to, that \nthe American economy and American farmers live in a global economy, and \nthat we have to be a good deal more sensitive to our actions as it \nrelates to that and the impact that those actions can have on our \nproducers. Cutting ourselves off through unilateral sanctions seldom \nbenefits us as a nation and almost always hurts the producer. In this \ninstance today, we are\n\n[[Page S7798]]\n\nspeaking of that producer being the American farmer.\n\n  Many of us have recognized that for a long time and have tried to say \nin a clear way through different pieces of legislation that food should \nnever be used as a tool of foreign policy. But we stumble into that on \na regular basis. As a result of that, we damage significantly the \nproducer, because in the business of trade, one of the things that \nAmerican agriculture has been able to establish over the years is two \nvery important items. First of all, they are able to let the world know \nthey can deliver a quality product. The world knows that and \nappreciates it. But it is also important that the world knows we are a \nreliable supplier. We search and we allow our producers to find markets \nand work to build those markets, only to be snuffed out by a piece of \nlegislation that may or may not have impact upon another nation. That \nis exactly what has happened in this instance and why it is so \nimportant we act today and in a timely way.\n  Food should never be used as a tool of foreign policy for all the \nreasons that have been spoken to by myself and Senator McConnell and I \nam sure will be referenced here today. It is poor policy to require the \nfarmer to bear the burden of a faulty foreign policy or undeterminable \ngoals, faulty goals.\n  In the bill we passed a year and a half ago, a new farm bill, we made \na variety of promises to American agriculture producers. We promised, \nas we eliminated most price supports and ushered in a greater freedom \nto produce, that we would help open up world markets and that we would \nassure their openness and access to those markets, and that would \nbecome an important part of the marketplace. We promised less \ngovernment intervention, and we promised to improve risk management \noptions. The tragedy is, while we promised it, the action that was \nnecessary to be taken under the Arms Export Control Act was a denial of \nthat promise.\n  Today, we are here on the floor reinstating that promise very \nclearly. I hope the task force that Senator McConnell and others are \ninvolved in, while they have looked at this and while Senator Roberts \nhas been a leader in helping us focus on this issue, that we go well \nbeyond this in this future, that we examine all of the things we are \ndoing in the area of sanctions to see whether they really make sense or \nnot. Maybe they would have in a world economy if we were the sole \nprovider, if we had something nobody else had, if we had something that \neverybody else needed; maybe then we could force policy that was \notherwise unpopular with some. That is not the case, certainly not the \ncase with agricultural commodities. We must be a supplier of quality, \nand we must be a reliable supplier. Government needs to stay out of the \nway, only to help facilitate access to those markets, not in any way to \ndeter them.\n  This amendment today moves us again to deal with this issue in a \nforthright manner. I think it will go a long way toward sending the \nright signal to our markets. I thank Senator McConnell and others who \nhave been involved.\n  He mentioned a good number who have been involved with us on a \nregular basis over the last several months, both Democrat and \nRepublican, in focusing on this issue. I am happy to have played some \nrole in it but, most importantly, to help get this to the floor on a \ntimely basis so we can impact markets and production and price in this \ncountry. I am convinced this action today will do so.\n  I yield back any remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to join my \ncolleagues, Senator Biden, Senator Roberts, and numerous other sponsors \nof this amendment, in moving forward this important piece of \nlegislation today.\n  I ask unanimous consent Senator Kerrey be added as a cosponsor as \nwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it is imperative that we preserve \nPakistan as an export market for our wheat. Washington State wheat \ngrowers need this bill. Our wheat prices right now are beneath the cost \nof production. Our growers and the rural communities they support are, \nfrankly, losing the shirts off their backs.\n  There are now 3,500 wheat farms in eastern Washington; that is 3,500 \nwheat families. These families are the backbone of our rural economy. \nIn Douglas, Lincoln, and Adams Counties, in Ritzville and Garfield, our \ngrowers need export markets like Pakistan so they can keep going. Every \nday we are losing family farms, and it is imperative that we do \nsomething about it.\n  This bill doesn't just affect farmers, it affects our truckers, it \naffects our ports, it affects our barge operators, and all of their \nfamilies as well.\n  Given the evolving market forces in south Asia, it is really critical \nthat we pass this bill today to give wheat growers in Washington State, \nthe Northwest, and the Nation the chance to compete with other \nsuppliers who are just waiting to take our customers.\n  No one condones the actions of either Pakistan or India earlier this \nyear. The proliferation of nuclear weapons must not be allowed. The \nArms Export Control Act of 1994, passed overwhelmingly by Congress, and \nrequires that sanctions be imposed on these nations.\n  But the original act excluded food and humanitarian assistance. \nUnfortunately, the export credit guarantee programs of USDA essential \nto sale of food to poorer nations like Pakistan were not excluded.\n  Last month, during committee consideration of the Agriculture \nappropriations bill, I passed an amendment to explicitly exclude these \nexport credit guarantees, most notably the GSM-102 program, from the \nsanctions.\n  Unfortunately, because of recent developments here on the floor, this \namendment on agriculture will not be enacted into law soon enough to \nprevent the loss of this important export market.\n  Pakistan recently announced that they will tender for 350,000 metric \ntons of white wheat on July 15 for an August shipment. Without access \nto the GSM-102 credit guarantees, United States wheat producers will \nnot sell a single kernel of wheat to Pakistan.\n  In recent years, Washington state wheat producers, in fact, Pacific \nNorthwest growers, have sold more than one-third of their wheat to \nPakistan. Washington state and other Pacific Northwest states produce \nalmost exclusively white wheat, making Pakistan out number one export \nmarket.\n  Washington wheat needs this export market. This is a $300 million \nmarket for Washington wheat.\n  If we do not enact this legislation by July 15, we will lose not only \nthe ability to bid on this tender, but potentially the entire Pakistan \nmarket, as other nations step in to fill the void.\n  That is why we are bringing this amendment as a stand-alone piece of \nlegislation this afternoon.\n  If we do not pass this bill and preserve this important wheat market, \nthe United States reputation as a reliable supplier of high quality \nwheat will be weakened and our competitive advantage in the global \nmarketplace undermined.\n  That is why this Congress must act now.\n  Mr. President, I have a number of items that I ask unanimous consent \nto have printed in the Record: A letter from Sandy Berger, Assistant to \nthe President for National Security Affairs, in support of my \namendment; remarks of the President in a radio statement on wheat \nexports in support of the legislation; a statement by the Secretary of \nAgriculture, Dan Glickman, in support of the legislation; a letter from \nthe National Association of Wheat Growers in support of this \nlegislation; and a letter from the National Association of State \nDepartments of Agriculture in support of this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                   Washington, DC., June 11, 1998.\n     Hon. Patty Murray,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murray: Thank you for your leadership in \n     addressing the question of Agriculture Department export \n     credit programs that may be affected by the imposition of \n     sanctions on Pakistan and India under section 102 of the Arms \n     Export Control Act. As you know, in implementing the \n     sanctions we are endeavoring, whenever possible, to minimize \n     the humanitarian impact on the people of India and Pakistan.\n\n[[Page S7799]]\n\n       With this purpose in mind, the Administration supports the \n     legislative language in the bill, introduced today by you and \n     Senator Roberts, which would amend the Arms Export Control \n     Act to create an exception for ``credit, credit guarantees, \n     or other financial assistance provided by the Department of \n     Agriculture for the purchase or other provision of food or \n     other agricultural commodities.'' We further support your \n     efforts to move such legislative language as expeditiously as \n     possible.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Samuel R. Berger,\n\n                                    Assistant to the President for\n     National Security Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  The White House,\n\n\n                                Office of the Press Secretary,\n\n                                                    June 11, 1998.\n     For Immediate Release:\n\n     Remarks of the President in a Radio Statement on Wheat Exports\n\n       ``Today, I announced my support for Senator Murray's \n     legislation to ensure that American farmers can continue to \n     export wheat to Pakistan and India under the Department of \n     Agriculture's export credit program.\n       In implementing sanctions against India and Pakistan, we \n     are trying, wherever possible, to minimize the humanitarian \n     impact on the people of those countries. We have long \n     believed that food should not be used as a weapon to \n     influence other nations.\n       Farmers in the United States provide a significant \n     percentage of Pakistan's wheat imports. Cutting off that \n     supply would only hurt the citizens of Pakistan and American \n     farmers without furthering our important goals of \n     nonproliferation of atomic weapons. We hope this amendment is \n     passed as quickly as possible.''\n                                  ____\n\nContinuing Agricultural Export Credits to India and Pakistan\n\n  [From Radio Address of Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, June 12, \n                                 1998]\n\n       When India and Pakistan recently conducted underground \n     tests of their nuclear weapons, they crossed a line with the \n     United States that requires a firm, no-nonsense response. \n     This Administration has imposed tough sanctions that we \n     support and that are required by law.\n       But the law also has called into question the fate of U.S. \n     agricultural export credits. Export credits promote the sale \n     of U.S. farm products to buyers in countries facing economic \n     difficulties. These credits, which come at no cost to U.S. \n     taxpayers, have enabled our farmers and ranchers to sell \n     several billion dollars worth of food and fiber around the \n     world. Without these credits, our exports would decline, as \n     would our farm income, and areas in Asia and other parts of \n     the world would be more unstable because economically \n     troubled countries would have a harder time buying food.\n       While India makes only nominal use of these export credit \n     programs, Pakistan is another story. They are the third \n     largest market for U.S. wheat, and the top market for white \n     wheat. Last year, Pakistan purchased 81 million bushels of \n     U.S. wheat, almost all through export credit guarantees. And, \n     so far this year, these credits have made possible $162 \n     million in U.S. wheat sales to buyers in Pakistan.\n       Unfortunately, as Congress wrote the arms control act, \n     these sales may soon be in jeopardy. By law, this \n     Administration could be forced to suspend these credits.\n       For humanitarian reasons, we should not use food as a \n     weapon to influence other nations. From an economic \n     perspective, it's important to show that the U.S. is \n     committed to being a reliable supplier of agricultural \n     products. And, for all practical purposes, the ones who will \n     be punished most by this action would be U.S. wheat farmers \n     who already have been beaten up by low prices.\n       This Administration will resist any action that would lead \n     to a de facto grain embargo, and I do not believe the arms \n     control act was written with that end in mind. We need to act \n     quickly to protect these export credits. Fortunately, \n     legislation now before the Congress--authored by Senator \n     Patty Murray, of Washington, and Senator Pat Roberts, of \n     Kansas--would do just that. This Administration strongly \n     supports this bill which would separate agricultural trade \n     from American's non-proliferation efforts.\n       For our world to be stable and secure in the next century, \n     we need strong international arms control efforts, but we \n     also need a strong agricultural trading system that is \n     capable of getting enough food to people around the world. \n     Both are essential ingredients to peace and stability, and \n     neither should be sacrificed to the other.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                                 Wheat Growers\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 11, 1998.\n     Hon. Patty Murray,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murray: We are writing in strong support of \n     the ``India-Pakistan Agricultural Credit Sanction Exemption \n     Bill''. It is our understanding that this bill will provide a \n     narrow exemption for food and food credit programs from any \n     possible sanctions resulting from Section 102(b) of the Arms \n     Export Control Act against the nations of India and Pakistan. \n     Further, this limited exemption is consistent with the \n     existing statutory exemption for commercial agricultural \n     loans.\n       Pakistan is the third largest wheat export market for the \n     United States. In 1997-98, Pakistan imported 2.2 million \n     metric tons. Wheat is the major staple of the Pakistani diet \n     and inadequate inventories could cause social unrest. In \n     1997, wheat shortages led to the collapse of the political \n     system. Such unrest could lead to the ouster of the current \n     government or worse, a military strike at India. We see food \n     as a means to protect the political stability of Pakistan.\n       Indian is subject to the same sanctions as a result of its \n     nuclear tests, however, it does not participate in the USDA \n     export credit guarantee program nor is it currently a major \n     importer of U.S. wheat. Nevertheless the narrow exemption \n     expressed in the ``India-Pakistan Agricultural Credit \n     Sanction Exemption Bill'' should be applied equally.\n       Thank you for your leadership in advancing the view that \n     food should not be used as a weapon of foreign policy. We \n     would also like to express our appreciation for your brave \n     effort to reverse the tide of unilateral economic sanctions. \n     Currently, eleven percent of the world wheat market is off \n     limits to U.S. producers due to the imposition of unilateral \n     economic sanctions. The addition of Pakistan and India to the \n     sanctions list would further disadvantage U.S. wheat farmers \n     and drive down already low wheat prices. It is our experience \n     that most sanctions serve no one but our competitors and do \n     little, if anything, to improve the behavior of the offending \n     government. We pledge to work with you and the bill's co-\n     sponsors to reform our unilateral sanctions policy and exempt \n     food and other humanitarian assistance from the U.S. \n     sanctions arsenal.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Bill Flory,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     National Association of State\n\n\n                                   Departments of Agriculture,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 11, 1998.\n     Hon. Patty Murray,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murray: On behalf of the nation's \n     commissioners, secretaries and directors of the state \n     departments of agriculture, I am writing to express our \n     strong support for your amendments to exempt certain \n     Department of Agriculture programs from sanctions under the \n     Arms Export Control Act. Prohibitions against U.S. \n     agricultural exports will only serve to hurt U.S. farmers.\n       As you know, the GSM-102 credit program is extremely \n     important to U.S. agricultural exporters. It serves as a \n     safety net for reluctant exporters by guaranteeing financing \n     for the sale of U.S. agricultural commodities to certain \n     foreign markets. The recently imposed sanctions against \n     Pakistan do not exempt such programs as the GSM-102 program, \n     virtually cutting off that market to U.S. agricultural \n     products. Many of our nation's farmers rely upon Pakistan as \n     a market for their products under the GSM-102 program.\n       Given the recent crisis in Asia, which has had a \n     substantial impact on U.S. agricultural exports, now is not \n     the time to cut off another key market for U.S. farm \n     products. Senator Murray, we appreciate your efforts on \n     behalf of U.S. agriculture. NASDA does not believe that \n     foreign policy should serve to ban the export of U.S. \n     agricultural products.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Richard W. Kirchhoff,\n                                 Executive Vice President and CEO.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, agriculture is in crisis. The bottom has \nfallen out of the agriculture economy. Many of our growers are on the \nverge of bankruptcy. In fact, many have already gone over the edge.\n  We are losing family farms and we are losing the rural way of life.\n  Many in this chamber argue that trade is the answer. Trade is \nimportant, critically important. Pacific Northwest agriculture depends \nupon vigorous trade promotion.\n  I am a strong proponent of trade. But trade is not enough.\n  The 1996 farm bill took away the safety net for our growers. The old \nfarm bill needed to be changed. And Freedom to Farm made some important \nchanges. But it went too far and now growers are suffering.\n  While a market-based approach creates freedoms and opportunities in a \ncompetitive global market, some semblance of a safety net is necessary \nto ensure our growers survive the ups and downs of a volatile market. \nCongress needs to take action to protect agriculture and preserve rural \ncommunities before it is too late.\n  And this bill is an important step. Maintaining our export markets is \nessential to our long-term success. I urge the Senate to approve this \nlegislation.\n  I retain the balance of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nMontana.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank my friend from Kentucky. I also want to thank the\n\n[[Page S7800]]\n\nSenator in a couple of other areas, because responding to what we have \nin the Northwest is, in my regard, an emergency.\n  Let's back up a little bit and talk about what has happened to farm \nexport, and especially to the Northwest. Last January, we sat down with \nofficials, including the Prime Minister of Australia, and talked about \nwhat has been commonly referred to as the Asian flu, the financial \ncrisis in the Pacific rim--the complete, or almost complete collapse of \nfinancial conditions in four countries: Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand \nand South Korea. And then we talked a little bit about the financial \nsituation that Japan finds herself in, not being able to ride to the \nrescue of her neighbors in the rim. At that time, there was a consensus \nthat maybe those countries that found themselves in financial \ndifficulty would not impact the GDP of Australia, and little was \nregarded here in this country. I thought at the time that you cannot \nlet the economies in four major importing countries of agricultural \nproducts cave in and it not affect this country. Sadly, I was correct.\n\n  So our exports to that part of the world have gone to zero. Now we \ncome along with sanctions. Let me tell you a little bit about \nsanctions. I have never been convinced that sanctions on food really \nwork. I will tell you in an instant that if we unilaterally sanction a \ncountry on American agricultural exports, here is what happens: That \ncountry is still capable of buying a supply from somebody else in the \nworld. But the market knows of these sanctions; therefore, the rest of \nthe world maybe puts 1 or 2 cents a bushel on wheat. Now, 1 or 2 cents \ndoesn't sound like a lot for a bushel of wheat that weighs 60 pounds. \nThat is in a short ton anyway. But when you are buying 300,000 metric \ntons, it is a lot of money. Even to a farmer, it is the difference \nbetween making the land payment this year and not making the land \npayment--that 2 cents a bushel.\n  Once that sale is made to the country that we have had sanctions on, \nthen the country that did the selling pours the rest of their crop on \nthe world market. So what do we do and what do our farmers do? They \ncompete at a lower level. That is not right. It hasn't worked, as far \nas denying the country that had the sanctions on it. It didn't deny \nthem of food supply for the people who live there. But it has denied \nour farmers entry into the marketplace, a place to compete.\n  To give you an idea, in the last 4 years the United States has \nimposed 61 unilateral economic sanctions on 35 countries containing 40 \npercent of the world's population. Now, what does that country do when \nthat sanction is placed? It retaliates: I am not going to buy American \nproducts at any price. I am not going to do that.\n  So, in essence, we have denied our grain producers access to that \nmarket to even be considered to compete. I realize that we are talking \nabout food here. I realize that to some folks that is not very \nimportant--until it comes suppertime. But to a farmer who only gets one \nor two paychecks a year, that is how he makes his payment on his \noperation, his fertilizer, his machinery, his land payment. It \ncontributes to his schools, his community, his church. But under the \nconditions right now, they cannot do this.\n  So I ask my colleagues to strongly support this amendment. Yes, I \nknow there are far-reaching implications of sanctions and, yes, there \nare folks who really understand that maybe national security may be at \nstake.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield to the Senator from Montana an additional \nminute.\n  Mr. BURNS. Thank you. Mr. President, you tell me where they have \nworked when it comes to the supply of food. That is the very basic of \nall of our necessities every day. The Senator from Idaho is exactly \nright. We have developed export markets by using two methods--it is \nquality, it is quantity, and it is reliability. We are a reliable \ncustomer, and to deny our producers--and you can go all over the world. \nOur producers compete on an individual basis. We don't pool our wheat \nlike Canada. We don't sell wheat on the international market by a \ndecision made by Government. We do it by individual producers who want \nto sell their crop at a given time. Given the proper tools of risk \nmanagement, they could take advantage of the international market.\n  I urge support of this amendment. I thank my friend from Kentucky for \nchampioning it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from \nOregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before I begin, I want to express my \nappreciation to the Senator from Delaware, who spent about 2\\1/2\\ hours \nwith a group of us this morning, working to make sure that this \nlegislation got to the floor today. I also want to thank our colleague \nfrom Kentucky, Senator McConnell, who was equally helpful in our effort \nto make sure that this bipartisan legislative effort didn't blow up at \nthe last minute. I want to assure my colleagues that it was very close \nto going by the boards this morning.\n  Mr. President, the wheat farmers of the Pacific Northwest are 6 days \naway from a disaster. On July 15, Pakistan is going to initiate a \nprocess to purchase 350,000 metric tons of white wheat for August 1 to \n20 shipment. Without access to the Government credit guarantees that we \nare talking about here, U.S. producers are not going to sell a kernel \nof wheat to Pakistan. The USDA estimates that Pakistan is going to \nimport just under a million metric tons this year. Now, our prices are \nat a low. This year's crop is going to be one of the best ever. But the \nfact is, farmers across this country are staring an economic train \nwreck in the eye. We have a storage and transportation bottleneck with \nthe imminent wheat harvest. We have a fair amount of the old crop still \nin the bins. We are facing the prospect of storing a great deal of \nwheat on the ground this year. Making a sale to Pakistan in the key \nAugust shipping period would be an enormous help in dealing with these \nlogistical challenges. A sale might mean the difference between two or \nthree turns of a river barge fleet versus only one turn in August.\n\n  Let me touch briefly on what it means to just one county, Umatilla, \nwhich I am very pleased that my colleague, Senator Smith, who has \nworked so effectively with all of us on a bipartisan basis, calls home, \nand wheat growers there produce nearly one-third of all the wheat \nproduced in our State. The economy of that county depends on both the \ndirect sales of wheat and on all of the related jobs through suppliers, \nequipment, fertilizers, warehousing, shipping, and all of the economic \nbase of our regional economy.\n  The fact is, Mr. President, and colleagues, unilateral sanctions \nsimply do not work. They end up inflicting harm on U.S. producers and \nshippers. They don't target those specific leaders who are engaged in \nthe most reprehensible activity. They hand market share to our \ncompetitors and then put the typical citizen in these countries in a \nposition where they will not be able to secure the humanitarian help \nthey need to survive. Each of these outcomes is not, obviously, a \ngrowth of U.S. foreign policy.\n  I am of the view that we do a lot of things well in our country. But \nI think what we do best is we grow things, and, at a critical time when \nwe are seeing the United States in a position to play this leadership \nrole in the global economy, it would be a tragedy to make the mistake \nof not passing this legislation, which, as far as I can tell, has kept \nabout 15 Members of the U.S. Senate on the floor simply to speak for \nhow important this legislation is.\n  We are, in the Pacific Northwest, 6 days away from a disaster. So it \nis critical now at the 11th hour that this legislation pass.\n  I am pleased to have been a part of this bipartisan group that has \nworked on this legislation over the last few weeks.\n  Again, I want to express my thanks to Senator McConnell of Kentucky, \nand Senator Biden, for their patience through that 2\\1/2\\-hour exercise \nthis morning that had Sandy Berger of the White House and others \ninvolved, because had not Senator McConnell and Senator Biden been so \npatient this morning, we might not have this bipartisan legislation on \nthe floor this afternoon, and our wheat farmers would not have had the \nhelp they need.\n\n[[Page S7801]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, thank you.\n  I wish to first congratulate the bipartisan leadership in this body, \nthe leadership of our two leaders, Senator Lott and Senator Daschle, \nfor addressing this issue and addressing the more encompassing issue of \nsanctions in total.\n  I want to also thank my friends and colleagues, Senators Biden and \nMcConnell, for their active leadership on this issue.\n  This is a strong first step. We need a comprehensive trade package, a \ncomprehensive package we will talk about and address. Yes, sanctions; \nsanction reviews--a number of my colleagues and I have worked on this \nissue for the last year. We have legislation pending. Senator Lugar has \nbeen a leader in this area. We need to address the IMF issue as a \nCongress. We will be addressing MFN status with China and fast track. \nBut a complete package.\n  This is a strong first step. This is the beginning of the larger \ndebate that this Congress will have and must have about the role of the \nUnited States in the world and how we intend to engage the world, and \ntrade is a very important part of that.\n  Our relationships with other nations must not be held captive to one \nissue. But our relationships with other nations are complicated. They \ninclude trade, of course, commerce. They include U.S. interests abroad, \nnational defense, and human rights. But we must not allow one dynamic \nof our relationship with all our other nations on this globe to be held \ncaptive to just one issue.\n  History has shown, Mr. President, that trade and commerce engagement \nin reaching out does more to change attitudes and alter behavior than \nany one thing. Why? It improves diets; it improves standards of living; \nit opens society; it exposes people who have lived under totalitarian \nrule, who have had limited exposure to freedom, to liberty, to economic \nfreedom, products, choice, consumerism. That is what trade does. Not \none among us believes that just trade alone is all we need. But it is \nan important, integral part of our relationships around the world.\n  We live in a very dynamic time. The light of change today in the \nworld is unprecedented in modern history, and maybe all of history. \nThat change is spherical. It is moving. It touches every life in every \nway. Food, fiber, housing, and trade are common denominators of mutual \ninterests of all the peoples of the world.\n  We must not isolate ourselves. Unilateral sanctions isolate those who \nimpose unilateral sanctions. We need dynamic policies for dynamic \ntimes. The world is not static.\n  This is a good beginning. This is a significant beginning. Our \nleadership in this body has seized the moment at a critical time as we \nhave witnessed our President in China for 9 days dealing with many of \nthese issues. We know we have far to go in all dynamics with respect to \nour relationships with China, Pakistan, with India, all nations. But \ntrade and commerce will play a vital role in building those \nrelationships, enhancing the freedoms and liberties of people \nthroughout the globe. We in the United States must play a full, dynamic \nleadership role in that process.\n  Mr. President, I am very proud to join my friends and colleagues who \nhave worked on this diligently, who will continue to provide \nleadership, not just to this body but to the country, to the world, and \nto our farmers and our ranchers, our producers, and our citizens. We \nare all interconnected. We do live in a global village underpinned by a \nglobal economy.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to vote for this very important \namendment. Again, I say to my colleagues that this is an engagement we \nmust all be part of.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I have not spoken. I am not going to take much time \nbecause Senators whose States which have very, very important interests \nin passage of this bill should be given time.\n  I would like to begin by thanking Senator Murray. She has been the \nspearhead of this effort. I, quite frankly, wish we had done something \nbroader. The Senator from Kentucky and I thought we had worked out \nsomething more along the lines that my friend from Nebraska was just \ntalking about, a broader approach to dealing with not just merely \nagriculture, which is obviously very important, but I just say to my \ncolleagues, hopefully the Senator from Kentucky and I will be back on \nthe floor in the not-too-distant future with a proposal for a more \nrational policy relating to sanctions generally, not just as they \nrelate to Pakistan and not just as they relate to agriculture.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join the Senator from Kentucky in \npresenting this legislation.\n  As our colleagues know, just before the Fourth of July recess, the \nmajority and minority leaders formed a bipartisan Task Force on \nSanctions Policy. The Senator from Kentucky was named the chairman, the \nSenator from Delaware the co-chairman.\n  The task force was given two tasks; first, to make recommendations to \nthe Senate leadership, by July 15, related to the existing sanctions \nagainst India and Pakistan. And second, to make recommendations, by \nSeptember 1, on sanctions policy generally.\n  These are tight deadlines, but with the support of the leadership, \nthe chairman and I are determined to try to meet them.\n  The situation with regard to Pakistan and India is our first \nchallenge.\n  Two months ago, the security situation in South Asia changed, and \nchanged utterly, to borrow a phrase from Yeats. The explosion of \nnuclear devices, first by India, then by Pakistan, brought two nations \ninto the so-called club of countries which acknowledge that the possess \nnuclear weapons.\n  The testing by both countries was promptly--and properly--condemned \nby the United States and the international community. But the United \nStates went further than most countries, because under the Glenn \namendment, enacted in 1994, the President was required to impose \nsanctions on both governments.\n  The sanctions imposed by the Glenn amendment are as severe as they \nare sweeping.\n  They require the termination of all assistance under the Foreign \nAssistance Act--with certain exceptions such as narcotics assistance \nand humanitarian aid--the termination of all military sales and \nfinancing, the termination of all licenses for the exports of items on \nthe U.S. Munitions List, and the termination of all credits or credit \nguarantees provided by the U.S. government.\n  Additionally, the law requires the United States to oppose the \nextension of loans by international financial institutions like the \nWorld Bank, and requires the U.S. government to prohibit private U.S. \nbanks from making loans or credits for the purpose of purchasing food \nor other agricultural commodities.\n  The Glenn amendment provides little flexibility. Once imposed, there \nis no authority for the President to waive the law. His hands are \ncompletely tied.\n  I voted for the Glenn amendment in 1994, which was part of the State \nDepartment Authorization Act that year. But when viewed in the context \nof Pakistan's and India's decision to test, I have to conclude that \nwhile our approach worked for many years, it is no longer working. It \ndidn't stop them from testing, and the lack of flexibility in the law \nprovides little incentive for India and Pakistan to take positive steps \nnow.\n  All this is not to suggest that sanctions should never be applied. I \nhave voted for many sanctions laws in the past, and even authored a \nfew. In this instance, sanctions were clearly appropriate, both as a \nstrong condemnation of the governments in Delhi and Islamabad and to \ndeter other countries which might seek a nuclear weapon.\n  What I am second-guessing is the decision of Congress not to provide \nmore flexibility to the President.\n  I am a strong defender of congressional power, and I believe Congress \nis\n\n[[Page S7802]]\n\nwell within its constitutional authority to impose sanctions for \nforeign policy reasons. But the President is charged with the conduct \nof diplomacy. And any statute which provides little or no discretion \nfor the President necessarily interferes with his ability to perform \nthat task.\n  The task in this case is already difficult enough: the President \nfaces the considerable challenge of convincing the two governments to \nconstrain their nuclear weapons programs and avoid further escalation \nof tensions in the region. The inflexibility in the Glenn amendment \ndeprives the President of tools that he might use to advance these \nobjectives.\n  In imposing sanctions, we must also pause before applying sanctions \nunilaterally.\n  The weight of the historical evidence suggests that we are more \nlikely to advance our objectives if we can gain the cooperation of our \nmajor allies. Moreover, unilateral sanctions may impose a greater cost \non our economic interests than they do on the targeted country.\n  In the case of India and Pakistan, we are therefore faced with two \nquestions: should we reconsider some of the unilateral sanctions set \nforth in the Glenn amendment?\n  And should we give the President some flexibility in order to advance \nhis diplomatic objectives in the region?\n  I answer both questions in the affirmative and, I believe, so does \nthe chairman.\n  However, the bill we are now considering is limited only to removing \none unilateral sanction:\n  The bill before us would provide a permanent exemption under the \nGlenn amendment for U.S. government credits to support the purchase of \nfood or other agriculture commodities.\n  This provision is identical to the provision sponsored by Senators \nMurray and Gorton which was added to the Agriculture appropriations \nbill during its consideration by the Committee on Appropriations.\n  The exemption for Commodity Credit Corporation--or CCC credits--is \nconsistent with the approach of the Glenn amendment, which permits \nloans by private banks for the purchase of food and other agricultural \ncommodities.\n  This matter is of some urgency, because there is an important sale \noffer to be made by Pakistan in the coming days.\n  Wheat farmers in the Pacific Northwest provide a significant portion \nof Parkistan's wheat market, and they rightly fear that they could lose \nthat market if the CCC credits are not available.\n  I have long believed that we should not force U.S. farmers to bear \nthe burden of foreign policy sanctions, so I am pleased to support this \nmeasure.\n  But I remain hopeful that in the coming weeks, we can devise a means \nto provide the President flexibility with the remaining sanctions now \nin place against india and Pakistan.\n  I do not mean to suggest that we should repeal these sanctions.\n  At this stage, just a few weeks after the nuclear tests in the \nregion, and with the President's diplomatic efforts still at an early \nstage, it is premature to contemplate a complete repeal or blanket \nwaiver of the provisions in the Glenn amendment.\n  But we should attempt, before we adjourn for the year, to give the \nPresident some latitude in order to assist his efforts to negotiate \nwith the two countries.\n  We should not underestimate the enormity of the task before the \nPresident.\n  Helping to construct a new security framework in South Asia may take \nconsiderable time, given the complexity of the situation and the deep-\nseated antagonism between the countries of the region. I hope that our \ncolleagues will give the administration the support that it needs in \nthe months ahead.\n  In closing, I would like to thank the chairman of the task force, \nSenator McConnell, for his gracious acceptance of the job and for \nhelping point us in this direction. I would also like to thank the \nmajority and minority leaders for their confidence in selecting us to \nlead the task force, and for their support for this initial \nlegislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, with the permission of my friend, may I yield now, \neven though it will be two Democrats in a row, to my friend from North \nDakota, Mr. Dorgan, for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware. I am \npleased to speak in support of this legislation. I will ask unanimous \nconsent to be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was pleased to be a cosponsor of this \nparticular proposal when it was offered by Senator Murray in the Senate \nAppropriations Committee. I know that Senator Murray offered it on \nbehalf of herself and Senator Roberts from Kansas, and I was pleased \nthen to cosponsor it. It is the right thing to do. I must say, however, \nit is inching along in the right direction. This is not taking giant \nsteps today. It is inching along in the right direction.\n  The question of sanctions, especially sanctions in international \ntrade that say to the American farmer, you bear the entire cost of \nsanctions that we impose for foreign policy reasons; we are upset with \nCuba so let's cut Cuba off so they can't get any grain. We are upset \nwith Iran, Iraq, Libya, let's cut them off so they can't buy grain--10 \npercent of the world's wheat market is off limits to American farmers \nbecause, for foreign policy purposes, this country has decided that is \nwhat ought to be done. I fundamentally disagree with that.\n  Hubert Humphrey used to say send them anything they can't shoot back. \nTranslated, he meant we ought not cut off food shipments around the \nworld. I don't think we ought to cut off food shipments. All that does \nis hurt the poor people and hungry people around the world. But the \nfact is we do have sanctions in place, and I think in addition to a \npiece of legislation today that says with respect to the sanctions now \ndealing with Pakistan and India, that it will not include GSM credits, \nwhich therefore would then facilitate the flow of grain from the \nNorthwest in this case. That is a step in the right direction, albeit a \nsmall one.\n  We don't ship grain to Pakistan. They are going to make these \npurchases largely from the Northwest. But farmers are farmers, and the \nwheat market is the wheat market.\n  The fact is the Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, described very \nwell the crisis that exists in farm country today. Wheat farmers in \nthis country have seen wheat prices on the international marketplace, \non the national markets collapse, just drop to the cellar.\n  In my State, we not only have just rock-bottom wheat prices, we have \nthe worst crop disease in a full century. It is called fusarium head \nblight. We call it scab. It has devastated the crops. So a farmer takes \nall the risks. They plant the seed, hope it will grow, hope insects \ndon't come, hope it doesn't get destroyed by hail, hope it doesn't rain \ntoo much, hope it rains enough. Finally, all of those things are OK. \nThey hope they raise a crop, and when they raise a crop they hope it \nisn't devastated by disease. They take the grain to the elevator in \ntheir 2-ton truck and discover they get $2 a bushel less than it cost \nthem to raise it. And they go out of business hand over fist. We have \nso many auction sales right now they are calling auctioneers out of \nretirement to handle them.\n  We have a huge problem. We have to deal with the underlying farm \nbill. I know some people think it is working just fine. Gee, this is \njust great. It is not just great. It is not working just fine. We are \npulling the rug out from family farmers in price support and calling it \nfreedom to farm. It is like taking the minimum wage to a dollar an hour \nand calling it freedom to work. It doesn't make any sense.\n  We need to deal with the underlying problem. We need to deal with the \nlarger trade problems. We can't get wheat to China. Japan isn't buying \nenough beef. We have had a flood of unfairly subsidized imports come in \nin durum and spring wheat and barley from Canada. We have a whole range \nof problems.\n  This bill deals with one small issue that is urgent and must be dealt \nwith now. It deals with, in GSM, credit issues that will allow us to \nship wheat to Pakistan and India. I support that. But we have a lot \nmore to do. We ought to decide as a Congress right now that\n\n[[Page S7803]]\n\nsanctions will not include food shipments, period. Let's get that 10 \npercent of the world wheat market back for American farmers.\n  Second, we ought to decide if there are those who insist that \nsanctions include food shipments from American farmers to overseas \nmarkets, then farmers ought to be reimbursed for the cost and the loss. \nWhy should farmers be told, here is our new foreign policy and you pay \nthe price. You bear the cost. Why should farmers be sent that bill and \ntold to pay up. If it is our belief that the best foreign policy is to \nshut off food shipments through sanctions to some part of the world, \nwhy not as a part of our foreign policy through the State Department or \npart of our defense policy through the Defense Department, why not \nreimburse family farmers who are told now they bear the entire cost of \nthose sanctions.\n  So I stand today to say again I appreciate this legislation. Senator \nMurray and Senator Roberts initiated it, at least on the Senate side, \nand I was pleased the day that Senator Murray introduced it on behalf \nof her and Senator Roberts. I am pleased to be a cosponsor. It is the \nright thing to do right now. But there is much, much, much more to do \nif we are going to address in a real and significant way the farm \ncrisis.\n  This is as tough as I have ever seen it in rural America. I am not \ngoing to go further talking about the farm problem and the trade \nproblem because they are abiding and tough and difficult, and we must \nget about the business of dealing with it. And I expect that in the \ncoming couple of weeks we are going to have a big discussion. I know \nsome people don't have farmers in their areas; they don't have to deal \nwith farm problems every day. I think it is an opportunity to deal with \nfarm problems. Family farmers are the roots of our society. Family \nvalues originate on the family farm and they nurture small towns and \nbig cities in this country and always have.\n  I am pleased to represent a State of family farmers, and I think it \nis interesting to see people who wouldn't know a razorback hog from a \npickup truck tell us here in Washington, DC, all about the theory of \nfamily farming. The fact is family farmers don't live on theory. They \nrisk everything they have to try to raise a crop and hope when they \nhave raised a crop to be able to sell it to make a decent living. Today \nthe sad answer is this economy doesn't produce that because we have a \nwhole series of problems, one of which, a small one, is addressed by \nthis bill, and that is the potential cutoff of a foreign market for \nwestern wheat. This bill addresses it, and I am pleased to be a \ncosponsor. But I hope in the coming weeks we will do much, much, much \nmore to address the crisis faced by family farmers.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nKansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. President, first let me pay a sincere thanks to Senator McConnell \nand Senator Biden, and both Republican and Democratic leaders, and to \nall of my colleagues who have addressed this most important issue for \ntheir help and support. I do really appreciate the opportunity to speak \nin behalf of what I consider to be a truly emergency agriculture export \nrelief bill.\n  If we move, if we pass this bill, our U.S. wheat producers may, and I \nemphasize may, be able to sell Pakistan almost 14 million bushels of \nwheat. Now, that means about $40 million in the pockets of American \nwheat farmers instead of $40 million in the pockets of our competitors, \nnot to mention the poor people in Pakistan who are suffering from \nmalnutrition and hunger in regards to a very needed commodity.\n  The deadline for the wheat tender or sale is July 15. That is next \nweek. That is why this is an emergency. That is why the decks are \ncleared. That is why this legislation is hotlined. Now, if the Congress \ndelays, in this body or in the House, it will be a $40 million delay at \nthe expense of U.S. agriculture. This bill simply exempts the GSM \nexport credit program from the mandated sanctions now imposed upon \nPakistan.\n  Let's take a look at a list of the positive things that will happen \nwhen and if the GSM credits are made available.\n  First, armed with the credits and facing desperate, desperate \neconomic straits, Pakistan may well buy the wheat from these United \nStates as opposed to our competitors.\n  Second, as a result of sale, the wheat market will gain strength, as \nwill price recovery, especially in the northwestern part of the United \nStates.\n  Third, lost U.S. market share due to the sanctions hopefully will be \nregained, but most important the passage of this legislation will send \nan immediate strong signal to the world trade community that the U.S. \nwill compete aggressively, aggressively for export markets, and that \nthe Congress is taking steps, finally taking steps, as the Senator from \nNebraska has indicated, to correct the current drift in our trade \npolicy. And, yes, it has great implications in regard to farm program \npolicy. I am not going to go into that as of this afternoon, but it \ndoes have great implication.\n  Mr. President, Pakistan is expected to tender for wheat again in a \nfew months, not just next week. So, with our export credit program \nfreed from sanction chains, why, U.S. producers may win that sale as \nwell. I might add again, time is of the essence. Our harvest is just \nconcluded or is in the process of concluding. Now is the time when our \nU.S. wheat is the most competitive. If we don't sell the wheat now, the \nadvantage will fall to our competitors.\n  I am pleased this legislation basically encompasses the legislation \nthat Senator Gorton, Senator Murray, myself, and others introduced when \nwe first heard of the sanctions some weeks ago. I also note the \npresence of the distinguished chairman of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee. He has a very comprehensive sanctions reform bill that looks \nahead. I see Senator Hagel is still on the floor, and Senator Biden. I \nhave joined them in introducing a bill to take a look back in regard to \nthe 115 sanctions that we have now imposed on 75 percent of the world's \npopulation. And we have other bills as well. So, I am very pleased to \ntake part in that effort.\n  That is the good news. But I feel compelled to warn my colleagues, \nhowever, that I believe there is some bad news, with potentially more \nto come. This bill as originally proposed by the bipartisan task force \non sanctions, ably led by Senators McConnell and Biden, took one \nimportant step for agriculture, and I think a bigger step towards \nmeaningful sanctions reform as it pertains to our national security and \nour foreign and our trade policy. It represented, in my view, the first \nstep in providing the President, any President, and his national \nsecurity team and his foreign policy team, the real-world flexibility \nto deal with the proliferation and testing of nuclear weapons.\n  The obvious case in point, and the reason we are here, is the \nsituation in Pakistan and India. More than a month ago, Secretary of \nState Albright told Members of this body, in a briefing, that she \nneeded a full arsenal of diplomatic tools to help both coerce and \npossibly positively influence India and Pakistan to cease any further \ntesting and to discuss some kind of mutual strategy for improved \nrelations between the two countries. I would add at this point, my \ncolleague and the senior Senator from Kansas, Senator Brownback, and \nSenator Robb from Virginia, have been to India and Pakistan and have \ntaken a hard look at that situation.\n  As I recall Secretary Albright's words, she wanted the flexibility to \nuse carrots and sticks instead of a sledgehammer. I think that is \npretty graphic.\n  Let me stress, too, that the actions of India and Pakistan were most \nserious and dangerous. No way did this bill or the original and more \ncomprehensive bill really condone the aggressive and dangerous actions \nof India and Pakistan. That is not the case. It should go without \nsaying that our national and international security is the foremost \nconcern of everyone in this body, and the President, and, yes, farmers \nand ranchers, and, yes, everybody in the business community. It is this \nSenator's foremost concern.\n  The United States cannot countenance the proliferation and testing of \nany weapons of mass destruction. We must continue to evaluate and \nimprove\n\n[[Page S7804]]\n\nour joint effort with our allies to achieve these mutual goals. But, in \nthe doing of this, I say to my friends, there is a right way and there \nis a wrong way.\n  Unfortunately, the best of policies years ago may not serve our best \ninterests as of today. Those who passed legislation 4 years ago could \nnot know--we cannot know--how the world would look in 1998 or 4 years \ndown the road. But as a result of mandatory sanction legislation passed \nin 1994, the executive has little--little, if any--any flexibility to \ndeal with the extremely sensitive issue of India and Pakistan.\n  These sanctions are now in place. We have stopped all loans from \ninternational lending institutions, all credit programs. India, which \nis not dependent on World Bank financing, has largely been--somewhat--\nhas been unaffected by the sanctions. But Pakistan is in serious \njeopardy of default. How can this serve peace and cooperation?\n  Under the law of unintended effects, mandatory U.S. sanctions may \nwell increase the suffering in Pakistan, it may well promote further \nextremism, serve no useful purpose--I might add in farm language, the \ntesting cow is already out of the nuclear barn--and increase the \nlikelihood of war in south Asia. And, in the process, since the United \nStates alone has imposed sanctions, our trade competitors are first in \nline to seize our U.S. markets.\n  In the original bill introduced by Senators McConnell and Biden, and \nsupported by the great majority of the Senate, we fixed that problem. \nStep two of the bill would have granted the executive the full \nauthority to impose none, some, or all of the sanctions in the Arms \nControl Act. It also gave the President authority to lift some or all \nof the sanctions when appropriate. In other words, the original bill \nprovided an ``as you were, 9-month cooling off period,'' and gave to \nSecretary Albright the tools she requested to see if we could not \nachieve some progress in south Asia.\n  However, due to the concerns of several Senators--and I do not \nquestion their intent, their concern--it will not be possible to enact \nthis more comprehensive bill. But as I said, in terms of the warning I \nsaid earlier--here is the warning: My friends, we are passing a very \nnarrow and limited sanctions reform bill that applies to agriculture \nonly, due to the Pakistani wheat tender and problems in farm country \nand our trade policy and our export policy. But I must warn you, when \nyou deal with sanctions, they become overall embargoes. We saw that in \n1980, with the infamous embargo imposed by President Carter. It ended \nup for 10 years like shattered glass and we had a terrible time putting \nit back together in regard to contract sanctity for U.S. agriculture.\n  If our competitors offer the same credit arrangements, and Pakistan \nhas a choice, who do you think they are going to buy from as long as we \ncontinue the overall sanctions? In farm country language, you sanction \na country and they get their nose out of joint.\n  The danger is this: Without section 3, which we originally had in the \nbill, we are also endangering the agricultural segment. It could \nhappen. I hope it doesn't, but it could happen. As a matter of fact, I \nthink a policy of ``we will continue to sanction a whole lot of this \nbut we will sell you some of that only if it suits us'' does not do \nanything for a comprehensive and a clear trade policy.\n  I have already pointed out that in national security terms the \ncurrent policy is counterproductive. Let me spell out some economic \nconsequences in striking section 3.\n  Prior to the imposition of sanctions, the United States accounted for \n25 percent of India's international trade. That is remarkable, \nconsidering all the miles in between our country and theirs. Also, I \nsay, Senator Brownback just went all the way over and all the way back \nto try to get an update on this. It has been truly extraordinary. The \nsanctions are now, however, estimated to cost India and Pakistan $4 \nbillion in international bank loans. The Boeing aircraft company stands \nto lose up to $6 billion over several years in business with 30 \nairplanes that cannot now be delivered. Enron is building a huge power \nplant in western India, essential to raise the standard of living of \nIndia's near billion population. A foreign competitor could, in fact, \nactually take over that project. And $21 million in economic \ndevelopment and housing assistance and $6 million to combat greenhouse \ngases in India have been terminated.\n  Now, if there was any evidence, some evidence, a shred of evidence, \nthat stopping this business activity or assistance would somehow result \nin Pakistan and India agreeing on a test plan and resolving their \ndifferences, I would gladly support sanctions. I would gladly do that. \nIf there is any evidence that trade and foreign policy dominated by \ntrade sanctions would have any practical or positive effect, I would \nsupport sanctions. In some rare cases they may be effective. In this \ncase, I think they are making things much worse.\n  I think we have made a mistake in striking section 3 of this bill. In \ndoing so, we have put grain sale to Pakistan at risk. I hope that is \nnot the case. I am still optimistic. We continue to send signals that \nout of date and counterproductive sanctions are still the order of the \nday.\n  I full well realize, and I respect, the concerns in regard to \nauthorship, jurisdiction, and the agreed-upon goal of a sanctions task \nforce and the committees of jurisdiction achieving meaningful and \ncomprehensive sanction reform. I understand that. I am part of the \nsanctions task force. That is going to take a considerable amount of \ntime. It probably should, in terms of comprehensive reform. And, as a \nmember of the task force, I look forward to working with my colleagues. \nBut, Mr. President, in the doing of this, and in striking section 3, if \nwe limp to the meetings it will be because, by delay in striking \nsection 3 from this bill, we will have continued to shoot ourselves in \nthe foot.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from South \nDakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from South \nDakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from Delaware, \nSenator Biden, and the Senator from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, for \ntheir work in helping expedite consideration of this very urgent \nlegislation; also, a special commendation to my colleague, Senator \nPatty Murray of Washington State, for her extraordinary leadership on \nthis legislation, as well as to Senator Roberts from Kansas.\n  Over 10 percent of the world's wheat market is currently boxed out to \nour country's wheat farmers due to the current economic sanctions. The \nsituation of wheat becomes all the more urgent as we consider sanctions \nagainst Pakistan and India, Pakistan being our third largest importer \nof wheat, at a time when wheat prices have fallen to less than $3 a \nbushel.\n  I have to say, however, that our effort to address this issue today \nneeds to be regarded, I think, as part of a much larger effort to \nrevisit the entire matter of sanctions imposed by the United States, as \nwell as taking a look at other protrade mechanisms available to us.\n  In my view, it is inexcusable that the 105th Congress has not moved \nfull funding of the International Monetary Fund, the IMF, and fast \ntrack continues to languish. I look forward to working with Senator \nLugar and others who are looking at comprehensive reform of our entire \nsanctions regime.\n  The fact is, Mr. President, that the United States has slapped \neconomic sanctions on other countries about 120 times in the past 80 \nyears, but over half of those instances have been since the Clinton \nadministration came to power. This month, it is India and Pakistan, but \nno other country on Earth opts for sanctions as often as has the United \nStates. Currently, our sanctions imposed by our Government affect more \nthan 70 nations in one form or another, home to two-thirds of the \nworld's population. What is worse is that this 105th Congress is \nconsidering, as we speak today, an additional 30 sanctions in other \npieces of legislation.\n  Frankly, it is often an emotional and short-term political \ncalculation which drives these sanctions, rather than a longer term, \nreasoned, logical explanation of what kind of cost benefit would derive \nand what kind of diplomatic leverage actually is derived from the \nsanctions.\n  It vents more outrage, but more often than not backfires, \nparticularly\n\n[[Page S7805]]\n\nin the case of food items, particularly in the case of grain where \nother nations have an opportunity to grow and to take our markets.\n  It is America all too often, rather than the target nations, that \nbecomes isolated and that becomes victims of our own sanctions. When \nother nations refuse to join with our sanctions, American business \nsuffers. In 1995 alone, unilateral sanctions cost the U.S. economy an \nestimated $15 billion to $19 billion and up to 260,000 jobs, according \nto the Institute for International Economics. Sanctions beyond that \nalso give American suppliers a reputation for unreliability and its \neffects can be long lasting.\n  There are instances where sanctions, to some degree, have been \neffective. South Africa comes to mind. Some aspects or sanctions \nagainst Iraq come to mind relative to chemical, biological and nuclear \nweapons. But the successes we have had with sanctions in the United \nStates, I think, points to a general rule, and that is, to be \neffective, sanctions must have broad international support and must \ntarget specific vulnerabilities.\n  We need to be examining more alternatives to sanctions, whether \nagricultural or otherwise. The engagement with other nations, rather \nthan isolation, is one that I think is coming upon this Congress and \ncertainly this administration as a direction that we need to pursue.\n  I am pleased that the Clinton Administration has organized a special \nState Department team installed to rethink our overall sanctions \npolicy. The premise, I think, of our policy as we move in this \ndirection--first with this bill and then, hopefully, with broader, more \nfar-reaching sanctions legislation--is that it is multilateral \nsanctions, even if they are weaker in nature, that are usually \npreferable to unilateral sanctions. And secondly, any sanctions that we \ndo impose should be subject to a cost-benefit analysis. Incredibly, in \nthe past, few sanctions have been evaluated for their consequence on \nthe American economy relative to what it does to the target nations.\n  The focus, I believe, needs to be on a much more reasoned approach to \nsanctions in general. This is a good first step in the right direction. \nIt is urgent because of the Pakistani offer to purchase 350,000 net \ntons of wheat as of July 15, and we have this urgency now. But I \nsupport this legislation, and I ask unanimous consent to be listed as a \ncosponsor and yield back what time I may have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nKansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I thank very much \nthe Senator from Kentucky. I, too, ask that I be added as a cosponsor \nof this bill.\n  I applaud the leadership of Senator McConnell, and the leadership of \nthe majority leader, Trent Lott, in moving this forward rapidly.\n  I think the number of people who have spoken on the floor about the \nissue of food and that it should never, ever be used as a political \nweapon or tool in foreign policy, speaks clearly with the mind of the \nSenate that it doesn't work. Food being used as a political tool or as \na tool of foreign policy should never, ever occur.\n  Hopefully, as we move forward on some reforms, that will be a point \nof agreement, something with which everybody agrees: Food is never, \never to be used. It only hurts the people and hurts our farmers in the \nUnited States. So I congratulate my colleagues.\n  I particularly recognize my colleague from Kansas who has been a \nleading proponent in agriculture and agricultural trade for many years \nin the Congress, now in the U.S. Senate. We need to move this \nlegislation, and we need to move it now.\n  Senator Robb and I just got back 10 days ago--actually less than \nthat, 7 days ago--from a trip to India and Pakistan. We met with the \nprime ministers of both countries. We met with the defense and foreign \npolicy leadership in both countries, and we saw areas that they want to \nengage with the United States, feel they have definite security needs--\nboth India and Pakistan --that they are responding to and are having \ndifficulty in understanding us throwing the book at them.\n  I think we need to work now, obviously, in lifting this particular \nsanction on food. It should not be in place, period, anyway. It should \nbe lifted rapidly, and I am glad to see the leadership doing that.\n  We next need to work on lifting the rest of the sanctions. We need to \ndo it, in my estimation, rapidly. Pakistan is in crisis. They have less \nthan 2 months foreign reserves of funds left to meet their debt loans. \nThey have lost half of the valuation of their stock market. We need to \ndo so rapidly.\n  We need to move forward in a way that reduces tension in the region, \nand this is a key point as well. We went to the line of control between \nPakistan and India, and tensions are high. At the time we were there, \n11 people were bombed and killed on the Pakistani side--just the time \nwe were there. We met with a number of villagers who had been wounded \nat some point in time in the last 6 to 12 months. They were showing us \nthe wounds they had. We have to act in a way that reduces tension. We \nhave to act in a way that re-engages the United States in the region.\n  I am convinced we can do all of these things. This is a good first \nstep. We have to further engage. I think we have to engage the United \nStates broadly in the region with India and Pakistan.\n  There were a number of concerns raised by India while we were there \nat the same time the President was in China, saying that they were \nreacting to perceived threats from China that they have stated publicly \nand they were saying to Senator Robb and myself as well.\n  On Monday, Senator Robb and I will be hosting a hearing in the \nForeign Relations subcommittee that deals with the Indian subcontinent \non the issue of how can we next move forward with lifting the remainder \nof these sanctions in a way that we can do so rapidly, that helps the \ncountries involved, that doesn't hurt unequally countries like Pakistan \nand India, that reduces tension in the region, and works rapidly to \nmove this issue forward. We need to do so.\n  I am delighted to see that we are dealing with this issue of food. We \ndo need to deal with the rest of the issues, particularly in the \neconomic areas. We do need to deal with the areas of reducing tension \nin the region. I am convinced we can do all of this. We need to be back \nup in front of this body quickly, again, with the steps we need to take \nto further engage the United States in lifting the sanctions in this \nregion.\n  I congratulate the leadership on moving this forward. I yield back \nthe remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield 13 minutes to the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, before I make the rest of my remarks, I want to say I \nsupport this legislation and will vote for it. I do want to bring up \nsome points, though, that have not been brought up here today. I \nsupport this. It is good legislation that extends the exemption for \nfood assistance already contained in the Glenn Amendment sanctions. \nThis has been worked out with the leadership. And it is basically the \nlanguage that Senator Murray brought out of committee, I believe. I \nthink it is identical language--or close to it. So I want to \ncongratulate her also on this. But let me put a different perspective \non sanctions than some of those that have been expressed here today.\n  The United States currently has in effect some 61 sanctions against \ndifferent nations around the world. They are not all involved in \nnuclear nonproliferation. We have sanctions involved with such things \nas drugs, as terrorism, human rights, sanctions against Cuba.\n  This legislation today does not address those. I do not think in some \nof these areas--for instance, on drugs, even if food was involved--we \nwould be lifting these sanctions. But the United States has wanted to \nprevent nuclear war. Ever since the case of Hiroshima\n\n[[Page S7806]]\n\nand Nagasaki, most responsible nations in the world have realized we \nneed to control the threat of nuclear holocaust by sometime, somehow, \nsome way reducing nuclear weapons.\n  While that remained a long-term objective, it would become even more \ndifficult if more and more nations developed a nuclear weapons \ncapability. It was with that longtime hope that legislation has been \npassed for more than 20 years--much of it my legislation; that is the \nreason I feel a special relationship or a special responsibility here \ntoday--for more than 20 years trying to stop the spread of nuclear \nweapons while at the same time holding out hope for eventual weapons \ncontrol and reduction.\n  For many years I felt this was a rather futile gesture. I did not \nfeel good about what we had done at all because we were not making much \nprogress. But finally the cold war demise brought new hope for really \ngaining control of nuclear weaponry, and in a comparatively short \nperiod of time there was real optimism that control over these weapons \ncould be gained.\n  With the end of the cold war and agreement with the Soviet Union, we \nsaw missiles suddenly being taken out of silos, weapons being taken \ndown, cores of fissile material being removed, and real progress was \nbeing made. The Lugar-Nunn--Nunn-Lugar--whichever way you want to say \nit--legislation gave some help in that direction. That has been a big \nmammoth help. And with U.S. leadership, we have achieved something we \nwould not have even thought possible a few years ago, 185 nations \nsigned the NPT, and progress is being made on the CTBT, the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which now has 149 signatories.\n  So it was against that backdrop of really making some progress that \nthe Glenn amendment was passed in 1994--which we are altering here \ntoday--with the belief that if we were even a little tougher than we \nhad been, that this would really discourage other nations from moving \ntoward nuclear weapons. That hope, of course, went down the drain when \nIndia's extreme Hindu nationalism took precedent over what most people \naround the world thought should have been more rational behavior. It \nwas against that backdrop we passed the legislation.\n  The sanctions passed in the 1994 legislation were meant to be tough \nand provided no Presidential waiver largely because of the very spotty \nperformance in nuclear nonproliferation in past administrations. I \nwould remind my colleagues today who are here decrying what has gone on \nhere that this bill passed unanimously in the U.S. Senate. Everyone \ncritical today--most of the people here were here in 1994. And so it \npassed unanimously in the U.S. Senate.\n  Some feel that sanctions are just no good in any respect. But \nsanctions or the threat of sanctions as one of our diplomatic tools, I \nbelieve, has been effective in the past in helping to turn off either \nactual or incipient nuclear and missile programs. And we can give as \nexamples Argentina and Brazil. Taiwan--I made a trip out there some \nyears ago when we knew what Taiwan was doing in heading toward possible \nnuclear capability. South Korea was also on that list, and South \nAfrica. And we may even have delayed some of Pakistan's access to the \nbomb which resulted in nuclear explosions.\n  What we do today here in the name of our own U.S. economy--I want \neveryone to realize what we are doing--what we are approving are U.S. \nloans, taxpayer dollars, to replace the money the Pakistanis spent on \ndeveloping nuclear weapons instead of on food for their own people.\n  I also say, does this bring them any closer--with what we are about \nto do today, will this result in or do we have any under-the-table or \ntacit agreement that they will go ahead and sign the NPT, that they \nwill sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty? We can say this is a \ncarrot hanging out there, but our carrots to Pakistan in the past have \nbeen rebuffed by one falsehood after another for the last 17 or 18 \nyears that I have been experiencing personally, including visits to \nPakistan to talk to their top people when they denied having any \nweapons or any weapons program, clear up until the time they set off \nthe bombs that they claimed they did not have all these years.\n  So my reaction to this is, yes, for humanitarian reasons, I certainly \ndo not want the Pakistani people themselves and little babies going \nhungry, and so on. So I am willing to go along with these humanitarian \nconcerns. But we do need definitely to rethink sanctions across the \nboard and what we mean by them.\n  As time has gone along, and the nations of the world are no longer \nbeing forced to choose between the United States and the Soviet Union, \nthe world really has become more multipolar in every respect, with \nbusiness, industry, banking, economics, and so on. And so the role of \nsanctions has changed along with that.\n  It has become increasingly evident through the years that the \nsanctions only become really effective if they have multilateral \nsupport, either from our major allies or preferably at the United \nNations. I believe sanctions still have a major role to play in \nnonproliferation and in our fight against drugs and terrorism and human \nrights abuses and the situation in Cuba, and so on. I do not think we \nhave to say all sanctions are bad, but they are only effective if they \nhave multilateral support.\n  Today we have economic arguments here because sanctions are going to \nhurt our own farmers in this country, and we may have some that will \naffect the manufacturing of jeeps out of Toledo, for instance, in my \nhome State of Ohio, as well as farming interests there.\n  So the world situation has changed, and we need, in each one of these \ncases, to consider the case on its own individual merits. In that \nregard, I have submitted legislation that was put in just before the \nlast break. The legislation would alter the way sanctions are \nadministered, and would be not only prospective but would be \nretrospective, also. And it would be basically this: At the time of an \nevent or a determination that triggers a sanction against a given \ncountry, the President could, at his discretion, place a hold on the \nimposition of the sanction for up to 45 calendar days to decide whether \nto remove or impose the sanction or to say, ``Here is a part that will \nwork; here is a part that will not work.'' Maybe the President would \nwant to say, ``None of it will work,'' so he wants to recommend that we \ndo away with that whole sanction for that particular country at that \ntime.\n  He would be completely flexible in what he could recommend, but he \nwould have 45 days to either build the multilateral support that I \nspoke about or come to the Congress and say to the Congress: Here is \nwhat I recommend in changing this sanction in this particular \nsituation. And then he would propose that to the Congress, and Congress \nwould have 15 session days to act under expedited procedures--15 days. \nWe would have a limit on what debate could occur, obviously. It would \nbe given preferential treatment here, and we would consider the \nPresident's purpose in this and require him to give us his reasons why \nhe wants to change this legislation, alter it, or how he thinks it \ncould be better administered. Congress would have 15 days to approve or \ndisapprove what the President had done. That gives the President \nultimate flexibility, it seems to me, and would be a great step \nforward.\n  For sanctions that are already in place, the President, on the \nanniversary of that sanction, would have to come back and say once \nagain to us why it is working, why it is not working, what changes he \nthinks should be made in the sanction. And he would do that at the 2-\nyear anniversary of the imposition of any sanction, and then would have \nto give us a report every year thereafter on that sanction as to \nwhether it was working or not working and recommend any changes to make \nit more effective.\n  I do not see any other way to make this whole thing work in the \nmultipolar world in which we live now. Sanctions 15 or 20 years ago may \nhave had more of a chance of an effect even though they were \nunilateral, but rarely in the situation we find ourselves in in the \nworld community today.\n  So while I am for this legislation today for humanitarian reasons, I \ndo not go along with some people who talk about poor little Pakistan \nand how they are in the situation that they have brought upon \nthemselves because they have deliberately misled us intentionally--one \nleader after another for\n\n[[Page S7807]]\n\nabout the last 15 or 16 years that I have been personally dealing with \nthis. But I do not want to see the Pakistani people go hungry or \nanything like that, and so I go along with this today.\n  It was mentioned a moment ago what a sad situation it was that we did \nnot include the other parts that were originally posed in this \nlegislation. If we had kept those proposals on this legislation, I can \nguarantee you I would probably have participated in my first filibuster \nin my 24 years in the U.S. Senate. I feel that strongly about it.\n  I do think we have played a good role in stopping the proliferation \nof nuclear weapons, and sanctions have helped--but if we take these off \ntoday as far as food sales go, maybe it will give us a lever; maybe it \nwill give Pakistan an incentive to sign the NPT, sign the comprehensive \ntest ban treaty, and hopefully that would encourage India.\n  There is nothing in here for India, so I don't know whether we are \nunbalancing this situation or not. I don't know what the administration \nmay have planned to sweeten the pie, sweeten the pot for India in this \nregard; also, to get them to move toward NPT and CTBT status.\n  Make no mistake, these are not just some international loans we are \napproving, these are U.S. loans we are approving to Pakistan and will \npass in the Senate. It still has to pass the House, obviously, and we \nhope this can get done in time to take place before the bidding starts \non the international sales, as I understand it, by the 15th.\n  I repeat, I think we need to rethink sanctions. The outline of what I \nhave proposed is in legislation now. It has been filed. I hope we can \nmove in that direction, because I think it would give the President the \nultimate flexibility he needs without dumping congressional \nresponsibility at the same time. It would mean whatever the President \nproposes with regard to sanctions we would have to consider on an \nexpedited, privileged basis. To me, this is the way we should be going \nin the future.\n  I know I am part of the task force that will indeed be looking at \nthese options between now and September 1 when we have to have them \nsubmitted for the U.S. Senate.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his time.\n  Mr. GLENN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nWashington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the time has come to pay the piper, and we \ndon't much like the price. For years we have been able to sing the \nsiren song of sanctions on the cheap. Whenever we are concerned about \nhuman rights--sanctions. If we are concerned about nuclear \nproliferation--sanctions. But I think almost always the magic of those \nsanctions has been that they don't go into effect when we make the \nspeeches on that subject on the floor; they may happen sometime later. \nAnd now they have happened.\n  All of us in this body and our predecessors are guilty of this song. \nBut now we learn what it really does. At a time in which farm prices, \nespecially in our wheat country and the Pacific Northwest, are already \ndeclining precipitously because of the financial crisis in east Asia, \nwe add to our own pain by creating a situation that will almost \ncertainly cause us to lose hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of \nsales in Pakistan to other countries that don't share our enthusiasm \nfor sanctions, unless we act in a period of time of less than 1 week.\n  Yes, this is an urgently needed bill, urgently needed for the farm \nsector of our community, urgently needed for our own ability to operate \nin a highly competitive world of agriculture. For that purpose, the \nwork of the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from Delaware and \neveryone else who has been a part of this is vitally important.\n  But the Senator from Ohio just said, gosh, this is unbalanced, it \ndoes something for Pakistan and it doesn't do anything for India. It \ndid something for India this morning, Mr. President. This morning it \ndid when it also allowed waivers with respect to the Export-Import \nBank, where last year we sold almost $400 million worth of aircraft \nfrom my State, with future similar sales greatly threatened by \nsanctions which now remain because the Senators from California and \nfrom Ohio wouldn't permit this bill to come up at all unless that was \ntaken out.\n  Of course we are going to support the bill in its present form, and \nof course we will support a task force, and what my seatmate here, the \ndistinguished Senator from Indiana, has been working on for months, to \nbring a more rational system of sanctions together. But we are finding \nthat the sanctions cost us more than they cost the Nations against whom \nthey are imposed, because you can buy wheat in parts of the world other \nthan the Pacific Northwest. Unfortunately, you can buy jet airliners \nfrom other sources than Seattle, WA. In fact, when you impose sanctions \non one thing on a country, you give that country an immense incentive \nto buy other things from other countries, as well as a form of \nresentment.\n  In this case, when the India nuclear tests were largely caused by our \npolicies with respect to China, and of course the Pakistani test by \nwhat happened in India, the sanctions are particularly bizarre.\n  The sanctions that we are in part removing today should be removed. \nBut they are an illustration of an even bigger fact--that we should \nhave done what this bill did this morning and does not do now; we \nshould be doing even more. So in that respect, the promise in this bill \nis dual: First, an opportunity, if we do get it all the way through and \nto the President, that we will save a vitally important part of our \nwheat sales; and, second, the illustration that we are only at the \nbeginning of deciding that maybe that song wasn't worth the price that \nwe are now paying the piper for. And that may be every bit as important \na part as the specific sections we are passing this afternoon, as \nimportant as they are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes, with the \npermission of the Senator from Delaware who stepped off the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, let me say that I think the debate this \nafternoon has been instructive, particularly with respect to the impact \nof sanctions, because we are acknowledging, perhaps for the first time \nin a forum and debate like this, the fact that sanctions clearly have \nlimitations and all too often the target of the sanctions ends up being \nless impacted by the sanctions that are actually put in place than the \ncountry that enacts those particular sanctions.\n  Senator Brownback spoke a few moments ago of a trip that he and I \ntook to the Asian subcontinent just over a week ago. We had very good \nmeetings with Prime Minister Vajpai and his key officials within his \nGovernment, including Interior Minister Advani, Defense Minister \nFernandez, and others. We spent another day in Pakistan with Prime \nMinister Sharif, Foreign Minister Khan, and a number of key officials. \nWe went up to a line of control and not only observed the positions \nthere but did observe the fact that the fighting in the Kashmir area \ncontinues to inflict far more casualties on civilians than it does on \nactual combatants.\n  But for a very different reason than my good friend and colleague \nfrom Ohio, I am pleased that section 3 was removed because it was less \nthan, I believe, we need to do in terms of taking congressional fingers \noff of the ability to waive sanctions that we currently employ. I \nbelieve it is important that we continue to focus on our oversight role \nand make the administration not only responsible for the conduct of \nforeign policy, but for defending foreign policy choices. But \nultimately, if we prescribe sanctions and act, in effect, as 535 \nSecretaries of State in too many instances, we make it virtually \nimpossible for the administration to carry out the functions of any \nadministration--whether it be Democratic or Republican--to carry out \nthe functions that we expect an administration to carry out on our \nbehalf. So taking section 3 out of this particular legislation, which \nwould have had a limited waiver authority, and working to provide the \nkind of complete waiver authority and comprehensive treatment that I \nbelieve this subject deserves, in my judgment, it is the right thing to \ndo. Given the statement just made a few minutes\n\n[[Page S7808]]\n\nago by the distinguished Senator from Ohio, it may be that we will have \nextended debate on that particular topic. But it is important that we \ndo so.\n  In this particular instance, much like fast-track authority and \nothers, the Congress of the United States can play a role, but \nfrequently its most important role is as the ``bad cop'' to provide an \nopportunity for the administration to get concessions and to make \nprogress in areas that, but for the possible effect of sanctions or \nother activities that the Congress might impose, the President working \ndirectly with the other country with singular decisionmaking authority \ncan achieve results that we simply could not obtain if we were reliant \nsolely upon the actions of the Congress of the United States.\n  So I am pleased to be supportive of this legislation. I think that \nfood is the right place to draw the line in the near term. I support \nthe amendment that will be offered by my distinguished colleague from \nVirginia, and I believe the Senator from Connecticut, with respect to \nadding medicine to that list--I think that is an appropriate addition.\n  Next week, we will begin to consider, in a more comprehensive \nfashion, the kinds of authority that we ought to provide to the Chief \nExecutive of the United States, whatever party he or she might be in at \nany given time, the authority to negotiate directly with foreign \ngovernments and not have the prospect of having to then bring whatever \nnegotiation that took place back to the Congress, where it might be \namended or changed.\n  With that, again, I salute those who were involved. I thank Senator \nBrownback for making a very exhaustive 96-hour trip to visit those two \ncountries and to get directly engaged in some of the problems that \nconfront us. I thank all of our colleagues for the effort they have put \ninto trying to find an equitable solution to a very serious problem \nconfronting not only the United States and the South Asian Continent, \nbut the international community and sanctions that we might employ in \nthe future have the kind of effects that we may not have intended them \nto take.\n  With that, I yield back whatever time I may have and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Kentucky is \nrecognized.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, Senator McConnell and Senator \nBiden, my friends, who have shown leadership on this issue, I thank you \npublicly for doing that. It's been a remarkable afternoon as we've \ndebated this issue. In fact, the debate has been somewhat limited \nbecause I think there's a whole lot of unanimity and that perhaps the \nSenate may have acted precipitously in the past.\n  I appreciated Senator Glenn's willingness to share with us some of \nthe history and motivation that went into the markup of the Arms Export \nControl Act. I don't think anyone here doubts his sincerity and the \naccuracy of what he said. However, I think all of us who have risen \ntoday to defend wheat farmers recognize how seriously we have failed in \nsome regard. We have not kept a nuclear genie in the bottle on the \nIndian Subcontinent, and now we see the bizarre spectacle of the \nAmerican Government poised to wrestle American farmers to the ground \nbecause our law does not control arms half a world away.\n  I am pleased to rise as a defender of Oregon farmers. I suppose the \nmotivation of everyone here is absolutely appropriate. I have \nadditional motivation in that the farmers that we're talking about are \nmy neighbors.\n  I come from Eastern Oregon, a place of rolling hills of wheat. And so \nwhen I consider this issue, I see their faces. And I know how much \nthey're suffering as we speak, because last time I checked, wheat in \nthe Port of Portland was selling at about $2.75 a bushel. I don't know \nwhen it has been that low and to have the threat of sanctions come on \ntop of it is truly--truly a double jeopardy. I am pleased with what the \nSenate is doing today and I am happy to be an original cosponsor of \nthis amendment. Again, I am thankful to the Republican and Democratic \nleadership for changing at least a small portion of the Arms Export \nControl Act.\n  Let me indicate how important this is as a country issue and a city \nissue. This year alone about 40 percent of the U.S. soft white wheat \ncomes from the Pacific Northwest. Again, this year alone that crop \namounts to about $255 million. Sales of this magnitude for the rest of \nthe year will simply go to another country if we don't act as we are \ntoday.\n  In addition to that, this will have an effect on the city of \nPortland. So far this year, wheat sales in the Pacific Northwest have \nresulted in about $10 million. So, this is an issue that brings country \nand city together in a very significant way.\n  Now, Mr. President, I am pleased to tell you that in a recent \nconversation with President Clinton, he emphasized his willingness, \neven his great desire to sign this legislation. So we are doing \nsomething here, acting unitedly as Americans and with our president.\n  I am also pleased to tell you that a couple days ago I met with the \nForeign Minister of Pakistan and Special Envoy of the Government of \nPakistan. We discussed the need for Pakistan to develop with America a \nnew way of rebuilding our relationship. I indicated to him that I felt \nit important to keep the door of commerce open as we acted in this \nCongress on sanctions legislation. I also let him know that they should \nalso act to reach towards us as well. He gave me his assurance that \npurchasing soft white wheat from the Pacific Northwest would be a \npriority over similar purchases from other countries.\n  Mr. President, it's been a pleasure to stand with so many Senators \nwho care about our farmers. I count myself chief among them. I thank \nthem for their support and ask for their votes in the Senate and for \nthe state of Oregon. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. President, in my home State of North Dakota, we are facing a \ndisaster of stunning proportion. We are losing literally thousands of \nfarm families as a result of what I call a ``triple whammy'' of bad \nprices, bad weather and bad policy. One part of the bad policy is the \nsanctions that we place on foreign countries that locks us out of their \nmarkets.\n  Mr. President, I have just spent 9 days in my State going from town \nto town. Everywhere I have gone, farmers have taken me aside, bankers \nhave taken me aside, Main Street business people have taken me aside \nand they have told me that something is radically wrong. Farmers are \nnot cash-flowing. We have the lowest prices in history, coupled with a \ndramatic reduction in production because of the outbreak of massive \ndisease--scab and other disease--that is reducing yields dramatically. \nThat combination is absolutely devastating to farmers.\n  In the midst of this, our Asian markets, which are critical to us, \nare weakening because of a financial collapse there. And on top of it, \nour own Government is imposing sanctions on countries like Pakistan, \nwhich is the third largest buyer of wheat, and we are locking ourselves \nout of those markets, further weakening prices, creating what is, in \neffect, a death spiral.\n  Mr. President, what are the consequences? In my State, there are now \n30,000 farm families. We are anticipating losing as many as 10 \npercent--3,000 farm families--this year. We have auctions that are \nbeing offered daily--many of them each and every day, as farm families \nliquidate, leave the land, because they can't possibly make it. These \nare some of the very best farmers that North Dakota has.\n  Mr. President, it is critically important that we pass this \nlegislation to exempt agriculture from these sanctions to give our \nfarmers a fighting chance. I visit farmsteads frequently in North \nDakota. I wish I could explain to my colleagues the depth of despair \nthat is being felt there. I had a farmer say to me this last week that \nhe believes farm conditions are worse than the 1930s.\n  I have had many farmers say to me that conditions are worse than the\n\n[[Page S7809]]\n\n1980s. That was an incredibly bad period in North Dakota and, of \ncourse, in the rest of the farm country as well.\n  Mr. President, it is time to act. We can take a first important step \ntoday by passing this sanctions legislation.\n  I want to especially thank my colleague, Senator Murray of \nWashington, for her outstanding leadership on this legislation; Senator \nMcConnell from Kentucky, who has taken a strong interest in getting \nthis legislation passed--my hat is off to Senator McConnell as well; \nSenator Biden, who has played a critical role in advancing this \nlegislation and keeping it together in the difficult hours this \nmorning; and Senator Roberts from Kansas, who has also played a leading \nrole. My thanks to each and every one of them.\n  I can tell you, we face a desperate situation in my State. It is \ntruly a disaster. I just went through six counties, and in every one of \nthem they are literally under water. There are 2 and 3 feet of water on \nthe farm fields. There won't be any crops there this year. Coupled with \nthe very low prices on crops they had last year, we face a deepening of \nthe disaster that is already occurring.\n  This is an important step. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nchairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, who really, I think, \nbegan this debate with his comprehensive sanctions proposal. We are all \ngrateful that it began to stimulate all Senators to certainly rethink \nwhere we are at this point with our history of sanctions.\n  I thank the chairman of the Agriculture Committee and yield him 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, my thanks to the distinguished Senator from \nKentucky. I appreciate his leadership, that of Senator Biden, and \nlikewise the role of Senator Lott and Senator Daschle in appointing \nthis important task force.\n  I am eager to speak today as an original sponsor of the legislation \nbefore the Senate. This bill is appropriate and a good first step \ntoward comprehensive review of economic sanctions that is sorely needed \nfor our Nation's economic security.\n  First, the legislation is timely. Executive agencies have debated \nwhether the Agriculture Department's export credit guarantees for \nPakistan should be included in the Glenn Amendment prohibitions, or \nnot. The Justice Department concluded the law did prohibit these \nguarantees.\n  In fiscal year 1997, Pakistan bought $347 million worth of U.S. wheat \nwith USDA's export credit guarantees. In fiscal year 1998, Pakistan was \nallocated $250 million in export credit guarantees and has used $162 \nmillion of that amount, all for wheat.\n  On July 15, Pakistan will hold a tender for 350,000 metric tons of \nwheat. Without export credit guarantees, the United States will get \nnone of that business. That will mean the loss of about $37 million in \nforeign exchange earnings.\n  The Pakistani government will not draw any lessons from our lack of \nparticipation, except that the U.S. has chosen to cede another market \nto its competitors. Other grain exporters are participating in the \ntender and will make the sales if we do not. Only our farmers will \nsuffer. Quick action by the Congress, however, can resolve the short-\nterm problem.\n  Second, the legislation is appropriate. Food should not be a weapon \nin foreign policy. The history of unilateral agricultural sanctions \nover several decades adequately demonstrates their futility.\n  When sanctions are unduly rigid and automatic, they become a \nroadblock to prudent diplomacy. This is a much more serious issue. In \nfact, sanctions tend to harm our industries and hamper our foreign \npolicy more than they advance their stated goals.\n  Mr. President, rarely did we state our goals when we adopted any of \nthe 61 sanctions that are now on the books; nor have we established \nbenchmarks that show whether these sanctions have been successful. \nObviously, our policy was not successful with regard to the sanctions \nwe are discussing today. Unilateral sanctions rarely accomplish their \nobjectives in the absence of multilateral cooperation. In fact, \nscholarship on this subject is replete with almost no instance in which \nunilateral U.S. sanctions have achieved their intended goals, even when \nthe goals were implicit as opposed to being explicit.\n  Finally, the legislation is a good first step. This Senate needs a \nbroad debate on economic sanctions and their consequences. The majority \nand minority leaders have shown strong leadership in naming a \nbipartisan task force to consider sanctions policy.\n  The fact that we need to pass this legislation on an emergency basis \nonly illustrates the need for a more comprehensive legislative \napproach. We need to think through the consequences of unilateral, \ninflexible sanctions before they are imposed, not after.\n  In the near future, I will offer a modified version of my bill, S. \n1413, for the Senate's consideration. That legislation will establish a \nframework for the consideration and review of future sanctions, and \nwill broadly exempt food and humanitarian assistance.\n  I look forward to working closely with the task force headed by \nSenator McConnell and Senator Biden. I appreciate that we must examine \nnot only prospective views on any legislation suggested but likewise \nretrospective views and those of our Chief Executive and Secretary of \nState.\n  For the moment, we need to pass the bill before us. I commend those \nwho brought this important legislation to the floor today.\n  Mr. President, we will also need to think carefully, as other \nSenators have suggested, about the overall agriculture situation in our \ncountry. As a general rule we ought to be thinking about how we make \nthe sale and move the grain, not about how we store the grain and \ndismember the farm bill.\n  Congress should grant the President fast track trade negotiating \nauthority. We must have this in order to successfully move our grain to \nthe rest of the world this year, next year, and for many years to come. \nFast track is essential for the World Trade Organization (WTO) \nnegotiations that will be paramount next year. We must also act on \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) replenishment. This is critical to \nhaving any chance of regaining Asian demand. Right now, prices are down \nbecause demand is down. It is as clear as that.\n  Finally, we must have broad sanctions reform. Sanctions inhibit us \nand cost American jobs and American sales.\n  For all of these reasons, Mr. President, this is an important moment, \nan important bill, and I strongly support its passage.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMontana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I first thank my good friend, the Senator \nfrom Delaware.\n  Mr. President, we are now embarked on a very significant policy \nchange with respect to sanctions. Over the past several years, it was \nsimple for the U.S. Congress to slap sanctions on an offensive country. \nWe could also give the President the authority to grant sanctions. We \ncould do this because we believed this power was free. That is to say, \nwe in Congress freely used sanctions to express our sentiments about \nissues of particular concern, and we passed several pieces of \nlegislation giving the President sanctions authority because it didn't \ncost anything. And we made our statements loud and clear by doing so. \nGood statements, for example, that tried to curb proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction. And at that time, these efforts were \nnecessary in steering certain countries away from a course contrary to \nworld public policy.\n  Unfortunately, despite our best intentions, most of these sanctions \nbills have been ineffective. Many have not accomplished the purpose for \nwhich they were intended. We may ask ourselves why? I believe one \nimportant reason is the fact that the world has become so global. In \naddition, this global marketplace is not conducive to the imposition of \nunilateral sanctions imposed by the United States. Quite simply, the \nsanctioned country can very easily avoid the purpose and penalty of our \nsanctions by going to other countries to get the products that they \nwould otherwise obtain from the United States.\n  So, by and large, unilateral sanctions have not worked very well. On \nthe\n\n[[Page S7810]]\n\nother hand, multilateral sanctions tend to work when a majority of \ncountries in the world join together with the same purpose and to help \naccomplish the same objective. The legislation that we are considering \ntoday, and will pass today, recognizes that phenomenon.\n  That being said, I believe that there is definitely a role for \nsanctions--unilateral and multilateral. We just have to work together \nto determine when and where each sanction is most appropriate and \neffective.\n  Over the last couple of weeks, we have seen a demonstrated interest \nin reforming our sanction's policy. We realize today that it probably \nmakes more sense to pass something narrowly crafted than to use a \nblanket action to achieve a specific goal. Take for example, the fact \nthat we are considering a waiver with respect to GSM agricultural \ncredits for food shipments to Pakistan. We now believe--and I think I \nam speaking for almost all Members of Congress--that food shipments \nshould never be used as a foreign policy weapon. Barring a country from \na necessary food source is wrong. It is anti-humanitarian. More often \nit hurts the very people who need it the most. It also tends to \ninadvertently penalize our producers here in America.\n  Food as a weapon simply does not work, and the legislation before us \ntoday essentially provides a release valve with respect to food \nshipments and agriculture products. Today we are talking about \nPakistan, but we should also rethink our policy toward India and the \nrest of the sanctioned countries after this particular vote. We must \nalso devise a way to give the President a little more flexibility when \ntargeting a specific result. These results include the reduction of \nnuclear tests and weapons of mass destruction in Asia.\n  I believe that it is also important to point out that our \nagricultural producers are currently blocked out of 10 percent of the \nglobal market due to sanctions. This lack of market access obviously \nhurts our producers. It is almost ironic that in many cases we hurt \nourselves far more than we hurt or influence an errant country. This is \nmost often the result when we employ the use of unilateral sanctions. \nOur producers simply cannot afford to bear the brunt of our failed \nforeign policy endeavors. We simply must oppose and remove trade \nsanctions that unfairly inhibit market opportunities for our ag \nproducers.\n  I might also add that I recently accompanied President Clinton on his \ntrip to China. During this trip, I talked to several Chinese officials \nand tried to encourage them to open up their markets to American \nproducts like Pacific Northwest wheat. Unfortunately, the response I \nreceived was to the effect that China would be willing to buy if \nAmerica was a reliable supplier. Their spin on trade was justified by \nclaiming we in America sanction our food exports too often. Why, then \nshould they depend on us to provide a reliable source of wheat, or beef \nor any other commodity subject to sanctions?\n  Now I'm not saying the sole reason China does not take wheat, \nparticularly Pacific Northwest wheat, is due to sanctions. But I do \nbelieve our random sanctions policy is a contributing factor. Again it \nwas obvious that if we stop using food as a tool of foreign policy, we \nwill have an easier time in encouraging market access.\n  Mr. President. It took awhile but sanctions reform is now moving \nquickly. Many Senators should be recognized for their efforts in \nbringing the forefront--Senators McConnell, Lugar, Dodd, Biden, Glenn, \nMurray, Feinstein and Roberts. There are many more and I would like to \ncompliment them for their efforts. I only suggest that, as we work \ntogether on a solution, we be a little more thoughtful than we were \nthis morning in rushing to push legislation throughout without \nthoughtful consideration and foresight.\n  Discretion is the better part of valor. For that reason, I am pleased \nthat we in the Senate decided to focus on a narrow sanctions reform \nprovision that would pass on its merits in the immediate future. This \nis much more reasonable that trying to enact broader sanctions reform \nwhich we should do, but at a later date in the fall after we have a \nsufficient amount of time to work together to produce a truly dynamic \nsanctions package. In the interim, I urge us to think carefully, think \nthoughtfully. Find a proper role for sanctions and offer a nonpartisan \nsolution. We need to work together as a team. We have to, in fact, as \nthe world becomes more complex with regard to foreign policy and trade \npolicy build a strong coalition. As a team of Americans representing \nthe Democrats, Republicans and Administration we will be able to set \nforth a policy enabling Americans to be respected as we would like to \nbe.\n  With that, Mr. President, I compliment those who are involved in this \nlegislation. It is a good first step. Let us continue down this path.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I note with some concern the support of \nsome of my colleagues for a weakening of the sanctions currently in \nplace against India and Pakistan under the terms of the Nuclear \nProliferation Prevention Act of 1994. Although I do not oppose the \nFarmers Export Relief Act of 1998, I would encourage members of \nCongress not to lose sight of the national security considerations \nwhich motivate our sanctions against India and Pakistan, and to tread \nwarily along the path of haphazardly lifting those sanctions.\n  In 1994, the United States Senate voted unanimously in favor of \nautomatic sanctions against any country which ``crashed the gates'' of \nthe nuclear club. The gravity of counter-proliferation sentiment in the \nSenate at the time was clearly expressed by the absence of the standard \n``national security waiver'' that sanctions legislation typically \ncontains. At the time, we believed that such a tough sanctions \nrequirement would serve as an effective deterrent to any country which \nbelieved it had more to gain than lose by developing the ability to \ndetonate a nuclear device.\n  The tenor of the debate in the Senate today indicates that our 1994 \nsanctions legislation is viewed as a failure. India and Pakistan are \nnow nuclear powers, attesting to the inability of the global non-\nproliferation regime to constrain their national ambitions.\n  But can we say with any degree of certainty that our sanctions policy \nis as powerless as some suggest? The 1994 legislation was intended not \nonly to deter countries from developing a nuclear weapons capability, \nbut to punish countries that flouted the global consensus, embodied in \nthe Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, against developing nuclear \nweapons as a legitimate instrument of national power. Sanctions against \nIndia and Pakistan have been in place for less than two months. It has \nbeen widely acknowledged that both countries, particularly Pakistan, \nhave suffered from the cut-off in U.S. trade and investment and the \ncessation of loan guarantees from the international financial \ninstitutions.\n  An earlier draft of the Farmers Export Relief Act of 1998 would have \ngranted the President the authority to waive all the sanctions mandated \nby Congress by the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994. I am \npleased that this language was removed, as it would have been \ninconsistent with both the spirit and letter of the 1994 law.\n  I support American farmer and agribusinesses who wish to export their \nproducts to South Asian markets. However, I am not convinced that the \ncampaign to waive U.S. sanctions for agricultural products is driven by \nconcern for American national security interests. What is the basis for \nsingling out agricultural products, rather than any other category of \ngoods, for a sanctions waiver? I am not convinced that the merits of \nexporting grain, cotton, or even tobacco--all agricultural goods that \nwould be exempt from sanctions should this legislation pass--are such \nthat agriculture should be singled out for a sanctions waiver. What \nnational security logic drives this approach?\n  Let me stress that I do not oppose this legislation to exempt \nagricultural goods from the sanctions regime in place against India and \nPakistan. I simply wish to caution my colleagues against piecemeal \nefforts to take the teeth out of sanctions whose credibility and \neffectiveness hinge on their capacity to hurt countries which defy \ninternational norms and undermine American national security. we must \napproach sanctions policy with an eye for overall strategy rather than \ntaking a more narrow, tactical approach that obscures the larger \nobjectives of our foreign policy.\n\n[[Page S7811]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am a member of the Sanctions Taskforce \nestablished by the Majority and Minority Leaders, and I support this \nbill. I want to give the President additional flexibility in his \nefforts to persuade the Indian and Pakistani Governments to walk back \nfrom the nuclear precipice. I think this bill represents an appropriate \ncompromise.\n  But I also want to emphasize that I am doing so because the \nPresident's waiver authority expires on March 1, 1999. I do not favor \nan open-ended waiver, nor do I want my support for this bill to be \ninterpreted as a signal that the President should immediately use the \nauthority to waive sanctions. I hope he will think long and hard before \nhe does, and do so only if he is convinced that it could bring about a \nsignificant change in behavior of these countries.\n  The United States finds itself in a difficult position. We are, after \nall, the only country that has ever used nuclear weapons against \nanother country. We have also conducted thousands of nuclear tests, and \nwe have an enormous nuclear arsenal. From the perspective of the \nIndians and the Pakistanis, our expressions of outrage at their recent \nnuclear tests may seem hypocritical.\n  I for one believe the United States could do a great deal more to set \nan example on nuclear disarmament. We do not need to wait for the \nRussians before we take further steps of our own. Our overwhelming \nmilitary power makes it possible for us, indeed I would say we have a \nresponsibility, to do so. We can reduce our arsenal further without \nrisking our own security or the security of our allies.\n  But having said that, I also believe that the actions of the Indian \nand Pakistani Governments were at complete variance with the trend of \nhistory. Their acts were reckless and unnecessary. They contributed \nnothing to their defense, and they have only increased tensions and \ninsecurity in South Asia. They have invited similar recklessness by \nother countries.\n  It is therefore imperative that the President use whatever diplomatic \nmeans he has to encourage the Indians and Pakistanis to join the \nComprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, to enter into serious \nnegotiations on a solution to the Kashmir problem, and to take whatever \nsteps are necessary to ensure that they are not drawn into a nuclear \narms race. In that regard, they need only look to the experience of the \nUnited States and the former Soviet Union to understand why it is in \ntheir interests to not start down that road.\n  I want the President's diplomacy to succeed, and I support giving him \nthe tools he needs. But I also support the sunset provision in this \nbill because it gives these countries ample time to demonstrate whether \nor not they intend to respond to these concerns. If they do not, then \nsanctions should be reimposed. Any country that detonates a nuclear \ndevice should expect to suffer the consequences. On the other hand, if \nthey do respond positively then I have no doubt that the Congress will \nreciprocate.\n  Mr. President, the avoidance of nuclear war is our country's first \npriority. Ever since the end of World War II we have done our utmost to \navoid the use of nuclear weapons, by ourselves or by others. We have \nmade headway with Russia on nuclear disarmament, but that process has \nstalled. I fully support the President's decision to go to Moscow to \ntry to revive that process. The administration has also made progress \nin building international support for the Test Ban Treaty. The Indian \nand Pakistani tests have set that process back. This bill seeks to \nrevive it. If we fail, we can anticipate a future with nuclear weapons \nbristling on every continent. That is not a legacy we want to leave.\n  I commend Senators McConnell and Biden for their very effective \nleadership of the Taskforce that produced this legislation.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, times are tough for Idaho's farmers \nright now. No one who has read a commodity report in the last few \nmonths would disagree. Wheat and barley prices are at record lows as \nare prices for other important Idaho agricultural products. Growers all \nover the state are on the verge of bankruptcy. This is an emergency.\n  In a time when the situation is so desperate, eliminating a market \nthat represents almost half of Idaho's white wheat exports could \npermanently cripple the grain industry in my state.\n  That is why sanctions against countries such as India and Pakistan, \nat least those based on agricultural commodities, don't make sense. In \nfact, the only loser--the only group that will suffer as a result of \nthe sanctions--will be America's farmers.\n  While I completely understand the reasons behind sanctioning \ncountries that violate the Arms Export Control Act, I cannot support \npunishing Idaho wheat farmers for the actions of foreign governments. \nThis body cannot stand by while much of the nation's wheat crop is \nsitting in grain elevators. Closing an existing market to America's \ngrain producers could have dire consequences. American wheat producers \nare already shut out of 20 percent of international markets. I believe \nthat we need to expand new markets, not close off existing ones.\n  It is for that reason that I am an original cosponsor of S. 2282, the \nFarmer Export Relief Act. This bill would send a strong signal to the \ninternational trade community that the United States will aggressively \ncompete for commodity markets.\n  The fact is, food should not be used as an economic weapon. The \npeople of these countries, two of the world's largest, have to eat. \nThere are 967 million mouths to feed in India, 135 million in Pakistan. \nThat's over 4 times more mouths than we have here at home.\n  Pakistan will soon make a $37 million purchase of white wheat. Our \nproducers should be able to bid on that 13.5 million bushel sale. If \nthey don't get their food from us, that void will quickly be filled by \nother nations with similar surplus problems. Pakistan is the third \nlargest wheat export market for the United States. We can't allow such \na big portion of exports to be handed over to our competitors.\n  Bill Flory, an Idahoan, is the president of the National Association \nof Wheat Growers. As a grain producer from Northern Idaho, Bill knows \nfirst hand the problems facing growers. Bill recently told me that the \nprices he is getting for his wheat are almost exactly the same as he \nwas getting in the 1970's--almost thirty years ago.\n  Mr. President, this is, indeed, an emergency. Idaho's grain farmers \nshould not be punished for the actions of other nations. It is time for \nthis body to come to the aid of American grain producers and lift the \nsanctions that don't hurt the violators, but instead only hurt our own \nfarmers.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I am pleased to support this important \nmeasure to keep our agricultural export markets open.\n  Beyond the legislation currently under consideration, I am pleased \nthat Congress has begun a serious discussion about the general issue of \nour sanctions policy. Too often in the past we have been quick to use \nthe blunt instrument of unilateral sanctions without fully evaluating \nits impact. I believe that when considering sanctions, we in the \nCongress must take into account not only the likelihood the policy will \nmeet our objectives, but also the effects sanctions will have both \ndomestically and abroad. By acknowledging that our farmers should no \nlonger bear the brunt of our sanctions policy, this legislation is a \nsmall but important first step.\n  More importantly, those of us from rural states know that a crisis is \nbrewing in rural America and I think it is vitally important that the \nSenate begin to act to preserve family based agriculture. Exports are \ndown, prices are collapsing, and producer incomes are decreasing at an \nalarming rate. And somehow, this crisis in rural America is growing at \na time when the rest of the country enjoys an unprecedented economic \nboom.\n  Without action, we are about to see another migration from our family \nfarms. If we don't act to preserve this way of life, we are going to \nalter forever the face of rural America. And I suspect that the \nagricultural sector we end up with will not be one we like.\n  I believe strongly that this Congress should act and will act to \npreserve family based agriculture. I am pleased that we are taking this \nfirst step to support our wheat farmers today and I look forward to the \nupcoming debate about how best to act to preserve a healthy and \nprosperous rural economy.\n\n[[Page S7812]]\n\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nlegislation before us today. This bill touches on matters of great \nimportance to the future of American farmers as well as the direction \nof foreign policy for the United States.\n  I agree with many of my colleagues who contend here today that this \nlegislation signals an important first step in reevaluating our \nsanctions policy. Many of us would agree that we have overused and \nthereby deadened the sting of sanctions. In addition, unilateral \nsanctions only hurt U.S. producers, regardless of the sector, and \nessentially amount to a gift to our foreign competitors.\n  I would also like to express my agreement with those who have \nsuggested that agricultural sanctions in particular are an ineffective \nstick and cause substantial damage to already depressed agricultural \nmarkets. In a world market where the prices for agricultural \ncommodities continue to decline and almost every major player heavily \nsubsidizes its agricultural sector, curtailing U.S. farmers' access to \nsignificant portions of the global market through sanctions only serves \nto make a difficult situation worse.\n  I would also like to emphasize the importance of allowing the free \nmarket to dictate agricultural production and sales. The wealth of \nnations--and this is a conscious choice of wording--is not attained by \nerecting barriers--either through tariffs or embargoes--to the export \nof our agricultural commodities. Our agricultural surplus must be \nallowed into markets where there is a demand. Pakistan is only one of \nthose markets.\n  If left in place, these sanctions will have a devastating immediate \nimpact on American farmers. The pending sale of 15 million tons of \nwheat to Pakistan hangs in the balance. Our wheat farmers will shoulder \nthe most immediate burden of misguided foreign policy unless we are \nwilling today to take a small, but crucial step, in changing that \npolicy. American farmers desperately need the remaining 10% of global \nmarkets that our current sanctions deny them. We already witnessed the \nimpotence of embargoes in 1980. How often do we have to repeat our \nmistakes to learn?\n  Between 1993 and 1996, the United States unilaterally imposed \nsanctions 61 times against 35 countries. The effectiveness of these \nsanctions in attaining specific foreign policy objectives would have to \nbe evaluated on a case by case basis. However, what requires no \ndetailed examination at all is that we have created a web of walls to \nU.S. exports that previously did not exist. We have erected, in \nessence, extensive non-tariff barriers to myriad U.S. exports. We have \nsystematically carved out large pieces of the global market and made \nthem inaccessible to U.S. producers. The competition should be \noverwhelmed with gratitude. We are doing more to bolster foreign \nproducers of agricultural goods than their own governments could hope \nto achieve through subsidies.\n  The focus of this legislation are the sanctions invoked in reaction \nto the nuclear tests carried out in India and Pakistan earlier this \nSpring. The 1994 Glenn amendment not only included agricultural \ncommodities, it also shut off agricultural credit programs that enabled \ncountries like Pakistan to import U.S. wheat and feed its citizens. In \nsanctioning Pakistan in this manner, we run the risk of further \ndestabilizing the existing regime. I have already voiced my concern \nabout the danger inherent in this approach. Hungry citizens and \ndesperate regimes with nuclear weapons capability could be a formula \nfor disaster.\n  A further disaster must, however, be noted and has not been \nadequately emphasized in the discussion of this bill. Allowing \ninternational markets to be regulated by supply and demand for \nagricultural products--as well as other goods, services and capital--is \nan idea that dates back to the founding of this nation. The wealth of \nthis nation can only be derived from a free market economy and \nunimpeded international trade. These artificial barriers will spell \ndisaster for U.S. farmers in the immediate term, and they will \neventually have negative ramifications for every sector in the U.S. \neconomy.\n  Mr. President, I am hopeful that this legislation will initiate \nfurther changes. It is essential to American farmers that we change the \ncurrent policy. This is an important first step to removing the \nbarriers we have created to allowing U.S. producers to compete and \nprofit in global markets. The economic lessons published by Adam Smith \nin 1776 are as pertinent today as they were at this country's birth. \nU.S. sanctions will serve to crush the invisible hand and hinder our \ncompetitiveness. I believe we should keep this foremost in our mind as \nwe evaluate our sanctions policies, MFN and fast track in the coming \nmonths.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Who yields time?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I believe I have 6 minutes remaining under \nmy control.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Just under 5.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield just over 4 then to the Senator \nfrom Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  Let me join in the chorus of praise of our distinguished colleagues \nfrom Kentucky and Delaware, who have worked out this arrangement to \nallow for the adoption of this resolution that will permit the sale of \nfood shipments to go forward in the case of both Pakistan and India.\n  I also want to take a moment here to commend our colleague from \nIndiana, who is no longer in the Chamber, but who went beyond the \nparticular legislation in front of us and suggested that there are a \nnumber of things we need to be doing on the international level if we \nare going to continue to have the kind of success economically at home \nthat we have enjoyed over these past several years.\n  The critical elements, of ensuring success at home economically over \nthe long term are that we have a sound education policy, an issue which \nwe have been debating today as part of the higher education \nreauthorization legislation, in addition to the obvious sound monetary \nand economic policy. Another important component is to also have \nresponsible global economic policies. Certainly enactment of IMF \nlegislation is a critical element of such a policy. I am hopeful that \nthe other body will follow the Senate in passing the IMF legislation \nbefore we adjourn this Fall.\n  Sanctions policy is another part of our global economic policy that \ncertainly demands our attention in this Congress and in this session. I \nthink most Members now have come to the conclusion that our present \nsanctions policy is not only not working very well, but is actually \ncounter to our own self-interest.\n  Someone suggested the other day that when we adopt unilateral \nsanctions, what we ought to do is immediately lay off about 5 percent \nof the workforce in the affected industries, because that is the \nultimate effect and we should be honest about it.\n  Senator Hagel, Senator Pat Roberts, Senator Biden, and I, and others \nintroduced legislation before the July 4 recess would fundamentally \nchange how unilateral sanctions are dealt with in this country. I would \nrestore the appropriate balance of power between the Congress and the \nExecutive in the sanctions area by giving the President the authority \nto delay, suspend, or terminate a particular sanction if he believes it \nserves an important national interest to do so. But we are not going to \ndebate that today or bring it up, but I am hopeful that before this \nsession ends we will find the time to do so.\n  I am fearful that while there is a keen interest in the sanctions \nissue now because of recent events in Pakistan and India, we will soon \nmove on to other things without fundamentally addressing the problems \nwith sanctions that the India/Pakistan highlighted so vividly. I hope \nthat doesn't happen.\n  We currently have in place sanctions that effect more than 40% of the \nworld's population. In one year alone, existing sanctions has cost the \nUnited States $20 billion in lost export revenues and affected 200,000 \njobs in America. And even if you did not pass one new sanction, that \n$20 billion turns into $100 billion over a five year period, and those \n200,000 jobs turn into a million.\n\n[[Page S7813]]\n\n  So I am hopeful that this interest being expressed today by both \nDemocrats and Republicans on this particular issue--and they have gone \nbeyond it to suggest we need to fundamentally change how we impose \nunilateral sanctions--will bear fruit in terms of some broader \nlegislative steps before this Congress expires.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3113\n\n  (Purpose: To exempt medicines and medical equipment from sanctions)\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, Senator Warner and I have an amendment, on \nwhich we have been joined by Senator Hagel and Senator Robb, which I am \ngoing to send to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself, Mr. \n     Warner, Mr. Hagel, and Mr. Robb, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3113.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 1, after line 14, insert:\n       (c) Section 102(b)(2)(D) of the Arms Export Control Act is \n     further amended in clause (ii) by inserting after the word \n     ``to'' the following words: ``medicines, medical equipment, \n     and,''\n       Renumber succeeding subsections accordingly.\n\n  Mr. DODD. This amendment has been cleared by both sides. What it does \nis, to exempt the sale of medicines and medical equipment from \nsanctions that would be imposed under this provision of the Arms Export \nControl Act. Senator Warner, Senator Hagel, Senator Robb, and I feel \nthat just as food should not be used as a weapon against other \ncountries, neither should medicine or medical equipment.\n  I have heard it said now countless times over the last hour and a \nhalf or 2 hours on this floor that food shipments ought never to be \nused as an instrument of sanctions policy. Whatever else we may choose \nto do to sanction a government, we shouldn't be hurting the average \nperson in that country because they aren't responsible for the actions \nof their leaders. We shouldn't be victimizing innocent men, women and \nchildren with our sanctions policy.\n  I guarantee you that the political leaders who formulate policies of \ncountries get their flu shots, get their medicine; they get their food. \nIt is the general population who are the innocent victims who suffer. \nSo we wanted to add medicine and medical equipment to make a point \ntoday, to put them on the same footing as food shipment are treated in \nthis bill, so that we would begin to set the precedent that food \nshipments and medicine will no longer be used as a tool of our \nsanctions policy. Our ultimate goal is to lift all sanctions on the \nsale of food and medicine that currently are included in existing law, \nand bar the imposition of any future sanctions of this kind. We hope we \nwill accomplish this broader objective before Congress adjourns later \nthis year. But that goes beyond the parameters of the legislation that \nis being considered today.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues in correcting \nwhat is clearly an unintended consequence of Congressional enacted \nsanctions--namely preventing American farmers from being able to export \ntheir products abroad. This not only hurts American farm families, but \nit also ends up hurting innocent populations who in many cases are \nterribly dependent on American food stuffs in order to stay alive. \nMoreover, it is unlikely to alter the behavior of the sanctioned \ngovernment.\n  I do not believe that food should ever be used as a weapon against \nother governments or people. That is not what the United States should \nbe about. The American people have an enormous humanitarian spirit \nalways reaching to help the weak and defenseless. Surely there are \nenough weapons in our foreign policy arsenal that we can forswear the \nuse of food as a sanctions tool.\n  Similarly, I believe that we should also forswear denying life saving \nmedicines and medical equipment to innocent women and children, simply \nbecause we don't like something their government officials may have \ndone. Let's not kid ourselves into thinking we are denying any high \ngovernment officials access to all the food or medicine they need--\nthey'll get it even though there is scarcity with respect to the \ngeneral public.\n  I am pleased that the Managers have agreed to accept the Dodd/Warner \namendment that amends the Arms Export Control Act to make it explicitly \nclear that medicines and medical supplies will not be withheld under \nthe sanctions provisions of this act.\n  When we impose sanctions against other governments we are at the same \ntime sending a signal to the rest of the world about what the United \nStates stands for and believes in. For that reason I believe we should \nnever be telling the world that we believe in starving innocent people \nor denying them access to medical care. It is important that throughout \nthe planet everyone understands that the United States operates only on \nthe highest moral standards and will never stoop to the kind of \nbehavior that is the hallmark of petty dictatorships who care nothing \nfor the well being of their people.\n  Mr. President, while I support what we are doing today, I do not \nbelieve it goes far enough. It does not resolve the problem that \ncurrently confronts the President with respect to sanctions generally \nand India and Pakistan most immediately. We have done nothing today to \ngive him the flexibility he needs to bring India and Pakistan back \nwithin the fold of internationally responsible countries in the realm \nof nuclear nonproliferation. I would hope that we could get agreement \nto deal with this issue very quickly so that a bad situation does not \nbecome a global tragedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time under the control of the Senator from \nDelaware has now expired.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask for an additional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I think this proposal is a step in that direction. It makes \nsense. It deserves our broad-based support. I strongly urge our \ncolleagues to join with us on the broader efforts to fundamentally \nchange sanctions policy.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Kentucky has \n2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there is no objection to the amendment.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1313) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the situation is this. We are just \nabout out of time, but I have one more Senator on our side of the aisle \nwho would like a couple of minutes.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Thompson have 2 \nminutes and Senator Harkin have 2 minutes, and Senator Biden and I have \n2 minutes each for a close.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So I say to our colleagues, that means the vote will \nbe about 8 minutes from now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank my colleagues from Kentucky and Delaware.\n  Mr. President, just a couple of brief points that I think need to be \nmade in order to put what we are doing in context. I think the \nlegislation is good legislation and it is needed. However, I think what \nwe are doing here is taking a step toward Congress intervening in the \nsanctions process, as we have sometimes, and I think that is good. But \nI think we need to keep in mind that most of these sanctions have been \npassed in times past because of concerns of nuclear proliferation. \nProliferation has come about because of detonation by countries that \nhave been carried out in their own countries, such as India and \nPakistan. Proliferation has also come about because of exports from one \ncountry to another, to a troublesome country, to a rogue nation or a \nnation that we feel might pose some danger to us.\n\n[[Page S7814]]\n\n  So, while we are fashioning a particular remedy for a particular \npurpose with regard to these sanctions, we need to keep in mind that it \nis in a much larger context that we are going to have to address this. \nBecause, while we want to liberalize the administration's discretion \nwith regard to sanctions in this area, we need to keep in mind that \nwhat is also going on right now is the situation where Congress, time \nand time again, has expressed concern that the administration has not \nused the sanctions that are available to it. We have a situation right \nnow where we have imposed sanctions on India because of detonations, \nand India's response is that they are doing so in large part because of \nour relationship with China. China, on the other hand, continues to be \nthe world's greatest distributor of weapons of mass destruction around \nthe world, and as they do so, the President waives sanctions on China.\n  More recently, the administration has decided to exercise its waiver \nauthority and not to sanction the Russian company Gazprom for energy \ninvestments in Iran which violate the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act.\n  So, while it may be appropriate and needed for Congress to intervene \nto liberalize the application of sanctions in the area that we are \ndealing with today, we need to keep in mind that while we are bashing \nsanctions--and I personally believe that they have been greatly \noverapplied, are indiscriminate, there has not been sufficient \ndistinction with regard to countries that pose a threat or not----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I ask consent for an additional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. We have not made that kind of distinction; we have not \nmade a distinction between those countries that pose a threat and \ncountries that do not. We are going to have to address all of those \nissues and mainly we are going to have to address the question of \nwhether or not we want to also intervene, as a Congress, with regard to \nthose instances where the administration is not imposing sanctions when \nthis Congress believes they should; where this administration is \ngranting waivers to Russia and China time and time again with regard to \ntheir activities of proliferation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to make a few comments in favor of \nthe bill and its swift passage. I just want to point out again what the \nbill accomplishes. What this legislation will do is to establish that \nthe automatic sanctions under the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act \nof 1994 will not include a prohibition against credit, credit \nguarantees or other financial assistance provided by the Department of \nAgriculture to support the purchase of food or other ag commodities. \nAgain, this bill does not deal with the underlying purposes and \noperation of the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994. It only \ndeals with the question of whether the automatic sanctions will include \nUSDA credit guarantees or other financial assistance for the purchase \nof food and ag commodities.\n  My views in this regard are similar to what Hubert Humphrey, a former \nMember of this body, once said when he wanted to extend more food sales \nto the then-Soviet Union--which, of course, was our enemy in the cold \nwar--and someone was taking him to task for that. Senator Humphrey \nreplied that he was in favor of selling them anything that they \ncouldn't fire back.\n  That is essentially my perspective, too. We ought to be willing to \nsell food with credit guarantees not only for our own purposes here in \nthis country but because a lot of people whose economic circumstances \nare marginal in other countries need this food for their basic \nsubsistence.\n  Finally, it is important that the Senate not have the misimpression \nthat this legislation is going to solve what is shaping up to be a very \nserious crisis in rural America and on our farms. We need to pass this \nlegislation. It will help, but it should not delude us into thinking \nthat now this is going to cure our low wheat prices or corn prices or \nsolve the farm income problem.\n  With respect to U.S. ag exports, I would point out the net impact of \nU.S. trade sanctions in six markets--Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, \nLibya, and Sudan--amounts to only 1 percent of the total U.S. ag \nexports. Those six countries purchased only about 2 percent--I ask \nunanimous consent for 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Those six countries purchased only about 2 percent of the \ntotal world ag imports in 1996. When India and Pakistan were added, the \nresult was only 3.2 percent of the total world ag trade subject to U.S. \nsanctions. That is simply not enough to have caused the tremendous drop \nwe have recently seen in wheat and other commodity prices. So, yes, we \nneed to pass this bill, but we need to come back in this body and do \nsomething to help solve the low ag prices that are hurting our farmers \nall over America. This bill alone won't do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, what we are doing here today at the urging \nof Senator Murray and Senator Roberts is necessary and important. But I \nwant to make it clear we didn't start this off as an ag bill. This is \nabout foreign policy. This is about sanctions. It does affect us. It is \nimportant.\n  My only regret here today is we are only exempting agriculture. I \nhear my colleagues from the agricultural States stand up and talk about \nhow farmers are put at risk. I point out, people who work in a factory \nat Boeing are put at risk. People who work in the Du Pont Company are \nput at risk. People who work in every other industry are put at the \nsame risk farmers are put at when we impose these sanctions. So we \nshould go further than we are going today.\n  That is the task that has been assigned to the task force that is \nchaired by Senator McConnell and myself. I am hopeful and I am \nencouraged by the fact that we have been nonpartisan in our approach so \nfar, to try to deal with this. There is going to be a tendency on the \npart of Democrats to say, ``Gosh, if there is a Republican President \nnext, maybe we should not do this.'' There is a tendency on the part of \nRepublicans to say, ``We have a Democratic President for the next 2 \nyears, maybe we should not do this.'' I hope we continue to rise above \nthat and do what needs to be done and have a rationalized sanctions \npolicy that is fundamentally different than what we have here today.\n  But that is easier said than done. That is our task. We will attempt \nto do it. I am just sorry we weren't able to go forward with what was, \neven the broader version of this, was a modest version of what we had \nto do. We weren't able to get that done today, but with the leadership \nof the Senator from Kentucky and the help of our colleagues who have \nengaged in this, maybe we can come up with something before this \nsession is over that rationalizes our sanctions policy.\n  I thank my friend from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my good friend from Delaware. I do look \nforward to this challenge we have together to try to move forward on \nthis issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Grams of Minnesota and Senator \nBond of Missouri be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, before we close for the vote on this \nIndia-Pakistan bill, let me re-examine our mandate from the leadership.\n  Senator Biden and I and the task force have been asked to focus on \nthe following issues: What constitutes a sanction? Is it a sanction \nwhen we withhold or condition U.S. foreign assistance? Is it a sanction \nwhen we ban investment? Obviously, it is a sanction to ban commercial \nactivity or investment, but there are other issues of aid conditions \nthat are clearly foggy. What sanctions are in place? What flexibility \nhas been offered? And how are these current sanctions being \nimplemented? Implementation, even after we enact a sanction, has been \nsomewhat haphazard.\n  Mr. President, as the task force moves forward, let me suggest that \nwe are very likely to have a hearing before the August recess to give \npeople out in the country who are affected by what\n\n[[Page S7815]]\n\nwe decide an opportunity to have their say. We know the business \ncommunity, for example, seems to be comfortable with the 301 process, \nbecause they know what to expect and when to expect it. We look forward \nto hearing from them. There are others out in our country who feel the \nUnited States is, after all, the beacon of freedom in the world and we \nshould express ourselves about policies in other countries with which \nwe disagree, and we want to hear from them, Mr. President, as well.\n  It is the intention of Senator Biden and myself to meet the September \n1 deadline that the leadership has given us. I want to say that we \nwelcome the thoughts and comments of our colleagues both on and off the \ntask force.\n  Mr. President, I understand that time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on the \nengrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Shall the bill, as amended, \npass? On this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I appreciate the fact that the Senate took \nup this very important issue of agricultural sanctions and has acted on \nit.\n  Now, of course, we return to the Higher Education Act. The managers \nof the legislation have been making progress. We have at least a couple \nof amendments that will still take some more time. I encourage Senators \nto speak briefly and just go ahead and get a vote on the issues that \nare involved. The plan is to stay on the Higher Education Act until we \ncomplete it tonight, so we will need cooperation of all Senators. I \nunderstand some Senators may have other events they would like to go \nto, but you can't say, ``I want to offer amendments, but, by the way, I \nhave an event I have to go to.''\n  Please work with the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from \nMassachusetts. This is important legislation that expired July 1. We \nneed to get it completed so we can get it in conference and get it done \nbefore we go out at the end of the year. I believe with a little \ncooperation, we can complete this very important Higher Education Act \ntonight.

I know of no one that wants to speak on the other side.\n  I ask that Senator Santorum be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee \nand also the ranking member, Senator Kennedy, and other members of the \nworking group, including Senator Coats and Senator Dodd, for working \nwith me on this amendment. It is a very important amendment to \nproprietary schools, career schools, who are doing the real lion's \nshare of the work in educating in the poor communities, with \ndisadvantaged people in our society. They are doing a great job in some \nof the toughest settings to try to make up the skills deficit that we \nhave heard so much talk about in this country for the working poor and \nfor those, in many cases, coming off of welfare.\n  We are moving from welfare to work, and we are going to have to have \neducational institutions in poor communities, in the cities, to be able \nto educate the poor. As a result, I have worked with the working group. \nAnd I will send the amendment to the desk I am offering with Senators \nDeWine and Coverdell.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3114\n\n    (Purpose: To amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to improve \n              accountability and reform certain programs)\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum], for himself, \n     Mr. DeWine and Mr. Coverdell, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3114.\n\n\n[[Page S7816]]\n\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

LIAISON FOR PROPRIETARY INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER \n                   EDUCATION.\n\n       Title II of the Department of Education Organization Act \n     (20 U.S.C. 3411 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 219. LIAISON FOR PROPRIETARY INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER \n                   EDUCATION.\n\n       ``(a) Establishment.--There shall be in the Department a \n     Liaison for Proprietary Institutions of Higher Education, who \n     shall be an officer of the Department appointed by the \n     Secretary.\n       ``(b) Appointment.--The Secretary shall appoint, not later \n     than 6 months after the date of enactment of the Higher \n     Education Amendments of 1998 a Liaison for Proprietary \n     Institutions of Higher Education who shall be a person who--\n       ``(1) has attained a certificate or degree from a \n     proprietary institution of higher education; or\n       ``(2) has been employed in a proprietary institution \n     setting for not less than 5 years.\n       ``(c) Duties.--The Liaison for Proprietary Institutions of \n     Higher Education shall--\n       ``(1) serve as the principal advisor to the Secretary on \n     matters affecting proprietary institutions of higher \n     education;\n       ``(2) provide guidance to programs within the Department \n     that involve functions affecting proprietary institutions of \n     higher education; and\n       ``(3) work with the Federal Interagency Committee on \n     Education to improve the coordination of--\n       ``(A) the outreach programs in the numerous Federal \n     departments and agencies that administer education and job \n     training programs;\n       ``(B) collaborative business and education partnerships; \n     and\n       ``(C) education programs located in, and involving, rural \n     areas.''.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, this amendment does three things, all of \nwhich will, I believe, aid career colleges in proprietary skills and in \ntheir ability to hold down at-risk default rates. They are serving \npopulations who, as a result of being at risk, have a tendency to have \nhigher default rates. They want to work with the system to be able to \nhelp hold down those default rates because, obviously, they want to \nstay in business and continue to educate.\n  So the first provision that we put in this amendment is to require \nthe guaranty agencies and lenders to contact institutions when they are \ndoing skip-tracing of borrowers who have gone into default. In other \nwords, this will allow the schools to be notified when former students \nof theirs are going into default because, in many cases, through their \nplacement offices they know where to locate these people and can, in \nfact, aid the lending institutions and guaranty agencies in bringing \nthese people back on to a payment schedule, to avoid default, and to \nkeep the default rate low, but also to help the young people who are \nout now in the working environment avoid a bad thing on their credit. \nAnd, obviously, it will save the Federal Government some money.\n  Secondly, it sets September 30 of each year as the deadline for the \nDepartment of Education to release its annual default rate for schools. \nThis will help schools in their planning process, giving more certainty \nin how to deal with potential problems they may have with the default \nrate down the road.\n  Third, it creates a liaison position at the Department of Education \nfor proprietary schools, similar to the liaison position created \nseveral years ago for community colleges. Community colleges and \nproprietary schools, in many cases, serve similar populations. There \nhave been problems in communicating, in getting information, and having \na voice at the Department of Education. This is a mechanism for those \nwho are sometimes considered somewhat of a ``stepchild'' in the higher \neducation community to get some real responsiveness from the Department \nto their needs and to their concerns.\n  That is the sum total of the amendment. I believe it will help these \ncareer and proprietary schools better serve an at-risk population that \nis in desperate need of making up a skills deficit. It will put them in \na better position to keep the default rates down and improve the \nprogram overall.\n  Again, I thank the chairman, the ranking member, Senator Coats, and \nSenator Dodd for working with me and my staff in coming up with this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we have an \nimmediate vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, I just need 30 seconds, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think these are very good suggestions \nand recommendations. I think they will improve the accountability in \nthe important areas of recovery of debt, and also give better \ninformation on these default rates, and will help to assist some of the \nproprietary schools. I think they are all very solid, good management \nrecommendations that can make the programs more efficient. I thank the \nSenator for those initiatives.\n  I urge that we accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3114) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3111\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the pending amendment, I believe, is the \nWellstone amendment.\n  I move that we return immediately to the Wellstone amendment and \nrelinquish any time that was available.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I think my colleague, Senator Dodd from \nConnecticut, wants to speak on this amendment, and Senator Ford and \nSenator Moynihan are going to come down. I believe my colleague from \nDelaware also is going to speak.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Matthew \nTourville, an intern in my office, be allowed to be on the floor while \nwe debate the higher education bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will yield time to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Rena \nSubotnik, a fellow in my office, be allowed floor privileges during the \npendency of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend our colleague from Minnesota for \nthis amendment. I think it is a very thoughtful amendment, one that I \nthink most Americans would feel very comfortable in backing and \nsupporting.\n  There was a significant debate, as we all recall, in this Chamber not \nthat many months ago on the issue of welfare reform, and the desire to \nhave people who collect public assistance find meaningful work. All of \nus supported the underlying principle of that concept. There were \ndisagreements on how it should be achieved and on final passage of the \nbill. But the underlying desire to move people from welfare to work was \ncertainly a laudable goal.\n\n[[Page S7817]]\n\n  What our colleague is suggesting here is that a person on welfare who \nenters an educational program to learn skills and training--that \neducation experience ought to be considered on a par with a work \nexperience. For persons acquiring skills and trying to improve the \nquality of their life, to enhance their opportunities, I think that \nought to be applauded and encouraged. If a person is engaged in that \neffort here, certainly that individual deserves our support and \nbacking. A person who acquires skills is going to be a person who will \nearn that income that will make him or herself independent, a good \nprovider at home, a better citizen. All of us know of the vital \nimportance of education.\n  I made note earlier in the day that we now know factually that a \nperson who earns a college degree today earns twice the income of a \nperson with only a high school diploma. That was not the case only a \nfew short years ago. A few short years ago, with a high school diploma, \na set of good hands and a good heart, you could provide for your \nfamily, you could earn a good salary, a good wage, buy a home, educate \nyour children, provide for their health needs. But today that is no \nlonger the case. You have to have more education.\n  In my view, if a person who has been on welfare, on public \nassistance, is entering an educational opportunity, as I said a moment \nago, then that ought to be supported. So I strongly urge our colleagues \nhere to support the Wellstone amendment. If there is one thing that we \nknow works to end the cycle of poverty, it is education. A person who \nhas those tools will be in a far better position to not only gain \nemployment, but to remain employed and to understand and support \ndemocracy.\n  I have often cited this quote, and I can't resist because sitting \nnext to me is our dear friend and colleague from West Virginia. I have \noften used it and said to my audiences in my home State of Connecticut \nthat Thomas Jefferson understood this concept 200 years ago when he \nsaid in a speech--I think I have the quote pretty close--``Any nation \nthat expects to be ignorant and free expects what never was and never \ncan be.'' He made those comments at the beginning of the 19th century. \nWe are just a few short days from the end of the 20th century. \nCertainly, if it was true then, it is true today--that ``Any nation \nthat expects to be ignorant and free expects what never was and never \ncan be.''\n  As expensive as education is, ignorance is far more costly. We \ncertainly know that people who are dependent on public assistance in \nmost cases are people who lack educational skills.\n  To strengthen our country, to create opportunity to improve an \nindividual's chance to succeed in this country, I think the idea should \nbe equating a person who is entering an educational process on the same \nfooting as someone who is entering into a work experience. For those \nreasons, I support the amendment of our colleagues from Minnesota, and \nurge adoption of it by a strong vote in this body.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Wellstone \namendment and am an enthusiastic cosponsor of it.\n  I come to the Senate floor as a professionally trained social worker. \nI have been through seven welfare reforms in my career, both as a \nsocial worker in the streets and neighborhoods, and now in the \ncorridors of the U.S. Senate. When we talk about reforming welfare, we \nwant to make sure that welfare is not a way of life but that it is a \ntool to move to a better life.\n  Over the break I sat in a room in Baltimore meeting with welfare \nmothers who wanted exactly to move to a better life and who were \npracticing self-help. But the very cruel rules of government are going \nto derail their hopes, dreams, and practical opportunities. And what is \nthat? They were enrolled in a community college program--one in \nbusiness, one as an addiction counselor, and one doing prenursing \ncourses to make sure they could get back to society and be able to give \nan income to their family. But they were told they had to leave the \nprogram. They had to leave the program and look for work rather than \ncomplete the program so that they could have jobs that were truly self-\nsupporting and sustaining. Why were they told that? Not because of a \ncallous social worker. We are not callous. But the rules of government \nsaid you can get some kind of temp training. You can get into a \ntraining program where you can get some type of training that might or \nmight not take you to a livable wage.\n  That is not what welfare reform is all about. Welfare reform is to \nend the culture of poverty. And yet the very rules that we now have \nreinforce the culture of poverty. We are not giving help to those who \nwant to practice self-help--meaning those who want to go to school, \nstay in school, and learn the skills for the new global economy, \nwhether it is in the service field, the nonprofit, or the private \nsector.\n  The Wellstone amendment allows States, if they so choose--I happen to \nhave the type of Governor who would be eager to have this--to allow \nthese women to be able to go into a job training program or have 2 \nyears of higher education.\n  There are people--there are women now on welfare who because of a bad \nchoice in marriage actually dropped out of college. They might be 18 \ncredits away. If we could help them finish, they would be able to have \na job with benefits and be able to lead, indeed, a better life.\n  The Wellstone amendment is not about new rules. It is about \nopportunity. The other side of the aisle, and this side of the aisle, \nhas said one of the most important functions of government is to create \nan opportunity ladder. This is what the Wellstone amendment does. It \ncreates an opportunity ladder that doesn't necessarily take you to the \ntop but gets you over the top.\n  I support the Wellstone amendment. I want to compliment the Senator \nfrom Minnesota for his steadfast commitment to children, but to know \nthat for the children, they need a parent who has the best social \nprogram, which is a job that pays a living wage. And this is the best \nway to get one.\n  I look forward to voting for the amendment, supporting the amendment, \nand I look forward to seeing to it that those women I talked to are \nable to get on with their life while we get on with doing our job.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from \nMaryland. She always kind of takes these issues from the abstract and \nconnects them to people. I really thank her for her statement. I am \nvery proud to have her support. I hope we really get a strong vote for \nthis.\n  Mr. President, I think my colleague from Kentucky is on the floor and \nwishes to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the Wellstone \namendment. I am honored to be able to add my name as an original \ncosponsor to this important amendment.\n  Booker T. Washington wrote that ``success is to be measured not so \nmuch by the position one has reached in life as by the obstacles which \none has overcome while trying to succeed.''\n  He might well have been talking about the single, uneducated parents \nin this country trying to turn their lives around, while ensuring their \nchildren grow up in a healthy, safe environment.\n  Things like child care, transportation, and education, become \nobstacles of insurmountable proportions for these struggling parents, \nputting jobs that can build secure futures further and further out of \nreach.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I supported and voted for welfare \nreform. It's been almost two years since Congress rewrote our welfare \nlaws in hopes of breaking the cycle of dependency that was trapping too \nmany Americans in poverty and despair. Much good has come of that law, \nincluding substantial drops in the welfare rolls, saving states like \nKentucky $14 million.\n  But despite its good intentions, the new welfare law is penalizing \nparents trying to improve their chances at getting good jobs. Under the \nnew law, a parent must work 20 hours to continue receiving aid.\n  That might not seem particularly onerous, but the law also limits \nthese single parents to just one year of education before requiring \nthem to find work.\n\n[[Page S7818]]\n\n  Let me just repeat that. But the law also limits these single parents \nto just 1 year of education before requiring them to find work.\n  As one of Kentucky community college wrote me, ``for even the best \nprepared traditional students, our community college programs require \ntwo years with a full load of course work. The best prepared \ntraditional student, however, doesn't represent our average student. \nWith over 70 percent of our students testing into developmental \nEnglish, reading or math courses, the extra time needed to prepare for \nactual college course work is critical to their success. Twelve months \nis inadequate time for a person to move from a life of dependence upon \ngovernment assistance to a life of independence and self-sufficiency.''\n  For most single parents, the burden of going to school full-time, \nholding down a part-time job, all while trying to raise healthy \nchildren, will simply become too much, forcing them to choose a low-\npaying job with no future over the path to skilled, high-paying work.\n  Leaders in my home state of Kentucky, like Representative Tom Burch, \nrecognized this problem. But their efforts to change the policy have \nbeen hampered by fears that the state will lose critical federal funds, \nfurther short-changing those who need the aid most.\n  That is why I am pleased to join in offering this amendment which \nwill stop penalizing parents trying to improve their situation.\n  This amendment allows up to 24 months of post-secondary or vocational \neducation, removes the 30 percent limitation on education as a work \nactivity for teen parents, and clarifies that participation in a \nfederal work-study program is a permissible work activity.\n  In my state, nearly 4,000 parents could benefit directly from these \nchanges. But the truth is, they're not the only ones who stand to \nbenefit. With the economy growing in Kentucky, employers are having a \nharder time finding qualified employees. With good-paying jobs, these \nparents can provide a much better quality of life for their children, \nand that adds up to success no matter how you measure it.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this worthwhile amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support for \nthe Wellstone amendment from Kentucky's Secretary for Families and \nChildren, Viola Miller; the Honorable Tom Burch; Kentuckians for the \nCommonwealth; and President Deborah Floyd of the University of \nKentucky's Prestonburg Community College be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         The Secretary for Families and Children, Commonwealth of \n           Kentucky,\n                                                   March 25, 1998.\n     Hon. Wendell H. Ford,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Ford: This is to express my support for the \n     amendment you and Senator Wellstone have proposed for S. 1133 \n     to support education for welfare recipients. While we \n     understand that the goal of welfare reform is for recipients \n     to obtain employment, and fully support that goal, we need to \n     acknowledge that some recipients must acquire skills to be \n     employable.\n       Approximately one-half of our recipients do not have a high \n     school diploma or GED and less than one percent have any \n     postsecondary education. We want to provide assistance that \n     will not only help recipients get jobs, but also allow them \n     to keep jobs and to advance. Thus, we support this initiative \n     whether as an amendment to S. 1133 or through some future \n     action.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Viola P. Miller,\n     Secretary.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         Commonwealth of Kentucky,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                                   March 19, 1998.\n     Senator Wendell Ford,\n     173A Russell Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Ford. We appreciate your continuing interest \n     and support of education for Kentucky's low-income parents. \n     The General Assembly, the Kentucky Welfare Reform Coalition, \n     and Kentucky's low-income parents are working hard to \n     maintain access to educational opportunities. With the \n     cooperation of the Kentucky Cabinet for Families and \n     Children, progress has been made. Nonetheless, legislative \n     attempts to expand educational opportunities are being \n     stymied by the Cabinet's fear of incurring federal penalties \n     under TAN-F work requirements. Clearly, the Commonwealth of \n     Kentucky does not want to risk losing federal funds to assist \n     those most in need.\n       Getting off and staying off public assistance are directly \n     linked to educational attainment. The Urban Studies Institute \n     at the University of Louisville recently reported that 51% of \n     a sample of discontinued K-TAP recipients (Kentucky's version \n     of TAN-F) have less than a 12th grade education. The \n     University of Kentucky reports that 1996 average weekly \n     earnings of women with less than 12 years of education are \n     $176.00, far below the federal poverty level. With some \n     college, weekly earnings for Kentucky women more than double \n     to $371.00\n       This session we introduced 98 HB 434 to increase access to \n     educational opportunities for Kentucky's low-income parents. \n     The seed for this bill grew from K-TAP recipients struggling \n     to stay in school. We could only make small strides with this \n     legislation given the Cabinet's desire to comply with the \n     Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation \n     Act of 1996.\n       Your proposed amendment to S. 1133 to allow up to 24 months \n     of post-secondary education or vocational education, to \n     remove the 30% limitation on education for teen parents, and \n     to clarify that education counts as a work activity will \n     potentially help nearly 3,700 low-income parents annually \n     continue on the road to economic independence. We strongly \n     endorse your support of this legislation for the people of \n     the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the United States of \n     America. Thank-you for the opportunity to support this \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tom Burch.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             Kentuckians for the Commonwealth,\n\n                                 Prestonsburg, KY, March 20, 1998.\n       Dear Senator Ford, We were thrilled to learn that you will \n     co-sponsor an amendment to SR 1133 to expand educational \n     opportunities for welfare recipients.\n       As you know, Kentuckians For The Commonwealth has been \n     organizing to build support for state legislation addressing \n     this issue. In fact, several members of our organization met \n     with you in October 1995 to express concerns about access to \n     education and training in the welfare reform plans being \n     discussed by the Republican Congress. We haven't stopped \n     working ever since.\n       We applaud your efforts and look forward to lending our \n     support to this cause.\n       KFTC and Kentucky Youth Advocates co-sponsored a series of \n     public forums last fall in five locations across Kentucky. \n     During these events, hundreds of low-income Kentuckians, \n     teachers, social workers and concerned citizens shared their \n     concerns about the impacts of welfare reform on their \n     families and communities. Federal restrictions on educational \n     opportunities were mentioned more than any other issue at \n     these events. (Enclosed is a short video with excerpts from \n     people who spoke first-hand about the importance of education \n     in getting a living wage job and leaving welfare.)\n       Led by a remarkable group of low-income parents, KFTC \n     worked with a coalition of groups to develop legislation \n     which was eventually sponsored by Representative Tom Burch in \n     the Kentucky General Assembly. HB 434 sought to prevent \n     recipients from being pushed out of education and training \n     due to punishing federal work requirements and lack of \n     supportive services. The bill would have used state dollars, \n     not federal TANF money, to support students in post-secondary \n     education. We hoped this would allow student-parents some \n     relief from the time clock and 20-hour work requirements \n     while they got the training necessary to earn a living wage.\n       We found a great deal of support among legislators, \n     community college presidents, low-income Kentuckians and \n     others for our effort. In fact, the original version of the \n     bill was co-sponsored by 15 law-makers, including both \n     Democrats and Republicans. However, the administration \n     strongly opposed the bill because they feared that federal \n     penalties would harm Kentucky if we made such a commitment to \n     education and training. The ``flexibility'' states were \n     promised under federal welfare reform wasn't there.\n       Our bill (HB 434) was weakened and now simply requires the \n     Cabinet for Families and Children to fully inform recipients \n     of their rights to education and to convene an advisory board \n     to examine the issues further. We also won a commitment from \n     the administration to provide child care assistance to TANF-\n     eligible students who decline cash assistance. This may allow \n     some Kentuckians to leave welfare and get the supportive \n     services they need to stay in school. We've come a long way, \n     but not far enough for the 3,700 Kentucky parents who must, \n     starting July 1, 1998, work twenty or more hours in addition \n     to raising their families and attending school full time.\n       Clearly, a lasting and comprehensive solution to this \n     problem lies at the federal level. Thank you for your \n     leadership. We look forward to working with you to win \n     passage of this amendment. Please let us know how we can be \n     actively involved in support of your efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n     Sherri Barker,\n       Floyd County.\n     Daisy Johnson,\n       Union County.\n       On behalf of Kentuckians For The Commonwealth.\n\n[[Page S7819]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                               Prestonsburg Community College,\n\n                                 Prestonsburg, KY, March 20, 1998.\n     Senator Wendell H. Ford,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Ford: It is with great optimism that I write \n     this letter in support of the Wellstone Amendment to S. 1133 \n     on Education as a Work Activity in the Personal \n     Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of \n     1996.\n       For many people of our region, education and training \n     present them their only way to escape a lifetime of poverty \n     and/or dependence on public assistance. As you know, \n     Prestonsburg Community College has long been committed to \n     providing education opportunities to all citizens in the Big \n     Sandy region. In our 35-year history, this commitment has \n     often meant removing obstacles from the paths our students \n     take to success.\n       Rather than removing obstacles, the Personal Responsibility \n     and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act actually presents a \n     serious obstacle.\n       For students at PCC and other post-secondary and vocational \n     educational institutions in the Commonwealth, this meant that \n     after the twelve months had expired, each student had to find \n     time in the day (1) to attend classes, (2) work a minimum of \n     20 hours per week to meet the countable work activity and (3) \n     raise the families that are the driving motivation behind \n     attending school.\n       For even the best-prepared traditional students, our \n     community college programs require two years (full load). The \n     best prepared traditional student, however, does not \n     represent our average student. With over 70 percent of our \n     students testing into developmental English, reading or \n     mathematics courses, the extra time needed to prepare for \n     actual college course work is critical to their success. \n     Twelve months is inadequate time for a person to move from a \n     life of dependence upon government assistance to a life of \n     independence and self-sufficiency.\n       The Wellstone Amendment--with its provision for up to 24 \n     months of post-secondary or vocational educational \n     opportunities--is the chance our students have needed since \n     the passage of the original 1996 legislation. If our students \n     are able to remain actively engaged in the educational \n     process for a full 24 months, they will be able to \n     concentrate on their elected course of study without the \n     heavy burden of meeting an additional, sometimes unrealistic, \n     work requirement. With the completion of that course work, \n     these students are far more likely to move into meaningful \n     employment with opportunities for advancement and success \n     throughout their careers.\n       Thank you so much for your support of the Wellstone \n     Amendment. Despite the detriments of the Personal \n     Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of \n     1996, Prestonsburg Community College has remained committed \n     to helping all of our students successfully continue in \n     school. The Amendment is an opportunity for the Senate to \n     remove a roadblock that hinders the progress of institutions \n     and students alike in their effort to produce a society of \n     self-sustaining citizens. This is an opportunity to help not \n     only our students, but students across the Commonwealth and \n     the nation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Deborah L. Floyd,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I have one other item I would like to put in \nthe Record. It is an editorial from the Lexington Herald-Leader dated \nJuly 1, 1998. I only quote a couple of paragraphs from that editorial. \nIt says:\n\n       We urge Congress to endorse such a change in a welfare \n     policy that right now insists on work first, education later. \n     It makes sense that work be the priority but not at the \n     expense of forcing the most motivated to choose an entry-\n     level job over a career track.\n       It is a shame we have to pass laws to mandate what is \n     common sense. A better education leads to career \n     opportunities and long-term self-sufficiency.\n\n  And they end that editorial with this paragraph:\n\n       One thing we do know. In this country, education is the \n     surest route out of poverty. And we shouldn't close off that \n     option by forcing people out of college into any old kind of \n     job just so we can proclaim that we made the transition from \n     welfare to work.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         End Welfare's Catch-22\n\n\n        Ford-Wellstone bill would allow more time for education\n\n       To address a problem, politicians often prefer the grand \n     gesture or the new proclamation rather than the less \n     glamorous work of just fixing what's wrong.\n       That approach was evident in the massive overhaul of \n     nation's welfare policies. Instead of changing the rules that \n     actually kept families dependent on monthly checks, Congress \n     imposed deadlines and ordered folks to either get jobs or \n     work for their benefits.\n       Spurred by this tough-love message and aided by a strong \n     economy, the welfare rolls have shrunk considerably in the \n     last two years. Now, Congress can finally look at changing \n     the rules that prevent folks from getting a leg up.\n       Proposals by Kentucky Sen. Wendell Ford and Minnesota Sen. \n     Paul Wellstone are a step in that direction. Their \n     legislation would increase from one to two years the time a \n     recipient can spend in vocational school or college and allow \n     participation in a federal work-study program to count toward \n     work requirements.\n       We urge Congress to endorse such a change in a welfare \n     policy that right now insists on work first, education later. \n     It makes sense that work be the priority, but not at the \n     expense of forcing the most motivated to choose an entry-\n     level job over a career track.\n       Kentucky is one of the few states that have agreed to count \n     some work study toward work requirements. But changing the \n     federal law would help ensure that the state would not lose \n     federal money for doing the right thing.\n       It's a shame we have to pass laws to mandate what is common \n     sense: A better education leads to career opportunities and \n     long-term self-sufficiency.\n       Yet, our national welfare policy has long snared poor \n     families in a Catch-22. For example, we bemoan single-parent \n     families yet force fathers out of the homes before giving the \n     families aid. We push folks to take low-pay, no-benefit jobs, \n     then cut medical benefits and food subsidies before they can \n     get on their feet, forcing them back on the rolls.\n       Over the last two years, those on welfare have proven that \n     they either want to work or will go to work if required. Now, \n     we may be ready to focus on what's needed to help them become \n     truly self-sufficient.\n       One thing we do know: In this country, education is the \n     surest route out of poverty. And we shouldn't close off that \n     option by forcing people out of college into any old kind of \n     job just so we can proclaim that they made the transition \n     from welfare to work.\n\n  Mr. FORD. I don't know how many of my colleagues have been to junior \ncolleges in the last year. I don't know how many of my colleagues have \nbeen to universities and colleges that have these types of individuals \nwho have started. I go to my community college, and I talk to them. And \nthis young lady with tears in her eyes says, ``I finally am on the edge \nof opportunity, and that edge is being sharpened by 1 year, and I have \nto leave education and go to work.'' She said, ``I cannot handle a job, \nI cannot handle education, I cannot handle my children, unless you give \nme this opportunity.''\n  I have looked into the eyes of those who want to do better, who can \ndo better, and we must give them that opportunity so they can have that \nbetter life. I hope that the 4,000 in my State have that opportunity \nfor that second year of education, that opportunity to find that job, \nand that opportunity to make a better life for their children.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the Wellstone amendment which \nincreases from 12 to 24 months the limit on the amount of post-\nsecondary education training that a state can count towards meeting its \nwork requirement under the new Temporary Assistance for Needy Families \nprogram. Under the old Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, \nrecipients could attend post-secondary education training for up to 24 \nmonths. I support the new law's emphasis on moving recipients more \nquickly into jobs, but I am troubled by the law's restriction on post \nsecondary education training, limiting it to 12 months. The limitation \non such advanced training raises a number of concerns, not the least of \nwhich is whether persons may be forced into low-paying, short term \nemployment that will lead them back onto public assistance because they \nare unable to support their families.\n  Mr. President, a majority of my colleagues in the Senate has \npreviously cast their vote in support of making 24 months of post \nsecondary education a permissible work activity under the Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families program. A year ago, on June 25, 1997, a \nLevin-Jeffords amendment to the Senate Reconciliation bill, permitting \nup to 24 months of post-secondary education, received 55 votes--falling \nfive votes short of the required procedural vote of 60. I would also \nlike to make note of the fact that the amendment had the support of the \nNational Governors Association.\n  Study after study indicates that short-term training programs raise \nthe income of workers only marginally, while completion of at least a \ntwo-year associate degree has greater potential of breaking the cycle \nof poverty for recipients of public assistance. According to the U.S. \nCensus Bureau, the median earnings of adults with an associate degree \nis 30 percent higher than adults with only a high school diploma or its \nrecognized equivalent.\n  Mr. President, I would like to share with my colleagues some examples \nof\n\n[[Page S7820]]\n\njobs that an individual could prepare for in a two-year vocational or \ncommunity college program and the salary range generally applicable to \nthe positions. One very productive specialty area is information \ntechnology. Graduates in this area are generally hired immediately \nfollowing or in some cases prior to completing their program.\n  According to a recent survey of the American Association of Community \nColleges, information technology programs that have exhibited the most \nindustry and labor force growth, with an average starting salary of \n$25,500 are as follows:\n  (1) Computer Technology/Computer Information Systems.\n  (2) Computer Applications and Software.\n  (3) Computer Programming.\n  (4) Microsoft Operating Systems.\n  Other important two-year training programs that present opportunity \nfor growth and self-sufficiency include:\n\nAccounting..............................................$14,000-$28,000\nLaw enforcement...........................................13,500-25,000\nDental hygiene............................................18,000-60,000\nResipiratory therapy/tech.................................21,000-32,000\nRadiology technician......................................22,235-32,425\nLegal assistant...........................................28,630-30,000\nChild care development....................................23,590-29,724\nRegistered nurse..........................................24,400-38,135\n\n  Additionally, Mr. President, in an effort to further improve the \nsuccess of welfare reform, this amendment would remove teens from being \ncalculated in the 30% cap of those involved with work/education \nactivities, ensuring that teens complete high school while giving \nstates more flexibility in designing a welfare program that meets the \nneeds of welfare recipients.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment because it will help \nus reach the new law's intended goal of getting families permanently \noff of welfare and on to self-sufficiency.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just very briefly, I hope this amendment \nwill be accepted. I think in the study of welfare reform there are a \nnumber of items which are necessary to help move people into meaningful \njobs. They have to have, one, by and large some help and assistance \nwith child care; secondly, they have to have the health care needs of \ntheir children attended to. One of the reasons people are on welfare is \nthe fact that health care costs have depleted their resources and they \nhave ended up on welfare. Third, there has to be a job available; and, \nfourth, there has to be some training or education. That is the key \nelement in terms of a successful movement. And taking all of those \nelements with an expanding economy, they have the real opportunity of \npromise for, I think, meaningful health care reform.\n  I did not believe in the last welfare reform bill we were really \naddressing those kinds of issues and questions, and therefore I voted \nin opposition to that particular program. The Senator from Minnesota \nhas offered, I think, a very important and significant amendment that \nwill really help to assist in terms of the medium- and long-term \ninterests of those individuals who have the ability to gain entrance \ninto educational institutions, obviously the commitment and the \ndedication to be able to do so, and I think it will make a major \ndifference in terms of their lives.\n  I think it is very commendable. I hope the Senate will accept it.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Wellstone \namendment as it will halt the momentum of welfare reform which has \ngained bipartisan acclaim for reducing the welfare rolls by 34 percent \nfrom the peak level in 1994. This amendment is a step backwards, and it \nwill surely invite additional means of thwarting welfare reform.\n  The Wellstone amendment has little to do with education. It will \nweaken the work participation requirements under welfare reform for \nwhich the States are to be held accountable. The Wellstone amendment \nwill create three new loopholes through which States will be tempted to \navoid their responsibility for helping families gain the work \nexperience they need to achieve self-sufficiency.\n  First, the Wellstone amendment will double the amount of time in \nvocational education from 12 months to 24 months that can be counted as \nmeeting the work requirement. Second, it allows postsecondary education \nto be counted as work in the same manner as vocational education. And, \nfinally, it removes parents up to age 20 from the 30 percent cap on the \nnumber of individuals who can be counted in educational activity. In \nother words, it will expand the number of people who can be in \neducational activities rather than in the workplace. This amendment \nwill significantly weaken the work requirements which deserve some of \nthe credit for the decline in the welfare rolls. And the effect of this \namendment is to keep individuals on welfare for a longer period of \ntime.\n  If this amendment passes, many more variations on this theme will \nfollow, and without restrictions on the number of individuals counted \nin nonwork activities, there will be no meaningful work participation \nrates. Raising these limits is another way of unraveling welfare \nreform.\n  The grave injustice of weakening the work requirement is that it \ntakes the pressure off the States to assist the hardest to serve, and \nit also requires an inequity among welfare recipients. A person who \ndoes not have a high school degree must work first. Only after such a \nperson has worked 20 hours a week does any education count toward his \nor her work requirement. But a person who is in postsecondary education \nwill not be required to work. Under this amendment, college will count \nfrom the very beginning of the work requirement but reading, writing, \nand arithmetic will not. One of the harshest indictments of the former \nwelfare system is that it shrugged its shoulders at the indifference to \nwelfare dependency. It did nothing to help those with little skills and \neducation to find the path to independence.\n  The key to forcing the States to serve this most needy population is \nthe work participation rate. Every time the work participation rate is \nweakened, it simply makes it easier for the States to do nothing for \nthose who are hardest to serve, and that is the effect of this \namendment. And this we should not do.\n  The work participation requirement on the States is an issue which \nthe Senate has now acted upon four times in the past 3 years. The \nSenate has debated this issue at length, and there is no demonstrated \nneed to reopen the bipartisan welfare reform agreement. The Wellstone \namendment simply does not belong on the higher education bill. Make no \nmistake about this amendment, its purpose is not about providing \neducation to welfare recipients; it will begin to unravel welfare \nreform.\n  The picture emerging from the states is crystal clear: welfare reform \nis working and work is the key reason. In March 1994, a record 5.1 \nmillion families were on the old AFDC program. There are now 3.4 \nmillion families receiving welfare assistance, a decline of 34 percent.\n  As the General Accounting Office found in its recent report to \nCongress on welfare implementation, the ``work first'' strategy has \nbeen a central feature of states' efforts to shift the emphasis from \nentitlement to self-sufficiency.\n  This strategy is working. States and counties which found the \neducation and training model to be unsuccessful in moving recipients \ninto work and self-sufficiency in the past are now helping more \nfamilies find employment.\n  GAO reports that more families are participating in work activities \nthan under the old JOBS programs and are able to keep more of their \nearnings while maintaining eligibility.\n  Another sign of success is in growth in wages. Oregon is among the \nstates which are following the progress of families that have left the \nwelfare rolls.\n  By matching job placements with data on employer-related wages, \nOregon found that between 1993 and 1996, those former recipients who \nremained employed experienced a wage growth averaging 14 percent per \nyear.\n  The states and the families are making progress. This is no time to \nchange direction.\n  This amendment is not about helping individuals get off welfare.\n  The Wellstone amendment is about keeping people on welfare, even \npeople who are seeking college degrees.\n  Let us make it clear that federal law allows a person to receive \nwelfare\n\n[[Page S7821]]\n\nwhile she is in vocational school or even in college. Under current \nlaw, welfare recipients can participate in vocational education \ntraining, job skills training, education directly related to \nemployment, or attend school to earn a high school diploma or GED. All \nof these count as work activities.\n  Indeed, the new welfare law allows states to use welfare funds to pay \nfor expenses related to a person's education if they so choose.\n  There is plenty of flexibility already built into the new welfare \nsystem if the states choose to make accommodations for individuals \npursuing post-secondary education. A number of states have already \ncreated special programs to provide assistance to students while in \ncollege, so models are available. And, because of the decline in the \nwelfare caseload, sanctions for failure to meet the work participation \nrate is not really an issue for all but a couple of states.\n  From a very practical standpoint, the Wellstone amendment is not \nreally needed. But it sends the wrong message at the wrong time.\n  The Wellstone amendment is simply not needed to allow someone to \npursue her educational training she chooses to advance.\n  The evidence of this comes from the ``National Evaluation of Welfare \nto Work Strategies'' which was recently released by the U.S. Department \nof Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Education.\n  This study, as conducted by the Manpower Demonstration Research \nCorporation, tracks over 55,000 individuals in seven sites across the \ncountry.\n  The first report examines the outcomes of welfare recipients in \nAtlanta, Georgia, Grand Rapids, Michigan, and Riverside County, \nCalifornia.\n  The studies include both individuals who are directed toward a ``work \nfirst'' approach and those who are assigned to educational activities.\n  MDRC found that many individuals pursued their educational interests \noutside of the welfare programs which were offered. In Grand Rapids, \nMichigan, for example, MDRC found that about 34 percent of those in \nGrand Rapids ``work first'' approach reported they were already \nenrolled in an education or training program at the point they were \nrandomly assigned to a research group.\n  Moreover, MDRC found individuals were almost as likely, or more \nlikely, to participate in basic education or college outside of the \nJOBS program as they were as part of JOBS.\n  In other words, participation in basic education and college, was \nself-initiated. People are going to pursue educational opportunities if \nthey believe that is in their best interest.\n  Mr. President, the Wellstone amendment is simply another attempt to \nweaken the work participation requirements by excluding people from \nbeing counted under the cap on educational activities.\n  Under the existing cap, no more than 30 percent of individuals \nengaged in work may be included in the calculation of work \nparticipation rates because they are in vocational training or in \neducational activities.\n  The Wellstone amendment contains another feature which is troubling. \nIt sends a very mixed message among those on welfare who are the \nhardest to serve.\n  In general, if an individual is going to college or is in a two-year \nvocational educational program, that individual already has two \nadvantages many welfare recipients do not--academic success and some \nmeans to support the pursuit of higher education. For these \nindividuals, school alone meets the obligation to work 20 hours per \nweek.\n  But if you do not have a high school degree, you go to work first.\n  For these individuals, the state receives credit for their basic \neducation only after they work 20 hours per week.\n  Mr. President, we have encouraging studies coming in which \ndemonstrate that work requirements work.\n  The ``National Evaluation of Welfare-to-Work Strategies'' has found \nthat in terms of comparing a labor force attachment strategy to an \neducation and training strategy, work wins.\n  This study shows that an emphasis on employment leads to higher \nearnings for the welfare family, is less expensive to operate, and \nproduces higher savings to the taxpayers.\n  So, there is evidence to suggest while the education approach is \ngood, work is better. But just as I do not believe that we should re-\nopen welfare reform to impose even tougher work requirements on the \nstates, neither should we adopt the Wellstone amendment. I simply do \nnot believe the rules should be changed at this point in time.\n  More importantly, by weakening the work requirements, we risk falling \nback into the same trap of the old welfare system in which it was all \ntoo easy for the states to do nothing for those who need the most \nassistance in finding the pathway to independence. The Wellstone \namendment turns its back on the hardest to serve and should be \nrejected.\n  Mr. Ford addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I am surprised at the distinguished chairman \nof the Finance Committee for objecting to an individual having the \nopportunity to get an education. He ought to understand better than \nanybody in this Senate Chamber that education is power, education \nlevels the playing field, education gives people an opportunity to do \nthings that they have always wanted to do. The employers will be able \nto reach out to get individuals who are educated and trained. These \npeople we are trying to help here want to get out of welfare. They want \nto be educated. They want better jobs. They want to take care of their \nchildren. If education does not belong on a higher education bill, I \ndon't understand where it belongs.\n  The employers want better employees. Where do you get better \nemployees but educated employees? Where do you find them today? Those \nwho are on welfare, trying to get out of welfare, get out of Catch-22.\n  We have the American Association of Community Colleges that endorses \nthis amendment, the State Directors of Vocational Technical Education \nConsortium, Career College Association, the Children's Defense Fund, \nCenter for Women Policy Studies, American Association of University \nWomen, the National Coalition for Women and Girls in Education, the \nAmerican Council on Education. I could go on and on, of the \nassociations that endorse this amendment.\n  So we are saying here this is going to destroy the welfare program? \nHow in the world are they going to buy a Roth IRA, if they don't have a \nbetter job and have more money so they can save?\n  Mr. President, I hope the distinguished Senator would understand we \nare trying to get them out of poverty, give them a good job, help the \nemployers--and higher education is where this amendment belongs. I hope \nthis doesn't destroy welfare. We have a bipartisan effort here. These \npeople are Democrats and Republicans who have endorsed this amendment.\n  So I am hopeful we would not look at this amendment as destroying the \nwelfare reform bill that I voted for and that I supported. I think this \nis one place, now that it is in place, soon to be a 2-year anniversary, \nthat we would have an opportunity to correct those things that we made \na mistake on. This is one we made a mistake on. It belongs in the \nhigher education bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. Moynihan addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment and, \nfrom the perspective, if I may, of someone who has been involved with \nwelfare dependency for a third of a century and more, and to make two \npoints, not each of which will give complete comfort to either side of \nthe debate.\n  First, to say that when we began to recognize that a different sort \nof person was finding herself on welfare--which is to say the program \nwhich began for widows, and was a temporary bridge program until \nsurvivors insurance matured, as old-age insurance matured; and Francis \nPerkins, who presided over the creation of the Social Security Act, \nwould describe the AFDC program, the typical recipient, as a West \nVirginia miner's widow, someone who wasn't going to work in the mines, \nthis was a time of depression--this was a person who was left with \nchildren and no other source of support. We began to recognize that, \nmore and more, we were getting younger mothers who had never been \nmarried, who had never had,\n\n[[Page S7822]]\n\neither themselves or through a spouse, a relationship to the workforce; \nand we began to think in terms of vocational education.\n  Vocational education was a Federal program. It began in World War I \nwith the idea of training persons for the elementary purposes of \nproviding the skills needed at the time in war industries. That has \nturned out to be a problematic experiment. Too often it became a way of \nproviding jobs for teachers in vocational education programs, and with \nno real cumulative effect upon the recipients it was designed to help. \nHowever, in that interval I have been engaged in this, 33 years, we \nhave seen something quite remarkable in our educational system, the \ndevelopment of a new level of education called the community college, 2 \nyears after high school, to acquire some specific training, often in \ncomplicated tasks for which there is a direct job relationship. That is \nthe way the community colleges have learned to work. They train you at \nthings for which there are jobs.\n  Last evening on the Jim Lehrer show we had a quarter hour segment of \na community college in Austin, TX, where they are running short of \nhigh-tech computer producers and they are taking people in the \ncommunity college there and they are teaching them about as advanced a \ndegree of production skills as you could imagine--people who work with \nmasks over their mouths lest their breath contaminate the infinitely \ncomplex circuitry of the computer chips they are making. This is done \nwith the support of local industries who want those people to be \nemployed and are in need of them and in a hurry for them.\n  This is exactly the sort of work program, training program, that \ntakes people off welfare permanently, as much as you can speak so of \nany individual. It puts them, not just in jobs, but in jobs that \nrequire high levels of training for which there is real demand in this \neconomy. To deny that opportunity to young women because they have been \non welfare is a form of injustice as well as a self-inflicted wound on \nthe society.\n  This is good sense. These are good training programs. These are \npeople who, as the Senator from Kentucky has observed--let them get \nthese 2 years behind them, get into the workforce, and buy Roth IRAs--\nRoth IRAs. The more the better for the people and the more people with \nthis kind of education the more such purchases there will be.\n  Mr. President, I do hope in the interests of good common sense and \nexperience, that this amendment be accepted.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I shall be brief. I am just going to \nsummarize.\n  I thank my colleague. I think Senator Ford and Senator Moynihan said \nit well. Mr. President, I think this is eminently reasonable. I want to \nbe clear one more time, this just gives the States the flexibility to \nallow a mother who is in college or wants to go to college for 2 years, \nto be able to do that and not be penalized for it. No State has to \nadopt this amendment. It is entirely up to the judgment of the States. \nBut right now we have a situation where States face penalties and they \nare put in a position of having to drive some of these women out of \nschool where they could do so much better in terms of employment, so \nmuch better in terms of jobs. There is a wealth of evidence that I \ncould go into, but I think we want to go to a vote.\n  This is the right thing to do. This is a terribly important \ninitiative supported by many Senators who supported the welfare bill, \nand I hope there will be a very strong vote for it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Center for Women \nPolicy Studies, that has over 100 signatures representing children, \nwomen and education organizations in support of this amendment, along \nwith a letter from the National Urban League be printed in the Record. \nSince I don't have time to go into other organizations of support I ask \nthat a list of these organizations from all around the country also be \nprinted in the Record. I would also like to include in the Record that \nI have received letters in support for this amendment from the American \nVocational Association, the American Association of Community Colleges, \nthe Association of Community College Trustees, and letters from a \nnumber of different legislators.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Dear Senator: The undersigned organizations from the \n     women's, children's civil rights, education, and human needs \n     advocacy communities urge your support for an amendment to be \n     offered by Senator Paul Wellstone (D-MN) to S. 1882, the \n     Higher Education Amendments of 1998. The amendment would \n     expand educational opportunities and encourage economic self-\n     sufficiency for welfare recipients by doing the following:\n       Increase from 12 to 24 months the limit on vocational \n     education;\n       Allow 24 months of postsecondary education to count as a \n     ``work activity'';\n       Remove teen parents from the vocational education cap so \n     more adults can; Pursue education.\n       Postsecondary education allows welfare recipients to pursue \n     careers beyond the low wage, short-term jobs usually \n     available to them.\n       Without an education, most women who leave welfare for work \n     will earn wages far below the federal poverty line, even \n     after five years of working (Weisbrot, 1997).\n       Nationally, the economy is projected to create only half as \n     many new low skill jobs as there are welfare recipients \n     targeted to enter the labor market (Weisbrot, 1997).\n       At least half of all new jobs by the year 2000 will require \n     a college-educated workforce (Kates, 1993).\n       Postsecondary education is a cost-effective strategy for \n     permanently moving welfare recipients from welfare to work at \n     a decent wage.\n       African American women holding bachelor's degrees earn \n     $2,002 a month, compared with $1,204 for those with only some \n     college education (Gittell, Vandersall, Holdaway, and Newman, \n     1996).\n       Among families headed by African American women, the \n     poverty rate for heads of households with at least one year \n     of postsecondary education is 21 percent, compared to 51 \n     percent for those with only a high school education (Gittell, \n     Vandersall, Holdaway, and Newman, 1996).\n       Among families headed by Latinos, the poverty rate drops \n     from 41 percent to 18.6 percent with at least one year of \n     postsecondary education (Census Population Survey, as cited \n     in Sherman, 1990).\n       For white women, the poverty rate drops from 22 percent to \n     13 percent (Census Population Survey, as cited in Sherman, \n     1990).\n       On average, women with a college degree earn an additional \n     $3.65/hour (1997 dollars) over the wages of women with only a \n     high school diploma (Spalter-Roth and Hartmann, as cited in \n     Institute for Women's Policy Research, 1998).\n       Postsecondary education breaks the cycle of poverty for \n     women and their children.\n       Benefits extend to the children of educated parents, as \n     they are more likely to take education seriously and aspire \n     to go to college themselves (Gittell, Gross, and Holdaway, \n     1993).\n       There is a strong association between parental income and \n     the income of their children in future years (Gittell, Gross, \n     and Holdaway, 1993).\n       We urge you to support Senator Wellstone's amendment to \n     give TANF recipients the opportunity to pursue postsecondary \n     education and become economically self-sufficient.\n       If you have any questions, please contact Tanya Chin or \n     Kathleen Stoll at the Center for Women Policy Studies, 202/\n     872-1770, or Mikki Holmes in Senator Wellstone's office, 202/\n     224-5641.

Senator Wellstone will be offering his amendment \n     to the Higher Education Amendments of 1998 (S. 1882).\n       The Wellstone Amendment would address a critical flaw in \n     the 1996 welfare reform law (The Personal Responsibility and \n     Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act) that places unrealistic \n     limits on welfare recipients who seek economic self-\n     sufficiency through education. The Amendment would:\n\n       Make 24 months of postsecondary and vocational education a \n     permissible work activity under TANF (Temporary Assistance \n     for Needy Families). Under current law, states can only count \n     12 months of vocational education as a work activity.\n       Remove teen parents from the 30% limitation in the \n     educational cap so that more adults can pursue education.\n\n       If the goal of welfare reform is to place welfare \n     recipients into permanent employment, and we know from \n     studies that people with more education and training have \n     higher earnings and a greater likelihood of being employed, \n     then common sense dictates that access to quality higher \n     education is the key to an effective reform of our welfare \n     system. According to the 1996 Economic Report of the \n     President, by the early 1990s, the earnings differences \n     between high school and college graduates had nearly doubled \n     from 49% in 1979 to 89% in 1993. And presently, each \n     additional year of schooling after high school is worth about \n     5 to 15 percent in additional earnings.\n       Welfare recipients face the same changing economic \n     conditions as any other person seeking employment today. \n     According to a recent report, Education and Training for \n     America's Future (Anthony P. Carnevale, 1998), more skill is \n     not only necessary to get a job, but also to keep one as \n     well. The report notes that education and training \n     increasingly have separated the economic winners from the \n     losers in a global economy where economic and technological \n     change has been increasingly biased in favor of skill. \n     Therefore, our national welfare policy must not be \n     responsible for relegating welfare recipients into the \n     ``economic losers'' category, when we know what it takes to \n     make them winners. If they join the ranks of ``economic \n     winners,'' then their children win and so does society at \n     large.\n       We should do no less for welfare recipients who seek to \n     make themselves permanently employable than what we seek for \n     all others in our quest for improving our national workforce \n     development system.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nSessions now be recognized for up to 10 minutes on his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just for the information of Senators, \nfollowing that, I know our friend and colleague from West Virginia has \nbeen here for some period of time and is prepared to speak on an \namendment, which he has talked with us about. We are prepared to accept \nthe amendment, but he wants to comment about it.\n  In terms of our side, we have one more amendment by the Senator from \nMinnesota, Senator Wellstone, and then an amendment by Senator \nBingaman, and an amendment by Senator Harkin. That is where we are. We \nhaven't been able to get time agreements, but it gives you some idea \nabout the amendments. And then I expect we will have one or two other \nSenators that want to speak on the measure. I think that gives us some \nidea about the work that remains for the evening--at least from our \nside. Is that your understanding?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes. It is our intention to finish tonight and to have \nthe vote on final passage tomorrow morning at 9:30.\n  I just urge everybody to take Senator Sessions' example by getting a \ntime limit and disposing of the amendments. I think this side is \nnearing completion. I don't believe we have any controversial \namendments that will take a great deal of time. So I am really \nexpecting that we can finish tonight, with the cooperation of all \nMembers. Certainly, I look forward to Senator Byrd's comments.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wanted to mention, as well, that I have \nan amendment on a market-based study on interest rates, which we may or \nmay not be able to get to. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I intended to come to the floor today, \nalong with Senators Bob Graham, Mitch McConnell and Paul Coverdell, to \noffer an amendment to the Higher Education Act that would have helped \nmore than 2.5 million students afford a college education.\n  I would like to particularly recognize the outstanding efforts of my \ngood friend from Kentucky, Senator McConnell. He has been a true \nchampion of this issue for quite a number of years. Senator Bob Graham \nof Florida has done an outstanding job of guiding and helping us work \non this amendment and handle it in the proper way. His advice and \nleadership have been crucial in gaining the support for this amendment \nthat we think is necessary for its passage. Let me take a few minutes \nto discuss the concept of prepaid tuition plans and why they are \ncritically important to help America's families.\n  As a parent myself, who has put two children through college--I just \nhad my second one graduate in May, and another one is currently in \ncollege--I know firsthand that America's families are struggling to \nmeet the rising cost of higher education. In fact, American families \nhave already accrued more college debt in the 1990s than during the \nprevious three decades combined. The reason is twofold: The Federal \nGovernment subsidizes student debt with interest breaks and deferred \npayments and penalizes educational savings by taxing the interest that \naccrues on those savings accounts for college.\n  In recent years, however, many families have tackled rising tuition \ncosts by taking advantage of prepaid college tuition plans. These plans \nallow families to purchase tuition credits years in advance. Thanks to \ninnovative programs already established by at least 17 States, like my \nhome State of Alabama, parents can actually lock in today's college \ntuition rates for tomorrow's education.\n  Congress has supported participating families in this effort by \nexpanding the scope of prepaid tuition plans and by deferring taxes on \nthe interest earned when students go off to college.\n  Recently, thanks to the hard work of Senator Coverdell and several \nMembers of the House of Representatives, including Chairman Bill \nArcher, a provision was included in the Coverdell A+ Educational \nAccounts bill, which would make all earnings in all prepaid tuition \nplans tax free. That is, interest that accumulated on the savings would \naccumulate without having to be taxed.\n  Unfortunately, President Clinton has promised to veto that bill on \nhis opposition to several other unrelated provisions--provisions that I \nthink are excellent, but the President has made clear his intention in \nthat regard.\n  Due to his anticipated veto, more than 2.5 million students and their \nfamilies planning to take advantage of prepaid tuition and savings \nprograms over the next decade will be denied the ability to invest in \ntheir children's education using tax-free interest income.\n  Our amendment, modeled after Chairman Archer's and Senator \nCoverdell's efforts during the A+ Educational Accounts conference \ncommittee, would have made earnings in State and private prepaid plans \ncompletely tax free.\n  Currently, most of the interest earned by families saving for college \nis taxed twice. The parent is paying taxes on it when he earns it. Then \nthey set it aside in the college account--even the prepaid tuition \naccounts--and they have to pay taxes on the interest that it earns. On \nthe other hand, the Federal Government subsidizes student loans by \ndeferring interest payments until after graduation and sometimes giving \nlow-interest rate loans. So it is no wonder that American families are \nhaving a hard time saving for college and instead are having to go \nheavily into debt to finance college at a later time. This trend must \nnot continue. As a matter of fact, it is not good public policy.\n  Mr. President, let me take a few minutes to make a very critical \npoint. I had an opportunity this morning to review a standard student \neducation loan agreement, which belongs to one of my staff members. The \nloan, which was used to pay for the final 2 years of his college \neducation, was $13,674.02. My young staffer is currently 25 years old. \nAfter the roughly 15 years it will take to pay off his loan, at which \ntime he will be 40 years of age, he will have paid a total of \n$13,171.64 in interest alone. Mr. President, that will bring his total \npayment for his 2 years in college to $26,845.65; that is nearly double \nthe original loan balance. This is the Federal Government's only \noption, the only way it provides help to families to pay for their \nchildren's education.\n  So in order to provide families a new alternative, the Sessions-\nGraham-McConnell-Coverdell amendment would provide tax-free treatment \nto all prepaid plans for public and private colleges and universities. \nThis would place all savings plans and all schools on an equal playing \nfield.\n  This bipartisan amendment would not only provide American families \nwith more than $1 billion in much-needed tax relief over the next \ndecade, but would also help control the cost of college for all \nstudents. In fact, the track record of existing State prepaid plans \nindicates that working, middle-income families benefit the most from \nthese prepaid plans.\n  Prepaid tuition plans must become law. The Federal Government can no \nlonger subsidize student debt with interest rate breaks and penalize \neducational savings by taxing the interest earned by families who are \ntrying to save for college. Both public and private prepaid tuition \nplans should be held equal by the Federal Government and must be \ncompletely tax free.\n  If these goals are achieved, the Federal Government would be \nproviding families with the help they need to meet the cost of college \nthrough savings rather than through debt. Indeed,\n\n[[Page S7826]]\n\nas a nation we ought to be reviewing all of our laws and all of our \npublic tax policies to make sure we are encouraging savings rather than \nencouraging debt. Too often our policies have been just the opposite.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks several items in support of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 3115, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, unfortunately at this point I will be \nhaving to withdraw this amendment due to the fact that it appears it \nmay be in violation of existing rules governing the revenue proposals \nwhich have to originate in the House of Representatives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendment is \nwithdrawn.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I simply say with regard to the letters \nthat have been introduced, those are letters to me from the Independent \nCollege Association and from the several other groups, such as the \nAmerican Council on Education, that say the steps referred to in this \namendment ``would make prepaid tuition plans more widely available and \nmore attractive for families. By doing this, families will have a \nstrong incentive to begin to save money for college when their children \nare young. And, as with any investment, saving early is vitally \nimportant.''\n  That is the American Council on Education, dated July 9, referring to \nthis amendment.\n  The National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities is \nlikewise supporting this amendment. They say, ``On behalf of the over \n900 independent colleges and universities that make up the National \nAssociation of Independent Colleges and Universities, I want to express \nour appreciation of your efforts.\n  ``We agree that students and families who want to utilize prepaid \ntuition plans should be allowed to dedicate those funds to the \ninstitution of their choice'' to be able to compete on a level playing \nfield.\n  The College Savings Plans Network has likewise supported this \nproposal in a letter to Congressman Archer dated July 2, 1998.\n  The National Association of State Treasurers has adopted this \nresolution. Many State treasurers have formulated this legislation in \nthe State--in fact, the Alabama State Treasury, and former State \nTreasurer George Wallace, Jr., is the one who passed the legislation in \nAlabama for the prepaid tuition plan.\n  Also, The Heritage Foundation has supported this effort.\n\n                              Exhibit One\n\n                                    American Council on Education,\n\n\n                                Government and Public Affairs,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 1998.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sessions: I am writing with respect to the \n     amendment on prepaid tuition plans that you hope to offer \n     when the Senate considers S. 1882, The Higher Education \n     Amendments of 1998.\n       In recent years, states and private sector organizations \n     have begun to offer prepaid tuition plans designed to \n     encourage families to save money for higher education. The \n     American Council on Education supports these efforts. We \n     believe that your amendment would enhance these plans in two \n     important ways. First, it would exclude from federal income \n     tax the value of the plan when the student enrolls in higher \n     education. Second, the amendment would allow private colleges \n     and universities to establish these initiatives.\n       These steps would make prepaid tuition plans more widely \n     available and more attractive for families. By doing this, \n     families will have a strong incentive to begin to save money \n     for college when their children are young. And, as with any \n     investment, saving early is vitally important.\n       We understand that there may be a jurisdictional problem \n     with your amendment and we hope that this can be \n     satisfactorily worked out. If it proves impossible to fix the \n     jurisdictional issue, we will work with you to ensure that \n     your plan is enacted this year.\n       We are enormously grateful for your leadership on this \n     issue of such importance to families and colleges and \n     universities. We look forward to working on it with you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Terry W. Hartle,\n                                            Senior Vice President.\n         National Association of Independent Colleges and \n           Universities\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 1998.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sessions: On behalf of the over 900 \n     independent colleges and universities that make up the \n     National Association of Independent Colleges and \n     Universities, I want to express our appreciation of your \n     efforts to allow private colleges and universities to \n     establish prepaid tuition plans that would enjoy the same tax \n     treatment and preferences as state sponsored plans. We agree \n     that students and families who want to utilize prepared \n     tuition plans should be allowed to dedicate the funds to the \n     institution of their choice. Allowing private colleges and \n     universities to compete on a level playing field in the tax \n     arena is absolutely necessary and fair.\n       We appreciate the parliamentary restrictions of including \n     this language in the Higher Education Reauthorization Act, S. \n     1882, and look forward to working with you to see that this \n     issue is addressed in a manner that will be enacted into law \n     in the very near future.\n       Again, thank you for your efforts. Please do not hesitate \n     to contact me if and when I can be further assistance on this \n     or any issue of importance to independent higher education.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  David L. Warren,\n                                                        President.\n\n\n                                College Savings Plans Network,\n\n                                      Lexington, KY, July 2, 1998.\n     Hon. Bill Archer,\n     U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the College Savings Plans \n     Network, I am writing in support of the proposed amendment by \n     Senator Jeff Sessions to S. 1882, The Higher Education \n     Amendments of 1998. The amendment is designed to increase the \n     nation's saving rate and to improve access to higher \n     education. The College Savings Plans Network (CSPN), the \n     association of the state-sponsored college tuition programs, \n     strongly supports Senator Session's amendment which would \n     establish an exclusion from gross income for amounts \n     distributed from qualified tuition programs to cover \n     qualified higher education expenses. The enactment of this \n     provision would further the public policy of encouraging \n     parents to save for their children's college education, which \n     would provide long-term benefits to the U.S. economy. CSPN \n     urges you to support the amendment to S. 1882.\n       CSPN believes that the tax treatment of the qualified state \n     programs should be carefully crafted to account for the \n     unique design and circumstances in which the state programs \n     operate. The Network supports the amendment because it \n     provides clearer tax treatment for contributions to and \n     distributions from the state-sponsored plans. Clearer tax \n     treatment would encourage college savings, and would reduce \n     the need to borrow, which would provide long-term benefits to \n     over 700,000 families who participate in the state-sponsored \n     qualified tuition programs.\n       Thank you for your strong leadership on this proposal and \n     commitment to expanding the educational opportunities of \n     American families.\n           Very truly yours,\n\n                                          Marshall G. Bennett,\n\n                          President, College Savings Plans Network\n                                  and Mississippi State Treasurer.\n\n                               Resolution\n\n\n           Federal Tax-Exemption for College Tuition Programs\n\n       Urging the Congress and the President to enact bipartisan \n     legislation that will provide for the tax-free treatment of \n     qualified state-sponsored college tuition programs, including \n     both prepaid and savings programs.\n       Whereas, over the last several years, the constantly \n     increasing costs of higher education and decreases in state \n     and Federal funding of higher education have made an \n     affordable, high quality college education increasingly \n     difficult to obtain for everyday Americans; and\n       Whereas, in response, State legislatures created state-\n     sponsored college savings programs to help families afford \n     postsecondary education for their children; and\n       Whereas, the State sponsored programs are designed and \n     operated in a manner to account for the unique nature of each \n     state's educational system; and\n       Whereas, the programs are primarily directed to middle-\n     income working families and encourage and permit these \n     families to save for and send their children to college, \n     where otherwise they may not be able to access postsecondary \n     education without relying on significant borrowing to afford \n     spiraling tuition costs; and\n       Whereas, over the past five years borrowing for higher \n     education expenses has increased more than in the previous \n     three decades; and\n       Whereas, the State sponsored programs are accountable to \n     State-level policymakers, and are subject to close public \n     scrutiny and multiple levels of accountability, which \n     provides strong safeguards to the public's interest in these \n     programs; and\n       Whereas, the Congress, recognizing the unique role states \n     play in providing access to higher education for their \n     citizens, in 1996, passed legislation to improve the tax \n     treatment of State sponsored programs; and\n       Whereas, the Congress, further recognizing the unique role \n     states play in providing access to higher education for their \n     citizens,\n\n[[Page S7827]]\n\n     has included provisions in the Revenue Reconciliation Act \n     that would further clarify and enhance the tax advantages \n     offered to families through qualified state tuition plans, \n     and\n       Whereas, under the proposed legislation, parents will be \n     given greater incentive to save for or prepay a major portion \n     of higher education costs in advance, in increments as little \n     as $15 or $25 a month, which fit easily within their budgets; \n     and\n       Whereas, this legislation is truly bipartisan and has been \n     widely supported by Democratic and Republican members of the \n     House and Senate.\n       Now, Therefore Be It Resolved, That the National \n     Association of State Treasurers does hereby call upon the \n     Congress and the President of the United States to promptly \n     enact legislation providing for tax-free treatment of \n     distributions from qualified state-sponsored college tuition \n     programs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      The Heritage Foundation,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n\n             Another Chance to Help Families Afford College\n\n       Last year, Congress took a big step to help American \n     families save for the huge cost of their children's \n     education. Thanks to the Taxpayers' Relief Act of 1997 \n     (Public Law 105-34) families are now able to establish \n     Education Individual Retirement Accounts (Education IRAs) and \n     deposit up to $500 annually for use later to pay for higher \n     education expenses without having taxes levied on the accrued \n     interest. But in passing this measure, Congress placed undue \n     restrictions on the amount of money families could place in \n     such accounts, and it favored public colleges over private \n     institutions.\n       Now, as the Senate moves to re-authorize the Higher \n     Education Act, and as Congress considers a tax bill, there is \n     another opportunity to help those families with college-bound \n     students while dealing with the deficiencies in current law. \n     An effective policy would:\n       1. Extend to all private tuition savings and prepaid plans \n     the same tax treatment public plans receive. Currently, 28 \n     states have established special programs that allow resident \n     families to save for college costs. Federal income tax on the \n     accrued interest in these state-sponsored accounts is \n     deferred until the account is cashed in to pay for college. \n     However, there are drawbacks to these plans, including the \n     fact that they do not effectively meet the needs of families \n     interested in sending their children to private colleges and \n     universities since the plans are designed specifically to \n     benefit public institutions. Nearly 25 percent of families \n     choose to send their children to a private college or \n     university, yet few state plans serve the needs of this \n     population. Nor do state plans provide a nationwide network \n     of institutions from which participating families may choose, \n     yet 20 percent of students decide to attend an institution \n     outside of their home state. Congress can help fix these \n     deficiencies by giving the same tax treatment to private \n     colleges and universities--or nationwide consortia of these \n     institutions--that establish plans similar to those of the \n     states as it does to the state-sponsored accounts for public \n     colleges.\n       2. Make all interest earned through tuition savings and \n     prepaid plans tax-free. Not only should all tuition savings \n     and prepaid plans receive equal tax treatment, they also \n     should be relieved of the double taxation that currently \n     exists within the tax code (the money being saved is taxed \n     when earned, and the interest on the savings also is taxed). \n     In the case of Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), Roth \n     IRAs and similar retirement plans, Congress has ended double \n     taxation, but not on money placed in education accounts. \n     Ending the double taxation of money in education accounts \n     would both encourage savings for college and be consistent \n     with long term tax reform.\n       Although these two provisions would provide significant \n     relief to the more than two and a half million students and \n     their families who plan to take advantage of tuition savings \n     and prepaid plans, there would not be a significant revenue \n     loss to the federal government. The Joint Committee on \n     Taxation has estimated that granting state tuition savings \n     and prepaid plans tax-free withdrawals would result in a \n     loss to the federal government of just $339 million over \n     the next five years. Since even the most enthusiastic \n     industry estimates of the private market do not anticipate \n     greater participation than is anticipated in the state \n     plans, the total impact on federal revenues for both of \n     the above proposals would be well below $800 million over \n     five years. And even if it is assumed that families saving \n     in private plans were, on average, in a higher tax bracket \n     than those participating in state plans, the total revenue \n     loss would not exceed $1.2 billion over the next five \n     years.\n       But it is in any case erroneous to assume that tuition \n     savings and prepaid plans benefit mainly the wealthy. In \n     fact, the experience of existing state plans indicates that \n     it is working, middle-income families who benefit most. For \n     example, families with an annual income of less than $35,000 \n     purchased 62 percent of the prepaid tuition contracts sold by \n     the state of Pennsylvania in 1996. The average monthly \n     contribution to a family's college savings account during \n     1995 in the state of Kentucky was $43.\n       Several Members of Congress have proposed tax-free savings \n     for college. Senator Paul Coverdell (R-GA), House Ways and \n     Means Chairman Bill Archer (R-TX) and Representatives Dick \n     Armey (R-TX) and Kay Granger (R-TX), gained inclusion of a \n     provision in the Education Savings Act for Public and Private \n     Schools (H.R. 2646), also known as the ``A+ Education \n     Accounts Act,'' that would not only accomplish the above two \n     goals for good tax policy but would also make interest earned \n     on family savings for primary and secondary education tax-\n     free. However, H.R. 2646 would place a $5,000 annual \n     contribution limit on private tuition savings and prepaid \n     plans.\n       Recently, Senators Jeff Sessions (R-AL), Bob Graham (D-FL), \n     and Mitch McConnell (R-KY) have proposed an amendment to the \n     reauthorization of the Higher Education Act (S. 1882) that \n     would accomplish the two goals without any annual \n     contribution limit. The result of these tax measures would be \n     in line with the over-arching goal of the bill, to make \n     attainment of a college diploma a reality for more American \n     students.\n       American families accumulated more college debt during the \n     first five years of the 1990s than the previous three decades \n     combined. Recognizing that this trend cannot continue, \n     several states have established tuition savings and prepaid \n     plans. Now, a nation-wide consortium of more than 50 private \n     schools, with more than 1 million alumni, has launched a \n     similar plan for private institutions. These plans are \n     extremely popular with parents, students, and alumni. They \n     make it easier for families to save for college, and the pre-\n     paid tuition plans also take the uncertainty out of the \n     future cost of college. It is time for Congress and the \n     President to recognize the value of such plans and eliminate \n     the double taxation that exists on interest earned through \n     the programs and to end the disparity that currently exists \n     between public and private colleges.\n\n                                      Stuart M. Butler, Ph.D.,\n\n                                      Vice President, Domestic and\n                                          Economic Policy Studies.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we believe we have a good plan. I want \nto again say how much I appreciate the leadership, advice, and support \ngiven by Senator Bob Graham of Florida. He is an outstanding Senator \nand has been a great aid to this effort. I see him on the floor at this \ntime and would be glad to yield such time as I have remaining to \nSenator Graham.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Has time been \nallotted to the Senator?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I asked for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 47 seconds left.\n  Mr. BYRD. He has yielded that to the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. The Senator from Florida has \n47 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. To my friend from Alabama, I express my appreciation for \nthe kind remarks in bringing this matter to the attention of the \nSenate, even though, because of the rules of the two bodies, we cannot \nconsider it tonight. But I believe what he has essentially done has put \nall of us on alert that we are going to be looking for another \nopportunity to remedy this remaining tax issue with the State college \ntuition plans and thus give to the families of America the assurance \nthat every dollar they invest in a prepaid college tuition contract \nwill go to the education of their children and thus encourage more \nfamilies to participate.\n  Mr. President, I hope that with the message the Senator from Alabama \nhas issued tonight we will soon be able to follow his clarion call.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, does the distinguished Senator from Florida \nneed an additional 2 or 3 minutes or so? I will be glad to wait.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I appreciate, as always, the Senator's graciousness. I \nanticipate that we will have an opportunity to discuss this issue \nagain, I hope soon, and at that time we can actually be making movement \ntoward legislative enactment. I will withhold any further comments \nuntil then. But I express my appreciation to the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the very distinguished Senator from \nFlorida.\n\n\n                         A TREND WORTH STOPPING\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I recently learned of an extremely alarming \nriot which occurred on the campus of Michigan State University. On May \n2, 1998, nearly three thousand students abandoned their dorm rooms and \nvarious other corners of the university's massive campus to protest a \nuniversity\n\n[[Page S7828]]\n\ndecision to end drinking at Munn Field, a popular campus spot where \nstudents gather before and after football games. Outraged students tore \nthrough a fence surrounding the field, thereafter charging into \ndowntown East Lansing, home to the university, to set ablaze one of the \narea's busiest intersections. Police officers were pelted with flying \nbottles, rocks, and bricks, and were only able to quell the scores of \nprotesting students with shots of tear gas.\n  Michigan State University does not stand alone. Both Washington State \nUniversity and Plymouth State College in New Hampshire have experienced \nsimilar protests. Mr. President, our Nation has a serious problem, \nwhich only continues to worsen with each passing day, yet, we in \nCongress have all but ignored this epidemic plaguing our nation's young \npeople. Rather, we have stood on this floor ranting about the \npernicious effects of tobacco, while its evil twin continues to rampage \nacross college campuses throughout the country. I support the efforts \nwe have undertaken to crack down on youth use of tobacco, but is it not \ntime, I ask, to broaden the equally staggering problem of alcohol abuse \namong our young people?\n  I hope that the President and the administration will engage in a \nsimilar crusade against alcohol abuse--similar to that which they have \nled with respect to the use of tobacco.\n  I hear nothing said about alcohol--not a word. The country seems to \nbe silent. It seems to have lost its voice when it comes to alcohol \nabuse.\n  Alcohol, Mr. President, is the drug of choice--the drug of choice \namong teenagers and college students--not tobacco, not marijuana, not \nheroin, but alcohol. Surveys show that over 85 percent of all college \nstudents imbibe alcohol. That is a disgrace.\n  Let me read that again. Over 85 percent of all college students \nimbibe alcohol, whether it be a beer, wine, or some other potent \nconcoction tossed together at a fraternity party. More than 40 percent \nconsume five or more drinks at one sitting within a 2-week period, \notherwise defined as ``binge drinking.'' It really isn't the ``in \nthing,'' Mr. President, and I hope that young people will learn that.\n  In the past year, the media have reported several incidents in which \ncollege students have tragically died due to alcohol poisoning or \nexcessive inebriation, including deaths at Louisiana State University \nand the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In Virginia \nalone, five students died within a one-month timespan in alcohol-\nrelated accidents.\n  If this were some new plague that was being visited upon the country, \npeople would be asking for a remedy.\n  The amendment I have included in the managers' package recognizes ten \nuniversities, colleges, or community colleges across the nation that \nhave responded to this crisis with innovative and effective alcohol \nprevention policies. Under my amendment, each institution receives a \ngrant of $50,000 in recognition of its efforts, subsequently to be used \nto help maintain and improve each respective program. In addition, my \namendment requires the Department of Education to distribute a \npublication identifying these schools and their policies to high school \ncounselors for the information of prospective college-going students \nand their parents. It is my hope that parents and responsible \nstudents--I should say responsible parents and responsible students--\nwill use this information to select schools that are most active in \nhelping students to be students, not drunks--students.\n  Mr. President, over the years, the culture of college has gradually \nchanged from one of academics and concentrated study to one consumed \nwith partying--partying, and nobody benefits from it. Gathering at the \nlibrary with classmates to prepare for an exam has taken a backseat to \nsitting around swilling beers at keg parties or ordering a round of \nshots at the closest bar.\n  Sadly, the process does not always begin in college. Often times, \nexperimentation with alcohol begins in high school, or even earlier in \nthe homes. That is where it begins many times. The examples are set by \nparents.\n  According to the 1995 ``Monitoring the Future'' study conducted by \nthe National Institute on Drug Abuse, 55 percent of 8th graders have \nexperimented with alcohol--55 percent of 8th graders have experimented \nwith alcohol. When I was attending a little two-room school back in the \nmountains of West Virginia, it would never have been thought of, nobody \nwould think of a student's going to school experimenting with alcohol. \nAccording to the study, 71 percent of 10th graders and 81 percent of \nhigh school seniors have experimented with alcohol. What are they doing \nin school? What do their parents think about that? What are their \nparents doing about it? Are the parents doing the same at home?\n  Even more alarming, perhaps, is the widespread occurrence of binge \ndrinking--measured by five or more drinks in a row at least once in the \nprior 2-week period. As indicated by the Monitoring the Future study, \nbinge drinking stands at 15 percent for 8th graders, 24 percent for \n10th graders, and 30 percent for high school seniors. What a shame.\n  Today, alcohol is infesting the lives of vulnerable young children at \nthe hands of irresponsible parents and schools, and students are not \njust walking away from the empty beer bottle with a so-called ``buzz.'' \nIn 1996, approximately 2,315 drivers between the ages of fifteen and \ntwenty lost their lives in alcohol-related traffic deaths.\n  Yet, all the rage is about tobacco. I don't have any criticism of \nthat rage, but why not alcohol also? Nobody hears a peep, not even a \npeep, about alcohol abuse.\n  More than 40 percent of all 16- to 20-year-old deaths result from \nmotor vehicle crashes, about half of whom die in alcohol-related \ncrashes. Nobody reads about tobacco-related crashes. These are alcohol-\nrelated crashes. Where are the administration speakers? Why don't they \nspeak out about alcohol as well? Where are the churches? Where is the \ngreat moral force of the churches in this country anymore?\n  Alcohol is a factor in the three leading causes of death for 15- to \n24-year-olds--accidents, homicides and suicides. There you have it. In \napproximately 50 to 60 percent of youth suicides, alcohol is involved--\nnot tobacco, but alcohol--booze. That is stuff that inflames one's \nmind. Furthermore, links have been shown between alcohol use and teen \npregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases.\n  So, Mr. President, with the drinking onset age becoming younger and \nyounger, colleges each year face an influx of students who already know \nthis drug all too well. Students walk on to college campuses today with \nbooze on the brain--we have heard of water on the knee or water on the \nbrain; these students have booze on the brain--completely apathetic to \ncurriculum, major requirements, and freshman seminar choices.\n  Fraternity parties run amuck with students hankering to get their \nhands on a beer or whatever may be the alcoholic beverage of the night. \nAccording to a national survey recently released by researchers at \nCornell and Southern Illinois universities, nearly three of every four \nfraternity leaders engage in binge drinking, averaging approximately \nfourteen drinks per week. Fourteen drinks per week!\n  Student alcohol abuse is the number one problem on college campuses \nacross the nation, yet, precious little is being done to combat this \ndestructive trend. In 1989, as part of the amendments to the Drug-Free \nSchools and Communities Act, Congress passed a minimum set of \nrequirements for college substance abuse policies as a condition of \nreceiving funds or any other form of financial assistance under any \nFederal Program. These regulations require institutions of higher \neducation to certify to the Department of Education that they have \nimplemented a policy that prohibits the unlawful possession, use, or \ndistribution of drugs or alcohol on college property, or as part of a \ncollege activity, and to distribute to college students a document \ndescribing campus policy on alcohol and other drugs.\n  While many schools reluctantly meet these minimum federal \nrequirements, there are a select few that go far beyond the call of \nduty to combat alcohol abuse on campus. It is these schools, these \ncandles that are glowing in the darkness, that deserve recognition for \ntheir efforts. I have read articles highlighting a northeastern school \nwhich has implemented substance-free housing on campus, reducing binge \ndrinking\n\n[[Page S7829]]\n\nby as much as 30 percent in the past few years as a result of the \nprogram. It is this kind of progress which must be sought by parents \nand educators. However, such significant headway does not happen \novernight, and certainly requires much work and dedication.\n  Again, my amendment names ten institutions of higher education each \nyear with proven effective alcohol prevention policies and awards each \na grant of $50,000 to help get at the root of the problem. These awards \nwould not be conferred haphazardly to schools that craft a pretty \nbrochure on alcohol abuse, but do virtually nothing to enforce what has \nbeen put down on paper. Vacuous words do not have much meaning, but \naction does. There are some terrific programs out there, such as the \none at the aforementioned northeastern school, which should serve as \nmodels for other schools still grappling with alcohol abuse problems. \nMy amendment awards those schools that make a difference.\n  Accordingly, my amendment lays forth explicit criteria which schools \nmust meet in order to be eligible to receive a National Recognition \naward. Applicant colleges must have specific policies implemented on \ncampus, including restrictions on alcohol advertising in campus \npublications and at sporting events, the establishment or expansion of \nalcohol-free living arrangements for all students, and the development \nof partnerships with community members and organizations to further \nalcohol prevention efforts on campus. In addition, my amendment creates \na review board, with members to be appointed by the Secretary of \nEducation, to review and evaluate the applicant's implementation of \nthese policies on campus.\n  Earlier this year, Secretary Shalala urged members of the National \nCollegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) to sever their ties with the \nalcoholic beverage industry, and called on colleges to eliminate \nalcohol advertising from sporting events. I second that motion. After \nall, this is simple common sense. It is unequivocally evident that \nalcohol and sports do not mix, yet colleges continue to endorse \nalcoholic beverage sponsorship of athletic events. One particular \nschool, until recently, actually herded basketball players from the \nlocker room onto the home court by way of an inflatable silver tunnel \nresembling a can of beer!\n  My amendment included in the Higher Education Act begins to touch \nupon some of the fundamental areas which must be addressed in halting \nthis deadly substance from further permeating college campuses. As we \nhave learned this year from the tragic deaths of several promising \nyoung students at some of our finest universities just this past year, \nthe decision to drink alcohol can sometimes mean life or death, even \nwhen an automobile is not involved.\n  Mr. President, I would like to acknowledge Senator Wellstone, and \nthank him for his work on the Labor and Human Resources Committee in \naddressing the issue of college drinking prior to S. 1882 coming to the \nfloor. Senator Wellstone was successful in including an extremely \nimportant counterpart to my amendment which creates a grant program for \ncolleges to establish alcohol and drug treatment, counseling, as well \nas alcohol and drug education. I want to commend Senator Wellstone for \nhis efforts and dedication to fighting alcohol abuse on college \ncampuses.\n  Mr. President, when I was a member of the West Virginia State Senate, \n48 years ago, I was a witness to the execution of a young man named \nJames Hewlett at the West Virginia State Penitentiary, in Moundsville. \nI asked to be a witness because the law at that time required a certain \nnumber of witnesses, to an execution. I asked to be a witness and the \nwarden accepted me as a witness. Before the execution, I told the \nwarden that I wanted to talk with this young man who was going to be \nexecuted at 9 p.m. He had shot a cabdriver in the back and left the \ncabdriver to die by the side of the road after robbing him and then \ndrove off with the cab. This young man was later apprehended in a \ntheater at Montgomery, WV, and was convicted and sentenced to die in \nthe electric chair.\n  He did not wish to have a Chaplain in his cell. He scoffed at the \nidea of religion. But, as the days and weeks wore on, he asked for a \nChaplain, because the Governor did not commute his sentence. And, so, \nthe young man knew that he was going to die.\n  I went into the doomed man's cell that evening and shook his hand. He \nwas perspiring. I said, ``I often speak to young people, 4-H groups, \nBoy Scout groups and Girl Scout groups, and I thought that you might \nhave a message that I could pass on to these young people.''\n  He said, ``Well, tell them to go to Sunday school and church. If I \nhad gone to Sunday school and church, I probably wouldn't be here \ntonight.''\n  I turned to go after a few more words. He said, ``Wait a minute. Tell \nthem something else. Tell them not to drink the stuff that I drank.'' \nThose were his very words. That was almost 50 years ago, but I have \ntold that story over and over to young audiences. ``Tell them not to \ndrink the stuff that I drank.''\n  I said, ``Why do you say that?''\n  The chaplain in his cell spoke up and said, ``Do you see that little \ncrack in the wall up there?''\n  I looked up at the wall and said, ``Yes.''\n  He said, ``If he were to take a couple of drinks, he would try to get \nthrough that little crack in the wall. That's what alcohol does to \nhim.''\n  I said goodbye and left, went back over to the warden's office and, \nat the stroke of 9, we were back in the death house where we watched \nthe execution. That was the story of Jim Hewlett, ``Tell them not to \ndrink the stuff that I drank.''\n  About 30 years later, I was visiting in the northern panhandle of \nWest Virginia and someone said to me, ``Why don't you pay a visit to \nthe home of Father so-and-so. He's very ill, and it might help if you \njust stopped by and said hello.'' I personally did not know the \nclergyman.\n  I said, ``Well, tell me where to go,'' and I went. And the priest was \nthere. He was very ill. I don't know how the subject matter arose, how \nI came to tell this story to him, but I told this same story of having \ntalked with Jim Hewlett just before the execution.\n  I told it in greater detail than I am now telling my colleagues, and \nthe priest just sat and listened. He never said anything. When I \nfinished, he said, ``Yes. That's the way it was. You see, I was the \nchaplain in that cell that night when you came to visit Jim Hewlett.''\n  That young man said to me--those words I will never forget --``Tell \nthem not to drink the stuff I drank.''\n  So I plead to our young people, those young pages who are here in \nthis great Chamber and those who are listening and watching on \ntelevision: Avoid alcohol. Stay away from it. There is nothing good in \nit. And the point is, you may get into an automobile and kill an \ninnocent person--a woman taking her children to school, to the library, \nto the hospital or to church. You may kill them. Smoking tobacco is \nbad, but tobacco won't cause you to drive while drunk.\n  I am not upholding tobacco, but what I am saying is, in this country, \nwe have been engaged in a great crusade against tobacco, but nobody \nlifts a finger, nobody says a word, there is not a peep said about \nalcohol abuse.\n  I implore the young people in this country to stop, look and listen \nbefore you ``drink the stuff'' that Jim Hewlett drank.\n  I thank the managers for accepting my amendment, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. Let me just say to \nmy colleague from West Virginia that it was an honor to work with him \non this amendment. I thank him for his eloquence and for all that he \ndoes in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, other colleagues are here--two colleagues. I am going \nto be quite brief. I am going to speak briefly about an amendment I was \ngoing to offer, and then I was going to ask unanimous consent my slot \nbe eliminated. I wonder if that will be in order.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. That is fine.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. While I have the floor, I ask unanimous consent that \nmy slot be eliminated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I will be very brief, because there are amendments \nthat we\n\n[[Page S7830]]\n\nhave in the evening ahead of us. Let me simply talk about a \nconversation I had with Nils Hasselmo, who was president of the \nUniversity of Minnesota and dropped by my office yesterday. He works \nwith the American Association of Universities. He said, ``Look, Paul, I \nrather you not do this amendment. We in the higher education community \nwant to work with you.'' If so, fine.\n  I want to refer for a moment to a report. This was the Boyer \nCommission on Educating Undergraduates titled ``Reinventing \nUndergraduate Education: A Blueprint for America's Research \nUniversities.'' This was dedicated in memory of Ernest Boyer, who had \nbeen president of the Carnegie Foundation. Many of us knew Ernest Boyer \nas a visionary concerning education.\n  What concerns me about this report that came out a few months ago--\nand there were quite a few front-page stories about it--is the \nfindings.\n  To be very brief, the findings go as follows: That in all too many of \nour large research universities, undergraduates go to these schools and \ntheir tuition is applied, of course, to the finances of these \nuniversities. They go in part because they hear about some of the \nuniversity professors who have excellent reputations, but they never \nsee them as teachers in their classes. It is not uncommon for \nundergraduates, first-year students--basically in their first year--to \nhardly have any professors--associate or full professors. It does seem \nto me if our universities and colleges are going to say they have a \nteaching mission, then there has to be some way that they live up to \nthat mission.\n  I could go on for hours and hours, but let me simply say that as an \nundergraduate many years ago, I experienced this. I have been a rebel \nabout this forever. I think it is just simply unacceptable that in so \nmany of our large research institutions, the graduate students are the \npriority, and the truth of the matter is, the undergraduates are not. I \nthink when parents send their children--women and men--to go to higher \neducation institutions, they have every right to expect that there will \nbe a real emphasis on teaching to go along with that emphasis on \nresearch and that, indeed, in their first year, these students will \nhave a chance to have some of these professors as teachers. That is \nwhat is wrong.\n  I was going to speak to this in an amendment. When I talked with Nils \nHasselmo and talked with others in the higher education community, we \nagreed to bring some presidents together, bring some higher education \npeople together and go through this and see what kind of changes can be \nmade.\n  I know that Mark Yudof at the University of Minnesota is doing some \nvery good work to try and put more of an emphasis on what happens to \nfirst-year students, and I think some of that is coming from the higher \neducation community.\n\n  I have to say, I didn't offer the amendment tonight, but I really \nwant to see some changes take place here, and I believe there are many \nother Senators who will as well. The higher education community has to \nbe accountable. There is a whole lot of Federal grant money that goes \nto these institutions. With all due respect, I think we have a right to \nsay, ``Look, we want to make sure that you don't just give lip service \nto teaching.''\n  By way of conclusion, I want to mention what was in this Carnegie \nreport as a kind of, if you will, bill of rights for students which \ngives us some direction, some sense of direction that I think the \nuniversities can go on:\n\n       (1) By admitting a student, an institution of higher \n     education commits to providing the student maximal \n     opportunities for . . . including--\n       (A) opportunities to learn through inquiry rather than \n     simple transmission of knowledge;\n       (B) training in the skills necessary for oral and written \n     communication at a level that will serve the student both \n     within the institution of higher education and in post-\n     graduate, professional and personal life;\n       (C) appreciation of arts, humanities, sciences, and social \n     sciences, and the opportunity to experience the arts, \n     humanities, sciences, and social sciences at any intensity \n     and depth the student can accommodate; and\n       (D) careful and comprehensive preparation for whatever may \n     lie beyond graduation, whether it be graduate school, \n     professional school, or a first professional position.\n       (2) A student in a research university has the right--\n       (A) to expect to, and to have an opportunity for, work with \n     talented senior researchers to help and guide the student's \n     efforts;\n       (B) to have access to first-class facilities in which to \n     pursue research, including laboratories, libraries, studios, \n     computer systems, and concert halls;\n       (C) to have many options among fields of study, and among \n     directions to move within those fields, including areas and \n     choices not found in other kinds of institutions; and\n       (D) to have opportunities to interact with people of \n     backgrounds, cultures, and experiences different from the \n     student's own background, culture, and experience, and with \n     pursuers of knowledge at every level of accomplishment, from \n     freshmen students to senior research faculty.\n\n  Mr. President, I say to President Hasselmo and others, I look forward \nto having discussions with the higher education communities. I see \nseveral colleagues who are ``education'' Senators--the Senator from \nMaine, the Senator from Vermont. I am going to get a letter out to \nSenators saying if you want to be involved in a roundtable discussion, \nlet's do so. The Chair, the Senator from Utah, has a fierce interest in \neducation. I think he is one of the intellectuals in the U.S. Senate.\n  I hope that we can work with the higher education community. Tonight \nwon't be the debate on the amendment, but I say to my colleagues in \nhigher education, this was my background. I was a teacher, a professor \nfor 20 years. The fact of the matter is, it is time to be more \naccountable. The fact of the matter is, you keep saying that teaching \nis your mission, but with all due respect, there is plenty of evidence \nthat is not so much the case, and we ought to give these first-year \nstudents and these undergraduates a fair shake.\n  I conclude by asking unanimous consent that a series of statements \nand very powerful statements from students around the country in \nrelation to the higher education bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Student Profiles for Higher Education Floor Statement\n\n\n                           distance learning\n\n       Amy Saeland: Amy is a 23-year old student at Northwest \n     Technical College in Bemidji, MN. The distance learning \n     program provides the flexibility she needs to schedule \n     classes around work. However, the current federal student \n     financial assistance restrictions prevent her from fully \n     benefiting from the advantages of distance education.\n       Sue Listerud: (Inver Hills Community College) ``Distance \n     learning is an ideal way for adults to go back to college. \n     Making time to come to campus is extremely difficult. \n     Education and development of new skills allows students to \n     enhance their employability. The non-traditional student \n     needs non-traditional instructing methods.''\n       Lu Schmidtke: (Inver Hills Community College) ``Distance \n     learning allows me to receive credit for knowledge I already \n     have in addition to teaching me a great deal more about the \n     subject. I can do this on my own time at my own pace with a \n     minimum amount of time in class.''\n       Gwen Borgen: ``I am a Dean of Students at Badger School in \n     Badger Minnesota. I am currently pursuing my Masters in \n     Educational Administration through Bemidji State University. \n     Working full-time and trying to obtain this degree is quite a \n     challenge. I am approximately 150 miles from Bemdiji so the \n     convenience of distance learning is phenomenal. I am able to \n     work full-time, raise a family, be involved in community and \n     church and still work on my degree.''\n       Jane Klaers: ``I live in the town of Wabasso, MN. We have \n     about 750 people in our town. I have been taking ITV classes \n     off and on for about 3 or 4 years now through West Community \n     College-Worthington campus. What I like most about these type \n     of classes is that I don't have to travel to a college to \n     take college level classes. To me that is a tremendous \n     advantage. I have 2 small children and having these types of \n     classes has allowed me to continue my college studies. This \n     system is a tremendous service to people such as myself that \n     can't go to the `traditional' classes.''\n       Karen Affinito: Karen was admitted to the Master's program \n     in Education in April 1997. Ms. Affinito works as an Early \n     Intervention Specialist with infants who are at high risk for \n     cognitive and physical developmental problems. She has \n     attempted to continue her education at local traditional \n     educational institutions but found the time constraints of \n     full-time employment and a family to be real barriers to her \n     education. TGSA's distance learning program is making her \n     education possible.\n       Keitha Hatfield: Keitha is an office manager for the Texas \n     Conference of Churches, entered the Graduate School of \n     America's Master's program in Organization and Management in \n     October 1997. Through faculty-guided, self-directed study and \n     the interactive capabilities of telecommunications and \n     computer technology, The Graduate\n\n[[Page S7831]]\n\n     School of America is able to deliver an educational \n     experience that is personal, convenient and of the highest \n     quality. Her goal for her academic program is to develop \n     the skills and knowledge which will enable her to \n     establish a nonprofit foundation devoted to research on \n     social innovation, the public sector, and current social \n     systems. About her studies, Ms. Hatfield writes ``ideas \n     are the most important social force in history'' and ``all \n     these ideas started with one individual, one visionary, \n     one dreamer who knew how to say ``Why?''\n       Susan Arakawa: Susan was admitted to the Graduate School of \n     America's Master's program in Interdisciplinary Studies in \n     February 1996. Ms. Arakawa had worked as an English as a \n     Second Language (ESL) instructor for 10 year prior to \n     beginning her academic work with TGSA; for three of those 10 \n     years, Ms. Arakawa lived, worked and studied in mainland \n     China. Ms. Arakawa has structured her academic program to \n     accomplish the research necessary to write and publish a book \n     about the relations (historic as well as current) between \n     China and the United States. Ms. Arakawa has made excellent \n     progress in her program and has begun work on the final \n     project for her degree.\n       Francis Jock: Francis is a Native American, admitted to the \n     Graduate School of America's Ph.D. program in Organization \n     and Management in June 1994. Previously, he had spent 22 \n     years in military service, achieving the rank of Command \n     Master Chief Petty Officer and managing over 300 enlisted \n     personnel. It was very clear from Mr. Jock's application that \n     he was highly motivated to be a lifelong learner, he listed \n     as one of his personal goals ``to continuously improve my \n     personal growth through continuing education.'' Mr. Jock \n     withdrew from The Graduate School of America in March 1995 \n     due to lack of funding.\n\n\n               Working Many Hours While Going to College\n\n       Eric Alleckson: (1997) Eric Alleckson, a junior and \n     President of the student government at Concordia College. \n     Eric works two part time jobs, received financial assistance \n     from his family, and will graduate with still large loans to \n     repay. ``Some money from loans is quite acceptable, if it is \n     a reasonable amount,'' Eric said, ``[But] the burden of \n     student debt can be as restrictive as no education at all.'' \n     Despite his two jobs and the sacrifice his parents are making \n     financially, Eric says that his education would not be \n     possible if there was no external financial assistance.\n       Abbie Weiss: Abbie will be a junior at Concordia University \n     in St. Paul. She is in a one-parent, middle-class family. \n     With the help of her father and the federal grant program she \n     is able to attend college. She still needs to work three on \n     campus jobs and one off-campus job (25-30 hrs/wk) to pursue \n     her education. Without the help of financial aid, finishing \n     at Concordia will be threatened. ``Financial aid allows \n     students to attend the college of their choice and to excel \n     in their situation. My experience does not stand alone. Many \n     other students are in the same situation that I am in and \n     without help they may not be able to fulfill their dreams.''\n\n\n                         high student loan debt\n\n       Sonja Lenk: (1997) Sonja Lenk, a junior at Moorhead State, \n     was attending college with financial help from MSU work study \n     and her parents' contributions, but will still graduate with \n     approximately $11,000 in student loan debt.\n       Michael Kurowski: Michael, a senior at Winona State \n     University and the MSUSA vice chair elect, received the \n     unsubsidized Stafford loan. He worked three jobs equaling \n     close to 50 hours per week. Michael will have a loan debt of \n     approximately $20,000. (PHOTO)\n       Mario Hernandez: Mario, a senior at Southwest State \n     University, in Marshall, MN, and the MSUSA MVP, received the \n     Pell grant, state grants, the subsidized and unsubsidized \n     Stafford loans. He worked approximately 30 hours per week. \n     Hernandez received scholarships to help dampen the costs. His \n     loan debt is $4500. (PHOTO)\n       Tony Fragnito: Tony, a senior at Bemidji State University, \n     in Bemidji, MN, received the Pell grant all four years of \n     college. He also worked between 35-40 hours per week. \n     Although Tony received one scholarship, most of his financial \n     funding is from loans. His loan debt will be $12,000.\n       Michael V. Nesdahl: Michael, a fifth year senior at \n     Southwest State University, in Marshall, MN, didn't receive \n     any financial aid throughout his five years of college. He \n     worked approximately 40 hours per week and was in the \n     National Guard. Most of his funding was from the military. \n     Nesdahl will have a loan debt of $7300.\n       Tony Rust: Tony, a senior at Southwest State University, \n     and the Minnesota State University Student Association state \n     chair elect, received the Pell grant his freshman year only, \n     the Perkins loan his first three years and the Stafford loan \n     all four years. During his four years of college, Rust has \n     worked at least 20 hours per week in order to pay for tuition \n     and other expenses. His parents have not helped him \n     financially, but he did receive scholarships during his \n     sophomore year. His loan debt will be approximately $20,000.\n       Kay Wendling: Kay, a senior at Winona State, received no \n     financial aid this year. However, in the past three years, \n     Kay received a subsidized Stafford loan. She worked at least \n     16 hours per week off campus and 10 hours per week on campus. \n     She will have a debt of $13,000.\n       Heidi deRuyter: Hedi, a senior at Moorhead State, and MSUSA \n     treasurer and operations officer, received federal loans \n     only. During her four years of college, deRuyter worked at \n     least 20 hours per week. She received some scholarships the \n     first year and her parents usually paid the interest on the \n     loans. She will have a debt of $18,000.\n       Francis Klinkner; Francis, a fifth year senior at Mankato \n     State, and the MSUSA state chair, received no financial aid \n     this year. However, he did receive the Pell and state grants \n     and the Stafford loans during his first four years in \n     college. Francis worked at least 40 per week throughout his \n     four years. His parents paid for his books, otherwise most \n     of his funds came from loans. His debts will be $23,000.\n\n\n                        impact of welfare reform\n\n       Crys Hans: Crys Hans, 28 years old, is transferring to the \n     University of Minnesota from the Hibbing Community College \n     and has maintained a GPA above a 3.8 while raising her 3-\n     year-old daughter and working part time. Crys is determined \n     to achieve financial independence for her and her daughter. \n     However, under the new Welfare Reform legislation, Crys will \n     have ``even greater challenges.'' In six months, her one year \n     of approved education will expire; she will have to work a \n     minimum of 30 hours a week; and, she has to begin paying for \n     child care. Crys is concerned about the impact the new \n     welfare reform guidelines will have on her ability to finish \n     school, secure a good paying job, and support and spend time \n     with her daughter Tiana.\n       Colleen: Colleen, a divorced mother of two, dropped out of \n     high school when she became pregnant. She obtained her GED; \n     worked on a limited basis at a low wage office job; and \n     decided that she needed a college degree to be able to \n     support her family over the long term. She is enrolled in \n     liberal arts classes at Minneapolis Community and Technical \n     College and is doing very well. However, she would like to \n     enroll in the Registered Nursing program to earn an A.S. \n     degree. Because it takes 3 years to complete this degree (due \n     to prerequisites needed), Colleen has had to put her dream on \n     hold because of the welfare reform guidelines. The nursing \n     degree would help Colleen achieve economic self-sufficiency, \n     which office worker positions would not.\n       Camille Martinson: Camile is a single mother of 2 children. \n     She is currently on the Minnesota Family Investment Program \n     (state's new welfare reform program) and receiving AFDC, MA, \n     and food stamps, while attending North Hennepin Technical \n     College. New welfare reform requirements are pressuring her \n     to go to work now for $5.15 an hour, rather than finish her \n     education and be qualified to earn up to $20 an hour as a \n     nurse.\n       Jonia Stanfel: Jonia, a single mother majoring in computer \n     programming at the Minneapolis Community and Technical \n     College, will be finished with her A.S. degree in less than a \n     year. She is getting A's and should be able to support \n     herself and her 3 young children after she graduates. \n     However, last summer she was told by her Stride caseworker \n     that ``we are not supporting education programs.'' She was \n     then told her child care would be discontinued and she must \n     work 20 hours per week to receive her MFIP grant. Because the \n     computer curriculum is rigorous, she knew she could not work, \n     raise her kids and put in the time needed to get her computer \n     degree. So . . . she has taken out a $2,600 loan and is \n     funding her education on her own for the next 9 months. Her \n     question is, ``why wasn't funding available to someone who \n     wanted to earn a two-year degree in a field with guaranteed \n     jobs at high salaries?'' Jonia feels fortunate that her \n     college went to bat for her on the child care funding issue. \n     But what happens to those people who don't have such an \n     advocate?\n       Beth Frenette: Beth, a single mother of a two-year-old, has \n     a clear cut career path in place when the new MFIP guidelines \n     hit. Her plan was to earn a two-year degree and transfer \n     to finish a B.A. degree in Elementary Education. To offset \n     expenses, she was planning to get a job in Human Resources \n     while in school. She began her plan by appealing for MFIP \n     funding for her B.A. degree, but her appeal was denied. \n     The reason: ``if she can get a job now in Human Resources, \n     she doesn't need funding for additional education.'' She \n     then enrolled at Minneapolis Community and Technical \n     College to begin taking her general education \n     requirements, and appealed again for MFIP funding. Her \n     second appeal was also denied, for the same reason stated \n     before. She had submitted a clear education plan at each \n     appeal. With help from our Career Placement Director, \n     Beth's funding has been reinstated, although now she must \n     squeeze 30 hours of work per week into her busy school and \n     family schedule. She will graduate from MCTC in 9 months.\n       Crystal Visneski: Crystal, a single mother of two, is a \n     human services major at Minneapolis Community and Technical \n     College. She is juggling her studies, her children, a part \n     time job, and responsibilities as an MCTC student ambassador. \n     The new work requirement that came with the MFIP guidelines \n     has drastically reduced the amount of time she can spend on \n     her studies, as well as the time she can spend with her \n     children, ages 4\\1/2\\ and 20 months. She will have to miss \n     her son's graduation from preschool in June because she's \n     taking an extra class this summer to ensure that she will \n     finish her degree before the MFIP one-year clock runs out.\n\n[[Page S7832]]\n\n     Taking extra classes each quarter and satisfying the work \n     requirement have created stress that has affected her \n     patience with her children and her ability to focus on her \n     studies. In addition, in the transition between her Stride \n     program and MFIP, she lost her bus passes, her mileage \n     reimbursement, and finally, her child care funding. She is \n     now paying $1,000 a month for the cheapest child care \n     available downtown, which is at the college's child Care \n     Center. She is not eligible for a sliding fee scale because \n     she receives welfare. Crystal is caught in the middle.\n       Latashie Brown: Latashsie, a single mother in her 30's, \n     decided to return to college to enhance her nursing skills \n     and improve her earning power.

Affordable housing and child care are critical \n     to her graduating. (PHOTO)\n\n\n                   How can my family afford college?\n\n       Jacqueline Maddox: Jacqueline is a single parent who is \n     concerned about how to pay for her daughter Bree's college \n     education next year. Her daughter was on the honor roll in \n     high school and is involved in extracurricular activities. \n     Bree's father passed away when she was 13 years old and did \n     not provide for her until he became terminally ill.

This dream was brought to a close when, after the \n     second semester, her state grant was cut off and the only way \n     she could continue would be to take out student loans. Being \n     that she was a single parent with a new baby the idea of \n     compiling new amounts of financial debt was overwhelming. She \n     could see no way out and chose to drop out of school and \n     raise her child. She fully intended coming back to school \n     when her son was in school himself. When her son was 9, he \n     was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder and she needed \n     to care for him full-time. Her second son was born and was \n     diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome in 1993 and is a strong \n     advocate for his proper education services to address his \n     needs. She was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in 1988 and \n     was injured in a car accident in 1995. It wasn't until the \n     accident before anyone mentioned the possibility of getting \n     financial aid through DRS. This program ran out of funds and \n     she then turned to the TRIO program. This program provided \n     her with the support she needed to compete with the updated \n     education field of today. The TRIO programs tutoring and \n     study skills have proved to be indispensable to her.\n       Shannon Ament-Yellowbird: Shannon Ament-Yellowbird, who is \n     a graduate of the University of Minnesota-Duluth, is pursuing \n     her dream of a career in medicine with the support from TRIO \n     Upward Bound and the McNair Post-baccalaureate Achievement \n     program.

After three years of hard work \n     in college, she had to fight to get approved just to stay in \n     school for even one more year. STRIDE agreed to let her stay \n     in school to complete an associate degree, provided she \n     finished by spring of 1999. This was an extremely painful \n     blow to her, especially since she was clearly on the road to \n     transfer and a bachelor's degree.\n\n\n                             binge drinking\n\n       Janice Rabideaux: On November 1, 1997 Janice, a 16-year-old \n     high school student, died from alcohol poisoning at a sleep \n     over party.

The ceremony is a required meeting all \n     pledges must attend in order to become an initiated member of \n     the fraternity. The pledges were taken downstairs together, \n     and after stating an oath, they left with their new ``Big \n     Brothers.'' The sophomore and other pledges were given a \n     variety of beverages which they were expected to drink. The \n     sophomore consumed a 40-ounce bottle of beer and a flask of \n     Southern Comfort liquor. As a result, he became intoxicated, \n     unconscious and unable to properly care for himself sometime \n     near 11 p.m. Then, he was taken upstairs by active members of \n     the fraternity. During various times in the night and the \n     next day, members of the fraternity observed the sophomore \n     student lying unconscious, and members of the Fraternity drew \n     on his skin including drawing a beard on his face. No one \n     could wake up the student as he lay snoring loudly and \n     gurgling. No one called for an ambulance either. After 12 \n     hours of being left alone, another fraternity member went \n     upstairs to check on the sophomore and discovered he was not \n     moving or breathing. Paramedics were called to the scene. He \n     was pronounced dead immediately. The medical examiner \n     estimated his death at 7:00 a.m. He died of pulmonary \n     edema, caused by acute alcohol intoxication. His blood \n     alcohol level was measured to be .250 to .300 at its peak \n     (Iowa law considers a person to be intoxicated at an \n     alcohol level of .1 and .001 for under-aged drinkers.

Holly is diabetic, \n     and annually spends approximately $3,000 for medical \n     expenses.

(Source: AP and Steve \n     King)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from Indiana, who is on the \nfloor, my understanding is that we reached an accommodation or \ncompromise when it comes to higher education and ``minor sports.'' We \nwill have the GAO study that will go forward. And, in addition, we \nalready have language in the bill that does call for a disclosure of \nfinancial information as to what is spent on different sports on the \ncampuses. I think that is really important to a lot of us who were \ninvolved in some of these ``minor sports.'' And I see those sports \nbeing cut right now in our institutions of higher learning.\n  I thank my colleagues for their accommodation. They seem ready to \nspeak. I said I would be brief. I am done, I say to the Senator from \nMaine.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would like to engage in a colloquy with the bill's \nmanager, Senator Jeffords.\n  In Title II, Improving Teacher Quality, the bill authorizes the \nSecretary of Education to award grants to states to reform teacher \npreparation and, on page 363, lines 13-15, ``to ensure that current and \nfuture teachers posses the necessary teaching skills and academic \ncontent knowledge in the subject areas in which the teachers are \nassigned to teach.''\n  In (1) beginning on lines 18, the bill includes as an authorized \nactivity that can be funded by a grant, ``reforms that hold \ninstitutions of higher education with teacher preparation programs \naccountable for preparing teachers who are highly competent in the \nacademic content areas in which teachers plan to teach, which may \ninclude the use of rigorous subject matter competency tests and the \nrequirement that a teacher have an academic major in the subject area, \nor related discipline, in which the teacher plans to teach.''\n  I commend the committee for these provisions and believe they will be \nvery helpful in training good teachers.\n  Could the gentleman clarify a point for me?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I would be pleased to.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The bill uses the language, ``academic content areas \nin which the teachers plan to teach.'' I am concerned that this would \nlimit grants to programs that train teachers pursuing certain academic \nmajors, such as biology or history or French.\n  My concern is that individuals in teacher preparation courses \npreparing to teach in the elementary grades might be excluded. Students \nin preparation to teach at the elementary level would not have an \nacademic major, in the traditional sense that is directly related to \nthe subject that they plan to teach, in part because elementary \nteachers teach all subjects.\n  Yet, I'm sure we all agree that strong teaching, particularly the \nteaching of reading and math at the elementary level, in the primary \ngrades, is critical. It is fundamental to a student's educational \nsuccess in the subsequent grades.\n  Do you not agree?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Absolutely. I agree.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. And so, could you clarify that these funds could be \nused for teacher preparation programs preparing teachers to teach in \nelementary and secondary schools, in particular elementary reading and \nmathematics?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes, clearly, that is the intent. We do not intend to \nexclude the preparation of teachers for teaching at the elementary and \nsecondary level and we agree that good instruction in how to teach \nreading and elementary mathematics should be a major emphasis because \ngiving students a strong foundation in reading and math in the early \nyears is critical to giving them a solid foundation for learning \nthroughout their entire lives.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nspeak about a provision that has been included in the managers' \namendment of the higher education legislation that we are considering. \nSpecifically, I have some reservations about a provision, offered by \nSenator Craig of Idaho, which expresses a sense of Congress regarding \nthe protection of student speech and association rights.\n  I value highly the protections guaranteed to our nation's citizens \nunder the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Freedom of \nspeech and association are cherished rights. They are foundational \nrights, in that the ability to speak freely and criticize the \ngovernment are necessary to ensure that other constitutional rights are \nguaranteed and that the system of government erected in the \nConstitution functions well.\n  However, it must be remembered that the First Amendment was targeted \nagainst government oppression and designed to protect against \ncensorship by the government--not by private individuals or \ninstitutions. The Bill of Rights was adopted to address the concern \nthat the new federal government would not accord sufficient respect for \nthe rights of individual citizens. It protects the citizens from the \ngovernment, not from other citizens. As Thomas Jefferson wrote in a \nDecember 20, 1787 letter to James Madison, ``a bill of rights is what \nthe people are entitled to against every government on earth.'' The \nprotections of the Bill of Rights were designed to check specific \nabuses that can flow from government power; they were neither designed \nnor intended to be a general code of conduct applicable to all \ncitizens. Indeed, a wholesale application of the Bill of Rights to all \nprivate citizens would turn these key protections on their head--\nprovisions designed to safeguard individual liberty would become the \ninstrument for limiting individual liberty.\n  The United States Supreme Court has long recognized the unique role \nof the Bill of Rights as a limitation on government action through the \nstate action doctrine. With the exception of limited circumstances in \nwhich some heavily regulated quasi-private entities are deemed state \nactors for limited purposes, the Supreme Court has refused to treat \nprivate entities as state actors to which the Bill of Rights apply. Two \ncases, Flagg Brothers, Inc. v. Brooks from 1978, and Jackson v. \nMetropolitan Edison Co., from 1974, articulate the Court's position in \nthis area.\n  The notion that the Bill of Rights is directed exclusively at \ngovernment action is implicit in the First Amendment itself. The First \nAmendment protects citizens not only from government regulation of \nspeech, but also limits the government's ability to interfere with the \nright of individuals to join together to form private associations and \norganizations, including private educational institutions. A private \ncollege or university may choose to remain private in nature so that it \ncan maintain control over its educational mission and policies. \nWholesale application of the First Amendment protections to private \ninstitutions does not vindicate the First Amendment right to speech, \nbut rather ends up restricting the First Amendment freedom of \nassociation.\n  None of this is meant to suggest that the federal government should \nnever impose conditions on private institutions that receive federal \nfunds. Although there has been an excessive tendency toward applying \nsuch mandatory conditions, there are situations in which Congress can \nproperly insist that organizations receiving federal funds maintain \ncertain minimum standards or not use the funds for questionable \npurposes. Even in the specific context of federal funds directed to \nprivate institutions of higher learning, it\n\n[[Page S7834]]\n\nmay be appropriate for Congress to insist that beneficiaries afford \nsome rights to their students.\n  My concern is not that the Craig provision favors imposing some \nconditions on these institutions, but that it imports wholesale the \nlimitations and restrictions developed over two centuries of cases \ninterpreting the First Amendment. There is no reason to think that \nliberties designed to protect private individuals and entities from the \ngovernment will strike the appropriate balance in the very different \nrelationship between a student and a private college or university. \nFortunately, the measure before the Senate today is not legislation \nthat would impose the First Amendment directly on private educational \ninstitutions, but rather a sense of the Congress resolution that these \nconstitutional limitations should apply to private institutions. I do \nnot share that sense, and if the measure before the Senate were binding \nlegislation, I would exercise my rights in an effort to change the \nlegislation. However, in light of the non-binding nature of the Craig \nprovision, I am content to note my views and concerns for the record.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1882, the \nHigher Education Reauthorization Act, which is perhaps the most \nimportant piece of legislation Congress will pass this year to ensure \nthat more Americans have a shot at the American Dream.\n  This legislation makes important strides both in improving the \neducation students receive within colleges and universities and in \nincreasing access to higher education.\n  For example, the bill makes significant improvements in teacher \ntraining. It authorizes $300 million for competitive grants to states \nimprove teaching, and it also authorizes $37 million for grants to \ninstitutions with teacher education programs working in partnership \nwith school districts in underserved areas in an effort to recruit \nteachers to communities that are most in need of assistance.\n  It also provides support for institutions that serve large numbers of \nlow-income students. In particular it creates a new authorization for \ntribal colleges, which play an important role in educating students in \nmy state of Nebraska.\n  But most importantly, this legislation is important because it opens \nthe doors of higher education to more individuals. It helps more \nindividuals acquire the knowledge and skills that will help them make \nbetter lives for themselves and their families.\n  Approximately $45 billion in this bill is devoted to postsecondary \ngrants and loans for students. This is wise investment for all \nAmericans because this financial assistance to obtain higher education \nhelps individuals increase their earning power once they graduate. When \nwe increase the income of Americans, we reduce spending and in turn \nreduce the tax burden on our citizens.\n  According to the U.S. Census, college graduates make an average of \n$600,000 more over their lifetime than do individuals without a college \ndegree. That differential has doubled in the last 15 years.\n  An individual with a bachelors degree can expect to earn $1.4 million \nover the course of a lifetime. With a professional degree, that person \ncan earn over $3 million in a lifetime.\n  But currently, on 60% of high school graduates go on to college, and \nby the time they are 25 years old, only about 25% have a college \ndegree. Many young people have the intellectual ability to succeed in \ncollege, but they do not have the financial ability.\n  We still have much work to do as we try to figure out how to make \nhigher education more affordable.\n  Nationwide we have about 10 million students enrolled in four-year \nand two-year public colleges and universities. About 83,000 of those \nstudents are in school in Nebraska.\n  We have about 2.5 million in private institutions--19,000 in \nNebraska. About 36% of students nationwide receive some form of Title \nIV assistance: 22% receive Pell Grants; 22% receive subsidized loans; \n10% receive unsubsidized loans; not to mention a smaller percentage who \nreceive PLUS loans, Federal Work Study, Supplemental Educational \nOpportunity Grants, and Perkins loans.\n  In public institutions in Nebraska, the number of Pell grants is \nabout 20,000. The dollar volume is $27.4 million. And the number of \nloans made to Nebraska students in public institutions is about 40,000. \nThat dollar volume is $137 million.\n  This $137 million is a substantial increase over the 1990-91 loan \ndollar volume, which was $43.5 million. We must figure out how to bring \nstudent loan debt under control.\n  At the same time, we must remember that Title IV assistance goes to \nthose most in need. 91% of Pell recipients have incomes of $30,000 or \nless. 65% of all recipients of subsidized loans have incomes of $30,000 \nor less.\n  This bill is a step in the right direction. It increases the \nauthorization for maximum Pell Grants to $5,000 for 1999-2000. But it \nalso calls for more reporting by institutions on college costs.\n  Reducing college costs and increasing access to higher education must \nbe a joint effort. I am pleased to be a part of this effort.\n  I am also pleased to contribute to this legislation in a number of \nother ways. The bill includes a Web-based education commission to \ndetermine the Federal role in helping parents, students, and teachers \nidentify high-quality educational software.\n  With Senator Wellstone and others, I encouraged the expansion of \ndistance-learning opportunities through the Learn Anytime Anywhere \npartnerships.\n  We must also continue to stress the need for substantive partnerships \nbetween higher education institutions, K-12 institutions, and business \ncommunities.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senate to pass S. 1882 so that all \nAmericans will have a shot at achieving the American Dream.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, we have before us the important task of \nreauthorizing the Higher Education Act for the next five years. I rise \ntoday in support of reauthorization, and I want to congratulate my \nfriend, the Chairman, Senator Jeffords, for his efforts to bring the \nSenate a bill that makes a higher education more affordable to all \nAmericans.\n  The Higher Education Act of 1998 continues a vital component of our \nnation's commitment to providing the very best education possible to \nour citizens. In particular, it is the programs reauthorized in this \nbill that to a great degree determine the shape of our federal presence \nin postsecondary education. In fact, nearly all of the available \nfederal student aid, and about 70 percent of all financial aid awarded \nto postsecondary students, comes as a result of this act. And overall, \nHigher Education Act programs are responsible for an estimated $35 \nbillion in grant, loan, or work-study assistance.\n  As we all know, the principal objective of the HEA is to expand \npostsecondary education opportunities, particularly for low income \nindividuals, as well as increasing the affordability of postsecondary \neducation for moderate income families. Since 1966, the Guaranteed \nStudent Loans Program within the Higher Education Act--now called the \nFederal Family Education Loan (FFEL)--has provided over $143 billion to \nstudents. In 1993, the program reached an all time high of $16.5 \nbillion in new loans.\n  Today, at a time when 71 percent of Americans--71 percent--think a \ncollege education is not affordable for most families, building on \nthese successes is all the more pressing. That is why, throughout the \nreauthorization process, I have expressed the belief that it is \ncritical we ensure the student loan program is strengthened in ways \nthat will increase access.\n  I have always said that there is more to balancing the budget than \nmaking our debits equal our credits. Rather, it's about leadership, \nfiscal responsibility and being visionary in our investments. In order \nto survive the many multi-faceted challenges of the 21st century, we \nwill have to invest heavily --more than ever before--in giving the \nessential tools to our country's greatest natural resource: today's \nstudents who are tomorrow's workforce.\n  That's why, as a member of the Senate Budget Committee, I have \ncontinuously fought to make education a priority during the balanced \nbudget debate, and--specifically--have fought to preserve funding for \nthe Student Loan program. In a world of increasing global competition, \nnow is NOT the time to be reducing the Federal commitment to higher \neducation!\n\n[[Page S7835]]\n\n  The fact is, education is the great equalizer in our society that can \ngive every citizen of our nation--regardless of race, income, or \ngeographic background--the same opportunity to succeed in the global \neconomy of the 21st century. This point is especially important when \none considers that of the new jobs that are being created--and will be \ncreated--more than half of the new jobs that are being created will \nrequire education beyond high school.\n  Education is also the biggest single factor in the so-called ``income \ngap''. Consider these statistics from the Census Bureau: In 1990, for \nexample, the average income for high school graduates was almost \n$18,000. But those who had 1 to 3 years of a college education, earned \non the average $24,000. And those who graduated from college and \nreceived a college diploma received an average salary of $31,000. We \nsimply must ensure that our young people have access to our system of \nhigher education if they are to succeed in the changing global \nenvironment and maximize their earnings potential.\n\n  That's why the bill we're considering is so important. It maintains \nand improves the various grant, loan, and work study assistance \nprograms already available under the Higher Education Act. It reduces \nthe interest rate on student loans. It increases the maximum Pell Grant \naward by $200 per year, up to $5,800 by 2004. It removes various \nbarriers for independent students seeking financial assistance. And it \ncancels loans for students who agree to teach for at least three years \nin high-need areas.\n  This is a significant step forward in our commitment to building a \nbrighter future for the generations that will succeed us. I want to \nthank the members of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources \nfor their work on this bill, and in particular the Committee Chairman, \nSenator Jeffords, for accommodating some of my concerns in his \nmanager's amendment. Because the federal role in higher education \nextends beyond loans, I believe that the changes which were \nincorporated have made for a stronger bill, and I appreciate his \nwillingness to work with me on their inclusion.\n  The first provision increases the personal liability and \nresponsibility of owners of proprietary schools to ensure their \nstudents receive the education that they were promised and purchased. \nThis is important when you consider what happened to students at the \nMaine Academy of Hair Design, where the school was closed and the \nstudents left without recourse--or the education they paid for. I am \npleased that the House bill already contains this provision, and its \ninclusion in the Senate version will ensure that it will be adopted in \nthe upcoming House-Senate conference.\n  The second provision requires the General Accounting Office in \nconsultation with the Inspector General at the Department of Education \nto issue a report to Congress outlining changes in federal law, and \nchanges in administrative procedures at the Department, that would \nensure property transfers, such as the recent one involving Nasson \nCollege and its former owner in my home state of Maine--could be \nprevented in the future. In the case of Nasson, the Department of \nEducation conducted an auction in which purchaser and seller \nrepresented the same individual--the person ultimately responsible for \npaying on the mortgage, who for ten years had failed to make payments \ntoward the $600,000 he owned to the Department, or to pay $28,500 in \nback property taxes to the community. It is an outrage--but, according \nto the Department of Education, perfectly legal. The language in the \nbill will help us in rewriting the law to prevent this from happening \nagain.\n  And finally, I am pleased that the Committee, during markup, included \na provision I authored along with Senator Dodd to address the needs of \nlow-income students who are parents. The ``Child Care Access Means \nParents in Schools'' provision, or ``CAMPUS'', authorizes three-year \ngrants to institutions of higher education to support or help establish \na campus-based child care program serving the needs to low-income \nstudent parents. The Secretary will award grants based on applications \nsubmitted by the institution, and the grant amount will be linked to \nthe institution's funding level for Pell Grants, in order to assure \nthat the program reaches low-income students.\n  Senator Dodd and I have worked together before on child care issues \nand I want to thank him for his leadership on the CAMPUS Act.\n  The bottom line is, students are more likely to remain in school, and \nto graduate sooner and at a higher rate, if they have CAMPUS-based \nchild care. These services are particularly critical for older students \nwho go back to school to get their degree or to improve their skills \nthrough advanced education. This is especially important in today's \neconomy, where people need to continuously train and retrain in order \nto meet the demands of high-tech jobs.\n  Mr. President, this has been a carefully crafted bill that fulfills \none of America's most important needs as we close out this century and \nlook to the next. I wholeheartedly support this reauthorization of the \nHigher Education Act, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to support S. 1882, \nthe Higher Education Act reauthorization bill.\n  The bill has several important features:\n  It authorizes $300 million for reforming and strengthening teacher \ntraining so that teachers will be better prepared to teach elementary \nand secondary students.\n  It continues student loans and increases the maximum authorized Pell \ngrant from $4,500 to $5,800 in 1999 to help students regardless of \nincome level get a college education.\n  It continues federal support for colleges and universities, such as \nscience and engineering programs and graduate fellowships.\n  Education, particularly a college education, can open many doors in \nour society.\n  Today, approximately 22 percent of all jobs in the U.S. require at \nleast a bachelor's degree, up from 15.8 percent in 1996, according to \nOccupational Outlook Quarterly. People with bachelor degrees have \nmedian incomes about 60 percent higher than for those with only a high \nschool education.\n  In California, shifts in the economy make higher education more \nimportant than ever. Service-related jobs, such as those in high \ntechnology, have displaced many traditional manufacturing jobs. These \nnew jobs require a level of knowledge and skill that can for the most \npart only be gained by a college education.\n  There are at least three specific factors that make this bill \nimportant to my state:\n  First, California has 21,000 teachers on emergency credentials and \nwill need up to 300,000 in the next decade.\n  Second, California has many first generation, bilingual and \n``nontraditional'' students, that this bill will assist.\n  Three, the bill provides for increases in several student assistance \nprograms. Californians receive $1.7 billion in federal student \nfinancial aid. Over 400,000 Pell grants go to California students.\n  5th year Pell grant. The Senate today unanimously accepted my \namendment to authorize the Secretary of Education to award on a case-\nby-case basis Pell grants for disadvantaged students for the fifth year \nof teacher education required in California to get a teaching \ncredential. This will enable many disadvantaged students to become \nteachers, at a time when we are facing a severe teacher shortage and \nhave 21,000 teachers in the classroom on emergency credentials.\n  Distance learning. I am also grateful that the managers have accepted \ntwo of my amendments to the distance learning demonstration (teaching \naway from the traditional campus via a computer, teleconferencing or \nother technologies). The manager's amendment includes a clarification \nthat university ``systems'' (e.g., UC system, CSU system) would be \neligible and the bill now authorizes 15 sites, up from 5 authorized in \nthe committee bill.\n  Limited English Proficient Students/School Districts: The bill \nauthorizes state grants for innovative ways to reduce teacher shortages \nin high poverty areas. At my suggestion, the bill includes as eligible \nor target areas, school districts with disproportionate numbers of \nlimited English speaking children. This is especially important in \nCalifornia, where 1.3 million students have limited English \nproficiency,\n\n[[Page S7836]]\n\na tripling since 1986, and where 87 languages are spoken.\n  Study of Few Borrowers: The bill provides that schools whose student \nloan default rate exceeds 25% for three years will be ineligible to \nparticipate in the student loan program. For schools like California's \ncommunity colleges, that have just a few borrowers, this method gives \nthe appearance of having a very high default rate. For example, if the \nschool has only four borrowers but two defaulters, they would have a 50 \npercent default rate. The manager's amendment includes my suggestion of \na study of the effectiveness of this measurement method by September \n30, 1999.\n  Enrollment in California's public schools, the college generation of \nthe future, is growing at three times the national rate. Enrollment in \nthe three major segments of higher education will increase by 28.9 \npercent, or by 549,144 students, between 1996 and 2006, according to \nthe state's Department of Finance.\n  California will have this surge in college applicants because (1) the \nnumber of high school graduates has increased by 22 percent since 1993; \n(2) many adult workers are changing careers by choice because of \norganization restructuring, or to enhance their employment skills; (3) \nmigration to California from other states and countries is continuing; \nand (4) more Californians over 40 are pursuing lifelong learning.\n  California's higher educational system has four components: the \nUniversity of California system, the California State University \nsystem, the community system, and private colleges and universities.\n  The University of California (UC) consists of nine campuses that \nserved 129,257 undergraduate students and 40,605 graduate students in \nfall 1997. UC educates approximately one in twelve of all postsecondary \nstudents in California, and includes the top one-eighth of high school \ngraduates. Total enrollment at UC is projected to grow by about 36,500 \nstudents by fall 2006.\n  In addition to providing instruction in liberal arts and the \nsciences, UC has exclusive public responsibility for doctorate, law, \nmedicine, dentistry, and veterinary medicine degrees. The UC campuses, \nespecially Berkeley and UCLA, are some of the most prestigious public \nor private institutions in the nation and the world.\n  The California State University System (CSU) consists of 22 regional \ncampuses with 276,054 undergraduate students, and 67,725 \npostbaccalaureate and graduate students enrolled in fall 1997. This was \none in six of every student enrolled in higher education in California. \nEnrollment is expected to grow by 31.4 percent or 105,809 students by \nyear 2006.\n  Another characteristic of the CSU system is its large number of \n``nontraditional'' students, students who are older than the usual \ncollege age. This is because many community college graduates transfer \nto CSU and many CSU students are working people seeking to progress \nprofessionally or maintain technical proficiency.\n  CSU's primary function is to provide instruction in the liberal arts \nand sciences and CSU prepares 60 percent of the state's teaching force \nwith 21 teacher preparation programs.\n  The need for new teachers in my state is especially critical because \nthere are currently 31,000 elementary and secondary classrooms being \ntaught by men and women without full teaching credentials.\n  A major emphasis of the bill to which I give my full and enthusiastic \nsupport is to increase support for teacher education and to emphasize \nreform, accountability, and competency. Funds are provided to both \nstates and postsecondary institutions for strengthening teacher \ntraining.\n  Another important element of higher education in California is the \nCalifornia Community system, the largest community college system in \nthe world. Its 106 campuses provided vocational, academic, and \ncommunity service programs to over 1.4 million students of varying \nages, income levels and educational backgrounds in 1997. Roughly three \nof four public postsecondary students were enrolled in community \ncolleges. The system is expected to increase by 28.9 percent as its \nattendance is projected to be over 1.8 million by fall 2006. A notable \nincrease between 1990 and 1997 has been in the age group 50 and older, \nwhich grew by 21 percent.\n  Students at community colleges are older and tend to be employed \nfull-time, many supporting families. Approximately 41 percent of \ncommunity college students are in the 20-29 age group. Older students, \nparticularly those over 40, are seeking postsecondary education for \nseveral reasons, including career enhancement, job displacement, \ndivorce (especially for women), personal growth, and reforms in \ngovernment assistance programs.\n  The student aid provisions of the bill will be particularly helpful \nto these students.\n  The bill also helps three specific types of institutions: Hispanic-\nserving institutions, tribal colleges and universities, and \nhistorically Black colleges and universities. Although California does \nnot have any historically Black universities, more than 2,000 students \ndo attend Hispanic-serving institutions and tribal colleges and \nuniversities. DQ University in Davis serves Native Americans from \nCalifornia and other states; and the National Hispanic University is a \nCalifornia higher education institution with a 25 percent or more \nHispanic enrollment. This reauthorization bill strengthens these \ninstitutions by providing special grant awards to help them serve these \npopulations and to become financially stable.\n  Student financial aid is a critical component of higher education in \nCalifornia. Expenses for tuition and supplies at California's \npostsecondary institutions, public and private, averaged $19,500 during \nthe 1997-98 school year. The California Postsecondary Education \nCommission estimates that 50-55 percent of students at California's \npublic and private institutions are receiving some form of state, \nfederal or institutional financial assistance.\n  Federal student grant and loan programs since 1973 have enabled \npeople to go to college. Tuition at higher education institutions \nthroughout the United States is increasing at rates higher than the \nconsumer price index (CPI) and the growth in family incomes. This is \nparticularly troubling for California, a high cost state. In 1993 the \nCPI was 2.7 percent and average undergraduate fees for the University \nof California system was $3,044.00. The CPI in 1997 was 1.7 percent \nwhile the UC fees rose to $4,166, an increase of 136.9 percent!\n  Total expenses during the 1997-1998 school year to attend the \nUniversity of California at Berkeley were $13,169 a year; at UC San \nDiego, $13,400; at California State University, Chico, $10,000. For \nprivate schools, the costs are more than $20,000 a year--at Occidental, \n$26,000; University of the Pacific, $25,000; and Stanford, $30,000. \nCollege affordability is becoming more difficult.\n  By continuing federal grant and loan programs, this bill will be a \nbig help to many California families.\n  I strongly support S. 1882, the Higher Education Act Reauthorization \nof 1998 because it continues the federal commitment to an important \nendeavor of our society, the pursuit of a college education, \nincreasingly the gateway to economic self-sufficiency. It will also \nrevamp and toughen federal support for teacher training, a dire need in \nmy and most states.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for the teacher training amendment that Senator Bingaman has \noffered. I am proud to be his prime cosponsor, and I want to thank the \nCommittee leadership for agreeing to accept this provision as part of \nthe managers' amendment.\n  The proposal we have put forward addresses an issue critical not just \nto the future of our public schools but to our nation as a whole--the \nquality of teachers who will be preparing our children to be productive \n21st century citizens and to compete in the Information Age economy.\n  There is growing evidence that many of the education schools charged \nwith developing the next generation of teachers are failing at their \nfundamental mission. Our amendment seeks to focus attention on this \nproblem, to push these seedbeds of teaching to set higher standards for \ntheir graduates, to hold them accountable when they don't, and \nultimately to raise up the quality of the next generation of American \nteachers.\n\n[[Page S7837]]\n\n  To understand the importance of this problem, it is important to \nfirst put it into the context of today's education debate. We all \nrecognize that we have many outstanding public schools and many \noutstanding teachers working in them, men and women who are heroes in \nevery sense of the word, for their dedication to helping America's \nstudents to fulfill their potential and realize their dreams. But it is \nbecoming readily apparent that there are also many schools that are not \nmeeting our expectations, that are failing to provide many students \nwith the academic skills they need to succeed in an increasingly \nknowledge-based labor market, and that in particular are denying a \ndistressing number of inner city children any chance of escaping the \npoverty and hopelessness that surrounds them.\n  We hear this over and over from parents, who tell us that they are \ndeeply concerned about the health of our education system and who list \nimproving our schools as their top priority. And we see this over and \nover in the mounting number of alarming studies and surveys that have \nbeen released recently, which taken collectively indicate that we \nremain a nation at risk even 15 years after that landmark report was \nissued.\n  One of the most publicized and compelling warning signs came from the \nlatest results of the TIMSS test, which showed that our 12th-graders \nranked near the bottom of the world in their knowledge of math (19th \nout of 21 nations) and science (16th out of 21). Our advanced students \ndid even worse, scoring dead last in physics.\n  Another troubling indicator came from a broad Public Agenda survey of \nemployers and college professors, the prime consumers of K-12 education \nin this country, which found profound dissatisfaction with the way \npublic schools are preparing students. More than 60 percent of \nemployers and three quarters of professors said they believe that a \nhigh school diploma is no guarantee a student has learned the basics, \nand nearly 7 out of 10 employers said the high school graduates they \nsee are not ready to succeed in the workplace.\n\n  With this heightened scrutiny, it is becoming clear that a big part \nof the problem is the caliber and performance of many of the teachers \nwe count on to help our children meet the increasingly high standards \nwe are setting for them. The fact is that many college students who \nchoose to go into teaching today fall near the bottom of their peer \ngroup academically--a survey of students in 21 different fields of \nstudy found that education majors ranked 17th in their performance on \nthe SAT. For those that go on to become secondary school teachers, a \nstunning member lack any expertise in their core field of instruction--\none national survey found 36 percent did not major or even minor in \ntheir main teaching subject.\n  Also alarming is the dismal performance of many teaching candidates \non state licensing and certification exams and other assessments of \ntheir qualifications. In Hawaii, for example, more than half of the 986 \nhires made in this past school year either failed to pass or complete \ncertification tests that by all accounts have generous cut-off scores. \nIn Long Island, only one in four teaching candidates in a pool of 758 \ncould pass an English test normally given to 11th-graders. And most \nrecently in Massachusetts, in a case that has received national media \nattention, 59 percent of the 1,800 candidates who took the state's \nfirst-ever certification exam flunked a literacy exam that the state \nboard of education chairman rated as at ``about the eighth-grade \nlevel.''\n  The situation in Massachusetts has generated real outrage, and for \ngood reason. Studies have shown conclusively that the quality of \nteaching is one of the greatest determinants of student achievement, \nand also that low-performing students make dramatic gains when they \nstudy with the most knowledgeable teachers. So we should be deeply \ntroubled by the trends we are seeing, especially when we consider that \nthe surge in student enrollment we're expected to face over the next \ndecade will necessitate the hiring of up to 2 million new teachers. If \nwe do not confront this problem now, we could be facing an incompetence \nboom in our schools that would doom our hopes of true education reform.\n  A number of states have begun to respond to the crisis in teacher \nquality and reevaluate their standards for certification and the tests \nthey use to judge subject knowledge. Texas in particular has been at \nthe forefront of this movement, implementing a comprehensive teacher \nquality and accountability plan that among other things will crack down \non education schools that continually churn out unqualified graduates.\n  But this is truly a national problem that demands a national \nresponse, and the legislation we are considering today offers us a \nvaluable opportunity to do something concrete to fix this problem. The \nunderlying bill makes an important step in that direction through the \nnew teacher training title it creates, which will encourage states and \nlocal school districts to: set tougher standards for their \ncertification exams; expand efforts to recruit top-notch teachers in \nhigh-need content areas like math and science; improve their \nprofessional development programs for veteran teachers and mentoring \nprograms for newcomers; and to create new partnerships that will draw \non the expertise and resources of the business and higher education \ncommunities to produce better, more knowledgeable teachers.\n\n  The amendment that Senator Bingaman and I have proposed, and that the \nCommittee leadership graciously accepted, is meant to be a complement \nto that new title, in that it targets the problem of teacher quality at \nits source, the nation's education schools. While there are many \nexcellent training programs interspersed throughout the country, there \nare also a surprising number of schools that are routinely graduating \ninept teaching candidates. Many of these aspiring instructors are \nincapable of passing even the most watered down certification or \nlicensing exams--in fact, the pass rate at more than a few schools is \nbelow 50 percent. This situation is simply unacceptable, given the \nchildren's lives involved, and we believe our amendment will go a long \nway toward fixing it.\n  Among other things, our proposal would force the states, local school \ndistricts and the general public to confront the severity of this \nproblem. The truth is that most people don't know how poor some of \nthese teacher training programs are, in large part because most ed \nschools do not disclose their pass rates as other professional schools \ngenerally do. Our amendment would change that by requiring education \nschools to widely publicize the results of their graduate's performance \non state certification and licensing exams. It would also require each \nstate to collect a broad array of data to produce a report card on \nteacher quality, which in turn would be forwarded to the Department of \nEducation to compile a national report card, allowing us to measure for \nthe first time the caliber of America's teaching force.\n  But this amendment, which is comparable to a provision the House \npassed overwhelmingly, is not just about opening our eyes to bad \nprograms. It's about closing the door on the worst of them, and holding \nthose chronic underperformers accountable. Under our plan, states that \nreceive funding under the Higher Education Act would be required to \nidentify those teacher training programs that are failing and to then \ntake action against them if they do not improve, including withdrawing \nstate approval and terminating financial support. To show that we mean \nbusiness at the Federal level, our amendment would disqualify any \neducation school from participating in the Federal student aid programs \nif a state goes so far as to sever its ties with that program.\n  Mr. President, we recognize that this legislation on its own will not \nmagically turn every new teacher into Socrates. It is going to take a \nlot of hard work in each school district and each individual state to \nchange the way we have been operating for many years. We are convinced \nthat this plan will help to lay the groundwork for a new national \neffort to improve teacher quality, and will thereby make a significant \ncontribution to our broader goal of lasting education reform. Our \noptimism has been reaffirmed by the broad bipartisan support this \namendment has received here in the Senate and the House and by the \nwelcome endorsement we received from both major teachers unions.\n  Again, I want to express my appreciation to the bill managers for \ntheir\n\n[[Page S7838]]\n\nwillingness to accept our amendment, and I look forward to its passage. \nThank you.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, before I begin, I would like to \nthank my colleague, Senator Jeffords, for his leadership on this bill.\n  Mr. President, I believe the reauthorization of the Higher Education \nAct reestablishes our commitment to the young people of our Nation by \nfocusing on one of our Nation's founding principles--opportunity.\n  By improving the quality of teacher training and recruitment, \nincreasing the purchasing power of students through Pell grants and \nother forms of student assistance, and by improving access to higher \neducation for students with disabilities, this legislation provides \nopportunity for the young people of our Nation to seek a higher \neducation.\n  While I could continue to talk about the many merits of this bill, \nthere is one issue that has been of great concern to me and to the \nstudents and parents of my State, and that is the rapidly rising cost \nof tuition. Even as we battle--successfully-every year to give more and \nmore of our Nation's children an opportunity to seek a higher education \nby expanding Federal financial assistance, the cost of tuition \ncontinues to increase far beyond the Consumer Price Index--thus \noffsetting out efforts to expand education opportunities. We are \nwinning the yearly battle but faring not nearly so well in the war.\n  In the 1997-98 school year, average undergraduate yearly tuition and \nfees for public 4-year institutions of higher education were $3.111, \nrepresenting a 97-percent increase from the 1988--89 school year. For \nprivate 4-year institutions, tuition and fees that same year were \n$13,664, representing an increase of 71 percent. As a result, students \nand families have become increasingly dependent on Federal financial \naid in the form of grants and loans. In the 1996-97 academic year, \nFederal loan programs provided over $30 billion in financial aid to \nstudents.\n  Even as we have continued to provide assistance to our students over \nthe last 10 years, a troubled trend has developed. Student financial \naid in the form of loans is disproportionate to the amount of financial \naid received through grants. In the 1996-97 academic school year, 60 \npercent of Federal, State and institutional students financial aid was \ndistributed through loans.\n  The combination of a decline in Federal grants and an increase in \ntuition cost for both public and private institutions has forced many \nstudents and families to seek Federal loans to pay for a higher \neducation. I believe our goal in expanding the availability of student \nloans can't be simply to replace disappearing grants and subsidize vast \ntuition increases. Our goal is to expand opportunity. And so, providing \nmoney is not enough; we must control costs. Some have suggested that \nFederal incentives may be one way to control rising tuition rates. \nWhile this may not be a popular suggestion, we cannot afford to \ncontinue this cycle and this game of cat and mouse with our Federal \neducation dollars.\n\n  Earlier this morning, my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, \naddressed this issue in great detail and made some excellent points \nwith respect to access and affordability. Basically, we're pricing \nparents and students out of the education marketplace by limiting the \nnumber of Federal grants. It is my hope that we can work together to \nchange this disparity in the ratio of loans to grants and to find ways \nto streamline the existing student financial assistance structure so \nthat the good we do here on a bill like this isn't undermined by \ntuition rates which increase even more quickly than our ability to \nadequately meet the financial needs of our students.\n  However, in the meantime, I am pleased that the chairman, Senator \nJeffords, has included a sense-of-the-Senate provision in this bill on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Wyden that expresses these concerns.\n  Mr. President, it was once said that ``education is a social process. \nEducation is growth. Education is not preparation for life; education \nis life itself.'' I believe this bill represents our commitment to our \nstudents by providing them with the access, assistance, and the \nopportunity for a higher education. Education--the process of \nlearning--is what drives us, fulfills us, and inspires us to achieve, \nand I believe it is our collective responsibility as legislators, and \nas citizens of this country, to sustain it. Again, I thank my \ncolleague, Senator Jeffords, the members of the committee and their \nstaff for their work on this important legislation.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Higher \nEducation Reauthorization Act of 1998 (S. 1882). I commend my \ncolleagues, Chairman Jeffords and Senator Kennedy, for their hard work \nand leadership on this most important legislation. There are few pieces \nof legislation in this Congress that are as important to American \nfamilies.\n  I would also like to express my gratitude to Senators Jeffords and \nKennedy for including in this bill two amendments I authored and which \nI think are critically important for students across the nation.\n  The first, the Torricelli Campus Hate Crimes Right to Know Act, would \nexpand the campus security information available to the over 14 million \nstudents and their parents who apply to college every year.\n  In 1990, the Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act, was enacted in \nresponse to a steady rise in violent crime on some college campuses. \nThis legislation paved the way for families to obtain vital security \ninformation about their college campuses. However, it is clear the law \nneeds strengthening. Currently, the Campus Security Act requires \ncolleges to report only those hate crimes motivated by race, religions, \nnational origin, sexual orientation, or ethnicity, and those that \nresult in murder, rape, or aggravated assault. This dual reporting \nrequirement severely limits the ability of prospective students to gain \ninformation about the safety of a campus.\n  Our nation's college campuses should be a refuge from crime, \nparticularly heinous attacks motivated by hatred and bigotry. The \ndisturbing truth, however, is that college campuses are often fertile \nground for bigotry. Twenty-five percent of minority college students \nattending predominantly white colleges have been victims of a hate \ncrime. In 1996, 90 incidents of anti-Semitic activity occurred on \ncollege campuses.\n  Students and their parents have the right to know about any crimes, \nparticularly those involving hatred and bigotry, that were committed on \na college campus they will call home for four or more years. My \nlegislation, which is now part of the Higher Education Act, will ensure \nthey get that information.\n  The Torricelli Campus Hate Crimes Right to Know Act lists hate crimes \nas one of the reportable offenses and expands the definition of a hate \ncrime to include those that result in robbery, burglary, arson, motor \nvehicle theft, vandalism and simple assault. The legislation also \nexpands the definition of a hate crime to include gender and \ndisability.\n  I am grateful to my colleagues, Senators Jeffords and Kennedy for \nincluding this language in the Higher Education Act to provide students \nand their parents with vital information so that they may better \nprotect themselves against such crimes.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to express my gratitude to the \nmanagers of this bill for including another piece of legislation I \nintroduced.\n  This legislation undoes a travesty. We are inadvertently penalizing \nstudent reservists who are called to active duty and deployed overseas \nin places like Bosnia. While these courageous individuals are enduring \ngreat personal sacrifice in the service of their country, we are \nputting them at a financial disadvantage by starting the clock on the \nsix month grace period for paying back their federal student loans.\n  Since the average call-up for a student reservist now lasts for 270 \ndays, the grace period on their loans expires. Instead of returning \nhome to a hero's welcome, they are coming home to a mailbox full of \ndefault notices. Although the Department of Education can grant \ndeferments to these students upon their return, federal law prohibits \nreinstating the six month grace period, so interest continues to accrue \nwhenever they are not attending classes. It is unfair and inconsistent \nwith our increased reliance on the Reserve forces to call up these \nstudents to serve in\n\n[[Page S7839]]\n\nharm's way, and, at the same time, to keep the clock running on their \nsix month grace period for paying back their student loans.\n  This amendment, which is based on legislation I have introduced with \nSenators Sessions, Hutchison, DeWine, Cleland, D'Amato and Bingaman, \nwill not provide these veterans with any special treatment or benefit. \nIt will simply guarantee that the repayment status on their student \nloans will be the same when they return as when they left.\n  These selfless Americans are helping to maintain a tradition that is \nover 350 years old, and extends back in time to before the founding of \nour Republic. Historically, militia and National Guard units have \nfought with honor in all major U.S. military operations from 1637 to \nthe present. Today, these dedicated individuals represent all fifty \nstates and four territories, and truly embody our forefather's vision \nof the American citizen-soldier. Reservists are active participants in \nthe full spectrum of U.S. military operations, from the smallest of \ncontingencies to full-scale theater war, and no major operation can be \nsuccessful without them.\n  Since the start of operation Joint Endeavor almost 1,000 New \nJerseyans have served with the New Jersey Air National Guard in Bosnia, \nand right now there are New Jerseyans on the ground in the Balkans \nfulfilling the requirements of the Dayton Accords. It is important for \nus to acknowledge their sacrifice so that we never forget what it means \nto be truly selfless.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I would like to thank Senators Jeffords \nand Kennedy and their staffs for all of their hard work on the Higher \nEducation Reauthorization Act and for their assistance with these two \namendments.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for S. \n1882, the ``Higher Education Reauthorization Act of 1998. This \nimportant piece of legislation provides the authority for a litany of \neducation programs which are intended to provide low and moderate \nincome families with opportunities for postsecondary education.\n  It is my firm belief that our nation's colleges, universities, and \npost-secondary institutions have been and will continue to be the key \nto equal opportunity and economic advancement in our society. Each \nyear, enrollment increases in postsecondary institutions around the \ncountry as more and more people realize the important role education \nplays in their economic future as well as the personal fulfillment and \ngrowth which can be achieved through higher education. It is imperative \nthat we continue to encourage students of all ages to continue their \nstudies and take advantage of the opportunities available for them at \nour nation's colleges, universities and postsecondary institutions, \nwhich are the finest in the world.\n  The rising cost of college and higher education continues to be a \nmajor concern for American families. Tuition for college continues to \nskyrocket, making it harder and harder for working families to save and \npay for their childrens' education. Over the last twenty years the \naverage tuition at public 4 and 2 year educational institutions has \nincreased by 400% while tuition at private 4 year institutions has \nincreased more than 440%. These are unnerving statistics for parents \njust starting their families, but terrifying to families with college-\nbound children.\n  This bill addresses these financial concerns of American families by \nincreasing the availability of grants and loans to students and their \nfamilies. It also provides students with the lowest loan interest rates \nin nearly two decades. These programs work together to help make \ncollege affordable for millions of Americans and alleviate their \nanxieties about incurring excessive debts.\n  In addition to making college more affordable for all Americans, this \npiece of legislation includes many programs which help strengthen \neducational opportunities for millions of low income or high risk \nstudents. This bill expands early intervention programs such as TRIO. \nAs many of my colleagues know, the TRIO program reaches out to high \nrisk students in high school and provides them with the encouragement, \ntools and personal training necessary to succeed in college. \nPersonally, I have seen the success of the TRIO program in my home \nstate of Arizona where this program has played an important role in \nencouraging Native American and Hispanic children to finish high school \nand to go on to receive their college degree and often their masters \ndegree.\n  Another important component of this bill is the establishment of a \ncomprehensive program promoting statewide reforms to enhance the \nperformance of teachers in the classroom by improving the quality of \nteacher training. Having professional, well-trained teachers is an \nessential component for ensuring that our children achieve high \neducational standards. These new teacher training programs will be held \nto high standards and accountability to ensure that meaningful training \nis occurring. Finally, in our concerted effort to increase the number \nof students entering the teaching profession and serving our nation's \nunderserved urban and rural areas this bill provides financial \nincentives for individuals who enter the teaching profession.\n  By passing this piece of legislation, Congress is strengthening our \nnation's education system while helping students get a college \neducation, which is an important and essential investment for our \ncountry. This is why I am proud to support this bill and commend my \ncolleagues on the Labor Committee for their dedication to this \nimportant matter.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator Jeffords for \nhis leadership in bringing the important Higher Education Act \nAmendments bill to the floor of the Senate. The bill reflects a great \ndeal of hard work and difficult compromises on a number of issues, \nparticularly with regard to the FFELP, the Federal Family Education \nLoan Program.\n  However, there remains an issue of importance to my home state of \nTexas regarding state secondary markets that I and my colleague from \nTexas, Senator Hutchison, are concerned about. While I understand that \nyou did not include a provision in the bill addressing this issue, I \nwould nevertheless ask that you and the other members of the Committee \ncontinue to review the matter and seek an acceptable provision to \naddress it.\n  As you know, each state is authorized to designate one state \nsecondary market that may also act as an eligible lender under the \nFFELP. For most states, which have only one state secondary market, \nthis is not a concern. However, Texas and several other states have \nmultiple state secondary markets. The multiple secondary markets in \nthese states are the only state secondary markets in the country that \nare not considered under the law to be either eligible lenders or \neligible holders of student loans. Rather, these secondary markets must \ngo through the costly and burdensome exercise of utilizing an eligible \nlender bank trustee in order to effectively hold and originate loans.\n  This is inconsistent with the intent of the FFELP--to ensure maximum \naccess to student loan capital, and does not appear to meet any \nsignificant policy objective of the FFELP. Particularly at a time when \nlender yields and the number of lenders under the FFELP are declining, \nit is becoming increasingly important that these multiple secondary \nmarkets have the same ability to add capital to the student loan system \nas the secondary markets in single-market states now have.\n  Moreover, if the multiple secondary markets in Texas and other states \nwere granted eligible lender status, it is my understanding that there \nwould be virtually no change in the level or type of government \nregulation and oversight that these multiple secondary markets would be \nsubject to. In Texas, this regulatory oversight includes a variety of \nstate and federal agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service, the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, the state guarantee agency, the \nstate attorney general, the state bond review agency, state auditors, \nprivate bond rating companies, private auditors, municipal governments, \nand individual boards of directors and corporate officers. While the \nexact type of regulation of multiple secondary markets varies somewhat \nfrom state-to-state, my understanding is that the granting of eligible \nlender status would again not reduce or otherwise change that \noversight.\n  Thank you very much for your willingness to continue to consider this\n\n[[Page S7840]]\n\nissue, and I look forward to working with you in this regard.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator, and I appreciate your support for \nhigher education in Texas and your interest in this particular issue. I \ncertainly understand your concern and your desire to ensure that all \nstate secondary markets are treated equitably and that they are able to \nfully participate in the FFEL Program. I, too, want to see this \nimportant program and all its participants succeed so that students \ncontinue to have adequate access to affordable loans for their post-\nsecondary education goals.\n  While this specific issue is one that we have not yet held hearings \non in the Labor and Human Resources Committee, I am interested in doing \nso in order to thoroughly review the merits of granting eligible lender \nstatus to all state secondary markets. As this process continues, I \nwill certainly seek the input and suggestions of you as well as Senator \nHutchison.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I thank the Senator and I thank the Chair. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, this bill represents a strong bi-partisan \nconsensus on the Labor Committee to ensure that students maintain \naccess to post-secondary education through vital student opportunity \nprograms, such as TRIO; healthy, stable, and streamlined loan programs; \nand a simplified student aid process. I am pleased to have contributed \nto this important bill and look forward to its quick passage today and \non the floor.\n  This bill was developed using several guiding principles. First, we \nstrove to maintain the primary focus of the Higher Education Act since \nits inception in 1965, which is to ensure that students have access and \nopportunity to pursue higher education. We have strengthened the major \nstudent opportunity programs in the Act by focusing more on the needs \nof low-income students through an expanded Pell Grant program, and \nmaking needed reforms to the TRIO programs.\n  In an effort to ensure continued access to higher education programs \nfor all students, these amendments also include a new, low interest \nrate for student loans. This legislation sets a student loan repayment \nrate of 7.43 percent which represents a significant reduction in the \ninterest rate for students. The interest rate that was scheduled to \ntake effect on July 1, 1998 would have destabilized the successful \nFederal Family Loan Program by causing thousands of lenders to stop \nmaking student loans which would have left students without loans for \nthe school year. The interest rate included in these amendments \nprovides a significant reduction to students while maintaining the \nlong-term viability of the student loan programs and ensuring that \nstudents will continue to have access to private loans at the lowest \ninterest rate in 17 years.\n  Another vital principle for these amendments was the improvement and \nmodernization of the student aid delivery system. This legislation \ncreates a Performance-Based Organization (PBO) within the Department of \nEducation aimed at providing quality service to students and parents. \nThe utilization of this PBO which will incorporate the best and most \nsuccessful practices in the private financial sector, coupled with \nother reforms aimed at streamlining the student aid regulatory \nrequirements will result in a better managed and higher quality federal \nstudent aid system.\n\n  A third principle which guided these amendments was the need for \nmuch-needed reform of teacher preparation programs. A recent report \nfound that 36 percent of teachers in the core subjects, such as math \nand science, neither majored nor minored in those subjects. Annually, \nmore than 50,000 under-prepared teachers enter the field, which means \nabout 1 in 4 new teachers are not prepared to meet the enormous \nresponsibilities of teaching. This shortage of qualified teachers is \nthe only real shortage of teachers in this country, and it most \nseriously impacted inner-city students who are often taught by teachers \nwho lack a degree in their subject matter. This problem is growing--\nbetween 1987 and 1991, the proportion of well-qualified new teachers \nentering the field declined from 74% to 67%.\n  I am very pleased that these amendments include a new initiative for \nteacher training and professional development aimed at addressing the \nshortage of qualified teachers in this country which replaces most of \nthe existing teacher preparation programs with a two-pronged approach. \nThis initiative encourages state level reforms intended to produce well \ntrained and highly competent teachers, and local level partnerships \nintended to improve under-performing teacher education programs.\n  States will compete to receive some of these teacher training dollars \nand can use the grants to strengthen their teacher certification \nrequirements, create or expand alternative certification programs to \nattract highly qualified people from other occupations to the teaching \nprofession, to decrease the shortage of highly qualified teachers in \nhigh need areas, or to develop programs which reward excellent teachers \nand remove unqualified teachers.\n  This reauthorization was also guided by a strong desire to streamline \nand consolidate the many programs and activities which are found in the \nHigher Education Act. This Act has become increasingly complex over the \nyears and these amendments make great strides in simplifying the Act \nand better targeting its programs and activities.\n  I would like to thank the staff who have worked on this important \nlegislation for the last year: on Senator Jefford's staff, Susan \nHattan, Jenny Smulson, Scott Giles, Cory Heyman, and Pam Moran have \ndone excellent work on this bill. In addition, Marianna Pierce with \nSenator Kennedy and Suzanne Day with Senator Dodd have worked \ndiligently to ensure that this bill represents a strong bi-partisan \nconsensus. Thank you all so much for your long hours and excellent \nwork.\n  Again, I am pleased to have been a part of crafting this important \nlegislation.\n\n\n                     olympic education scholarship\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to engage the chairman of the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources, Senator Jeffords, in a colloquy \non an important measure which will be a subject of discussion during \nthe House-Senate conference on the Higher Education reauthorization \nAct.\n  It has been observed that America does not send its athletes to the \nOlympic Games, Americans do. Indeed, the U.S. Olympic Committee, whose \nresponsibilities include the support for training and selecting \nathletes to represent the United States in the Olympic and Pan America \nGames, is the only major national Olympic Committee from among the 197 \nparticipating nations that receives no funding whatsoever from its \nfederal or state governments. All funds for training U.S. athletes must \ncome from private sources, including an individual's personal \nresources.\n  In September 2000 more than 800 young American men and women will \ngather in Sydney, Australia to represent their countrymen in the XXVII \nOlympiad. They will join more than 10,000 other athletes from nearly \n200 nations to engage in friendly competition. Many will have spent \nmore than a decade preparing for what Jesse Owens once referred to as \n``fifteen seconds of glory.''\n  As they have since the modern Olympic Games were instituted in 1896, \nAmericans back home will follow with great pride the accomplishments of \nthe U.S. athletes, and will vicariously share in each triumph. But when \nthe Olympic flame is extinguished and our American heroes return home \nmost will leave forever the athletic careers to which they have devoted \nso much of their lives.\n  The greatest homecoming we can prepare for our U.S. athletes is \nassistance in obtaining the educational foundation that will enable \nthem to pursue productive lives outside of their athletic arenas. We \ncan achieve this by reauthorizing the Olympic Education Scholarship \nprogram. Originally authorized in 1992, this important program recently \nexpired; however, reauthorization language has been included in the \nHouse version of the Higher Education Act and it is my hope that our \nSenate conferees will support the House reauthorization of this \nimportant Olympic Education Scholarship program. The $5 million \nauthorization level for this program would be an important step toward \nallowing these\n\n[[Page S7841]]\n\nyoung men and women to simultaneously advance themselves on the \ntraining field and in the classroom.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to say to the Senator from \nMichigan that I am tremendously impressed with the dedication, \ndetermination, and work ethic of our Olympic hopefuls. Given the \nopportunity, the same ethic suggests that they would apply similar \ndedication to academic endeavors. Balancing a schedule of rigorous \ntraining and education is very difficult for any person. Our Olympic \nathletes should be in the position to acquire post-secondary education \nafter representing our country in the Olympic games. For these reasons, \nI pledge to the Senator from Michigan my efforts in the conference to \nconsider the House language which reauthorizes the Olympic Education \nScholarship.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two letters to \nthe Chairman and Ranking Member of the Labor Committee, signed by \nmyself, Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, Senator Wayne Allard, Senator \nDaniel Patrick Moynihan, Senator Spencer Abraham, Senator Alfonse \nD'Amato, Senator Dianne Feinstein, and Senator Barbara Boxer, be \nincluded in the Record following this colloquy.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                    June 26, 1998.\n     Hon. James M. Jeffords, Chairman,\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy, Ranking Member,\n     Labor and Human Resources Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Jim and Ted: We write to request your support for an \n     amendment reauthorizing the Olympic Education Scholarship \n     (OES) program which we wish to have included in your \n     manager's amendment to the Higher Education Reauthorization \n     Act of 1998 (HEA). Originally authorized in 1992, this \n     important program recently expired. Reauthorization language \n     has been included in the House version of HEA. A copy of our \n     proposed amendment is attached.\n       The OES program will help America's athletes advance their \n     education while training at U.S. Olympic Training Centers \n     through a targeted educational scholarship program. Without \n     such a program, many American athletes have been forced to \n     put aside higher education as they deal with the \n     extraordinary demands of Olympic training. Sadly, once their \n     Olympic careers are over, many of these athletes find \n     themselves without the educational tools necessary to move \n     forward. The $5 million authorization level for this program \n     would be an important step toward allowing these young men \n     and women to simultaneously advance themselves on the \n     training field and in the classroom. This is particularly \n     true for the Olympic athletes who train at the USOC training \n     centers in Lake Placid, New York; Colorado Springs, Colorado, \n     San Diego, California; and Marquette, Michigan.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carl Levin.\n     Daniel Patrick Moynihan.\n     Spencer Abraham.\n     Ben Nighthorse Campbell.\n     Wayne Allard.\n     Alfonse D'Amato.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                     July 8, 1998.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Labor and Human Resources, \n         Dirksen Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I am writing to request that you \n     include in your manager's amendment to S. 1882, the Higher \n     Education Act of 1965, support for the Olympic Training \n     Scholarship Program.\n       The program provides financial support for American \n     athletes with their education while they train for the \n     Olympics. Many of our Olympic athletes have had to either \n     postpone their education while they train or forego \n     opportunities to participate in the Olympics. Unfortunately, \n     many who postpone their education often find themselves \n     without sufficient education to establish professional \n     careers. The $5 million authorization level for this program \n     would allow these young men and women to simultaneously study \n     and train for the Olympics.\n       I appreciate the support of the committee and look forward \n     to working with you to address California's needs. Please do \n     not hesitate to call on me if I can be of further assistance.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                 Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                     July 9, 1998.\n     Hon. James M. Jeffords,\n     Chairman,\n     Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to request your support for \n     including a reauthorization of the Olympic Education \n     Scholarship (OES) program in the manager's amendment to the \n     Higher Education Reauthorization Act of 1998.\n       The OES program helps America's athletes advance their \n     education while training at U.S. Olympic Training Centers \n     through a targeted educational scholarship program. Without \n     this program, many American athletes may be forced to \n     postpone higher education due to fiscal restraints. Once \n     their Olympic careers are over, many of these athletes are \n     without the educational background necessary to move into \n     professional careers. The $5 million authorization level for \n     the Olympic Education Scholarship program would be an \n     important step toward allowing these young men and women to \n     advance themselves both on the training field and in the \n     classroom.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Barbara Boxer,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n\n                 faculty retirement incentive provision\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today along with my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Moynihan, to address the faculty retirement \nincentive provisions contained in the House-passed version of the \nReauthorization of the Higher Education Act. This provision amends the \nAge Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) to allow the use of \nage-based incentives for the voluntary retirement of faculty at \ncolleges and universities.\n  In the House, Congressman Fawell worked to include this provision in \nthe Higher Education Act, and we thank him for his leadership on this \nissue. Here in the Senate, Senator Moynihan and I have introduced an \nsimilar provision in the last two Congresses. I am please that Congress \nand the President will have an opportunity this year to pass this \nimportant legislation.\n  This legislation, called the Faculty Retirement Incentive Act, will \nclarify that institutions may establish plans that give faculty who \nwish to retire early financial assistance in doing so. Further it would \nhelp to ensure that academic institutions will be able to make \nnecessary new hires, particularly in expanding disciplines and new \nfields. For those who are concerned about potential recrimination if a \nfaculty member would choose not to retire early, the double protections \nof the ADEA and the tenure system provide effective safeguards against \ncoercion. It is also important to note that current law expressly \npermits the type of age-based benefit for employees participating in \ndefined-benefit plans. Most colleges and universities, however, \nmaintain defined-contribution retirement plans for tenured faculty.\n  In January, the bipartisan National Commission on the Cost of Higher \nEducation included this legislation initiative in its recommendations \nto check the skyrocketing cost of a college education. The Commission \nrecommended that ``Congress enact a clarification to the Age \nDiscrimination in Employment Act to ensure that institutions offering \ndefined contribution retirement programs are able to offer early \nretirement incentives to tenured faculty members.''\n  The Faculty Retirement Incentive Act has the active support of a \nnumber of organizations, including the American Association of \nUniversity Professors, the American Council on Education, the American \nAssociation of Community Colleges, the American Association of State \nColleges and Universities, the Association of American Universities, \nthe Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities, the Association \nof Community College Trustees, the Association of Jesuit Colleges and \nUniversities, the University Personnel Association, the Council of \nIndependent Colleges, the National Association of Independent Colleges \nand Universities, the National Association of State Universities and \nLand Grant Colleges, and the National Association of Student Personnel \nAdministrators.\n  I feel it is important that Congress enact this important legislation \nand I know my colleague from New York shares this same belief.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. It has been a pleasure to work with my colleague from \nMissouri on the Faculty Retirement Incentive Act. Before I discuss the \nspecifics of our bill, however, I would just like to commend the \nChairman, Senator Jeffords; the Ranking Minority Member, Senator \nKennedy; and the other Committee members for the bipartisan way they \nhave gone about the business of reauthorizing the Higher Education Act. \nI think they have done an outstanding job.\n  It has taken us several years to address the need of institutions of \nhigher education to offer age-based incentives for the voluntary \nretirement of faculty. In 1990, Congress passed the Older\n\n[[Page S7842]]\n\nWorkers Benefit Protection Act (OWBRA) which made early retirement \nincentives permissible in the context of defined-benefit retirement \nplans, but did not address the status of such incentives in the context \nof defined-contribution retirement plans. Defined-contribution \nretirement plans are most popular with tenured faculty due to their \npension portability. The OWBRA did not preclude defined-contribution \nretirement plans, but by not addressing them at all, it added to the \nambiguity surrounding the matter. Functionally, early retirement \nincentives operate in the same manner for both types of plans. There is \ncontinued uncertainty, however, whether early retirement incentives \nwith an upper-age limit that are offered to tenured faculty conflict \nwith the purpose of the ADEA of prohibiting arbitrary age \ndiscrimination.\n  Inclusion of the Faculty Retirement Incentive Act in the \nReauthorization of the Higher Education Act will provide a safe harbor \nfor colleges and universities by clarifying that the early retirement \nincentives are permitted by the ADEA. Senator Ashcroft and I believe \nthat the faculty retirement incentive provision will benefit colleges \nand universities, as well as those faculty who choose to participate. \nAs officials for the American Association of University Professors have \nstated, this provision will ``provide greater flexibility in faculty \nretirement planning, offer a substantial retirement benefit to those \nprofessors who choose to retire under the terms of an incentive plan, \nand leave other professors whole in their choice to continue their \ncareers.''\n  Senator Ashcroft and I intended to offer our bill as an amendment to \nthe reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, but the Chairman \ninformed us that there is broad support among Committee members for the \nHouse-passed provision, and that this issue can be resolved in the \nConference Committee.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I would like to thank both Senators Moynihan and \nSenator Ashcroft for their diligent work on tenured faculty retirement \nincentives, and for their cooperation. I want to assure my two \ncolleagues that there is, indeed, broad support for the measure and \nthat I am confident that Senate conferees will give the House-passed \nprovision the consideration it is due.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, included in the manager's package of \namendments to the higher education bill is a resolution I introduced \nlast March on binge drinking on college campuses.\n  This was the same resolution that was introduced in the other body by \nRepresentative Joe Kennedy--and virtually the same as what was adopted \nby the other body in its version of the Higher Education Act.\n  I want to take a few minutes to talk about my resolution--and why \nthis issue is so important. But, first, let me thank Senators Kennedy, \nDodd, Jeffords, and Coats for accepting the resolution.\n  Let me also thank Representative Joe Kennedy, who came up with the \nidea for this resolution and has long been trying to bring alcohol-\nrelated problems to the attention of Members of Congress.\n  And, finally, let me thank the Center for Science in the Public \nInterest, which endorsed the resolution early on and has worked \ntirelessly to get it passed.\n  Mr. President, I think every one of my colleagues has heard or read \nabout college students across the country--from Louisiana to \nMassachusetts to Virginia--who fell drunk out of dorm room windows or \nconsumed so much alcohol, so fast that it literally poisoned them.\n  There were at least 18 such deaths this last academic year.\n  And, Mr. President, I think every one of my colleagues saw the news \nreports from this past spring on the riots--yes, riots--on several \ncollege campuses across the country--from Washington to Michigan to \nOhio.\n  We saw police wearing riot gear; carrying shields; and firing tear \ngas into throngs of drunk college students.\n  These riots were either alcohol-induced--parties that got out of \ncontrol--or were based on a peculiar notion--that underage college \nstudents should have a right to get drunk.\n  That's what binge drinking is. There is a technical definition for \nthe academics who study this problem--and I'll talk about that in a \nminute. But, in layman's terms, binge drinking is simply the idea that \nyou drink to get drunk, or, as a recent article in the Washington Post \nmagazine put it, it is where ``drinking isn't part of the party; it is \nthe party.''\n  And, binge drinking is, according to many university presidents, the \nbiggest problem facing America's colleges today.\n  Let me repeat that. The biggest issue facing America's colleges--\naccording to many college president's themselves--is not raising money \nfor the university. Not ensuring high academic standards. Not finding \ntop quality faculty. No, it's binge drinking.\n  There is a reason for that. And, it has to do with more than just the \n18 college students who died this last year--tragic as that is.\n  According to a study by Harvard University, 44 percent of college \nstudents are binge drinkers--that is, technically, for men, consuming \nfive drinks in one sitting during a 2-week period, and for women, \nconsuming four drinks in one sitting.\n  Again, 44 percent of college students are binge drinkers.\n  Nearly one in every five college students is a frequent binge \ndrinker--that is, binge drinking three or more times in a 2-week \nperiod.\n  And, almost half of all freshmen--18 year olds--binge in their first \nweek at school.\n  But, it even goes deeper than that--deeper than the 18 deaths; deeper \nthan the 44 percent of students who are binge drinkers.\n  The reason that binge drinking is the most important issue facing \ncolleges today is because binge drinking affects everyone on campus--\neven those college students who do not during--and even the majority of \ncollege students who are not binge drinkers. They are all affected by \nthose who are.\n  Talk to a student who lives in a dorm room next to someone who drinks \na lot, and I can guarantee you that he or she does not get many \npeaceful nights of sleep--and does not get many peaceful moments to \nstudy.\n  The greater the number of binge drinkers at a school, the greater the \nchances are that a student will be hit, pushed, insulted, assaulted--\nand of being the recipient of an unwanted sexual advance.\n  And, alcohol is involved in most campus rapes, violent crimes, \nstudent suicides, and fraternity hazing incidents. Many of the victims \nof these crimes are not the ones doing the drinking.\n  You know, we have heard a lot in the last decade or more about the \nconnection between alcohol and car accidents, where those who die or \nare injured are often innocent victims who were not drinking.\n  And, there has been a great effort--led by Mothers Against Drunk \nDriving, a group for which I have the highest respect--to educate the \npublic and prevent the tragedy.\n  But, there is also a growing body of evidence showing a link between \nalcohol and other crimes and irresponsible behaviors.\n  There is a link between alcohol and unsafe sex; between alcohol and \nsuicide; between alcohol and rape; between alcohol and violence.\n  And, nowhere is this link more prevalent than on college campuses.\n  Unfortunately, there are many people out there--including many \nofficials on college campuses--who look at binge drinking by college \nstudents as just part of the ``campus experience''--as just some ``rite \nof passage'' to adulthood.\n  Well, I make no apologies for saying that drinking yourself to death \nis no ``rite.'' It's just plan stupid.\n  And, I make no apologies for saying that those who overlook the \nproblem are contributing to it.\n  It is time for the culture on college campuses to change--before \nsomeone else's son or daughter becomes another statistic.\n  We need to bring the problem of binge drinking among college students \nto the attention of the American people--to educate them and to prevent \nthe tragedies associated with it--just as we have done with drunk \ndriving.\n  So, Mr. President, my resolution would call on all college and \nuniversity presidents to recognize and acknowledge the problem--and \nthen to find solutions.\n\n[[Page S7843]]\n\n  Specifically, my resolution expresses the sense of the Senate that \nevery college and university president should carry out six specific \nactivities to reduce alcohol consumption on college campuses.\n  (1) To appoint a task force to establish a policy on reducing alcohol \nand other drug-related problems;\n  (2) To provide students with the opportunity to live in an alcohol-\nfree environment;\n  (3) To enforce a zero tolerance policy on the consumption of alcohol \nby minors;\n  (4) To eliminate alcoholic beverage-related sponsorship of on-campus \nevents;\n  (5) To enforce vigorously a college's disciplinary codes against \nthose who violate campus alcohol policies; and\n  (6) To work closely with the local officials in the town in which the \ncollege is located.\n  Mr. President, these activities are very similar to what is currently \nhappening at the University of Delaware under the leadership of \nPresident David Roselle.\n  They need to happen on every college campus in America.\n  Now, there are some who say that this is just a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution--it just expresses our opinion. True. But, Mr. President, we \nmust start somewhere.\n  I believe that if we begin to take the problem seriously--and if \ncolleges begin to seriously address the problem--we can begin to make a \ndifference.\n  The lives of students can be saved--and the quality of life on our \ncollege campuses will be better.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for their support and for including my \nresolution in the bill.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I want to commend Senators \nJeffords, Kennedy, Coats, and Dodd for their efforts in putting this \nbill together, and thank them for working with me to include several of \nmy priorities in the bill.\n  No issue is as important to our future as education. When I was \ngrowing up, it was possible to graduate from high school and get a job \nas a police officer, a firefighter, or a clerk, and earn enough to \nraise and support a family. Mechanics used to train for their work on \nthe job. The nursing profession used to consist of women who \napprenticed in hospitals.\n  Times have changed. Now, if you want to be a airline mechanic, you \nneed four years of college. Nursing is a degree program, and there are \nsub-specialities of nurses who are highly and scientifically educated. \nOne recent advertisement for a maintenance technician stated the job \nrequired an understanding of ``basic principles of electricity, \nmechanical systems, and fluid power.'' By the year 2000, the Department \nof Labor estimates that more than half of all new jobs will require an \neducation beyond high school.\n  A higher education has never been as important as it is today. \nUnfortunately, while the value of a higher education is increasing, so \nis its cost. According to the U.S. General Accounting Office, tuition \nas a percentage of median household income has nearly doubled over the \nlast 15 years--from 4.5 percent in 1981, to 8.9 percent in 1995. In 14 \nstates, tuition is more than 10 percent of median household income. In \n30 states, tuition is more than eight percent of household income. In \nall but one state, tuition is 1995 was more than it was 15 years ago.\n  The GAO reports that tuition at public, four-year colleges and \nuniversities increased 234 percent in 15 years. By contrast, the cost \nof medical care has gone up 182 percent, new cars by 106 percent, new \nhouses by 101 percent, median household income by 82 percent, and food \nby 66 percent. The Consumer Price Index has risen 74 percent.\n  The exploding cost of college means that access to higher education \nis getting more and more out of reach for working- and middle-class \nAmericans. The more tuition goes up, the more students will be priced \nout of their opportunity to pursue the American Dream.\n  That is exactly the wrong direction for our country. As President \nClinton said in his 1997 State of the Union, ``education is a critical \nnational security issue for our future.'' He is absolutely right. In \norder to compete with cheap, third-world labor in a global economy, and \nto maintain the rising standard of living to which we have grown \naccustomed, America will need a workforce even better trained than it \nis now.\n  Last year in Davos, Switzerland, world economic leaders met to \ndiscuss the effects of technological change on the global market. They \nnoted that if education and training policies do not keep pace with \ntechnological innovation, the gap between the ``knows'' and the ``know-\nnots'' will grow, increasing the disparities in wealth and capacity, \nand the ability of industrialized nations to remain competitive will \nshrink.\n  It that is the case, we should be working overtime to ensure that no \nstudent is barred from college because of a lack of financial \nresources. The legislation before us today goes a long way toward \nachieving that goal. It will standardize and make available information \nabout college costs, so we will know exactly why costs are increasing \nat a rate so out of proportion with every other indicia of inflation. \nIt will help us solve the mystery of the case of the Incredible Rising \nTuition Bill. It will help American families and students make better \ndecisions about where to go to college.\n  The legislation tells schools that the time has come to come clean \nabout why their prices are climbing so rapidly, and to answer the \nquestion of whether the massive tuition increases are really necessary. \nSchools who opt to not comply with the requirements of the bill will be \nfined $25,000. I want to thank Senator Dodd for this provision. I \nbelieve it is particularly important, because it puts the schools on \nnotice that we are serious about these requirements.\n  I also want to thank Senator Dodd and the other managers of the bill \nfor including an amendment of mine directing the Secretary of Education \nto study the impact of student debt. Unfortunately, the trend in \nstudent aid over the last 20 years has been to move away from grants in \nfavor of loans. Combined with the increasing cost of college, this \ntrend has meant that more and more students are graduating with more \nand more debt.\n  According to the GAO, the percentage of undergraduate students who \ntook out loans shot up 41 percent between 1993 and 1996. The percentage \nof graduates of four-year colleges who borrowed more than $20,000 rose \nfrom 9 percent in 1993 to 19 percent in 1996.\n  The General Accounting Office was not able to determine, however, the \neffect of this increasing debt burden on students and graduates. Under \nthis legislation, the Secretary of Education will, within 18 months, \ndetermine how this increasing burden affects students' decisions about \nwhether and where to go to school, how much to borrow, how long to stay \nin school, what kind of employment to seek, and whether burdensome debt \npayments impede graduates' ability to save for retirement or invest in \na home.\n  The legislation will provide for the first time a comprehensive \npicture of exactly what is happening to college costs, why it is \nhappening, and what the effects are.\n  Mr. President, I also want to thank the managers of the bill, as well \nas Senator Wellstone, for incorporating the provisions of the Fair Play \nAct into this higher education legislation. The Fair Play Act, which I \nintroduced last year with Senators Snowe and Kennedy, builds upon the \nextraordinary success of Title IX and promotes the continued expansion \nof athletic opportunities for women.\n  Colleges and universities are currently required to collect \ninformation about their men's and women's athletic programs, including \nparticipation rates, operating and recruitment budgets, the \navailability of scholarships, revenues generated from athletic \nprograms, and coaches' salaries, and are required to make this \ninformation available upon request.\n  The Fair Play Act directs colleges and universities to send this \ninformation, which they already compile annually, to the Department of \nEducation, and directs the Department to issue an annual report and \nmake the information available through a variety of mechanisms, \nincluding the Department's World Wide Web site.\n\n[[Page S7844]]\n\n  The Fair Play Act will provide prospective students and prospective \nstudent athletes with the kind of information they need to make \ninformed decisions about where to go to school. I will give the \nDepartment of Education valuable information to aid its enforcement of \nTitle IX in the area of athletics, and it will encourage schools to \ncontinue to expand their athletic programs to meet the interests of \nwomen nationwide.\n  Over its 25 year history, Title IX has been directly responsible for \nexpanding the athletic opportunities available to millions of women and \ngirls. The Fair Play Act builds on this legacy of success, and provides \nthe information needed to ensure that the expansion of athletic \nopportunities available to women continues into the 21st century.\n  I am grateful for the support of my colleagues on the Labor \nCommittee, and I look forward to continuing to work with them on this \nimportant issue.\n  Mr. President, I also want to thank the managers of this bill for \naccepting an amendment of mine creating a Faculty Development \nFellowship Program. The program will enable institutions of higher \neducation to award graduate fellowships to talented students from \ngroups under-represented in the American professoriate.\n  In many respects, colleges and universities are our nation's paragons \nof diversity. They understand the importance of having a student body \nmade up of men and women of different races, ethnicities, and \nbackgrounds. When I talk with university presidents from Illinois and \nelsewhere, they invariably tout their school's diversity.\n  The diversity appears to stop, however, after the undergraduate \nlevel. There is a disturbing dearth of diversity among graduate \nstudents and professors. In 1993, African-Americans received only 3 \npercent of all doctoral degrees conferred in the United States, and \nwomen received only 38 percent. According to the Department of \nEducation, only 14 percent of full-time instructional faculty at \ncolleges and universities are minorities, and only one-third are women.\n  We can do better than that. The problem is not a lack of talent among \nminorities and women, but a lack of opportunity. My amendment \nauthorizes $30 million per year to encourage talented students from \nunder-represented groups to pursue studies and become professors. The \nprogram will help us tap the talents of all our children, and therefore \nmake us a stronger society. A community that gives all its members a \nchance to contribute to the maximum extent of their abilities is a \nstronger community, because it benefits from a broader range of \ncontributions. As we head into the 21st century and a truly global \neconomy, we cannot afford not to tap the talents of all our children.\n  Mr. President, that is really what this whole bill is about, making \nsure that every American has the chance to go as far as his or her \ntalents will allow. This bill is about making sure that wealth and \nclass are not obstacles to education. It is about giving more students \nmore opportunities to receive a better education. I congratulate the \nleaders of the Labor Committee for their bipartisan efforts to put this \nbill together, and I look forward to its imminent passage.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor S. 1882, the Higher Education Reauthorization bill. This bill is a \nmajor victory for students and teachers across America. As a member of \nthe Committee, I have had the opportunity to hear from countless \nwitnesses from across the nation who have testified on everything from \ndefault rates to job hunting, campus crime to child care. With a \ndaughter entering college this fall, this issue has provided me with \nsome very interesting insights into the higher ed challenges, millions \nface each year.\n  Throughout the Labor Committee's effort on this bill, I worked to \nstrengthen our nation's commitment to providing the strongest training \npossible for school teachers. I am most pleased with the bill's focus \non teacher training and in particular its emphasis on technology \ntraining. A year ago, I introduced the Teacher Technology Training Act \nto add technology to the areas of professional development and teacher \ntraining included in current law. S. 1882 now contains my legislation, \nand I thank Chairman Jeffords, Senator Kennedy and Senator Warner for \ntheir cooperation and support in adding this critical piece to the \nbill.\n  The work of the committee on the teacher education provisions is \nreally quite historic and a drastic overhaul of the previous teacher \ntraining section. The bill provides Teacher Quality Enhancement Grants \nthat will institute state-level reforms to ensure both current and \nfuture teachers possess the skills and academic knowledge to teach \nchildren effectively in their assigned area. As a member of the Labor \nAppropriations subcommittee, I will fight to ensure that this section \nis finally funded at a level that does make a difference in the \nclassroom.\n  This teacher quality section particularly highlights training in the \neffective use of technology in the classroom. All of us have witnessed \nthe tremendous impact that technology now plays in our daily world. It \naffects the way we communicate, the way we conduct commerce, and the \nway our children learn in school.\n  Young people today are in the midst of a technology explosion that \nhas opened up limitless possibilities in the classroom. In order for \nstudents to tap into this potential and be prepared for the 21st \ncentury, they must learn how to use new technologies. But all too \noften, teachers are expected to incorporate technology into their \ninstruction without being given the training to do so. Many students in \nour public schools have told me they know more than their teachers \nabout how to use computers.\n  We can not continue to rely on students to teach teachers in the \nrapidly expanding area of technology. I have toured several teaching \nschools and found them well supplied with up-to-date equipment. \nHowever, student teachers are often not provided adequate instruction \nin the use of that technology beyond simple communication purposes. It \nis not enough for a teacher to be able to email or use computers merely \nfor administrative reasons, they must be able to use this education \ntechnology to advance their curriculum and provide their students \nresources along the information highway.\n  Last year, just 10 percent of new teachers reported that they felt \nprepared to use technology in their classrooms, while only 13 percent \nof all public schools reported that technology-related training for \nteachers was required by the school, district, or teacher certification \nagencies. Currently only 18 states require pre-service technology \ntraining.\n  This act will significantly turn these numbers around and provide our \nteachers with the training so critical to harnessing new technologies. \nI again thank Chairman Jeffords and Senator Kennedy for their \nleadership on this effort. This technology training for teachers has \nbeen supported by a wide array of interests including the National \nEducation Association, PTA, Society for Technology in Education, \nNational Association of Secondary School Principals, National School \nBoards Association, Information Technology Association of America, \nWashington State School Directors, the Software and Digital Alliance, \nthe Colleges of Teacher Education. I also would like to thank Senator \nWellstone for his work on the TANF amendment, so important for literacy \ninstruction and lifelong learning.\n  With increased Pell Grants and decreased interest rates on loans, \nstudents can begin to think about their future rather than paying for \ntheir past. I believe this first generation of the new millennium will \nbenefit immensely from the efforts put forth over this past year. From \nsimplifying the financial aid process to campus security improvements \nto technology instruction, S. 1882 will stand as a proud trademark of \nthis Congress.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. \n1882, the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1998, reauthorizing the \nHigher Education Act for 5 years. The Higher Education Act, enacted in \n1965 to provide disadvantaged students with greater educational \nopportunities, recognized the shared benefit of providing every \nAmerican a chance to maximize his or her potential. As a result of the \npassage of this legislation, doors have been opened to millions of \ncitizens who\n\n[[Page S7845]]\n\notherwise would not have had the access or the resources to obtain a \nhigher education. Although the act has been amended over the years \nthrough the reauthorization process, the central purpose of the \nlegislation has remained the same--to ensure access, choice and \nopportunity in higher education.\n  First, and foremost, this measure reauthorizes all postsecondary \ngrant and loan programs which have allowed so many of our citizens to \nobtain additional education and training. It lowers the in-school \ninterest rate on student loans from the current 7.6% to 6.8% and for \nthe years after school from the current 8.2% to 7.4% to make higher \neducation more affordable for more students. Most notably, the bill \nincludes an increase in the maximum Pell Grant from $3,000 for the \n1998-1999 academic year to $4,500 for 1999-2000, and increases that \naward by $200 a year for the following four years and further expands \neligibility to include more students who are financially independent of \ntheir parents.\n  I am pleased that the bill also reinforces our continued support of \nthe TRIO programs which have been so successful in serving \ndisadvantaged and first-generation college students. I have been a \nlongstanding supporter of TRIO which has served more than 700,000 \nthrough 1,900 programs nationwide. The impact of the outreach and early \nintervention services provided by TRIO become even more profound \nconsidering that more than two-thirds of the students benefitting from \nthe program come from families with incomes under $24,000. No one set \nof Federal programs captures more completely the American ideal that \nfostering educational opportunity for all citizens benefits both the \nindividual and the society as well.\n  Title II of the bill consolidates teacher training programs and \nrefocuses Federal efforts to more efficiently and effectively train and \nrecruit new teachers for our Nation's schools. It also provides for \ngreater loan forgiveness for those who choose to dedicate their lives \nto the teaching profession. Now those who agree to teach for at least \nthree years in high-need areas can see up to $8,000 in their student \nloans forgiven. In my view, this is an important step in relieving the \nheavy loan debt many graduates find themselves burdened with upon \ngraduation to allow some of our best and brightest to enter the \nteaching profession independent of this financial pressure.\n  I am also pleased that legislation I introduced to establish the \nThurgood Marshall Legal Opportunity Program has been incorporated into \nthe bill before us. This program would identify socially and \neconomically disadvantaged law school students and provide them with \nthe opportunity to hone their skills through summer institutes, mid-\nyear seminars and support services. Working within the framework of the \nhighly successful Council on Legal Education Opportunity (CLEO), this \nprogram will provide the necessary resources to ensure that those who \nhave proven themselves at the undergraduate level of study are able to \nmaximize their potential as they move on to law school. Investing in \nthe promise of these talented individuals is a worthwhile endeavor and \nI am pleased that this legislation has been included in this \nreauthorization.\n  Mr. President, passage of this legislation sustains our Nation's \nlongstanding commitment to access, choice and opportunity in higher \neducation. Every society places a premium on education in terms of \nfostering a skilled and trained work force in the next generation, and \nthe more complex economically the world becomes, the more critical it \nis to address this aspect of developing our human resources. In our \nsociety, however, education carries two other very important \nresponsibilities which make the legislation we are talking about today \nessential to the health and vitality of our society.\n  The first is that we are one of a handful of countries that has \nmaintained a democracy over a sustained period of time. Obviously, \neducation is essential to a literate citizenry capable of making a \ndemocracy work. The other dimension is that education in America \nrepresents a ladder of opportunity. We take great pride in being an \nopen society in which people can move up and forward, and the way they \ndo that is essentially through the educational ladders provided in the \nprograms we are reauthorizing today. In a Nation which believes that a \nperson's merit and talent should take them as far as they can go, we \nmust continue to foster a path which allows them to maximize this \npotential. Many of us here today have benefitted from this philosophy \nand have achieved certain levels of success as a direct result of the \nopportunities afforded by such principles. However, all of the programs \nwe address in this bill are not solely for the benefit of the \nindividual, as important as that aspect is. These programs are part of \nour national effort to include people in our society rather than \nexclude them, an essential concept in my view to the harmonious working \nof American society.\n  In passing this legislation, it is important to understand that the \nvalue of programs authorized by this bill cannot be measured simply in \nterms of dollars spent. Without Federal support, millions of Americans \nwould not have been able to attend college or receive the advanced \ntraining required to make them contributing, productive members of \nsociety. If this Nation is to continue to thrive in an ever-evolving \nglobal economy, we must not underestimate the value of the Federal \ngovernment's commitment to higher education.\n  The Senate's approval of the reauthorization of the Higher Education \nAct is a critical step in our on-going efforts to maintain access and \nchoice in higher education. We must continue to acknowledge the vital \nimportance of education in this country, to sustain the educated base \nwe have created, and to commit ourselves to a quality education for all \nour Nation's citizens.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1882, the \nHigher Education Amendments of 1998. I commend my colleagues, \nespecially Senators Kennedy, Jeffords, Coats and Dodd, for all their \nhard work in putting together a bi-partisan education bill to \nreauthorize the Higher Education Act. I congratulate you for producing \na package aimed at the needs of our students in paying for college and \ngetting a quality education. This bill truly helps us to get behind our \nkids and our students. It lays the groundwork for the future in working \ntoward a strong economy by educating our citizens and future leaders.\n  This bill contains may important provisions reauthorizing the range \nof student financial assistance. I support this bill for three reasons, \nin particular. First, it contains important provisions that expand our \nteacher training programs. Second, it increases the maximum amount \nneedy students can receive under the Pell Grant program. Third, it \nencourages new teachers to serve elementary and secondary schools in \nlow-income areas by providing loan forgiveness for their Stafford \nloans.\n  Training our teachers is one of the most important steps we can take \ntoward improving education today. Our children deserve to be taught by \nwell-qualified teachers in every classroom. We need more teachers, but \nwe need more quality teachers. That is why I cosponsored Senator \nKennedy's and Senator Reed's proposals to provide grants to local \npartnerships for teacher training. I am happy to see that many of the \nprovisions in these two bills were included in this legislation. These \ngrants will be made to local partnerships and are designed to encourage \nthe reform and improvement of education at the local level.\n  Second, I am very pleased that this bill increases the amounts \navailable to students for Pell Grants. This bill continues the historic \ncommitment of our government to grant aid to the neediest students by \nincreasing the Pell Grant to $5,000. Education should be an opportunity \nfor all people, regardless of their financial status. Education should \nbe both accessible and affordable. We have an obligation to make sure \nthat every single citizen of our country has the chance to go to \nschool, get an education, get a good job and a boost up the opportunity \nladder.\n  Third, this bill provides loan forgiveness for Stafford loans to \nteachers who choose to teach in elementary and secondary schools in \nlow-income areas. It authorizes the Secretary of Education to repay \ncertain loans made to borrowers who become full-time teachers for three \nconsecutive school years in a high-poverty area. This section combines \nour commitment to a quality\n\n[[Page S7846]]\n\npublic education for all students with our commitment to also target \nthe areas in highest need. It provides incentives for well-trained \nteachers to teach in areas that really need committed and well trained \nteachers. This bill helps ensure that we are meeting the needs of all \nof our students by targeting funds to those high need areas.\n  Let me briefly mention two other provisions of this bill that are of \nspecial importance to me. I am very pleased to see that the Thurgood \nMarshal Legal Education Opportunity Program, legislation that I \ncosponsored with Senator Sarbanes, was included in the manager's \npackage of this bill. This amendment will help qualified disadvantaged \nstudents gain admission to law school and help prepare them for their \nlegal education. It identifies socially and economically disadvantaged \nlaw students and provides them with both financial and academic support \nservices. This program has a 29 year record of assisting these \ndisadvantaged students and I am proud to have been a strong supporter \nof this program.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to thank Senator Jeffords and \nSenator Kennedy for including language in the manager's package that \ndoubles the authorization of federal funds that do not have to matched \nby the Historically Black Colleges and Universities graduate programs. \nThis will greatly help our HBCU graduate programs increase their \nquality of programs. It follows our important commitment to support our \nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities. I am particularly happy \nthat both HBCU graduate programs in my state at Morgan State University \nand Eastern Shore will benefit from this important amendment.\n  Mr. President, this bill represents a real investment in the \neducation of our youth. It represents, as it should, a bipartisan \neffort to ensure the quality and affordability of education for all. \nEducation can and should be something that we can all agree on. We will \nall have to live in the future with the decisions we make now on \neducation. We are responsible for our future, and that means we are \nresponsible for making sure that our children are equipped to deal with \nthe issues they will be facing.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the legislation before us today, the \nHigher Education Act, is an example of what can happen when the \nmajority makes an effort to work together with Senators from this side \nof the aisle to do something for the good of the country. I commend \nSenator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy for their good work on this bill. \nUnfortunately, we have seen too few examples of this type of bipartisan \ncooperation this year.\n  The Higher Education Act is very important, and I am pleased we are \nmaking good progress in renewing and strengthening it. As we are all \nwell aware, access to higher education can help unlock the door to a \nbetter future for our students and for our Nation, and this legislation \nprovides the key for many students. Pell grants, student loans, campus-\nbased aid and other programs have helped millions of students afford a \ncollege education. Through these programs, we provide $38 billion in \nfinancial assistance to more than 19.4 million students in \npostsecondary education institutions.\n  The bill we are adopting today makes a number of important \nimprovements in this law. First, and most important, it continues the \neffort to make a college education more affordable by continuing \ncurrent programs, increasing the maximum Pell Grant, reducing interest \nrates on student loans, improving repayment options for students, and \nincreasing the information available to families about the cost of a \ncollege education while encouraging institutions to minimize cost \nincreases.\n  The bill includes important incentives to improve the quality of \nteacher training and recruitment and to expand professional development \nopportunities. I commend the Committee, and in particular the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, and the Senator from Rhode Island, \nSenator Reed, for their efforts to consolidate and strengthen these \nprovisions into a more logical, coordinate system. We know that putting \nstudents in a classroom with a well-trained, qualified teacher is one \nof the most effective ways to help them achieve to the best of their \nabilities.\n  I am also pleased that the bill establishes a demonstration program \nto expand post-secondary opportunities for distance learning. This will \nhelp many people, especially those in rural areas, those with \ndisabilities and nontraditional students, gain access to programs in \nwhich they might not otherwise be able to participate. The Senator from \nMinnesota, Senator Wellstone, has been a strong supporter of these \nprovisions.\n  The bill also includes a proposal offered by the Senator from \nConnecticut, Senator Dodd, which I cosponsored, to encourage colleges \nto establish campus-based child care for low-income students. I also \nsupport provisions in the bill that will help reduce binge-drinking on \ncollege campuses and reduce campus crime levels.\n  Finally, I strongly support the provision creating a new grant \nprogram for Tribal Colleges and Universities. These institutions, most \nof which struggle financially, do a remarkable job of creating \neducational opportunities for Native Americans. They need and deserve \nfederal support.\n  I would like to note that while I did not support the Kennedy \namendment, I do support the study called for in the managers' amendment \nto determine whether there might be ways to move toward a more market-\nbased student loan system to improve the efficiency of the student loan \nsystem. While I did support the Harkin amendment because it reduced the \ncost of student loans, I would note that I strongly believe we must \ntake care to maintain a strong Federal Family Education Loan program. \nThe evidence is strong that competition between the Direct Loan program \nand the FFEL program is good for both programs and ultimately good for \nstudents, and I believe it is important that we work to maintain this \nbalance.\n  Mr. President, the Higher Education Act is yet another example of the \npositive impact the federal government can have in helping our Nation \ninvest in our future. By helping to lower the cost barriers to higher \neducation, we help millions of young people gain the skills they will \nneed to be contributing members of society while we build a strong work \nforce, encourage the development of our intellectual capital and \nnurture the leaders of the next generation. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me wholeheartedly in supporting this very important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it has come to my attention that the \nofficial CBO scoring of the Graham amendment adopted earlier today \nshows a slight mismatch in outlays relating to the new spending and \noffset contained in the amendment. This technical drafting error has \nresulted in a small paygo problem for this legislation.\n  It is my intention that this bill be in full and complete compliance \nwith all relevant budget rules and I intend to ensure that the bill as \nit comes out of conference will meet this standard.\n\n\n                        section 632 of title vi\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to raise the issue of \nSection 632 of Title VI of the Higher Education Act, the so called \n``hold harmless'' provision as the Senate discusses this very important \nreauthorization of the Higher Education Act.\n  It is my understanding that Section 632 was first enacted in the \nHigher Education Amendments of 1992 in order to prevent the Department \nof Education from funding new or expanding existing Title VI, \nInternational Education Programs unless existing Title VI programs were \nfunded at their FY 1992 level. However, the bill before us removes the \nprovision, so as to give the Secretary of Education greater \nflexability.\n  The University of New Mexico's Latin American Institute has contacted \nme to raise its concerns about the removal of Section 632 from the \nHigher Education Act. I also understand the international programs at \nOhio State and the U. of Michigan have contacted their respective \nSenators with similar concerns.\n  However, I also understand the reauthorization of the Higher \nEducation Act does not create any new programs within Title VI, so is \nit your understanding that since no new programs are created within \nTitle VI that Section 632 is unnecessary?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I understand the concern of the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Mexico in protecting the funding of international programs \nsuch as the Latin American Institute at the\n\n[[Page S7847]]\n\nUniversity of New Mexico. I would concur with my colleague from New \nMexico in what he has said and I would urge the Secretary of Education \nto allocate funding to international programs in a fair manner.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the distinguished Chairman for his \nconsideration of this important matter.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Collins be \nrecognized to speak on the bill for up to 15 minutes, and that \nfollowing her remarks, Senator DeWine be recognized to speak on the \nbill for up to 15 minutes, and that following their remarks, Senator \nBingaman be recognized to offer his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this \nimportant legislation, and I want to commend the Senator from Vermont, \nthe chairman of the committee, for his work in bringing this very \nimportant legislation to the floor.\n  Mr. President, today we continue a historic commitment which began 40 \nyears ago when Congress enacted the National Defense Education Act.\n  In 1958, the NDEA provided that: ``The security of the Nation \nrequires the fullest development of the mental resources and technical \nskills of its young men and women.'' At that time, Congress was \nthinking of security in terms of the cold war and was reacting to the \nSoviet Union's stunning achievement in launching Sputnik.\n  Although the cold war is behind us now, the sentiments expressed in \n1958 remain valid today. The threat may no longer be as dramatic as the \nthreat posed by the technological advancements of a hostile superpower; \ninstead, the threat that we face today is a quiet threat of lost \nopportunity--economically, culturally, and socially--a threat that will \nbe realized if we fail to provide educational opportunities to our \ncitizens.\n  As a Senator from a State with a very high rate of high school \ncompletion but a very low rate of participation in higher education, I \nam particularly concerned about the threat that the lack of access to \nhigher education poses to the future well-being of many of our lower-\nincome citizens.\n  We know, Mr. President, that fewer people from lower-income families \nenroll in postsecondary education. The problems caused by the lack of \naccess, however, do not stop once we get students to campus. Another \nchallenge is keeping them there and encouraging them to graduate.\n  The disturbing truth, Mr. President, is that students who find \ncollege least affordable are much less likely to complete college than \ntheir financially more secure counterparts. As the Educational Testing \nService's Policy Information Center has reported, ``The education \nstaircase . . . is getting steeper and harder to climb, particularly \nfor those in lower income groups.''\n  The center has reported the alarming fact that students from lower-\nincome backgrounds, in addition to having much lower rates of entrance \ninto college, have much higher dropout rates than those from higher-\nincome families.\n  In 1979, a student in the top quartile of family income was four \ntimes more likely to obtain a baccalaureate degree by age 24 than a \nstudent from the bottom quartile.\n  By 1994, Mr. President, this problem, this gap, had gotten much \nworse. Individuals from the top quartile were 10 times more likely to \nattain a 4-year degree by age 24.\n  When you couple this statistic with the well-established relationship \nbetween educational attainment and lifetime earnings, the consequences \nof the education gap are obvious. We keep reading about the gap between \nthe rich and the poor in this country and that that gap is growing. \nThat gap is, by and large, an education gap.\n  If we are able to provide educational opportunities to lower-income \nfamilies, we will help close that gap, because the differences in the \nlifetime earnings of people who complete only high school versus those \nwho go on to postsecondary education are enormous. We are at risk of \ncreating a permanent underclass of people without the skills that open \nthe gateways to economic opportunity, the skills that allow entry into \na job market demanding a higher-educated and better-trained workforce. \nIn fact, Mr. President, it is estimated that in the State of Maine more \nthan 80 percent of the new jobs being created require some sort of \npostsecondary education.\n  Unless steps are taken to close this educational gap, a gap rooted in \neconomics rather than in intelligence or ability, we are locking the \nchildren of America's lower-income families into a self-perpetuating \ncycle of inadequate education and low-income status. Without \neducational opportunities, a significant part of American society will \nnever have the chance to participate fairly in America's bright \ntechnology-based future.\n  Mr. President, the legislation before us, the Higher Education Act \nreauthorization, will help provide these educational opportunities. I \nwould like to highlight some specific provisions in this legislation \nthat I worked on and believe are critical. These provisions increase \naccess to education by focusing on two components--first, helping \nfamilies afford education; and, second, increasing the aspirations of \nour young people, particularly those who come from families where \nhigher education is not a tradition.\n  Mr. President, the Pell Grant Program has been one of the Federal \nGovernment's greatest contributions to the success of higher education. \nOver the last 25 years, this program has provided invaluable assistance \nto tens of millions of our neediest students.\n  The Pell Grant Program has, however, had some flaws. Most notably, \nunder its current formula, the program creates a disincentive to work. \nThis was brought home to me when I talked to a young person who had \ndecided to take a year off between high school and college in order to \nearn more money for her education. She worked at McDonald's and lived \nat home, saved every penny. The consequence was that she lost her Pell \ngrant when she went to school the next year.\n  We have created, in the current formula, a disincentive, because we \nhave a very low cap on allowable earnings which penalizes students who \nare trying to pay for their education through work rather than relying \nsolely on loans.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced the Working Students Income \nProtection Act to address this problem. I am very pleased that the \nLabor and Human Resources Committee has incorporated my bill into the \nfinal version of the legislation before us today. It will increase by \n$1,000 the earnings allowance for students who receive Pell grants.\n  Another important provision improving the Pell grant that is included \nin this legislation is the elimination of the dependent care cap that \nhad been included in the formula in the past. Again, I introduced \nlegislation to make this change because I was concerned that as we \nincrease the maximum level of aid, we end up limiting Pell grant awards \nto some of the most needy students, those who have child care expenses. \nOften these are single parents who are balancing raising children, \ngoing to work, and attending college. The changes that are included in \nthis bill will make it a little bit easier for these students.\n  Another provision of this bill includes legislation that Senator Reed \nof Rhode Island and I have authored to strengthen the State Student \nIncentive Grant Program. This program provides assistance to 12,000 \nMaine students who come from families whose average income is under \n$12,000.\n  Mr. President, as important as all this financial assistance is--and \nI know from my experience working in a Maine college that it is \ncritical--there is another significant barrier to higher education for \na lot of our young people.\n  If students come from a disadvantaged social or economic background, \nand come from families where there is no experience with higher \neducation, they may look at college as being beyond their reach. It may \nbe a frightening experience for them or something they simply do not \nconsider, despite having the ability to succeed.\n  In reauthorizing the Higher Education Act, we are continuing one of \nthe Federal Government's most successful efforts, and that is the TRIO\n\n[[Page S7848]]\n\nPrograms. In my home State, TRIO Programs such as Talent Search and \nUpward Bound have identified and reached out to promising young people \nwho otherwise never would have considered postsecondary education but \nfor these terrific programs. Two-thirds of the students benefiting from \nthe TRIO Programs come from families where neither parent has any \nhigher education and whose families' incomes are below $24,000.\n  One such student, Mr. President, recently visited me. She was a young \nwoman from Greene, ME, who talked with such excitement about the \nbenefit of the Talent Search Program to her aspirations. She said that \nthe program had convinced her that she wants to go to college. This \nyoung woman comes from a low-income family. Neither of her parents went \nto college. In fact, her mother was a teenage mother who dropped out of \nhigh school to raise her children. This young woman put it very well. \nShe said, ``But for this program, but for the Talent Search Program, I \nwould have been too frightened to go to college. I would have just \nassumed that it wasn't for me.'' This program, by exposing her to a \ncollege environment, by giving her the counseling, the mentoring, and \nthe encouragement that she needed, has convinced her that higher \neducation will be part of her future. I am convinced that it will be a \nbright future indeed.\n  It is difficult for me to think of a more worthwhile investment of \nFederal funds than these important programs. The Federal Government \ncannot guarantee equal educational attainment for every student, but we \ncan certainly take steps that will guarantee equality of access for \nevery student. We can help eliminate the barriers of cost and \ninadequate aspirations that prevent students from lower- and middle-\nincome families from pursuing postsecondary education. We can give them \nequal opportunity by providing the access through the important \nprograms in this legislation.\n  The Higher Education Act that is before the Senate today will help \nour citizens overcome economic and social barriers, take advantage of \neducation, and reach their full potential. That not only benefits them \nas individuals, it benefits our Nation as a society, as well.\n  Today I encourage my colleagues to join in affirming and extending \nthe commitment for access to education that we began 40 years ago.\n  I thank the President for the time, and I thank the chairman for his \nefforts, as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I will offer a few brief comments in \nregard to this very important piece of legislation that the Senate is \nnow considering. In my work on the Labor Committee, one of the things I \nhave been focusing on is the issue of quality teaching in our \nclassroom. Really, there is nothing more important in regard to \neducation than the teacher. Our children deserve to be taught by \nteachers who really understand their subject, understand the subject \nmatter.\n  I have worked hard to incorporate measures concerning good teaching \ninto this bill. I want to thank Chairman Jeffords for the assistance \nthat he has given me and the cooperation in getting these sections \nincorporated into this very good bill.\n  Title II of this legislation is entitled ``Improving Teacher \nQuality.'' Here are some of the measures that I have been promoting \nthat I am pleased to say have been included in this bill. One, the bill \nfunds programs that establish, expand, and improve alternative routes \nto State certification for highly qualified individuals from other \noccupations and for recent college graduates with records of academic \ndistinction.\n  Two, this bill would develop and implement innovative efforts aimed \nat reducing the shortage of highly qualified teachers in high-poverty \nurban and in high-poverty rural areas. These efforts might include the \nrecruitment of highly qualified individuals from other occupations--\nagain, through alternative certification programs.\n  Three, this bill would provide prospective teachers with alternatives \nto traditional preparation for teaching, through programs at colleges \nof arts and sciences or at nonprofit educational organizations.\n  I am pleased that this bill has a strong focus on alternative \ncertification or licensure of teachers. I introduced S. 1742, the \nAlternative Certification and Licensure of Teachers Act back in \nFebruary of this year. I introduced it because I wanted to give highly \nqualified people who like to teach, who want to teach, a chance to do \nso. These are people who can serve as mentors and who can serve as role \nmodels, real life examples of how a good education can make a huge, \npositive difference in a student's future. These are the types of \nindividuals that we should be encouraging to become teachers and to get \ninto education.\n\n  I also take a moment to talk about the commonsense Quality Child Care \nLoan Forgiveness Act, which I introduced last July. I am pleased that \nthis provision has also been included in this bill. Members can find it \nincorporated in title IV of the bill before the Senate.\n  Now, Mr. President, the Quality Child Care Loan Forgiveness Act \nprovides school loan forgiveness to individuals who earn a degree in \nearly childhood education or in related fields and who then obtains \nemployment in a child care facility. I think we must recognize the \nextraordinary need that exists today for quality child care. Recent \nstudies have shown that more than 80 percent of child care centers \nprovide mediocre or poor quality services. The indications are that a \nmere 14 percent of the centers surveyed met levels of quality that were \nhigh enough to adequately support a child's development. The Quality \nChild Care Loan Forgiveness Act will help ensure that our children get \nhigher quality child care. It will do it by encouraging more people, \nbetter qualified people, to teach in these facilities. It will \nencourage students who are in college to major in this area and to make \ntheir lifework early childhood development. Again, I don't know what \ncould be more important.\n  Finally, let me say I am glad that this bill includes important \nlegislation I sponsored having to do with the underground railroad. The \nUnderground Railroad Education Culture Act will provide for the \nestablishment of programs to research, display, interpret, and collect \nartifacts and other items relating to the history of the underground \nrailroad. The history of the underground railroad is important to this \ncountry. It is important to Ohio, and it is important to me personally. \nIn the 20 years prior to the Civil War, it is estimated--no one will \never know what the true figure is--but it is estimated that more than \n40,000 slaves, 40,000 human beings escaped bondage and made their way \nto free soil on the trail of the underground railroad.\n  This is a great story. It is a great story that every schoolchild in \nAmerica should know about. More than 150 underground railroad sites \nhave been identified in my home State of Ohio alone. We are sure there \nare many, many more besides that. These are sites that symbolized at \nthe time freedom for thousands and thousands of enslaved Americans. \nWhen I visit these places, as I have with my family, it gives me real \npause for hope about the future of our country.\n  When we talk about race relations in this country, we would do well \nto remind ourselves that at one of the darkest points in our history--\nmaybe our darkest point, the period of slavery--some blacks and some \nwhites took immense personal risk to work together for freedom, to work \ntogether for liberty. It is a great story. This is a part of the \nAmerican story that we should be proud of and we should build on. In \nOhio, we are very proud of the part our ancestors played in this great \nstory. This is why I think this legislation is so very important.\n  I want to again thank my colleague, Senator Jeffords, the chairman of \nour committee, and my other colleagues on the Labor Committee, for \nagreeing to place this legislation in the managers' amendment. It was \nvery important to recognize this period in our history.\n\n  Let me conclude, Mr. President, by mentioning briefly what I believe \nto be the next step on education policy. I have introduced legislation \nthat would provide assistance for the creation of nonprofit teacher \ntraining facilities across the United States, facilities that would \nhelp train teachers--teachers who are already in the classroom, or \nindividuals who are about to enter this great profession. S. 1742, the \nTeacher\n\n[[Page S7849]]\n\nQuality Act, which I have introduced, is a commonsense piece of \nlegislation that would assist school districts in their struggle to \nmaintain the highest possible academic standards for their children. I \nhope that in the weeks ahead we will consider this bill as well.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support this bipartisan effort and will \nvote in favor of its passage. Again, I congratulate Senator Jeffords \nand the other members of our committee who have worked so long and hard \nto bring this very good and comprehensive bill to the Senate.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, first of all, I want to thank both of my \ncolleagues from Maine and from Ohio, Senator Collins and Senator \nDeWine, for a very eloquent and pertinent statement and for all the \nwork they did in committee in helping us to put together this bill.\n  Mr. President, I now believe that, under the previous unanimous \nconsent order, Senator Bingaman is to be recognized. I don't believe \nthere is any time agreement.\n  Would the Senator be willing to accept an hour equally divided?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am not certain that a half hour on my \nside will be adequate. I have two other speakers in addition to myself. \nI would like to allow each of them to speak first. I don't expect that \nit will take much more than that on my side.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. We will wait on that.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3116\n\n  (Purpose: To ensure that secondary school teachers are sufficiently \nprepared during their pre-service training to have sufficient academic \n    knowledge to be able to help their students reach high academic \n                               standards)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     Mr. Cochran, Mr. Reid, and Mr. Hollings, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3116.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Insert at the end of Title II, Part A (page 237, after line \n     14)\n\n     ``SEC. 237. ACADEMIC MAJORS FOR SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS.\n\n       ``(a) States and postsecondary programs that prepare \n     secondary school teachers and receive Federal funds under \n     this Act excluding aid provided under Title IV, shall, unless \n     they have already done so, adopt within 3 years after the \n     date of enactment of the Higher Education Amendments of 1998 \n     a policy that all undergraduate candidates preparing to be \n     secondary school teachers be required to successfully \n     complete an academic major, as defined by the institution of \n     higher education at which the student attends, in the \n     academic area in which they plan to teach.''\n       ``(b) Nothing in this Section shall affect the eligibility \n     of an individual student or an institution of higher \n     education to receive Federal grants or loans under Title IV \n     under this Act.''\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this Higher Education Act that we are \nengaged in discussing and debating here is a very important act. We \nonly get around to it every 6 years, so this is not a subject like a \nlot of subjects around here that come up every year and we go through a \ndog and pony show here on the Senate floor. This issue comes up once \nevery 6 years. The last time we reauthorized the Higher Education Act \nwas in 1992. The next time we are expected to reauthorize the Higher \nEducation Act will be 2004. So it is important that we get it right and \ndo it right this year.\n  I join with others who have spoken in congratulating Senator Jeffords \nand Senator Kennedy for the leadership they have provided. We have a \nbipartisan bill. There are a number of incentives in this bill to \nstreamline and strengthen the ways in which we deal with the issue of \nhigher education in the country and the ways that we license and place \nteachers, including several provisions that I have recommended.\n  But there is some unfinished business, Mr. President, and that is \nwhat my amendment tries to address. Let me go on and describe a little \nof the background before I describe the amendment itself.\n  Teaching, of course, is our largest profession. We have close to 3 \nmillion people employed in teaching. To maintain and even increase the \nsupply of teachers, the teacher preparation programs need to generate \nthousands of teaching candidates every year as we move ahead. The \nFederal Government is a major support for the students who go through \nthese training programs. We provide $1.8 billion in student loans. Yet, \nwe all know that the quality of these programs, in many cases, is \ninadequate, and we need to question this large Federal investment when \nwe look at the quality of some of the teaching programs we are \nsupporting.\n  How is it that some universities can condone a rate of only 40 \npercent of their teacher education students passing licensing exams? \nHow do I, as a Senator, explain to my constituents the investment of \nFederal tax dollars going to these institutions when they fail to \nprepare students to meet the exams that the States themselves are \nproviding for people who want to teach?\n  For this reason, I propose an amendment to the Higher Education Act \nto require accountability on the part of education schools and the \nuniversities that house those education schools. The amendment requires \nthat States develop criteria to identify low-performing teacher \npreparation programs, including a State-determined pass rate on State \nlicensing exams.\n  It also proposes that States make a public list of the teacher \npreparation programs that meet the criteria for being labeled low \nperforming; that States develop a list of suggested ways in which local \nteacher preparation programs can improve; and, finally, after a 4-year \nperiod--4 years into this 6-year reauthorization bill--if the State \nremoved its approval from a teacher preparation program that the State \nitself felt had not made adequate improvement, then the Federal \nGovernment would support the State by withholding Federal funds from \nthat program as well.\n  That is what I have proposed. The education school accountability \namendment was designed to ensure that teaching candidates have the \nbaseline knowledge that they need before they go into the classroom. \nThe amendment included a section on reporting. States and institutions \nwould collect and publish the information needed by potential students \nto make informed decisions about enrollment in teacher preparation \nprograms.\n  I must say, Mr. President, that we have been able to work out a \nprovision on accountability of schools of education, which is being \nincluded in the managers' amendment, which I think is a substantial \nstep forward. It does not include many of the provisions I had urged, \nunfortunately. And I must say that I have been baffled by the response \nof the higher education community to this effort to impose a little \nmore accountability for low-performing teacher preparation \ninstitutions--those institutions existing nearly in every State.\n  In all the literature that has been distributed by that community in \nresponse to this amendment and the amendment Congressman Miller offered \non the House side, I have not seen any attempt by the higher education \ncommunity to take any responsibility or come up with any suggestions \nfor how to deal with the problem, which we know is a real one. The \nentire substance of their argument was one that they opposed \ninterference by the Government; they certainly didn't want the Federal \nGovernment involving itself in the role of the States, and they didn't \nwant the States involving themselves in higher education programs any \nmore than they presently do. Basically, they were saying that the \nhigher education programs need to be left as they are, in spite of the \nproblems that clearly exist.\n  Most troubling to me was the lack of willingness even to report pass \nrates of teacher preparation programs. In a letter dated June 9, the \nAmerican Council on Education indicated that reporting is too \nburdensome--the reporting that we were urging be accomplished. I don't \nreally understand why it is possible for law schools and medical \nschools to publish their student pass rates, but not schools of \neducation. Obviously, the question needs to be raised and answered: Is \nthere something to hide? Is there some information they don't want out? \nI fear that that may be the case.\n\n[[Page S7850]]\n\n  Together we can help the colleges and universities to raise the \nstatus of teacher education to ensure that students enrolling in \nteacher education programs get the return on their investment that they \nexpect and deserve. But we can't forget that the most important \nconstituency for us to be concerned about is the children who are going \nto be served by the graduates of these education schools. I think we \ncan make real progress if we impose some accountability there.\n  Mr. President, the amendment that I have offered and sent to the desk \nis in addition to what has been agreed to in the managers' amendment. I \ncommend the managers of the bill for agreeing to what I have already \ndescribed.\n  But the amendment that I am proposing says if you are training people \nto teach at the high school level--just at the high school level, not \nthe elementary school level--if you are training people to teach at the \nhigh school level, give those people an academic major. Give them any \neducation courses you want. Certainly courses in methods and courses in \ntechnique are fine, but don't turn out people to teach in our high \nschools who have only taken education courses. We are not saying that \nyou have to have a major in the academic subject in which you wind up \nteaching. We are not putting in any kind of requirement like that in \nthe law, only that you have to have some kind of academic major.\n  This is not, let me make it very clear, Mr. President, an amendment \nwhich intends to bash teachers. It is just the opposite. The amendment \nis intended to support the good teachers we have in our education \nsystem today, to give them more good teachers to work with them in \nimproving education.\n  In my State we have many extremely well-qualified and committed \nteachers who do a wonderful job for very little pay. In my own family, \nboth my parents devoted their careers to teaching. My sister is a \nteacher. I am a great believer in the value of good teachers.\n  I believe the amendment I have offered will strengthen our ability to \nturn out good teachers and have those teachers in the classroom. We \ngive a lot of speeches here about accountability. We need to make \npeople more accountable. We need to make government more accountable. \nWe need to make the institutions of government more accountable. I \nagree with all of that. The amendment I sent to the desk tries to do \nthat very thing. It says to the schools that are training our \nteachers--give the new teachers that are coming out a good academic \nbackground.\n  The problem has been discussed extensively. There has been a great \ndeal of publicity about the recent testing that has occurred in \nMassachusetts, of course, and the inadequate percentage of people there \nwho are able to pass the exam, the people who are getting ready to go \ninto teaching. Similar problems exist in other States. The simple fact \nis you cannot teach something if you do not understand it. You have to \nhave more than technique in order to be a good teacher. You have to \nalso know the subject matter. You have to have good academic skills \nprovided to the teachers or else the students cannot be expected to \nhave good academic skills themselves.\n  According to a recently completed analysis of State level student \nachievement data, students in States with more teachers holding \ncertification plus a major in their field do significantly better on \nthe national assessment of educational progress on reading and math \nexams than in States where this requirement is not available. Students \nof teachers who completed undergraduate activity majors and appropriate \nprofessional course- work achieve better than peers their own age whose \nteachers completed education majors. That is true no matter how poor \nthe students are, no matter what their ethnicity, no matter whether \nEnglish is their first language or their second language.\n  Mr. President, let me start with two charts that I want to call to \npeople's attention. This first chart makes the obvious point that there \nare 32 States that require teachers to complete an academic major for \nhigh school teaching, 30 that explicitly require that you have an \nacademic major if you go into high school teaching, two others that \nrequire the equivalent of that.\n  If any Senator wants to know whether his or her State already has \nthis requirement in State law, they need to look at this chart. We have \ntried to provide copies of it. I am told we are not able to put copies \non the Republican side of the aisle because there is some kind of a \nbreakdown in our efforts to be bipartisan around here and we are only \nable to give them to the Democrats. But the chart is here. If anyone is \nwilling to walk across the aisle, I would like to show them the chart. \nIt is the same on both sides of the aisle. It makes the point, very \nclearly, that 32 States are now requiring the exact thing that we are \ntrying to get done through this amendment.\n  I have been asked to break the discussion so that the Senator from \nIowa may speak.\n\n\n                        Privileges of the Floor\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an intern in \nmy office, Michael Pratt, and Lloyd Horwich, a detailee from the \nDepartment of Education, be given floor privileges during the duration \nof the debate on the Higher Education Act.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Thank you, very much.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me make another point--that \nrequiring an academic major saves money. Let me show this second chart \nwhich makes this point, I think, very graphically.\n  This chart makes the point that entry and retention rates of teachers \nof teacher preparation programs that allow beginning teachers to \ncomplete a major in their subject and require a firm grounding in \nteaching skills is substantially higher than those programs, the \ntraditional programs, that only have education courses in them. For \nevery 100 candidates who are just in teacher education, 3 years after \nthey complete their education only 28 of the 100 are still in teaching. \nWe are training 72 of the people out of those 100 candidates in teacher \neducation who don't stay in teaching more than 3 years. Those are the \nprograms where they don't have an academic major. In the case where \nthey do have an academic major, if you start with 100 candidates, after \n3 years 75 of those candidates are still in teaching.\n  Mr. President, it is clear to me that this is a good deal for the \ntaxpayer to give these people an academic background, keep them in \nteaching, and don't wind up spending a lot of money to train people who \nare going to drop out of the teaching profession very quickly. So I \nthink it is very important that we try to do this.\n  Teachers with academic majors feel significantly better, are better \nprepared for their work, and they are significantly more likely to \nenter teaching following their preparation. Over 90 percent do enter \nteaching following their preparation, and they are much more likely to \nremain in the profession for more years.\n  The Higher Education Act, which we are considering on the floor, \nencourages State and higher education institutions to implement an \nacademic major requirement. But it does not make it a priority for \ndeciding who gets funding.\n  Given the evidence that directly links the acquisition of a major \nwith student achievement, we are arguing with this amendment that the \nlanguage of the bill should provide that those States that do not \nrequire a major for high school teachers would be required to develop a \nplan for implementation of that kind of requirement over the next 3 \nyears. Requiring a major will help raise standards for entrance into \nthe teaching profession.\n  According to a recent study by the National Education Longitudinal \nStudy of 1988, in the field of math, only 35 percent of women attending \na major in education scored in the top two of the five proficiency \nlevels in the subject. Male education majors are almost three times as \nlikely to be below the lowest level of reading proficiency as their \npeers going into other majors.\n  Professional organizations are weighing in on this issue in favor of \nwhat we are proposing in this amendment. The October 1997 Conference of \nthe National Council of History Education conferees recommended that \nthe colleges' education faculty be given the authority to reduce the \nnumber of generic methods courses in order to present team-taught \ncourses with subject matter of scholars and seasoned teachers from the \nfield.\n\n[[Page S7851]]\n\n  The National Science Teachers Association supports all efforts that \nencourage science teachers to major in the subject that they plan to \nteach and at the same time receive a teaching credential.\n  If we expect higher standards of our students, as we all do, we need \nto provide them with teachers who have the content area preparation to \nhelp them meet those standards.\n  That is an impossible task when 39.5 percent of science teachers do \nnot even hold a minor in the subject that they are teaching. Thirty-\nfour percent of math teachers and 25 percent of English teachers were \nsimilarly teaching outside their field. In many high-poverty schools, \nthe percentage of out-of-field teachers can rise above 50 percent. \nIncreasing the number of teachers with an academic major is one way to \nalleviate the problem. We owe our children a quality education, a \nquality teacher in every classroom, and this higher education amendment \nis a place to start in that effort.\n  This bill, as I indicated earlier, only comes up once every 6 years. \nIt is important, I believe, that we take this action tonight before we \ncomplete action on the bill. It is not enough to say we are going to \nstudy this for another 6 years. Either we believe that upgrading the \nquality of teaching is important or we do not. Let's not put off action \nuntil we are well into the next century. This is a chance to quit \ncursing the dark and to light a single candle. I do not think people \nwho decide they should vote against this amendment should spend the \nnext 6 years complaining about the poor quality of teaching in our \nschools. This is a chance to deal with that poor quality of teaching in \na concrete way, and I hope people will support the amendment.\n  Let me defer. I see my colleague and cosponsor, Senator Cochran from \nMississippi, has risen to speak. Let me yield the floor so he can do \nso, Mr. President.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am delighted to join with my friend \nfrom New Mexico in sponsoring this amendment and urging the Senate to \napprove it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be shown as a cosponsor of the \namendment, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. There has been some misunderstanding, I think, in \nconversations I have had with fellow Senators about this amendment. \nWhat it does not purport to do is to tell the States how to certify or \nwhat criteria to use in the certification process for secondary school \nteachers. This amendment is directed to the universities and the \ncolleges that have departments of education and that grant degrees in \neducation, and it seeks to insist that as a part of the education of \nsecondary school teachers there be a requirement that there is a \nsubject matter major included as part of the learning experience for \nthese teacher candidates. So it doesn't purport to set out new rules to \nimpose on States in the certification process.\n  That is another subject, and we could talk about that in a separate \ndebate. But this subject talks about what kind of quality learning \nexperience do we want our secondary school teachers to have. Some can \ngo through the education departments in colleges and universities--at \nleast in 18 States, or 16 States. Thirty-two require that there be \nsubject matter majors of education degree candidates. But the other \nStates, you can go through an education department learning experience \nand get a degree and then be a candidate for certification and teach in \nthe secondary schools of the State without ever having a major field of \nstudy in an academic subject like English or history or math or \nscience.\n  It seems to me that it makes eminently good sense to suggest as a \nmatter of national policy that our education schools throughout the \ncountry insist upon an academic major for the graduates in the \neducation schools. And that is all this amendment does.\n  The Senator from New Mexico talked about a number of other subjects \nthat he thought ought to be considered by State governments, and they \ndeal in large part with certification items. But the committee has \nalready sorted through those suggestions. They have included some in \nthe managers' package before the Senate, and they have not included \nsome. But this is a very narrow amendment.\n  Of all the suggestions my friend from New Mexico makes, this one, to \nme, is one that ought to be approved by the Senate without any question \nwhatsoever. It is certain that those who teach in the high schools of \nour country ought to be well versed, well grounded in some academic \nsubjects, not just in teaching methods or teaching techniques or other \ncourses--the relationship of the school with the community.\n  We have all, in our common experience, had knowledge of the courses \nthat are taught in many of the education schools. Many of them are \nimportant, and they are valuable. But we do not want teachers coming \nthrough those colleges and universities with only courses in method and \ntechnique and the relationship of the school to the community and the \nother subjects that they are taught in the education departments. And \nwe are not being critical. I am certainly not. My State of Mississippi, \nI am glad to see, is one of the 32 States where the academic major is \nrequired of teacher candidates who are graduating from the departments \nof education in our college and university system.\n  So I hope Senators will look at this amendment carefully and support \nit. To me, it is a very important step in the right direction of \nimproving the overall quality of all of our teachers in secondary \nschools throughout the country.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I reluctantly rise in opposition to this amendment. I \ndo so reluctantly because the Senator from New Mexico and certainly the \nSenator from Mississippi have been very active in trying to accomplish \nthe goals which are intended by this amendment. The bill itself \nalready, with the assistance of the Senator from New Mexico--in many \ncases his own language--has provided incentives and has carefully \noutlined programs to reward the States for accomplishing the role of \nmaking sure that the teachers, the new teachers, have a major in the \narea that they intend to teach.\n  So I applaud him for those, but I just think it goes too far, and I \nthink it is counterproductive if you order the States to do something, \nwhich I agree they should do, but I think it will be counterproductive \nfor the purposes of getting States to understand why they should and to \ndo it not because they are told to but because they want to. On the \n``want to'' side, also, States are rewarded when they do so by grants \nand funding, and those that do not will not be eligible for some of the \nfunds that would be eligible to those that do. So there are incentives \nbuilt in already to accomplish the goal.\n  This provision just goes too far and will result not in improving \nteacher preparation programs but will instead provide little or no \nincentive for States to reform teacher preparation or for schools of \narts and sciences to work with their schools of education. Mandating at \nthe Federal level that States or partnerships require academic majors \nfor prospective teachers in order to be eligible for title II funds is \ncounterproductive to the goals of that title.\n  Title II requires that schools of arts and sciences work with schools \nof education to improve and expand the academic rigor of these \nprograms. By excluding these States and partnerships from competing for \ntitle II money, we are discouraging change in the very States and \nschools that need it the most.\n  About 20 States do not currently require students to have majors in \nacademic content areas, and 30 do. So we should not exclude those that \nare not presently doing it from getting funds to help them do it. In \nother words, those of us who oppose it believe that the carrot is much \nmore effective in this area than the stick. Title II will demand much \nof these grantees that receive the funds. Grantees will be required to \nshow that they have increased the number of courses taught by teachers \nwith academic majors in a particular field of study or they will lose \ntheir grants.\n  It is important to note that the amendment would deny States or \ninstitutions other Federal funds provided\n\n[[Page S7852]]\n\nunder this act, excluding title IV assistance.\n  This, too, is of concern to me. Requiring a major is not an issue \nthat the Federal Government should be mandating. It is an issue that \nhas historically been decided by States and institutions of higher \nlearning. And while we encourage it in title II, it is not appropriate \nfor the Federal Government to mandate it, as a prerequisite for \nparticipation in the title II grant program.\n  Finally, many States are moving towards requiring majors and \nincreasing the academic content knowledge of prospective teachers. It \ndoes not seem at all sensible to deny funds to the folks who are now \nmoving in the right direction.\n  This is a very, very critical area, and this is an important \namendment, and it should be carefully reviewed. It has some support, \nbut I believe the bill is well balanced as it presently is written, \nthat this amendment will be counterproductive of the goals of the bill, \nand therefore I must reluctantly oppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to inquire, I have some questions of \nmy colleague from New Mexico. I have not formulated a final position \nmyself on it. I was listening here to the debate and read some of the \nmaterial about this.\n  First of all, let me say I commend my colleagues from New Mexico and \nMississippi. Even having a discussion of how we can improve the quality \nof our teachers who are working in our elementary and secondary schools \nis worthy. I compliment the chairman and managers. We do some major \nthings in this bill to really try to assist teaching, such as loan \nforgiveness for people in the teaching professions, extended payment \nperiods--a lot of things that really try to recognize the value of \nteachers.\n  I see my colleague from Connecticut has arrived on the floor as well.\n  I was going back over, in my own State of Connecticut, what criteria \nwe have. On the list, we are listed as one of the States that requires \na major. That is true, but only in a limited degree. We require majors \nin certain subject matters, not in every subject matter. For instance, \nin languages we do not require that you have a major in a language, \nEnglish or a foreign language, in order to teach; the assumption being, \nif you were Hispanic or Latino and had acquired that skill, to major in \nit would require that you have teaching skills on how to teach the \nlanguage, but not necessarily require a major in the field.\n  We do in other areas. In the science and math areas we do require \nmajors. The general sciences, history, social studies, business, we do \nrequire majors; in foreign languages and English we do not. We have a \nrequirement here of a minimum of 30 semester hours of credit in the \nsubject for which endorsement is sought. I don't know whether or not \nthat constitutes a major or not. But it seems, here, we have sort of a \nmixed approach.\n  We have some very fine teachers. Mr. President, 80 percent of our \nteachers have advanced degrees in Connecticut, and are normally rated \nas some of the best educated teachers in the country. So my first \ninquiry would be, I guess, if we do not require majors in every subject \nmatter, would we be subject here? For instance, if someone did not have \na major in a language, would Connecticut now have to require a major in \nthat language, or would the 30 semester hours meet the standard? Or \nwould the fact that we do in some and not in others meet the standard? \nOr would we be faced with having our program dollars cut unless we \nchanged?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in response to the Senator from \nConnecticut, I would have to learn more of the detail precisely of what \nis done in Connecticut before I could answer the question. The source \nof the information that is reflected on this chart and that he has \nreferred to as to which States already require this was Education Week \nmagazine. They did interviews with the departments of education this \nlast year, in September of 1997, and published this list.\n  Our amendment does not say that you have to have a major in the \nsubject you wind up teaching. It says you should have a major in a \nsubject you intend to teach. Maybe there should be an exception in \nthere for foreign language. I would be glad to entertain that \nmodification, if the Senator thinks that is a problem. But the notion \nthat you should go into high school teaching without ever having \nmajored in anything, any academic subject, is the concern I have. We \nhave schools around the country--and they are not the schools the \nSenator is thinking of generally, and that I generally think of when I \nthink of teacher preparation--but there are schools around the country \nthat are not requiring people to take academic course work before they \nturn them out to teach in our high schools. So you have people going \nthrough, with very good intentions, who want to become teachers, want \nto become high school teachers, who take a whole raft of education \ncourses and then are turned out to teach, and they do not have the \nacademic training that they need in order to properly prepare students.\n  Mr. DODD. I appreciate the response on that. I do not have an \namendment to offer because I don't feel competent to suggest what my \nState ought to require that there be major studies in. They have \nexcluded certain areas. We require 3 semester hours in certain subject \nhours, 30 semester hours in others, a major in some and not in others. \nThey have made a decision to have sort of a multiple approach to this \nthing, a varied approach on it. Far be it from me to stand here this \nevening and say Connecticut ought to require a major in certain areas \nwhere they don't require it. I have enough confidence in the people who \nhave designed the program there to give them some flexibility.\n\n  What I do not want, if I am supporting my colleague's amendment, is \nto find out if my State loses financial assistance because we have not \nprovided major fields, or required a major in every subject matter \nalthough we have in others. Then I would feel remiss in terms of a \nnumber of areas.\n  As I understand it, you would lose funding in international \neducation, graduate education, funding for historically black colleges \nand universities, strengthening institutional grants that go to mainly \ncommunity colleges. I don't want to be in the position, if I vote for \nthis, to go back and find out I have just deprived my State of funding \nin those areas because the amendment, as crafted, would deny my State \nthose benefits because in some areas majors are not required. That is \nmy concern.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. COATS. Will the Senator from New Mexico yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has the floor, I \nbelieve.\n  Mr. DODD. I am glad to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. COATS. It is right on this very point, because on the list the \nSenator from New Mexico placed, I think, on the desk here--at least I \nhave that list; I think it is the same as his chart--Indiana is also a \nState listed that requires secondary teachers to acquire academic \naccreditation. I think the States ought to do that, or at least ought \nto make that decision. I don't think the Federal Government ought to \nmandate it for the same reasons the Senator from Connecticut stated.\n  However, I am concerned now that the Senator from Connecticut has \nindicated that his State is one of the States you listed under the \n``Yes'' column, as requiring that, as is Indiana, yet it doesn't \nrequire it in the sense that the Senator's amendment requires it in \norder to receive funds. We just learned of the amendment half an hour \nor so ago and have not had an opportunity. Our department of education \nis closed in Indiana now. I haven't had the opportunity to call and say \ndoes this conform? Is this across-the-board? Does this conform with the \namendment of the Senator, or are there exceptions like there are in \nConnecticut where, for certain disciplines, you require the academic \nmajor?\n  I am in the same position, I think, as is the Senator from \nConnecticut. I cannot vote to support that if I don't know whether or \nnot my State is going to be penalized. Does the Senator know the answer \nto that question relative to the State of Indiana?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Are you asking me or the Senator from Connecticut?\n  Mr. COATS. I am pretty sure the Senator from Connecticut doesn't\n\n[[Page S7853]]\n\nknow. If he does he knows more about the education in my State----\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would respond in the same way I would \nrespond to the Senator from Connecticut. The basis for the list is \nEducation Week, which published this based on interviews which they did \nwith departments of education around the country last September. I do \nnot know the detail of the department of education's requirements there \nin Indiana, any more than I know the detail of the department of \neducation requirements in Connecticut.\n  Mr. COATS. I join the Senator from Connecticut in saying I think the \nSenator's efforts are laudable. I do think, as the Senator from Vermont \nhas enumerated, there is a lot of language in this bill which I think \nreflects what the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from \nMississippi are attempting to do, yet it does it in an encouraging way \nrather than a penalizing way. Given the fact there is a lot of \nconfusion about how this amendment applies to these States, and there \nis no way we could determine that this evening, I wonder if the Senator \nwouldn't be interested in withdrawing his amendment--at least working \nwith us to try to accomplish these goals, but not in a way that puts us \nin a position where we will penalize our State.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. In response to that question, I would say the amendment \nby its own language says the requirement doesn't take effect for 3 \nyears.\n  There is a period of time in which to adjust the language if we were \nto adopt the amendment. There is plenty of time to adjust it if it is \nonerous on a particular State. Of course, I would not want to withdraw \nthe amendment because, quite frankly, I think we have a tendency--every \n6 years when we get to this thing, the education schools around the \ncountry lobby heavily against any change in the law or in the \nrequirements imposed on them. We will be here in the year 2004--at \nleast some of you will be here in the year 2004--once again trying to \ndecide whether it is appropriate to require anything of these schools. \nI do not want to withdraw the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Connecticut yield the \nfloor?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I pointed out earlier, I have not formed a \nfinal opinion on it. I raised the question because this was raised to \nme by my State. I am concerned--and I didn't expect this, so my \ncolleague from New Mexico doesn't have a definitive answer--that there \nmight be some criteria left open to the States to determine whether or \nnot something classifies as major. It is not his intention to say to \nsome State that he thinks falls into this category unwittingly they may \nbe deprived of these funds because we didn't realize certain subject \nmajors were not required. That is my concern.\n  I reluctantly may have to vote against the amendment, but I am not \nenthusiastic about doing it because I like the idea behind it. I think \nit makes a lot of sense. John Silber, the distinguished former \npresident of Boston University, wrote an article the other day, one of \nthe op-ed pieces in one of our national papers that makes the case. We \nare turning out people really not qualified to be teaching in our \nclassrooms.\n  I am sympathetic to the idea to increase the teacher skills and \nknowledge base. I want to make sure in doing so, in our enthusiasm for \nthat, we are not doing harmful things along the way. I share the \nenthusiasm. I share the appetite for it.\n  It is almost 8 o'clock here, east coast time. I want to make sure \nthat in voting for something like this I am not saying to 32 States \nthat may have very differing views on what classifies as a major that \nwe have to turn around and undo something here that would otherwise \ndeprive these States of funds they need and are clearly moving in the \narea of improving content as well as teaching skills.\n  I thank my colleague from New Mexico. I will listen to the debate. \nMaybe there will be something enlightening on this. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I think all of us on the \nEducation Committee know of the enormous commitment and perseverance \nand persistence and wisdom of our friend from New Mexico in the \ndevelopment of education policy, particularly the quality of our \nteachers. It is a very important record. When he speaks about these \nissues, I think all of us take these very seriously. I do think, \nhowever, that in this particular situation, on this particular \namendment, I must say that I differ with the Senator from New Mexico. \nLet me be very brief about the reasons.\n  First of all, in the various education programs and recruitment and \nretention programs--and I won't take the time to go on through them, \nbut as one who is a supporter and an author of a fair amount of them, \nthey never were funded over a period of time or funded very lightly:\n  The Paul Douglas Teacher Scholarship, Christa McAuliffe Teacher \nCorps, National Board for Professional Teachers, Standards class size \ndemonstration, middle-school demonstration, new teaching careers, all \nthe various mini-corps programs, foreign language instruction, small \nState teaching initiative--none of these effectively were funded. None \nof these were funded, and we had, as the Senator from New Mexico said, \nno evaluation of the few that were funded.\n  He makes a very good case about the past. I take some exception, and \nI ask our friends to review the parts of the legislation--I know the \nhour is late. We don't spend as much time in going through the \nparticular provisions of the legislation. That is point No. 1.\n  Point No. 2, I believe, that many of the 18 States are just the kinds \nof States that need this help and assistance. I will go into the \nvarious details of the programs, and many of the comments the Senator \nfrom New Mexico has made are actually the kinds of criteria which are \nincluded in the various competitive grants. I don't want to exclude \nthese 18 States. In many instances, they need the help and assistance \nthe most. We all need it. We have to have 2 million teachers over the \nnext 10 years, and we have to strengthen the opportunities for teachers \nto teach better and give our teachers additional training programs so \nthey can do it and hold them to a higher accountability. We are in \ncomplete agreement with that.\n  The question is how you get there. I am not for excluding 18 States \nfrom being able to participate. When we were considering the Goals \n2000, we were told that in making available resources that were going \nto be available to States on a voluntary basis that there were many \nStates that said, ``We don't want to do it because we do not want to \nhave participation of Federal programs in here.'' I do not want the \nStates that may need this the most denied it.\n\n  Let us look at the question--I will take the part of the Senator's \nevaluation first. If you look in the legislation on page 373, you see \n``Accountability and Evaluation.'' After a State receives a competitive \ngrant under this section, it ``shall submit an annual accountability \nreport to the Secretary''--the Secretary of Education--but also to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources, our committee, and as well as \nto the House.\n  Such report shall describe the degree in which the State is using the \nfunds to, what? Student achievement: ``Increasing student achievement \nfor all students, as measured by increased graduation rates, decreased \ndropout rates, or higher scores on local, State or other assessments.''\n  Second: ``Raising Standards.--Raising the State academic standards \nrequired to enter the teaching profession . . .'' That is going to be \npart of the criteria. It will be part of the application for States if \nthey want to participate in this program. They may have to, as part of \ntheir evaluation, have programs that will encourage the States to raise \nacademic standards ``required to enter the teaching profession, \nincluding, where appropriate, incentives to incorporate the requirement \nof an academic major in the subject, or related discipline, in which \nthe teacher plans to teach.''\n  This is a positive incentive. We are trying to, with the scarce \nresources that are going to be included in this bill, to say, yes, we \nwant to see movement toward an academic major in the subject area and \nrelated discipline in which the teacher plans to teach. That is written \nright in the evaluation program.\n\n[[Page S7854]]\n\n  It continues with regard to the core academic subjects, and it talks \nabout the efforts that will be made to decrease shortages for \nprofessional development in poor urban areas and rural areas and \ncommunities, and it does an evaluation of these.\n  What it does find out, as it says on page 377:\n  ``Each State or teacher training partnership''--that is either the \nState or local community--``receiving a grant . . . shall report \nannually on progress toward meeting the purposes of this part [upon \nwhich the grant was given] . . .. If the Secretary, after consultation \nwith the peer review panel . . .''--and that has been spelled out--\n``determines that the State or partnership is not making substantial \nprogress in meeting the purposes, goals, objectives and measures, as \nappropriate, by the end of the second year of the grant, the grant \nshall not be continued for the third year of the grant.''\n  I think that is pretty good, Mr. President, if we have a Secretary \nwho we are going to hold accountable to this. I think that is pretty \ngood. That is a tough evaluation. It identifies many of the points--\nvirtually all of the points--that the Senator from New Mexico has \nidentified. Whether it will be enforced, whether we will be serious \nabout seeing that it is enforced is going to be the challenge that is \ngoing to be placed upon us.\n  Look at page 372 where it talks about the responsibility of the local \npartnership in encouraging teachers at the local partnership. The \napplication will:\n\n       describe how the partnership will restructure and improve \n     teaching, teacher training, and development programs, and how \n     systematic changes will contribute to increased student \n     achievement;\n       describe how the partnership will prepare teachers to work \n     with diverse student populations, including individuals with \n     disabilities and limited English proficient individuals;\n\n  Some might say that is too prescriptive in terms of establishing at \nleast criteria where there will be competition for these resources. \nDescribe how the partnership will help prepare teachers to use \ntechnology. We can have all the technology in the world in our \nclassrooms, but if our teachers do not know how to blend it into \ncurriculum, that is very significant to mention.\n  The point is, Mr. President, that I believe that in this program we \nhave the most effective kind of evaluation and criteria and \naccountability that I have seen in higher education. We do not do as \nwell as we should in most programs, I will agree with that. But it does \nseem to me that the committee has given very substantial consideration, \nfirst of all, in recognizing that so many of these programs here just \ndid not measure up, did not have the support, and was not the way to \ngo.\n  And the best way we were going to try to do it was to provide some \nresources--half the money to the States, half to the partnerships. We \nhad a lot of debate about the allocations of resources, and then we \nestablished criteria which is spelled out and which has included many \nof the points of the Senator from New Mexico about what we hope will be \nachieved in those applications. And we do that for the States as well \nas the local partnerships. Then we have a tough evaluation program to \nhold the States and the partnerships accountable.\n  So I must say, although there is much to which the Senator has \npointed out that I agree with, it seems to me that the danger that we \nare risking in accepting the Senator's amendment is that we will be \ndenying important opportunities for States that for one reason or \nanother will not meet the exact criteria. They will be denied. We will \nbe cutting them off from any participation. I do not think that is the \nway to go. I think the evaluating programs and the enforcement \nmechanisms included in this bill are the way to go. So I hope that the \namendment would not be accepted.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. I won't belabor this because I think most of the points \nhave been made. I do want to join both the chairman and the ranking \nmember of the committee in opposing this amendment for all the reasons \nthat were stated. We have spent a considerable amount of time and \neffort in the committee to try to address the very areas that the \nSenator from New Mexico has raised. We have worked with the Senator \nfrom New Mexico in attempting to incorporate a number of his \nsuggestions and ideas.\n  I think the Senator from Connecticut raises a critical point relative \nto the fact that a chart out of Education Week does not really tell us \nthe full status of where each of our States reside relative to these \nrequirements. And because the Senator's amendment was substituted in \nlieu of another amendment, most of us are not able to get ahold of our \nState education departments at 8 o'clock in the evening to find out \njust exactly where we stand. We end up then potentially penalizing our \nStates for failure to meet the requirements of the Senator's amendment \nrather than providing, as the Senator from Massachusetts said, \nincentives for them to do so.\n  Also, I point out to Members that the Senator's amendment violates \nthe actual Department of Education Organization Act policy, which I \nwould like to read from. Section 103, titled ``Federal-State \nRelationship'' says:\n\n       It is the intention of the Congress, in the establishment \n     of the Department, to protect the rights of State and local \n     governments and public and private educational institutions \n     in the areas of educational policies and administration \n     programs and to strengthen and improve the control of such \n     governments and institutions over their own educational \n     programs and policies. The establishment of the Department of \n     Education [this was written into the code when the Department \n     of Education was established] shall not increase the \n     authority of the Federal Government over education or \n     diminish the responsibility of education which is reserved to \n     the States and the local school systems and other \n     instrumentalities of the States.\n\n  It goes on to talk about basically attempting to micromanage from the \nFederal level decisions that even with the establishment of the \nDepartment of Education the intent of Congress is listed.\n  Now, in a sense, we are doing that. But we are doing that here in \nthis bill in a way that encourages and still leaves the decisions to \nthe States to determine what their policies will be, and in this \nregard, policies relative to qualifications for teachers.\n\n  We all support the goal of higher qualified teachers being available. \nBut the Senator's amendment, I believe, takes us one step further than \nwe ought to go by penalizing those States that do not have that \nstandard. And I think there are some 15 or 20 that fall in that \ncategory. But as we now have learned, there may be several more. There \nis no way we can find out this evening. There may be several more that \nhave modifications of that requirement that require it in certain \ndisciplines but do not require it in other disciplines.\n  The Senator from Connecticut cited the example of an individual \naffluent in a native language that might major in a different subject, \nand yet because they do not need to major in that language, but then \nintend to teach in that subject, they want to have an academic major in \nanother subject. Are we going to penalize a State institution which \nreceives funds from the Federal Government for allowing that to take \nplace?\n  I think there are unintended consequences here that we ought to \nrealize. And we worked on this carefully in a bipartisan way. There was \na unanimous consensus coming out of committee in terms of how we would \naddress this particular issue--18 to nothing vote.\n  I urge Members to support the hard effort that has been put into this \nand not at the last minute here, on an amendment we really have not had \ntime to review and even check with our States on, to add this mandatory \nlanguage to this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me just respond to the various \npoints that have been made, and then I will yield the floor and we can \nget on to other business. I gather that it is not possible, because of \nthe arrangements that have been previously made with some Senators, to \ngo ahead with the vote. So it is going to be stacked for later.\n  Let me just respond to a couple points that have been made. The \nnotion that we are trying to micromanage by putting this requirement in\n\n[[Page S7855]]\n\nFederal law, I do not think is accurate. We are saying, look, we give \nthe States $1.8 billion to support these education training programs. \nIs it too much to ask that the education training programs that are \nbeing supported with this $1.8 billion provide academic instruction to \nthe people who they are going to turn out to teach in our high schools? \nIs that too much to ask?\n  I mean, we are not asking that that be done for the elementary \nschools. Fine, you can continue to turn out people for the elementary \nschools who take nothing but education courses. We are not trying to \ninterfere with that. But if you are going to teach at the high school \nlevel, you ought to take some kind of academic training. That is what \nthis amendment provides.\n  The notion that this is overreaching by the Federal Government, the \nSenator from Indiana saying this violates the spirit or the policy that \nestablished the Department of Education, we have done the same thing \nwith student loan default rates. We set it up with standards that need \nto be met. We have substantially reduced student loan default rates \nbecause of what we have done in that area.\n  We say here, fine, if you do not want the $1.8 billion, then do \nanything you want. If you want the $1.8 billion, then we will give you \n3 years in which to figure out how to begin providing academic \ninstruction to the people who are going to teach in the high schools.\n  I am in an awkward position here. Most of the people who have spoken \nagainst this amendment are from States that already require what the \namendment is intended to require.\n  I am from a State that does not require what the amendment is \nintended to require, and I think we should. I think the State of New \nMexico ought to require that anyone who is going into high school \nteaching have a major in some academic subject, not necessarily the one \nthey wind up teaching in but in some academic subject.\n  I appreciate the concern of the Senator from Massachusetts and \neveryone else. They are genuinely concerned about what will happen to \nthe 18 States. I represent one of the 18 States. I tell you what I \nthink will happen to the 18 States. I think they will propose a little \nstiffer requirements. They will do a better job of teaching the \nteachers who are going into our schools. And I think the students of \nthe country will benefit from that.\n  I think this is a responsible thing to do. I hope very much Members \nwill support the amendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask unanimous consent the Bingaman amendment be \ntemporarily set aside. I further ask unanimous consent that Senator \nDomenici be recognized to speak for up to 10 minutes, and upon the \nconclusion of his remarks, that Senator Warner be recognized, and \nfollowing that, we take up the amendment of Senator Harkin.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, I now have been waiting at \nleast 4 hours since I came on the floor. It was my understanding--just \nmy understanding, I didn't consult with the manager of the bill--but it \nis my understanding I was to come right after the disposal of Senator \nBingaman's amendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I point out, this will just take a very few minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thought you said there was another amendment?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. It is one I don't think will take any time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am the other Senator from New Mexico, \nso whatever has been said about the amendment, and who is for and who \nis against it, was not talking about my amendment.\n  First, I don't have any amendments. I rise to congratulate the \ncommittee on an excellent bill. By authorizing this Higher Education \nAct, the Senate is making a downpayment on our Nation's future. \nBenjamin Franklin, in the very early days of our country, put it best \nwhen he said, ``An investment in knowledge always pays the best \ninterest.'' Sometimes around here we are talking about interest rates \nas if they apply only to the economy and the like. So Benjamin \nFranklin, even many years ago, was talking about interest. He said, \n``An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.'' I believe that \nis right.\n  Building upon his statement and others, I say it is a simple fact \nthat the future is prejudiced in favor of those who can read, write, \nand do math. A good education is a ticket to an opportunity to a secure \neconomic future in the middle class of the United States.\n  As the earning gap between brains and brawn grows even larger, almost \nno one doubts today the link between education and an individual's \nprospects for a good and substantial livelihood and a good life in \nAmerica. That is what the Senate is doing today in improving the \npostsecondary education system of our country. Incidentally, I said \n``improving'' because it is already the best in the world. There are no \ncountries in the world that have a postsecondary education system that \ncomes anywhere close to ours.\n  So we are not here to be critical, we are here to offer improvements. \nIn a nutshell, this bill improves the financial aid opportunities for \nstudents, creates a unified program to promote excellence in the \nteachers of our public schools, and streamlines the Higher Education \nAct by consolidating overlapping programs and eliminating unnecessary \nregulatory requirements.\n  Before I make some specific comments on provisions in the bill, I \nwill quickly talk about my home State of New Mexico. We are a small \nState. Approximately 100,000 students are enrolled in New Mexico's \npublic colleges and universities, with about 53,000 enrolled in \ncommunity colleges and about 47,000 in universities. However, the \nnumber of high school graduates is expected to increase during the next \ndecade and members of the current workforce are expected to seek \nadditional education during that period.\n  Consequently, we must have a very high quality, low-cost college \neducation available to a growing number of students. We must provide \nthat regardless of income level, ethnic background, or place of \nresidence. Students attending New Mexico institutions received more \nthan $200 million in financial aid, counting grants and loans from all \nsources, during the 1995-1996 academic year. Thus, I believe that \neducational performance is a crucial element to our State's future. \nSpeaking as a New Mexican, clearly, our state's future relies upon the \ncapacity to prosper in this extremely competitive national-\ninternational economy and is directly related to the education we are \nable to give our young people.\n  Our colleges and universities directly and indirectly contribute to \nthe economic vitality of our country and our State as they produce \ngraduates with considerable intellectual depth and breadth, workers \nwhose skills allow them to meet the demands of their employers, and \nfirst-rate research that helps to expand the boundaries of our \nknowledge.\n  Let me make a few comments about some provisions.\n  Title II: I congratulate the committee for improving teacher quality. \nFocusing on the two areas they have with reference to teacher quality \nand recruitment of teachers for underserved areas, first, the bill \nseeks to improve student achievement, improving the quality of the \ncurrent and future teaching force by improving preparation of \nprospective teachers and enhancing professional development of \nactivities; second, it seeks to increase the number of students, \nespecially minority students, who complete high-quality teacher \npreparation programs.\n  Title III: the institutional aid title, creates a new grant program \nfor tribal colleges--those are our Indian colleges, which obviously are \nseverely underfunded and severely lacking in maximum professional \nqualities of their teachers--and the universities to strengthen \nservices to Native American students.\n  Student financial aid is given a huge boost through several changes \nwhich I believe are in compliance with the 5-year budget agreement we \nmade last year, which annually increased maximum Pell grant levels to \nthe following amounts: $5,000 for academic year 1999-2000; $5,200 for \nacademic year 2000-2001; $5,400 for academic year 2001-2002; $5,600 for \nacademic year 2002-2003; and eventually up to $5,800 for academic year \n2003-2004.\n  There are TRIO Programs that are given a boost through changes to the \nStudent Assistance section under title IV which provides benefits to \n700,000\n\n[[Page S7856]]\n\nstudents nationwide. Two-thirds of the participating students come from \nfamilies where neither parent attended college and incomes are below \n$24,000. This bill reserves up to 2 percent of that program for the \nevaluation and dissemination of partnership grants.\n  The new Dissemination/Partnership provision would encourage \npartnerships between TRIO programs and other community based \norganizations offering programs or activities serving at-risk students.\n  The Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFEL) is stabilized in the \nfollowing way. Student loan rates will be equal to the 91-day T-bill-\nplus-1.7-percent while students are in school, and plus-2.3-percent \nduring repayment after graduation. The interest amount is capped at \n8.25 percent and for PLUS loans, rates will be the 91-day-T-bill-plus-\n3.1 percent, capped at 9 percent for borrowers and lenders.\n  An innovative loan forgiveness program is also included for teachers. \nThirty percent of a teacher's loans will be forgiven after the fourth \nand fifth complete years of teaching in a high-poverty school and 40 \npercent after the sixth complete year after meeting certain eligibility \nrequirements.\n  Finally, there is the creation of new part within Title V dedicated \nsolely to supporting the needs of Hispanic Serving Institutions that is \nauthorized at $45 million for fiscal year 1999.\n  Mr. President, I believe we are taking an important step forward \ntoday by making an investment in our nation's future with the \nreauthorization of the Higher Education Act.\n  I close by saying, frankly, I believe that we have a magnificent \npost-high-school education system because there is great competition. \nAs a matter of fact, there is no question in my mind that if we had \nsimilar competition or even a little bit of it in our public school \nsystem, we would not have the education bills that we bring before the \nU.S. Congress which are so detailed and give so much direction and have \nso many hundreds of programs.\n  Higher education is competitive. You can make your choice. It can be \na private school, a public school. You can find the very best; you can \nfind less than the very best. But everywhere you look, you will find an \nopportunity to get a good college education. That is because there are \nso many institutions that want to do this, love their work, and think \nthey are part of America's future.\n  I end tonight congratulating the committee, in particular the \nchairman, for the good bipartisan work that has been accomplished on \nthis bill. I am glad, on a matter of this importance, we are not \nfighting in a partisan way here on the floor but tonight will approve \nthis bill by an overwhelming bipartisan vote which means we support \nsecondary education in America in a big way. It is our future. I yield \nthe floor.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am in consultation with the \ndistinguished managers of this bill in hopes that an amendment can be \naccepted, and I am receiving, I think, very fine cooperation.\n  I would like to state my case so that Senators can fully understand \nthe purpose of this amendment. There is an ever-increasing problem, \nregrettably, throughout America at our colleges and universities, and \nthat is binge drinking. But first I would like to congratulate the \nchairman of the committee, Senator Jeffords, for all his hard work in \ncrafting an excellent Higher Education Reauthorization bill. I am \nprivileged to serve on the committee with the distinguished Chairman. \nIndeed, our distinguished ranking member, Senator Kennedy, along with \nSenators Coats and Dodd, must also be recognized for their efforts in \nthis successful reauthorization legislation.\n  S. 1882 has several important provisions aimed at reducing and \neliminating the illegal use of drugs and alcohol on college campuses. I \napplaud the provisions for competitive grants to institutions programs \nof alcohol and drug abuse prevention and education. In addition, the \ncollegiate initiative to reduce binge drinking, included in the \nlegislation as a Sense of the Congress, is also noteworthy as \ninstitutions try to change the culture of alcohol use on college and \nuniversity campuses.\n  Mr. President, more can be done, I think, to change this culture of \nalcohol on college campuses. This past year--and I regret to have to be \non the floor of the Senate to say this--there have been five alcohol-\nrelated deaths at colleges and universities in the Commonwealth of \nVirginia. Five. One inebriated student fell out of a dorm window to her \ndeath. A second inebriated student fell down a flight of stairs to her \ndeath.\n  In response to these deaths, the then-Attorney General of Virginia, \nRichard Cullen, created a ``Task Force on Drinking by College \nStudents'' in November of 1997. The task force included forty-four \nmembers. Among them were parents of the deceased students, a \nrepresentative from every college and university in the Commonwealth of \nVirginia, representatives of the business community, representatives of \nthe law enforcement community, representatives of the legal community, \nand a number of members of the General Assembly of Virginia, our state \nlegislature. The current Attorney General, Mark Early, assumed \nleadership of the task force in January of this year when he was \ninaugurated. He should be commended for all of his hard work and \ndedication in bringing to a conclusion the important work of this \nvolunteer group, as it relates to the use of alcohol on college \ncampuses. The task force met for the final time on July 1 of this year \nand prepared its recommendations.\n  One problem the task force recognized immediately was the restriction \nplaced on colleges and universities by the Family Educational Rights \nand Privacy Act, known as FERPA, for schools to disclose a student's \neducational record to a parent without the consent of the student. The \nrecommendation continues that it should be the policy and the practice \nof each college and university to notify parents of dependent students \nof violations of law as they relate to alcohol and drugs.\n  Mr. President, I could not agree more with this recommendation. As a \nparent, and indeed as a grandparent, I would want to know if my \nchildren were in the unfortunate position of being in violation of the \nlaw as it relates to alcohol and drugs while they were students at a \ncollege or university. I would want to step forward in a constructive \nway, as would other parents, to lend a hand and assistance to work with \nthe faculty and administration of the college or university to help \nthat student. But sometimes parents are not aware of these problems \nbecause of the provision as construed in FERPA. Our colleges and \nuniversities should be free to notify the parents of dependent students \nwho have violated the law relating to drugs and alcohol.\n  My amendment, which I am still working on--and I understand, of \ncourse, it has to be accepted by the managers of the bill. There is no \nway to bring it to the attention of the Senate through a vote. The \nAmendment I seek is simple. It reads: ``Nothing in this bill shall be \nconstrued to prohibit an institution of postsecondary education from \ndisclosing, to a parent of a student, information regarding violation \nof any federal, state, or local laws governing the use or possession of \nalcohol or drugs, whether or not that information is contained in the \nstudent's education records, if the student is under the age of 21.''\n  The federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, FERPA, \ncreates, we believe, an impediment to the disclosure of a nondependent \nstudent's educational records to parents without the student's consent. \nNotification of parents of dependent students of violations of alcohol \nand drug law should be the policy and practice of colleges and \nuniversities all across our Nation.\n  As a member of the Virginia delegation to Congress--and I am \nprivileged to be one--I am trying to see that there is appropriate \nlegislation--so that there is a presumption of dependency by colleges \nand universities for all students who are under the age of 21 for the \npurposes of this notification to parents. This would ensure that \nparents are informed when their sons and daughters had the misfortune \nof violating state alcohol law or drug laws.\n  Mr. President, that summarizes my views. I shall continue to work \nwith the distinguished managers of this bill through the evening in the \nhopes that we can reach some understanding and that this measure may be \nincorporated in the bill.\n  You know, it is interesting. Tonight, I was very pleased to see an \nannouncement by the President of the United\n\n[[Page S7857]]\n\nStates of a decision to expend literally hundreds of millions of \ndollars on an advertising program to combat drug abuse to these young \npeople. It seems to me that this provision I am offering simply enables \nthe universities and colleges to bring in the parents of dependent \nstudents under 21 and involve them in a process, hopefully, to help the \nuniversity and the administration. We are placing a tremendous burden \non the administrative staffs of the universities and colleges. Why \nshould they not have the benefit of parental help in tragic situations \nwhere there has been a clear violation of law as it relates to drugs \nand alcohol?\n  I thank the distinguished managers. Perhaps during the course of the \nevening, we can work out an amendment. The one I have here technically, \nfor some reason, is not correct, but I have full confidence in the \nmanagers to see that we can get this done.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia, who \nhas been a tremendous help to me on the committee. I just point out \nthat since he has been on there, the ability to get a consensus has \ngrown immensely. A lot of it is through his savvy way of being able to \npull people together to walk in the same direction. I deeply appreciate \nthat. I assure him that this is a critical area, which all of us happen \nto be deeply concerned about. I will work with the ranking member of \nthis committee to find a solution.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Chairman for those kind words. \nI don't think I deserve any special credit. But I have over a quarter \nof a century of association with the distinguished ranking member. We \nwent to the University of Virginia Law School at slightly different \ntimes. I was a member of the law class with his marvelous brother, \nRobert Kennedy, whom I adored in law school. I wish he were here \ntonight. He could stop this thing in a minute.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We accept the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, then I will be seated.\n  Mr. DODD. I am sure your parents recalled quite frequently that you \nwere both at the university. [Laughter.]\n  Mr. WARNER. I am not sure we wanted them to.\n  I thank the managers.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, if I could ask the indulgence of the \nSenator, I think we are both willing to accept the Warner amendment, if \nwe could have that offered and accepted, if that would be all right \nwith the Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3117\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank both managers.\n  I send an amendment to the desk\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3117.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert:\n       Nothing in this bill shall be construed to prohibit an \n     institution of postsecondary education from disclosing, to a \n     parent of a student, information regarding violation of any \n     Federal, state, or local laws governing the use or possession \n     of alcohol or drugs, whether or not that information is \n     contained in the student's education records, if the student \n     is under the age of 21.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is my understanding that it is \nacceptable to both managers. I thank them.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. It is acceptable.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I urge acceptance of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3117) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3118\n\n     (Purpose: To reduce student loan fees, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin), for himself, and Mr. \n     Reid, proposes an amendment numbered 3118.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title IV, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. REDUCTION IN STUDENT LOAN FEES.\n\n       (a) Federal Direct Stafford Loans.--Section 455(c) (20 \n     U.S.C. 1087e(c)) is amended by inserting ``, except that the \n     Secretary shall charge the borrower of a Federal Direct \n     Stafford Loan an origination fee in the amount of 3.0 percent \n     of the principal amount of the loan'' before the period.\n       (b) Subsidized Federal Stafford Loans.--\n       (1) Amendment.--Subparagraph (H) of section 428(b)(1) (20 \n     U.S.C. 1078(b)(1)) is amended--\n       (A) by striking ``not more than''; and\n       (B) by striking ``will not be used for incentive payments \n     to lenders'' and inserting ``shall be paid to the Federal \n     Government for deposit in the Treasury''.\n       (2) Repeal.--Subparagraph (H) of section 428(b)(1) (20 \n     U.S.C. 1078(b)(1)) is repealed.\n       (c) Unsubsidized Stafford Loan and PLUS Loan Insurance \n     Premium Redirection.--\n       (1) Unsubsidized stafford loans.--Section 428H(h) (20 \n     U.S.C. 1078-8(h)) is amended--\n       (A) by striking ``may'' and inserting ``shall'';\n       (B) by striking ``not more than'';\n       (C) by striking ``, if such premium will not be used for \n     incentive payments to lenders''; and\n       (D) by inserting at the end the following: ``The proceeds \n     of the insurance premium shall be paid to the Federal \n     Government for deposit into the Treasury.''.\n       (2) PLUS loans.--Section 428B (20 U.S.C. 1078-2) is amended \n     by adding after subsection (f) (as added by section 427(2)) \n     the following:\n       ``(g) Insurance Premium.--Each State or nonprofit private \n     institution or organization having an agreement with the \n     Secretary under section 428(b)(1) shall charge the borrower \n     of a loan made under this section a single insurance premium \n     in the amount of 1 percent of the principal amount of the \n     loan. The proceeds of the insurance premium shall be paid to \n     the Federal Government for deposit into the Treasury.''.\n       (d) Effective Dates.--\n       (1) Subsection (b)(1).--The amendments made by subsection \n     (b)(1) shall take effect on the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (2) Subsections (a) and (b)(2).--The amendments made by \n     subsections (a) and (b)(2) shall take effect on July 1, 1999.\n       (3) Subsection (c).--The amendments made by subsection (c) \n     shall take effect on October 1, 1998.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the amendment I just sent to the desk \nreally can be called the Tax Reduction for College Students Amendment, \nbecause that is exactly what it is.\n  So all Senators who are interested in cutting taxes, I say listen up \nbecause this is your amendment because that is what this amendment \ndoes. It cuts taxes, and it cuts taxes for college students. Let me \nexplain.\n  First of all, I would like to say the legislation we are considering \ntoday, the Higher Education Amendments of 1998, is a strong bill. There \nare many positive features of this legislation.\n  I want to commend Senators Jeffords, Kennedy, Coats, and Dodd for \nputting together a strong bipartisan bill. However, I believe that this \namendment I am offering will do more to strengthen it even further.\n  So the amendment is simple. It cuts the tax which has become known as \norigination and insurance fees. But a tax by any other name is still a \ntax. That is what it is. This amendment cuts this tax, this student \ntax, by 25 percent.\n  In other words, it cuts it from 4 percent to 3 percent for students \nwith Federally subsidized guaranteed and direct student loans. It is \npaid for by eliminating or reducing excessive government subsidies paid \nto the student loan middlemen--the guaranty agencies.\n  My amendment eliminates the 1-percent insurance fee paid by students \non the subsidized Federal family education loans, and reduces the \norigination fee on subsidized direct loans by one point. The net result \nis that all students with subsidized loans will have these taxes cut to \n3 percent. In real terms it means up to an additional $171.25 while a \nstudent is in school.\n\n[[Page S7858]]\n\n  Sam Barr, from the University of Northern Iowa, wrote,\n\n       I have been in the financial aid profession since 1985. . . \n     . Over the years, I have had the opportunity to meet with and \n     counsel hundreds of students regarding loans. Many of these \n     students have expressed concern regarding the fact that they \n     received less money than they borrowed, and were very upset \n     that they had to pay back the fees--with interest [even \n     though they didn't get anything.]\n\n  Currently students pay the following taxes on their loans. Students \nwith direct loans pay a 4-percent origination fee. Students with \nguaranteed loans pay a 3-percent origination fee, and a 1-percent \ninsurance fee. In some cases, guaranty agencies currently waive a part \nor all of the insurance tax for some students with guaranteed loans.\n  For example, the Iowa agency waived half of the fee for students with \nguaranteed loans. California and Pennsylvania waived the entire 1-\npercent insurance fee.\n  So I have to ask, Mr. President, if some agencies are currently \nwaiving the insurance fee on a selective basis, we really must question \nwhether this revenue is really needed by the agencies.\n  Second, this benefit should be available to students on an equitable \nbasis in all States and in both loan programs. Unfortunately, Federal \nlaw does not provide a similar break for students with direct loans. As \na result, in my State of Iowa, more than half of the students that \nattend direct loan schools cannot receive this cut. In other words, \nIowa waves half of the fee. So that brings it down to 3\\1/2\\ percent. \nThat is for guaranteed loans, but half of the students in Iowa go into \nthe Direct Loan Program. They have to pay the full 4 percent. That is \nsimply not fair.\n  So my amendment provides an equitable distribution of the tax cut by \nproviding relief for all students with subsidized guaranteed and direct \nloans instead of just a select few. It creates a level playing field \nbetween the two programs by cutting the combined student loan tax by 25 \npercent. The amendment will also ensure that all agencies will operate \nin the most efficient manner possible.\n  Mr. President, this insurance fee has been a part of the Guaranteed \nStudent Loan Program since its inception. However, over the years \nadditional subsidies were added to support the guaranty agencies. As a \nresult, these agencies have accumulated huge reserves, currently in \nexcess of $2.4 billion. So what we are doing is recalling about half of \nthat money. But agencies will continue to hold over $1 billion in \nreserves needed to reimburse lenders for defaulted student loans.\n  In addition, the excessive subsidies have enabled agencies to pay \nlavish salaries in the past. At one point, a CEO of U.S.A. Group, the \nNation's largest guaranty agency, was paid over $1 million in salary \nand benefits.\n  To be sure, the Department of Education has cracked down on this \npractice and has established a compensation ceiling to prevent agencies \nfrom using Federal funds to pay exorbitant salaries. However, it is \nclear that generous subsidies enabled this to occur. The Senate bill \nhas revamped the guaranty agency subsidies.\n  Even with my amendment, these agencies will continue to be paid \nhandsomely for their work and will receive in excess of $4.5 billion \nover the next 5 years.\n  So if you have heard from some of your guaranty agencies that the \nHarkin amendment is going to break them and cause them to go bankrupt, \nthis chart will prove otherwise. Over the next 5 years, if you add up \ntheir fees, collections, investment income, and prevention fees, it \nadds up to almost $4.6 billion that they are going to get over the next \n5 years.\n  Without my amendment, they are going to get probably about double \nthat, about $8 billion over the next 5 years. So this is quite \nsufficient to take care of any problems that they might have--$4.58 \nbillion.\n  Mr. President, I am fully aware of the opposition to this amendment. \nThe guaranty agencies are obviously opposed to it. Critics have called \nit a thinly veiled attempt to destabilize the Guaranteed Loan Program \nto force schools to enter a Direct Loan Program. But how could that be \ntrue? For example, in Iowa, as I said, in my home State, the State has \nwaived half the fee. Students under the Guaranteed Loan Program pay \n3\\1/2\\ percent. Under the Direct Loan Program, they pay 4 percent. \nThese kinds of anomalies occur in a lot of States. All I am saying is \nmake them both the same; make them both 3 percent.\n  That is what my amendment does. As I have stated in committee \nrepeatedly in the past, I have supported the two loan programs. The \ncompetition of the Direct Loan Program has led to dramatic improvements \nin the Guaranteed Loan Program, and I think the result has been very \npositive for our students when we have both of these programs. But they \nare uneven and they are unfair.\n  Now, opponents also allege my amendment would cause individual \nagencies to become insolvent, thereby jeopardizing the payment of \ndefault claims by lenders. Absolute nonsense. In 1992, in the aftermath \nof the failure of the Higher Education Assistance Foundation, the law \nwas changed to make it clear that default claims would be paid by the \nFederal Government in the event of the insolvency of an agency--period.\n  Well, Mr. President, over the past 17 years, since the inception, in \n1981, of this program, the lender subsidy has declined dramatically, \nfrom about $1.9 billion in fiscal year 1982 to less than $300 million \nlast year. Unfortunately, students have not seen a commensurate \nreduction in the student loan tax. In fact, students are actually \npaying more. Revenues from the program, the origination fees, have more \nthan doubled. In 1982, when it started, revenues were $292 million; \nlast year, they were $629 million. So students are paying more.\n  The President's fiscal year 1999 budget proposed phasing out the fee \nfor the neediest students over the next few years. I wish we could do \nthat this year. However, I recognize that elimination of the tax \nprobably does not seem possible at this time. So this amendment takes \nthe first step with a 25-percent cut in the tax for the neediest \nstudents.\n  Last year, we provided a significant boost to the Pell grant. We \nraised the maximum grant by $300 million to $3,000 per student. This \neffort received strong bipartisan support. My amendment will have a \nsimilar impact for students. It puts more money in their pockets to pay \ntheir educational expenses. This chart shows that.\n  What this amendment does is it basically says that over a 4-year \nperiod the reduction in the tax will mean a savings of about $171.25 \nper student. Now, to those of you who don't think that is much money, \nthat buys a lot of textbooks for a student going to college. It buys a \nlot of textbooks.\n  These students, the neediest of students need every penny they can \nget to pay tuition and buy their books in school. Again, they are \nfrustrated when they go in and borrow the money and they pay the fee, \nand they get less money than what they borrowed. And then when they pay \nit back, they even have to pay interest on the money they never got. \nVery unfair.\n  Well, my amendment has the support of virtually every major higher \neducation group, and I have a number of letters in support of this \namendment. I ask unanimous consent, first of all, that a list of \norganizations supporting the amendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n            Organizations That Support the Harkin Amendment\n\n       Secretary Richard Riley.\n       American Council on Education.\n       American Association of Community Colleges.\n       American Association of State Colleges and Universities.\n       Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities.\n       Council of Graduate Schools.\n       Council of Independent Colleges.\n       National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher \n     Education.\n       National Association of College and University Business \n     Officers.\n       National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant \n     Colleges.\n       National Association of Student Financial Aid \n     Administrators.\n       U.S. PIRG.\n       U.S. Student Association.\n       The Education Trust.\n       The National Association of Graduate Professional Students.\n       Association of American Universities.\n       California Community Colleges.\n       California Association of Student Financial Aid \n     Administrators.\n\n\n[[Page S7859]]\n\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have several letters here--one from the Secretary of \nEducation, Richard Riley, in support of this amendment; one from the \nAmerican Council on Education in support of the amendment; one from a \nconsortium including U.S. PIRG, United States Student Association, the \nEducation Trust, and the National Association of Graduate Professional \nStudents in support of this amendment, and, lastly, one from the \nNational Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators in support \nof the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will be delighted to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Is it the Senator's understanding that this origination \nfee was really developed to help pay costs of the loan program when we \nhad soaring interest rates?\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is exactly right, these huge, high interest rates.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So it was really an insurance program in terms of the \nloan program at that period of time. And then as the Senator makes the \npoint now that we have virtually a strong economy, we have stable \ninterest rates, low interest rates in terms of these programs, whatever \njustification was there at that time certainly is not there at the \npresent time but still this fee has been maintained.\n  The Senator, as I understand, has spelled out that with his amendment \nthere is still going to be a sound economic situation in terms of the \ntotal program, and that we are going to save at a time, as the Senator \nfrom Connecticut and others have pointed out, of ever-increasing costs \nand the pressure that is on middle-income families and working \nfamilies, you are talking about, what is it, $171?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, $171.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And that is a lot of money for an awful lot of students. \nI can remember in my own State of Massachusetts when the University of \nMassachusetts in Boston had $1,000 a year tuition, 85 percent of the \nparents of the students who attended that university had never gone to \ncollege and 85 percent of them worked 25 hours a week or more. And when \nthey raised the tuition by $100, they lost 15 percent of their \napplications--15 percent.\n  It is a real reflection--when you are talking $170, we are talking \nabout a lot of books. We are talking about a real lifeline, in many \ninstances, to sons and daughters of hard-working families, I know \ncertainly in many of the urban areas and I believe in the rural areas, \nas well.\n  We have followed this issue for a long period of time. The Senator \nhas been a constant advocate for moderating the cost of higher \neducation over the long time that he has been in the Senate, and it has \nbeen a challenging one. But he, I believe, has made a very solid \nrecommendation, and I would certainly hope his position is sustained.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to support his amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank Senator Kennedy for those comments in support of \nthis amendment.\n  The Senator is absolutely right. This came in at a time when there \nwas extremely high interest rates, used as an insurance policy. And \nthen for some reason it just continued on and on and on and on. Again, \nas I pointed out, we have reduced some of the subsidies over the \nintervening years, but for some reason this student tax continued \non. There is absolutely no reason for it today, and, as the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts pointed out and as this chart clearly shows, even \nwith my amendment, over the next 5 years they are going to get $4.6 \nbillion that they really don't even need. But they have it. Do they \nneed twice that much? Do they need $8 billion? I don't think so.\n\n  So let's give our students a little bit of a tax break. Everybody is \nalways talking about giving people tax cuts around here. Here is one \nyou can vote for. Here is one that has an immediate impact right now. \nThat means these students going to college this fall will have an extra \namount of money to buy that textbook or to pay their tuition costs. For \nsome people, $171 may not sound like a lot of money. But for a low-\nincome student, families working hard trying to get their kids into \ncollege and through college, that is a lot of money. And it is money \nthat is not needed by these guaranty agencies. It is just not needed. \nThey get plenty of money, $4.5 billion. So I hope the Senate will \nsupport this very modest amendment. It is not cutting the whole thing. \nIt is just cutting it by 25 percent. I think our students deserve that \ntax cut.\n  I am a product of student loans when I went to college. Neither one \nof my parents went to college. They didn't have any money, so I had to \nborrow money to go to college. But in those days we had the National \nDefense Education Act which came in under the Eisenhower \nadministration. We borrowed the money. We never had to pay any interest \non it all the time we were in school, never had to pay any interest on \nit when we were in the military. Finally, when I got through law \nschool, I had to start paying back the loans and the interest started \naccruing on it.\n  I always thought what was good for our generation ought to be good \nfor the present generation. I don't know why it shouldn't be that way. \nThis is one step we can take to tell at least the neediest students \ntoday that they deserve to have a tax break and they deserve to have a \nlittle bit more money to buy their textbooks. So I urge the adoption of \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \namendment put forward by my colleague, Senator Harkin. I think what is \nreally intended here is an effort to try to undermine the effectiveness \nof the FFEL Program. I know my good friend from Iowa is a fan of direct \nlending. I know the same is true of my colleague from Massachusetts. \nAnd any way that they can try to undermine the FFEL Program and \nincrease the capacity of the direct loans to somehow supplant it, is an \neffort which I can understand.\n  I have been involved in this a long time. I was involved in creating \nthe commission that ended up recommending direct lending. We have tried \nvery hard to make sure these programs operate on a basis of fairness \nand comparability. So far, that has worked well.\n  This bill provides nearly $1 billion each year in new benefits. Many \nof these benefits were paid for by offsets found within the guaranteed \nstudent loan program.\n  Pell grants--S. 1882 raises the maximum Pell grant to historically \nhigh levels and authorizes $85.6 billion in Pell grants over the next 5 \nyears.\n  Other student assistance--S. 1882 authorizes more than $15 billion \nover the next 5 years for work-study grants, TRIO Programs, SEOG, \nchildcare grants for low-income students and other important programs.\n  Loan forgiveness for child care providers--S. 1882 authorizes more \nthan $50 million over the next 5 years to provide loan forgiveness to \nlow-income individuals who pursue careers as child care providers.\n  Loan forgiveness for teachers--S. 1882 authorizes more than $615 \nmillion over the next 10 years to provide loan forgiveness to teachers \nwho pursue teaching careers in private or public secondary or \nelementary schools that serve low-income families.\n  Extended repayment options--S. 1882 permits, at a cost of $290 \nmillion over 5 years, borrowers in the FFEL program with debt levels \nequal to or greater than $30,000 to be offered extended and graduated \nrepayment terms similar to those available in direct lending.\n  Student loan interest rate--And finally, and without doubt the most \nimportant benefit we are offering to students, is the low interest \nrate. S. 1882 preserves two vital and healthy loan programs while \nproviding students with the lowest interest rates they have enjoyed in \nnearly 20 years. By some estimates, this interest rate will provide \nstudents with a new benefit (in reduced interest costs) of nearly $11 \nbillion.\n  These examples speak for themselves and they reflect the strong \ncommitment I share with my colleagues to encouraging greater \nparticipation in higher education. The debate in which we are now \nengaged does not reflect upon one's commitment to student benefits. S. \n1882 already provides nearly $1 billion in new student benefits each \nyear. The issue which we must now confront is whether we are truly \ncommitted to preserving the stability of two student loan programs. The \nHarkin amendment, I believe unintentionally, would destroy the hub of \nthe FFEL program by putting more than\n\n[[Page S7860]]\n\ntwenty-two guaranty agencies, including the Vermont Student Assistance \nCorporation, out of business--out of business.\n  I want to reiterate this point. In order to provide some students \nwith a maximum of a $42 per year benefit, this amendment undermines the \nguaranty agency financing model and threatens the continued viability \nof the FFEL program both now and in the future. The choice is quite \nclear--a vote for the amendment offered by Senator Harkin is a vote to \ndestabilize the FFEL program. A vote against the amendment offered by \nSenator Harkin is a vote to preserve the many benefits that the FFEL \nprogram so successfully offers to students and their families. I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I point out that the $172 that was mentioned is over 4 years. It \ndoesn't sound quite as much when you talk about 4 years as it does in 1 \nyear. That is a few six-packs of beer a year. It is significant, \nperhaps a single text book, but certainly not something that is going \nto make a huge difference to any student.\n  I point out, this Federal fund and the insurance premium were created \nto try to take care of student loan defaults, to take care of the times \nwhen student's default on their loans, or loans are discharged due to \ndeath or disability.\n  Mr. President, 43 percent of the total cost of the FFEL Program are \nstudent loan defaults. This insurance premium helps take care of those \ndefaults.\n  I would like to address for a moment the student and family benefits \nthat are provided in this bill. S. 1882 reflects a strong bipartisan--\nin fact, unanimous commitment of members of the Senate Labor \nCommittee--to craft a bill which strengthens and expands the access to \nhigher education.\n  We have built up a dual system of competition perhaps. But we have \ntwo student loan systems that are more in balance now, and this bill \nbalances those two systems again. This amendment would attempt to \nunbalance it, to again favor the direct lending program by taking a \nbenefit away from one program and giving it to the other, and along the \nway, perhaps putting many of the present guaranty agencies that provide \nassistance to our college students out of business.\n  So I urge Senators to take a look at what this amendment really does. \nThe minimal gain, $42 a year, which might possibly occur, is no balance \nto the risk of putting this whole program into a position where it \ncould fail, at a cost of billions to students and the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Iowa. This amendment, which purports to lower \nguarantee fees on student loans, would, in actuality, increase fees for \nborrowers in Pennsylvania and elsewhere.\n  Under current law, student loan guarantee agencies participating in \nthe Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) have the option of \ncharging borrowers a guarantee fee of up to 1% for subsidized Stafford \nloans, unsubsidized Stafford loans, and PLUS loans. Amendment No. 3117 \nwould eliminate the optional guarantee fee for subsidized Stafford \nloans, and it would reduce by 1% the guarantee fee on Direct subsidized \nloans administered by the Department of Education. The costs of this \nprovision would be offset by obligating guarantee agencies to charge \nthe full 1% guarantee fee on all unsubsidized Stafford loans and PLUS \nloans.\n  The Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency (PHEAA), which \nguarantees loans for borrowers within the Commonwealth, presently \nwaives the guarantee fee for both subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford \nloans, as well as the fee for PLUS loans. In addition, PHEAA also \nwaives all guarantee fees for borrowers in West Virginia and Delaware, \nthe two states for which it has been designated by the state's governor \nas the guarantee agency. Should Amendment No. 3117 become law, PHEAA \nwould be compelled to begin charging a 1% fee on unsubsidized Stafford \nloans and PLUS loans. Consequently, total guarantee fees charged to \nstudent borrowers in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Delaware would \nactually increase.\n  Consider that in FY1997, PHEAA guaranteed $651 million in \nunsubsidized Stafford loans for 172,000 students and $171 million in \nPLUS loans for 28,000 parents. None of those borrowers were charged a \nguarantee fee. However, if this amendment had been law, it would have \ncost those borrowers $8.22 million in total guarantee fees. Moreover, \n20% of FFELP borrowers nationwide receive fee waivers or fee reductions \nfrom their guarantor. Consequently, Amendment No. 3117 would increase \nfees for borrowers in states other than just those serviced by PHEAA. \nAs such, I must oppose this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to join \nme in doing so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, I rise in strong opposition to the \nHarkin amendment. I commend our chairman for the outstanding leadership \non this legislation, but I have concerns on the impact of this \nlegislation, what it would do to making student loans accessible to \nmillions of our students.\n  At the core of making higher education affordable and accessible are \ntwo programs we have heard much about: The Federal Family Education \nLoan Program, or FFEL Program, which, through public-private \npartnership, has successfully provided loans to millions of students \nsince 1965. The second program is the Direct Student Loan Program, a \nprogram initiated by President Clinton, and a program I think designed \nto make the Department of Education the largest student lender in the \ncountry. In fact, there are currently 36 active State and private \nnonprofit guaranty agencies, including the Student Loan Guarantee \nFoundation of Arkansas.\n  These guaranty foundations work closely with students, with families, \nwith schools, and lenders to process loans, prevent loans from going \ninto default, and pay claims on and collect on those loans that do \ndefault as a part of the traditional Guaranteed Student Loan Program, \nthe FFEL Program.\n  Over the past 33 years, FFELP student loan providers have reliably \ndelivered more than 92 million loans totaling $245 billion. Two-thirds \nof all student loans are provided by the private sector via the FFEL \nProgram.\n  FFELP is cost effective for the Government, and the competitive \nenvironment spurs FFELP innovation and high-quality service. Reducing \nstudent loan original fees--which this amendment does not do--reducing \nstudent loan origination fees which are paid by students to the \nDepartment of Education, I believe, is a laudable goal, something we \nneed to study and something we may do, but the amendment we are \ndebating, the Harkin amendment, does not reduce the 3 percent \norigination fee paid by students in the Guaranteed Student Loan \nProgram. Rather, it eliminates the 1 percent insurance program, also \ncalled the guaranty fee.\n  It is interesting, when you are against something, you call it a tax. \nAnd this fee has tonight been called a tax. Suddenly, we are voting for \na tax decrease, a tax cut. But this guaranty fee has, in fact, preceded \neven the nationalizing of this loan program. It goes all the way back \nto 1965. This was not enacted as a temporary measure because of \neconomic conditions. The original fee, in fact, was, but we are not \ndealing with the original fee, we are dealing with the guaranty fee, \nthe insurance premium fee. That is what the amendment would do this \nevening.\n  That serves as the primary source of revenue to guarantors, intended \nto help offset the risk of default on student loans. Without the \ninsurance premium coming in on the new guaranteed loans, guaranty \nagencies will have insufficient funds in their Federal reserve fund to \npay lender claims on defaulted loans. Many of them will for sure. In \nfact, losing the 1 percent insurance fee equates to approximately 40 \npercent of revenue for the Student Loan Guaranty Foundation in my home \nState of Arkansas.\n  I believe--I think I am correct in this--that of all the institutions \nof higher learning in Arkansas, there is only one currently using the \ndirect lending program. All the rest have opted to continue in the FFEL \nProgram, and we seriously jeopardize the guaranty foundation with the \nHarkin amendment; therefore, we jeopardize the accessibility of student \nloans to hundreds of thousands of students who are going to need those \nloans now and in the future.\n\n[[Page S7861]]\n\n  With less money in their reserve to process loans and pay lender \nclaims on defaulted loans, the Arkansas guaranty agency could be forced \nout of business in less than 2 years. So I say to the competition, \nwhich has been lauded as being such a good thing, such a meritorious \nthing, it would be eliminated as the bias is made toward direct student \nlending, and the FFEL Program which has served my State so well would \nbe jeopardized.\n  Madam President, the Harkin amendment, I believe sincerely, is a wolf \nin sheep's clothing. It would essentially kill the guaranteed loan \nprogram by driving guaranty agencies out of business. If schools really \nwanted to be in the Direct Loan Program, then over 80 percent of them \nwould not have chosen to remain in the guaranteed loan program, which I \nbelieve we threaten by this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the loan program, which provides \nprivate capital and servicing for nearly two-thirds of all Federal \nstudent loans, and do so by opposing the Harkin amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I wonder if the Senator will yield for a little colloquy \non that issue to try to get something straightened out.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I will be glad to yield. I will be delighted.\n  Mr. Harkin addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask my friend from Arkansas----\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I will be glad to yield for a question. I am not sure \nI have the authority to yield for a colloquy.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will enter into kind of a colloquy on the floor here. I \nthought I would ask a question----\n  Mr. FORD. Just ask unanimous consent to have a colloquy.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I would be delighted.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent to have a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I submit to my friend from Arkansas that one of the \ngreatest myths about the guaranteed loan program is that the agencies \nare the real guarantors of the loans. I listened to the Senator and I \nlistened to the Senator from Vermont also talk about putting the \nagencies in jeopardy by reducing the amount of money to pay for \ndefaulted loans--at least that is what I heard--that my amendment might \nput them in jeopardy.\n  I think, contrary to popular belief, the Federal Government is the \nguarantor, and this changed in 1992. So I think there is a holdover \nfrom the previous era. In 1992--and I will just read to the Senator \nfrom the law itself: ``Consequence of guaranty agency insolvency. In \nthe event that the Secretary has determined that a guaranty agency is \nunable to meet its insurance obligations under this part, the holder of \nloans insured by the guaranty agency may submit insurance claims \ndirectly to the Secretary, and the Secretary shall pay to the holder \nthe full insurance obligation of the guaranty agency.''\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. If I might respond, if I understand what you have \njust read from the law, that while that ensures the fact the Federal \nGovernment is the ultimate guarantor, that that only occurs when the \nguaranty foundation, the guaranty agency, has faced solvency, and that \nis my very concern.\n  Yes, while there may be an ultimate protection, before that ultimate \nprotection is realized, the agencies that have served our students so \nwell would, in fact, face insolvency. That is my concern for the State \nof Arkansas; that is my concern for the students of Arkansas.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I think the Senator makes a good point. As I pointed out, \neven with this modest cut of 25 percent, that leaves, over the next 5 \nyears, $4.58 billion for these guaranty agencies. I haven't seen any \nevidence that this would be at all insufficient in the future for these \nagencies.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. If I might just conclude, we can stand here and \ndebate and have a colloquy over the numbers you presented. I cannot and \nwould not question the numbers you presented my colleagues, so I will \nnot speak on the aggregate that you presented. But I will say that \nwhile you are dealing with the aggregate, you are not speaking to the \nspecific circumstances and situations of guaranty foundations across \nthe country. I only know in particular how it would impact the Arkansas \nGuaranty Foundation, which has served our State well, and I believe \nthat the numbers in Arkansas reflect that it, in fact, could face \ninsolvency in a matter of years should the Harkin amendment be adopted. \nAnd that is the basis of my very sincere and very strong opposition.\n  Mr. HARKIN. And I understand that. I want to make a couple points, I \nhope, clear, and that is, the Federal Government is the ultimate \nguarantor, not the guaranty agency.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I understand, though, that if the guaranty foundation \nis insolvent, if I heard you read the law correctly----\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. That is my very concern--then we would force students \ninto direct lending. We would force institutions to adopt that program \nwhether they want to or not.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, Madam President, I just want to point out, again, \nI do happen to have these figures available. For the State of Arkansas \nright now, the reserve fund is $7.9 million--$7.9 million that Arkansas \nhas in its reserve fund. Even under my amendment, the yearly revenue \nfor the next 5 years will be $3.8 million a year. So for the next 5 \nyears, that will be another almost $20 million coming into Arkansas, \nand Arkansas has, as I said, a $7.9 million reserve fund right now.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. If I might just respond to that, the numbers we have \nindicate--and these are as of July 3, 1998--the cash reserve is $6.8 \nbillion, which is considerably different from the numbers that you are \npresenting, and that, in fact, the information I have is that reserve \nwould be jeopardized to a far more significant degree than what you \nhave reflected.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator may be right. My figures are from the end of \nthe last fiscal year.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Then I think it is certainly precarious for the \nfoundation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator just said the reserve fund was $6.8 million \nas of the end of this last month; is that what the Senator said?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. That is what I said.\n  Mr. HARKIN. $6.8 million. Even under my amendment----\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. What was the number that you gave for----\n  Mr. HARKIN. $7.9 billion as of the end of the last fiscal year.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. That would be a drop of $1.1 million in less than a \nyear.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is right.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Without the Harkin amendment. With the Harkin \namendment, it will be a considerable decrease in addition to that. Once \nagain, I would say the projections are, within 2 years they would be \ninsolvent, and the worst case scenario would become a reality in the \nState of Arkansas.\n  Mr. HARKIN. In the State of Arkansas, the Harkin amendment would \ncontinue to give $3.8 million over the next 5 years. That is hardly \ngoing insolvent.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. They have lost $1.1 million without the Harkin \namendment in the reserve fund. So, Madam President, I would say, once \nagain, my concern is for the students of Arkansas, that they have a \ncompetitive environment for student loans. I believe that will not \ncontinue if the Harkin amendment is adopted and that, in fact, the end \nresult, intended or otherwise, will be to force institutions into \ndirect student lending, which I do not think is in the best interest of \nthe students of my State or this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I believe I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Arkansas, once again, without \ngoing further, I don't know why that went down $1.1 million. A lot of \ntimes these agencies dip into reserve funds to pay salaries and \nbenefits and things like that. I don't know why they dipped in the \nreserve funds.\n  I just say that even $6.8 million for the State of Arkansas, with \n$3.8 million per year, is more than enough for\n\n[[Page S7862]]\n\nthe reserve fund. And, secondly, I say that in the worst case scenario \nthat the Federal Government still is the guarantor. And, lastly, I just \npoint out that unless one is totally pessimistic about the economy over \nthe next 2 or 3 or 4 years, saying that everything is just going to go \ndown the tubes, that we are going to have plenty of money in this \nreserve fund, even with this amendment.\n  (Mr. HUTCHINSON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. Lastly, I just say to my friend from Arkansas, who now \nhas assumed the chair, that there was some mention made that this \namendment was a direct threat to the Guaranteed Loan Program and a way \nof tilting it toward the Direct Loan Program. And, again, I say that \nnothing could be further from the facts here, because my amendment \ntakes a cut of 25 percent in both the Guaranteed Loan Program and in \nthe Direct Loan Program. It puts them both at 3 percent. So it makes \nthe playing field absolutely level. It does not give one a benefit over \nthe other.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REED addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I believe the Senator from Iowa has introduced a very worthy \namendment that is consistent with the overall thrust of the legislation \nto provide more affordable access to college for hundreds of thousands \nof American students. I hope that his amendment will prevail.\n  It also, I believe, compliments many other portions of this \nlegislation which is particularly directed at providing more \nopportunities for Americans to go on to higher education.\n  One aspect that I think it compliments is the existing State Student \nIncentive Grant Program. This is a program that has been operating for \nyears to provide Federal resources to local communities, to States, \nwhich they match dollar for dollar, which provides grants and work-\nstudy programs for students.\n  As you recall, last year this provision was threatened with \nextinction because of no appropriations. But we in the Senate were able \nto rally support by an overwhelming vote and restored this program. I \nam pleased to say that the legislation that we are debating today, the \nunderlying bill, makes significant improvements in the State Student \nIncentive Grant Program. It strengthens it, provides more flexibility \nfor the States. And I hope we will provide further support, not only \nhere but in the other body, so that we can continue to fund this very \nworthy program.\n  Once again, this program, like the Senator's amendment, is designed \nto provide particularly low-income American students access to higher \neducation, to make higher education more affordable.\n  Also, having this opportunity to speak briefly for a moment, I would \nlike to point out another aspect of the underlying legislation which I \nthink is very important, and that is the strengthened provisions for \nteacher education.\n  I was very pleased to note that many provisions of legislation \nintroduced to strengthen teacher education have been incorporated in \nthe underlying legislation. In particular, I was very pleased to \nintroduce legislation under S. 1169, the Teacher Excellence in America \nChallenge Act, or the TEACH Act. This legislation was based upon a \nnational commission to report what matters most, teaching in America, \nwhich essentially pointed out that we have a long way to go to ensure \nthat every child in this country has a high-quality teacher in the \nclassroom. Yet, we can take steps to get us to that worthy objective.\n\n  One step we can do is to force partnerships between schools of higher \neducation and actually elementary and secondary schools and other \nparticipants, essentially incorporating a model of education much like \nmedical education. We would never think about going to a physician that \nhad no extensive clinical training, yet we send young teachers into the \nclassroom that have barely weeks of actual classroom experience.\n  So I hope building on this commission's report, building on the \nlanguage of this particular legislation, that we can improve \ndramatically the quality of education and teachers in this country.\n  Just as an aside, several weeks ago, Massachusetts conducted its \nfirst intensive testing of prospective teachers. They found, in a \nshocking way, that 59 percent of these teachers failed an examination \nwhich was designed to test a strong 10th grader, basically focusing on \nsimple grammar, English, writing, and mathematics. This is a shocking \nindication of how far we have to go to improve teaching in America. And \nthe underlying legislation has provisions which I have introduced \nseparately which have been incorporated which will do that.\n  By and large, this is an excellent piece of legislation. I, of \ncourse, commend Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy for their \nleadership, and Senator Coats and Senator Dodd, and all the members of \nthe committee. And, once again, I hope that we will quickly not only \nadopt the amendment of the Senator from Iowa, but also the underlying \nlegislation which is a strong bipartisan attempt to further increase \nand strengthen the access to college for American students. In doing \nso, I think we will go a long way in keeping faith with a very \nimportant part not only of our country, but making sure that the future \nof our country is strong.\n  With that, I yield back my time.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, the hour is getting late. I doubt too many \nMembers are listening to this debate. I will be brief because I know we \nwant to move on to get these amendments finished so we can begin \nvoting. I would like to just briefly respond regarding this amendment. \nAnd I will not repeat the benefits that flow to students under this \nlegislation. Senator Jeffords of Vermont outlined those benefits: \nalmost $10 billion in new student benefits paid through extensive loan \nprovider cuts and other means over a period of years.\n  I think it is important to recognize that students benefit greatly \nfrom this legislation. It is kind of ironic that we are spending this \namount of time debating a bill that came out of committee on a \nunanimous vote, 18-0. We felt we had a bipartisan package put together \nthat would sail through the Senate here, but we are obviously tied up a \nlittle bit on some of the provisions. Hopefully, we can resolve some of \nthem.\n  I think it is important to recognize that what those of us who oppose \nthe Harkin amendment are doing, as we have done on a number of other \namendments, is trying to preserve a viable, competitive system in terms \nof providing service and collection and the provision of loans to \nstudents. There has been a concerted effort over the past 6 or 7 years \nto eliminate the private sector loan program in favor of a full \nFederal-run program. There were efforts to take it to 100 percent. \nThose were thwarted after a lot of contentious debate under previous \nCongresses.\n  But I thought at least finally we had settled on the concept that \ncompetition is good, competition within the system is good, and we \nought to have two programs side by side--a direct loan program run by \nthe Federal Government, the Department of Education; and a private \nprogram that was operated in the private sector, involving guarantor \nagencies and banks and others that provided students benefits for \nyears. And it was, of course, backed by the Federal guarantee. But it \noperated pretty well. There were concerns that those guarantor agencies \nwere reaping too much benefit from that particular program.\n\n  So over the last several years there have been a variety of measures \nenacted which substantially reduce the fees that go to the guarantor \nagencies. This bill takes $500 million from the guaranty agencies to \npay for student benefits. Between 1993 and 1997, revenue to student \nloan guarantors was cut by $2 billion. That is $2.5 billion we have \ntaken out. Student loan guarantors get back another $1 billion in \nreserves over the next 5 years under the Balanced Budget Act that the \nCongress entered into last year. As a consequence of that, the concerns \nthat were raised by the Senator from Arkansas become very real.\n  Ten student loan guarantors have ceased operations due to increased\n\n[[Page S7863]]\n\nrisk, declining revenues. The Alabama Commission on Higher Education, \nDelaware Higher Education Loan Program, Maryland Higher Education Loan \nCorporation, Mississippi Guaranteed Student Loan Agency, Ohio Student \nLoan Commission, Puerto Rico Higher Education Assistance Corporation, \nthe State Education Assistance Authority of Virginia, the State Student \nAssistance Commission of Indiana, the Student Loan Funds of Idaho, and \nthe Virgin Islands Board of Education have all ceased operations.\n  I don't think it is possible to accurately predict just which future \nagencies will go out of business as we keep squeezing the private \nsector and keep expanding benefits and provisions through the public \nsector, but a list has been put out that guaranty agencies would fail \nin a number of States over the next several years if the Harkin \namendment is adopted and if the process of continuing to impose \nrestrictions and squeezing the revenues of the private sector so they \ncan't compete equally with the public sector continue to be enacted.\n  Now, the ultimate decisionmakers shouldn't be Members of Congress or \nthe Department of Education. The Department of Education, obviously, \nhas a bias in favor of expanding their scope in this program and \nbecoming the only provider. That is what their intent was originally. \nThat is what they have been working for. They have had the support of \nsome Members of Congress on that.\n  I think we ought to go back to some basic philosophic understandings \nof what it is in this country that has proven over time to provide the \nmost effective service and benefits at the most effective cost. And it \nhasn't been the Federal Government. You can't point to agencies of the \nFederal Government--whether it be Post Office, which used to be under \nthe Federal control, but now is semi-independent--you can't point to \nany agency and compare it to a private agency and say the Federal \nGovernment is a more efficient provider of services at a more effective \ncost.\n  I remember asking the First Lady when she presented the Clinton \nhealth care plan, I said, ``Mrs. Clinton, you have done a lot of work \non this particular plan, but there is, in my opinion, a faulty \nassumption underlying the entire proposal, and that is that the Federal \nGovernment can provide services more efficiency and cost effectively \nthan the private sector.'' I said, ``In my experience here in \nWashington, I haven't come across any Federal Government program that \nhas been able to do that. When matched head to head, they haven't been \nable to do that.'' The reason they haven't is because they don't have \nto compete. They don't have stockholders to whom they are accountable. \nThey don't have a bottom line they have to reach. They simply turn to \nCongress for additional funds to fund whatever service they are \nproviding. The very nature of bureaucracy and the very nature of \nmonopoly leads to the inevitable conclusion that the taxpayer loses in \nthe long run when the services aren't provided.\n  So here we are yet again with yet another amendment designed to put \nthe private sector at a less competitive advantage. As I said, the real \ndecisionmakers in this process ought to be the users of the product. \nAnd the users of the product are the schools.\n  Despite credible efforts by the Department of Education, in fact, \nsome fairly heavy-handed tactics in some cases, two-thirds of all \nstudents choose to use the private sector to provide their loans and \nonly one-third choose to use the Department of Education. The \nDepartment of Education, even within that one-third, which is less than \nwhat they had planned for, is having trouble even providing effective \nservices to that one-third.\n  Let me refer to a GAO account which gave failing marks to the Federal \nGovernment and a number of Federal credit programs. Their report is not \nnews to anyone who has followed the debacle that has occurred at the \nDepartment of Education in administering the Direct Loan Program. \nDuring its first 5 years, institutions have been unable to fully \nreconcile disbursements received in Federal funds. There have been cost \noverruns estimated at $40 million, despite ongoing problems in the \nDirect Loan Program and their attempts to protect it, either through \nthe imposition of additional fees, cuts, additional revenue squeezes on \nthe private sector, and additional protections for the Direct Loan \nProgram.\n\n  So I think putting aside the intricacies of this program and whether \nthere was an origination fee or an insurance fee, whether there is \nenough in the reserve fund for 5 years or 3 years or whatever, we ought \nto go back to the basic premise of, do we want to substantially expand \nthe role of a department of government which has not proven itself an \nefficient administrator of these services, which has not proven itself \nas an entity capable of providing services in an efficient manner?\n  But if we are not going to do that, do we at least want to have a \nviable, competitive process, whereby the users of the product can make \nthe choice? I think that is really what this is all about. We need to \nremember that last year's bipartisan balanced budget agreement called \nfor the preservation of two healthy loan programs and that if there \nwere cuts, those cuts should be equally divided between those two \nprograms. That has not happened under the Harkin amendment. The cost of \nthe 25-percent reduction that the Senator from Iowa is talking about \ndoesn't come out, it is not equally divided between the Direct Loan \nProgram and the FFEL Program, the entire cost savings comes out of the \nFFEL Program.\n  So it is a violation of what the agreement was last year, the \nbalanced budget agreement. It violates the principle of that agreement \nby taking the fee from the private sector program and using it to cover \nthe cost of loss of revenue in the public sector program that results \nfrom the change that occurs under the Harkin amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Harkin amendment, preserve \nthe benefits and the balance that was created by the committee, \nsupported by the committee in an 18-0 vote, and move forward with this \neducation program that I think is important for our students and \nimportant for education initiatives that are in it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I believe we are reaching conclusion on this amendment. \nIt is my intention to make a few comments and then I believe Senator \nHarkin will close in a few minutes.\n  In the interim, let me first make a very few comments. We are \ncomparing apples and oranges here and you can make the apples look bad \nif you want to because you can't compare the oranges. The ``oranges'' \nare the direct lending program. It is a great one to cover things up. \nWhat you do when you lend out the money is create an accounts \nreceivable on your ledger sheet. It doesn't show up anywhere regarding \nwho doesn't pay back; it just shows up who does pay back. So it is very \nhard to trace where the losses are. On the other hand, the private \nsector one is a balanced one, with the student paying a 1 percent \ninsurance fee which helps take care of default. The lenders absorb 2 \npercent of the cost of defaults, which helps, and the guaranty agencies \nabsorb 5 percent, and the Federal government absorbs the remainder, \nwhich balances out and provides the money to pay for the default. So \nyou can't really compare the two programs. You can make this one look \nbad because you don't know what the other program has done. There is no \nway of telling.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the remarks of \nSenator Harkin, the Harkin amendment be set aside, that Senator Kennedy \nbe recognized to offer his amendment, that there be 30 minutes equally \ndivided on the Kennedy amendment, and that no second-degree amendments \nbe in order. I further ask that upon the conclusion of debate on the \nKennedy amendment, votes occur first on the Kennedy amendment, and then \non the Bingaman amendment, and finally on the Harkin amendment, and \nthat there be no second-degree amendments to any of the amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 \nminutes, equally divided, of debate between the votes for an \nexplanation of the amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. On the unanimous-\nconsent agreement just propounded, did\n\n[[Page S7864]]\n\nthat include the yeas and nays on all of the amendments?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. No, it did not.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to ask for \nthe yeas and nays on the three amendments with one show of seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. So for the information of all Senators, Mr. President, \nwe expect three votes to occur at about 9:45 or 10 o'clock, first on \nthe Kennedy amendment, then the Bingaman amendment, and then on the \nHarkin amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will wrap up my comments on the \namendment I offered. Again, Mr. President, I listened to the Senator, \nmy good friend from Indiana, talk about schools choosing to stay out of \nthe Direct Loan Program. Well, I point out that in the first 2 years \nthere was a tremendous increase in schools joining the Direct Loan \nProgram. But then in 1995 Congress began to make all of these threats \nabout ending or killing the Direct Loan Program. So what has happened \nis that schools are apprehensive about whether or not they want to keep \nthe Direct Loan Program, and that put a dampening effect on the \ntremendous growth we had in the first couple of years.\n  Secondly, I can't help but be somewhat amused by all this talk about \nthe private sector--the private sector involved in these students \nloans. We want this private sector to keep going --this private sector. \nLet me point out, Mr. President, that the ``private sector'' involved \nin this Guaranteed Loan Program gets a subsidy from the taxpayers of \nthis country to the tune of $7.5 billion a year. That is right--this \nprivate sector enterprise gets a subsidy from the Federal Government \nevery year of $7.5 billion. Private sector? Hardly. Subsidized sector? \nYes.\n  So all of this talk about this private sector out there in the \nGuaranteed Loan Program is nonsense. Now, if you want to make it \nprivate sector, let's not give them any subsidies. Let's knock out the \n$600 million to lenders for the special allowance payment. Let's knock \noff the $3 billion to cover defaults. Let's knock off the $2.5 million \nfor interest subsidy for students. Knock off all that stuff--the $7.5 \nbillion a year in subsidies that we put out for the guaranty loan \nagencies. If you want to talk about competition, that is fine; I don't \nmind having competition. In fact, it might be pretty good. But let's \nkeep it balanced.\n  The point is that this amendment that I have offered for the students \ncuts their taxes by 25 percent on both the Guaranteed Loan Program and \non the Direct Loan Program. It cuts it by 25 percent on both. It keeps \nthem both even in that regard. So if you want to keep competition, I \nsay vote for my amendment. You get a tax cut for the students, which \nallows them to buy textbooks, and it keeps the Direct Loan Program and \nthe subsidized, private sector Guaranteed Loan Program in balance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 30 \nminutes, equally divided, on the Kennedy amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3119\n\n(Purpose: To provide for market-based determinations of lender returns)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3119.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as I understand it, we have a half hour \nevenly divided, and I yield myself 7 minutes.\n  Mr. President, this was a very good segue--listening to the comments \nof my friend and colleague from Iowa--to the amendment which I propose \nthis evening and which has the administration's support.\n  The amendment I am offering will enable the Department of Education, \nworking with the Secretary of the Treasury, to conduct a pilot program \non methods to rely on competition to set interest rates on student \nloans. The results of this pilot program will be reported back to \nCongress within 120 days after the end of the test, and Congress must \nact again before any further action to implement competition on a wider \nscale.\n  The bill currently calls on the Secretary to study the feasibility of \nusing competition. That is too little and too late. It is a further \ndelaying tactic. My amendment takes the reasonable step of authorizing \na pilot program to see how competition would work in practice.\n  The obvious way to use competition is through an auction. Under this \namendment, up to 10 percent of the loan volume can be auctioned in each \nof 2 years. Students will be protected with the same low interest rate \nin the bill, and access to loans will continue. Colleges will \nparticipate on a voluntary basis. No one will be forced to be part of a \npilot project. After the pilot is completed, an independent entity will \nevaluate the results and submit them to the Department of Education, \nthe Treasury, and Congress. For example, one type of auction could \ninvite lenders to offer loans to all eligible students at a college, or \na group of colleges; or a State could originate loans for students at \ncolleges in the State and auction the loans afterward, with excess \nsubsidies returned to the Federal Government.\n  The pilot project would be able to assess the practical problems, if \nany, in this procedure. In fact, there is already experience to build \non. Loans for students in the health professions were conducted by \nauctions. Before the initial auction, the interest rate was based on a \n91-day Treasury bill rate plus a premium of 3 percent. At the final \nauction, the premium was 1.5 percent--a significant cut in the interest \nrate that brought major savings for the students. According to the \nTreasury, lenders will make an average return of 16 percent on student \nloans under this bill, a higher rate of return than their historic \nrates of return on their other assets, even though these loans are \nguaranteed by the Federal Government and therefore have no risk to the \nbanks.\n\n  As the Congressional Budget Office analysis of March 30, 1998, \nconcludes, ``banks do not require the same returns on FFELs that they \nrequire overall, since federally guaranteed student loans are less \nrisky than the average bank asset.'' The excessive cost to the taxpayer \nof these artificially high interest rates is at least $1 billion over \nthe 5 years.\n  Mr. President, we all know what is going on here. A Washington Post \neditorial of March 18 is titled ``Stared Down by the Banks,'' and it \npulls no punches and it accuses Congress of being intimidated by the \nbanks. A USA Today editorial of March 23, 1998, is titled, ``Banks \nActing Like Bullies''--too much subsidies for the banks. Clearly, we \nshould let competition set the interest rate, not Congress.\n  As the Los Angeles Times said in its editorial on June 5, ``Congress \nshould tackle the 'larger problem: the lack of competition in the \nstudent loan system.''' This amendment that I am offering this evening \nis a worthwhile pilot program that can help do so.\n  Competition can work and will work to save Federal dollars and save \ndollars for college students as well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe various Federal programs that are involved in this kind of a \ncompetition.\n\n         Examples of How Auctions Are Used in Federal Programs\n\n       Treasury Securities.--Treasury auctions bills, notes, bonds \n     and inflation-indexed notes and bonds in a sealed-bid \n     auction. Bidders bid an interest rate and loan volume they \n     would like at that rate. But no bidder can win more than a \n     certain percentage of the total put up for bid. \n     Noncompetitive bidders can submit pre-auction bids for a \n     given volume for which they'll accept the auction-determined \n     interest rate. Treasury usually uses discriminatory-price \n     auctions by giving each bidder the rate they bid, but it has \n     also experimented with uniform auctions in which all winners \n     get the highest winning rate.\n       HUD Loan and Real Estate Asset Sales.--HUD and FHA auction \n     defaulted mortgages, and bidders may bid on any number of \n     mortgages. Because any combination or all of the auctioned \n     items can be bid on together, there is likely overlap in the \n     mortgage packages submitted by each bidder. To address this \n     problem and to be able to determine which combination of bids \n     would optimize value for the government, an Auction \n     Optimization Model was developed by AT Bell Laboratories. \n     The computer model is used to select the winning bids based \n     on total revenue for the government.\n       Health Education Assistance Loans (HEAL).--HHS conducts a \n     sealed-bid auction in which bidders bid an interest rate and \n     loan volume they would like at that rate. The low bidder and \n     all others within a certain tolerance of the low bid win the \n     right to make loans. In the case of single winners, schools \n     would not have a choice in that given year and might have to \n     deal with different lenders in each year. In the case of \n     multiple winners, each bidder would have to compete to make \n     as many loans as they can, though it would probably be less \n     than their originally bidded volume.\n       FCC Wireless Spectrum Auctions.--The FCC conducts sealed-\n     bid auctions for spectrums in which hundreds of markets are \n     determined simultaneously. After each round, bidders see the \n     prevailing price in each market and can place a bid in the \n     next round in markets they had not bid for previously. The \n     auction does not end until no more bidders want to make \n     higher bids in any market. Telephone service provision is \n     also auctioned in certain areas, including relatively \n     unprofitable parts of areas. Though results have been mixed, \n     most auctions have gone well.\n       Elk Hills Oil Field of the Naval Petroleum Reserve.--Elk \n     Hills was one of the federal government's largest \n     privatization efforts, with the sale completed in February of \n     1998.\n\n[[Page S7866]]\n\n     The process involved getting five independent evaluators to \n     determine the value of the property before publishing the \n     offer and collecting proposals from potential bidders. Due \n     diligence and close attention to transfer documents were \n     components of the many legal and technical steps. The bid \n     evaluation incorporated negotiations with the three \n     finalists on terms beyond the payment, such as \n     environmental indemnity issues, and ultimately a single \n     winner was selected.\n       WIC Infant Formula Bidding Process.--WIC purchases of \n     infant formula comprise more than half of all formula sales \n     within the U.S., and in an effort to ensure competitive \n     pricing, in 1989 the federal government began requiring \n     states to establish competitive bidding processes. The firm \n     offering the lowest net price to the state or cluster of \n     states wins the exclusive right to sell infant formula to WIC \n     participants, and that firm is then billed by the state WIC \n     agencies for rebates on formula purchased with WIC vouchers. \n     Under this system GAO reports that after accounting for \n     rebates in 1996, WIC agencies paid 85 percent less than the \n     wholesale price for formula, on average, allowing WIC to be \n     extended to an additional 1.7 million persons each month.\n       EPA Pollution Rights.--EPA's acid rain program holds an \n     annual auction of a Special Allowance Reserve of \n     approximately 2.8 percent of total allowances, conducted by \n     the Chicago Board of Trade. In addition to providing an \n     additional means of obtain allowances (each equal to one ton \n     of annual SO2 emissions), the auction also \n     importantly establishes a market price signal. Allowances are \n     sold from the Reserve before private holdings are sold. \n     Anyone--including public interest and environmental groups--\n     can participate in the bidding on and trading of allowances. \n     Spot (for that year) and advance (not usable for seven years) \n     allowances for SO2 emissions are available through \n     the auction, and allowances may be bought, sold, banked, or \n     retired. This auction appears to use discriminatory pricing \n     rather than uniform pricing.\n       Resolution Trust Corporation.--RTC auctions collateralized \n     and uncollateralized assets. For example, in a recent \n     competitive (sealed) bidding process, approximately 1100 \n     assets were divided into 30 pools based on asset type and \n     region. A financial advisor and due diligence contractor \n     scrubbed the relevant files and collected data to establish \n     values and reserve prices for each asset. This information, \n     recorded in CD-ROM format, was made available to the public, \n     which had four weeks to review it. Bids on the 30 asset pools \n     were received at a centralized New York clearinghouse over a \n     two-day span. Based on the best and final bids, the $450 \n     million sale yielded 87 cents on the dollar rather than the \n     75 cents that the portfolio had originally been valued at.\n       Oil and Gas Sales on the Outer Continental Shelf.--After \n     determining to lease the tracts, they are advertised in the \n     Federal Register in an open bidding process. Potential \n     investors send their checks; after the highest bidder is \n     notified of their acceptance, the other checks are returned \n     to the unsuccessful bidders. At this point, the government \n     conducts its own assessment of the value of the oil and gas \n     reserves, based on geological and mineral information \n     provided by the successful bidder, to make sure the bidded \n     amount meets or exceeds the government estimated value.\n       Conservation Reserve Program (CRP).--The USDA solicits bids \n     from producers for enrollment of acres into the CRP. Bids are \n     accepted based on a formula that accounts for the \n     environmental for each dollar from enrollment (i.e., if a bid \n     is accepted, the government pays farmers rental payments for \n     10 years to idle their land and put a conserving cover crop \n     on it).\n       Timber Sales.--The Forest Service auctions off the rights \n     to timber companies to cut designated areas in National \n     Forests. After an offer of sale describing the timber and the \n     sale terms is publicized, a sealed-bid process takes place. \n     Non-price related terms of the sale, including environmental \n     concerns, are all set by the government, so the highest \n     bidder wins the auction.\n       Export Enhancement Program (EEP).--The USDA establishes \n     prices and bonus levels based on their estimates of the going \n     market rates, and then accepts bids from exporters. However, \n     rather than bidding against each other in a true-market \n     scenario, exporters are really only bidding against the \n     government-set price and bonus level, and they have the \n     option of coming back with successive new bids until they hit \n     the USDA-determined price levels.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We obviously have the Treasury securities that are \ninvolved in these kinds of competitions. The HUD loans; the FHA auction \non mortgages is a competitive bid; the HEAL loans, the Health Education \nAssistance Loans; the FCC wireless spectrum auctions. We had a long \ndebate on what was going to be the best way to protect the taxpayer. \nAnd the decision by the Congress was to have the spectrum auctions. Elk \nHills Oil Field of the Naval Petroleum Reserve was auctioned. WIC, \ninfant formula, there was a bidding process and auctions; EPA pollution \nrights are auctioned off. The Resolution Trust Corporation relied on \nauctions, and the auctions were, in their view, based on their best and \nfinal bids. The last auction that went off was typical. The $450 \nmillion sale yielded 87 cents on the dollar rather than the 75 cents \nthat the portfolio had originally been valued at, and was returned to \nthe Treasury. Oil and gas sales on the Outer Continental Shelf were \nauctioned off. Conservation Reserve Program auctioned off; timber sales \nauctioned off; Export Enhancement Program auctioned off.\n  These are existing Federal programs that use the auction system to \nprovide the best kind of protection to the taxpayers, and in this case \nto the students.\n  But this particular amendment says, with the urging of the \nAdministration, let's have a pilot program independently evaluated, the \nresult of which is submitted to the Congress, the Administration, and \nmade public. Then the Congress can make a judgment on this matter.\n  I hope our friends on the other side of the aisle who talk about \nmarket forces and are constantly lecturing Members will support this \nvery modest recommendation. This amendment is built on market forces \nand built on competition. It follows the kinds of recommendations which \nthe U.S. Government has accepted in terms of auctions.\n  All we are doing is saying let's have a pilot project and test how \nthis program would work in terms of protecting student loans. We have \nhad debates here tonight on the level of interest rates. We have had \ndebates in our committee on the level of interest rates. Let us try in \nterms of protecting students to give them the best deal that they can \npossibly have, and use these resources to make a major difference in \nreducing the cost of higher education in this country.\n  I reserve the remainder of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment being \noffered by my colleague Senator Kennedy. While I share his interest in \nexploring mechanisms for improving the delivery of student loans, as \nchairman of the Labor Committee, I strongly oppose his effort to \nprovide the Department of Education--whose desire to disadvantage the \nFFEL program has been aptly demonstrated--with unbridled authority to \nconduct an experiment on the FFEL program.\n  The impetus for this concept arose out of the lengthy deliberations \nwe have had over the past eighteen months about setting the appropriate \ninterest rate for students and lenders. In 1993, when the Student Loan \nReform Act was being drafted, its authors--including Senator Kennedy--\nanticipated that the Federal government would shift entirely from the \nFFEL program to the Federal Direct Loan program. A transition provision \nwas included in the law which changed the way that student loan \ninterest rates were to be calculated effective July 1, 1998. This \nchange was primarily intended to reflect the budget scoring needs of \nthe Direct Lending program. The consequences for student borrowers in \nthe FFEL program, however, would have been dramatic.\n  There is general agreement that, if the interest rate that was set \nfor July 1, 1998 and which was delayed until October 1, 1998 is allowed \nto go into effect, it will become unattractive for lenders to \nparticipate in the FFEL program.\n  S. 1882, as reported from the committee, confronts the challenge of \ntrying to provide students with the lowest viable interest rate on \ntheir student loans while ensuring sufficient lender participation to \npreserve open and full access to student loans. After nearly a year of \nconsultation with students, lenders, representatives of the higher \neducation community, the administration and financial services experts, \nthe committee put forward a compromise interest rate package.\n  This package sharply reduced lender yield by 30 basis points while \nallowing students and their families to enjoy the lowest interest rates \nin nearly twenty years. The process of developing this package was long \nand difficult and the stakes were very high. While by no means perfect, \nthe bipartisan compromise meets the twin challenges of low rates for \nstudents and continued stability in the FFEL program.\n\n[[Page S7867]]\n\n  As I wrestled with my desire to balance the twin objectives of \nreducing the interest rate paid by students and preserving access to \nloans under the FFEL program, I encountered several budget analysts who \nwere interested in using market-based mechanisms to establish student \nloan interest rates.\n  It became clear to me, however, that market-based mechanisms, while \nattractive a first blush, quickly reveal themselves to be far more \ncomplicated to design and implement than is ever fully appreciated. \nThese analysts, who often focus only upon economic considerations, \noften fail to recognize that student loan programs are designed \nprimarily to offer a social benefit--that is, to offer loans, at \nreasonable rates, to students without respect to credit history, \neducational program, loan size, geographic location, or potential as a \nconsumer of future credit products. Market-based mechanisms, if they \nare to be implemented, must be carefully designed to ensure that all \nstudents continue to have equal access to student loans without regard \nto any particular characteristics of the borrower or their program of \neducation.\n  Further, any changes to the delivery system for the FFEL program, \nmust strive to preserve the high level of service that students and \ninstitutions of higher education currently enjoy. Under an auction \nmodel, schools and borrowers may be forced to deal with a different \nlender and servicer each year. Regional lenders in small states may \nlose the ability to participate in the program. Students may lose the \nability to select the lender of their choice. And equally important, \nparticularly in light of the collapse last year of the Department's \nloan consolidation program, students may find themselves forced to make \npayments to myriad lenders each of whom has different practices and \nprocedures. An auction, improperly designed, could add new and \nunintended layers of complexity to the program.\n  As a result of these concerns, as well as concerns about the ability \nof the Department of Education to administer an auction model, the \nAmerican Association of Medical Colleges and others have publicly \nstated their deep reservations about moving toward a market-based \nmodel. These issues may be resolvable but I cannot support providing \nthe Department with the authority to experiment on the FFEL program \nuntil they have been studied and addressed to my satisfaction and the \nsatisfaction of my colleagues on the Senate Labor Committee.\n  In an effort to answer some of these questions, our bill directs the \nSecretary of the Treasury to conduct a study of the feasibility of \nemploying market-based mechanisms. After consultation with students, \nlenders, and institutions of higher education, the Secretary of \nTreasury is required to analyze the potential impact of these \nmechanisms on the delivery of student aid, the implications for \nstudents and institutions of higher education with regard to access to \nstudent loan capital, and provide a plan for structuring and \nimplementing a mechanism is a manner that ensures the cost effective \navailability of student loans for students and their families. This \nreport shall be provided no later than September 30, 1999.\n  It is my strong belief that any pilots, if appropriate, should only \nbe developed after careful study and full Congressional participation. \nIn this spirit, S. 1882 contains a provision directing the Secretary of \nTreasury to conduct a thorough study and report to Congress on the \nfeasibility of designating and implementing market-based mechanisms for \nsetting student loan interest rates. I look forward to receiving this \nreport and working with the Congressional Budget Office, my colleagues \nin the Senate, and all of the participants in the FFEL and Direct \nLending programs to fully assess whether or not market-based mechanisms \ncan contribute to improvements in the availability, cost, and \nefficiency of the student loan programs.\n  In closing, I want to make one very important additional point. From \nall of this talk, one might think that there is a crisis within the \nFFEL program which we are trying to fix. The FFEL program continues to \nbe the program of choice of the vast majority of colleges and \nuniversities. As a result, the higher education community has deep \nmisgivings about the Kennedy amendment because it is concerned that \nefforts by the Department to conduct experiments upon the FFEL program \nwill disrupt the benefits and services that students and institutions \ncurrently enjoy. For all of these reasons, I urge my colleagues to \noppose this amendment.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield the Senator from Indiana such time as he may \nrequire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I will be brief. I just want to make a \ncouple points.\n  Point No. 1, the legislation that is before us, the base legislation, \nalready contains a carefully designed analysis and feasibility study of \nmarket-based mechanisms for student loans. The Kennedy amendment goes \nmuch further than that. We have a study in place. We will get the \ninformation needed to make a determination as to whether or not we want \nto move to an auction market-based program.\n  Secondly, the last thing the Department of Education needs right now \nis another big responsibility. It can't handle the responsibilities it \ncurrently has. It has not been able to successfully manage the Direct \nLoan Program and the FFEL Program. Why would we want to consider giving \nit something else to manage?\n  Let me just cite a few things from the inspector general relative to \nthe Department's administering of the Direct Loan Program. The IG has \nconcluded that audits at 16 direct loan schools found 8 major \nweaknesses in 16 of those programs. They also stated that in their \naudit, the weaknesses they found were representative of the majority of \ndirect loan schools. They said:\n\n       They are very likely to exist at these other direct loan \n     schools. The Department reviewed disbursement amounts \n     recorded at one school and found a total of nearly $300,000 \n     hadn't been entered into the direct loan system.\n\n  The IG's report said that 3 of the 16 schools maintained excess cash \nas a result of improper cash management practices.\n  Let me quote again from the IG's analysis of the department's \nineptness in running the programs that it has now. And I quote:\n\n       The Department does not currently have a process in place \n     to match specific drawdowns with specific disbursement \n     transactions.\n\n  The IG goes on to say:\n\n       53 percent of student status reporting was inaccurate. On \n     average 71 percent of student records in the national student \n     loan data system were inaccurate; 58 percent of transactions \n     were not reported by schools through the department in a \n     timely manner.\n\n  The IG says that today, if data is not reported timely, due diligence \nand timeliness of reconciliation of loan data may be adversely \nimpacted.\n  We probably all remember, or should remember, that in the 1995-1996 \nacademic year, 1 million applications were backlogged at the Department \nof Education which caused families and students all over the country to \nbe put in a position where they didn't know whether they were going to \nget a loan or not. Two years later, the Department sent out 2.7 million \nforms to fill out and had the wrong shading on it, and therefore the \nforms were not processed right, and they ended up with hundreds of \nthousands of backlog as a result of that.\n  This goes on and on and on, the inability of the Department to handle \nthe one-third of direct loans that it now has. So why do we want to \nthrow in another major initiative at the Department of Education. Let \nthem at least get the initiatives that they currently have jurisdiction \nfor under some control. So I would urge my colleagues to join with the \nchairman of the committee in defeating the Kennedy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. What my friend, the Senator from Indiana, did not point \nout is that the student loan defaults\n\n[[Page S7868]]\n\nwere 22 percent under the Republican administration, the previous \nadministration, now down to 10 percent, saving hundreds of millions of \ndollars a year. This debate isn't over the particular administration, \nbecause what we are talking about is a very sound idea. Let me give you \nwhat Mr. Petri, a Republican in the House of Representatives, said:\n\n       The amendment would end the recurring battle--he has one \n     that would put in place an auction program. Ours is just a \n     pilot program.\n       The amendment would end the recurring battle between \n     student groups and lenders over the industry on student \n     loans, which results in the price of the private sector \n     services being set by political negotiation without regard to \n     the actual cost of services.\n       This amendment has the potential of saving the American \n     taxpayers billions of dollars through competition for this \n     profitable business. Up to now, with the exceptions of in-\n     school interest and the overall interest cap, the banks have \n     always received the same interest the students paid on \n     interest loans.\n\n  Here is Mr. McKeon, Republican of California. This is what he says:\n\n       The gentleman is correct that up to now we have tried to \n     figure out how much to pay the lenders for providing student \n     loans in a political negotiation, and we in Congress really \n     have no way of knowing what the right price is.\n\n  These are two Republicans who believe in the market system:\n\n       It would be much better if we had a market process to \n     determine rates.\n\n  That is exactly what this amendment provides, a test, a pilot. You \ncan't implement it until we vote again, but a test and a pilot make \nsense for the very reasons two of the most knowledgeable leaders in the \nRepublican Party in the House of Representatives have stated:\n\n       I am interested in working in that direction.\n\n  That is in the recent debate and discussion.\n  Now, Mr. President, I indicated just a few moments ago all the \ndifferent agencies of Government that use this process, the most \nsignificant, obviously, the Treasury, the FHA, dealing with a great \ndeal more amount of funding than we are considering.\n  Finally, Mr. President, just look at this chart that I have in the \nChamber. This represents, according to the FDIC--and my good friend \nfrom Iowa was referring to various figures. Under the proposal that we \nhave tonight, the proposal; that is, the bill, will guarantee the \nreturn on equity for all commercial banks at 16 percent. This chart \nhere shows what the banks have made from 1958 going up to 1996, and \nrecently, in 1994 through 1996, it has been in excess of 14 percent.\n  All we are saying, for those Members of the Senate who are concerned \nabout the cost of higher education, is we have an opportunity to do \nsomething and do it the old fashioned way--competition; competition, \ntried, tested, utilized by other agencies of our Government and which \neffectively works. At least a pilot project; let's give it a try.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If I could ask the Senator to yield just briefly.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would be glad to yield--1\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator \nfrom Iowa and 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I just want to ask the Senator again on this chart--this \nis outrageous--there is the return on equity for commercial banks. For \na number of years it averaged about 11, 12 percent. Now it is up over \n14 percent. That is a return on equity for banks. Is the Senator saying \nthat this bill that we are passing will guarantee them a 16-percent \nreturn on guaranteed student loans?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is the estimate by the FDIC. And was used by the \ncommittee.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Not only do they get the 16-percent guarantee, they get a \n$7.5 billion subsidy from the taxpayers of this country. So I think the \nSenator is absolutely right. If they want to be private sector, let's \nput it out for bid. Some years ago, as the Senator remembers, we put \nthe WIC Program out, the Women's Infants and Children's feeding program \nout for competitive bidding, good old free enterprise competitive \nbidding, and we have saved billions of dollars for the taxpayers of \nthis country and improved the program. I think the Senator is right on \ntarget on this. If there is so much money floating around here, let's \nput it out for bid. Let's put it out for good old free enterprise, \ncompetitive bidding.\n  Mr. COATS. Will the Senator yield at that point?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have 1\\1/2\\ minutes left, I believe. Is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a total of 3 minutes left.\n  Mr. COATS. Could I ask a question, just ask the time? How much time \nis left on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 4 minutes 6 \nseconds; the Senator from Massachusetts has 2 minutes 53 seconds.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will yield me 1 \nminute on our side?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes, you may have it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. We may have the makings of a real deal here. From what I \nhear it is that the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator from \nIowa are willing to put the whole program out for bid. And if we would \ntake the whole program, including what is run by the public sector, \nmaybe we could cut a deal and just turn the whole thing over to the \nprivate sector. Is that what the Senator is suggesting?\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The pilot program, yes. This is for a pilot program. We \nwill have to come back. But to test and put both aspects out, to have \nit fair.\n  Mr. COATS. The Senator is extolling the virtues of the market system?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That's fine.\n  Mr. COATS. Let's take the whole program.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am not prepared to take the whole program, Senator. I \nam talking about a pilot program.\n  Mr. COATS. I think I have the floor, Mr. President? Do I not have the \nfloor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana still has the floor.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I ask the Senator for an \nadditional minute.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield the Senator an additional minute.\n  Mr. COATS. I thought I heard the proposal that the virtues of the \nmarket system were so wonderful that the whole thing ought to be put \nout into the market system, and that is probably a good idea. So why--I \ndon't understand; you can't have it both ways. You cannot try to \nattract it into the public sector and not provide competition in the \nDepartment of Education and yet kick everything else into the free \nmarket.\n  So I am saying we may have the makings of a deal here. If the \nSenators think the whole thing ought to go in the market, why, we can \nprobably get that done pretty quickly and it might benefit everybody.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Just for 20 seconds, Mr. President. You have to start \nsomeplace. This is a pilot program. If the Senator--if we accept this \nthis evening, I guarantee we will work with the Senator from Indiana to \ntry to make any kinds of adjustments in any types of ways to get \nwhatever kind of pilot program that will accurately reflect the market \nforces on student loans. Whatever way the Senator wants to, we will \nwork with him closely and we will look forward to his vote this \nevening.\n  I yield the remaining time to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am reluctant to take the time. I am \nenjoying this going back and forth. I just wanted to add my voice on \nthis. In fact, I think, what the Senator from Indiana may have just \nproposed, it is unfortunate that it is not in the form of an amendment \nhere. Because I think a pilot program, as one who has supported \nallowing institutions to make the choices on direct loans and \nguaranteed loans, that is really the best way to work. Let the \nmarketplace work this out. I would certainly be amenable to such an \namendment here.\n  I think what the Senator from Massachusetts is proposing and offering \nhere is going to be a great asset to all of us. What we are doing right \nnow is guessing. This is a guessing game, and it need not be a guessing \ngame. So we are being asked arbitrarily here to sort of accept some \nnumbers, disregarding what the larger economic picture is across the \ncountry.\n  And by establishing this study with a pilot program, we can come back \nin 5\n\n[[Page S7869]]\n\nyears. That is when we come back to this issue. In that window we will \nbe in a far better position to make a determination as to what should \nbe those rates and how the marketplace could work. Why shouldn't we \ntake advantage of that? It doesn't lock us into a particular answer one \nway or the other. It just gives us the opportunity to try to see if we \ncan't come up with a more reliable, predictable solution as to how \nthese rates ought to be determined.\n  Given the fact that we hear from the Congressional Budget Office \nthat, under current rates, the banks have earned rates of return on \nstudent loans between 16 and 35 percent--by anyone's estimation that is \nexcessive. That is their estimate. Analysts predict that we will lock \nin generous profits. CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, predicts \nthat the rates of return under the interest rates in the bill will be \nbetween 10 and 25 percent. The Treasury Department calculates an \naverage return under the bill of 16 percent. That is really excessive.\n  So by allowing a pilot program in the marketplace deciding these \nfactors, we are not allowing a situation that costs taxpayers a \ntremendous amount. We have done so much here to alleviate some of the \npressures for students in this bill, it would be a tragedy not to take \nadvantage of doing something for the taxpayers who underwrite this \nprogram. I urge we adopt this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Vermont has \n2 minutes 25 seconds.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will be very brief. What we are faced \nwith here is a bill that says these are ideas we ought to study, but we \nought to have them studied not by an agency that is dedicated to \nkilling the program, so we give it to the Department of Treasury. We \nsay here is an idea; study it, and then make recommendations, and then \nwe can maybe go to a pilot if it looks good. You don't give it to an \nagency who is dedicated to doing the program in unless you obviously \nwant to kill the program. And that is obviously the design here.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.

Mr. President, first, I ask all the Senators to stay in the \nChamber so we can get through the next two votes quickly. The managers \nhave done a good job getting us to the point where we have two more \namendments left. There is one other issue that is being worked on, and \nthen we would be ready to go to final passage. If the Senators will \nstay close, we can get through the two remaining amendment votes in 20 \nminutes and hopefully be ready to go to final passage after perhaps a \nbrief colloquy right before final passage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the next votes in the series be limited \nto 10 minutes in length.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield? Do we have any information on \nhow we are doing on our Patients' Bill of Rights?\n  Mr. LOTT. I don't believe that has come up today. We have worked on \nhigher education. There is a vision on the horizon of how this could be \ndone. I am sure we will find a way to do that in the next week.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. You will let us know--next week?\n  Mr. LOTT. Like to; unless there is obstruction or resistance. \n(Laughter.)\n  I am sure when the time comes, the Senator may have some second \nthoughts.\n  But at any rate, let's do higher education and then we will talk \nabout that.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3116\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the Bingaman amendment No. \n3116, with 2 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment is intended to improve \nthe academic preparation of our teachers. This is an area of great \nconcern all around the country. The amendment says to States: You \nshould require an academic major for the people you are training to \nteach in high schools--that in addition to the education course they \ntake, they should have an academic major. Mr. President, 32 States \nalready have in place this requirement.\n  What we are saying is that over the next 3 years each State should be \nable to adopt a plan to get to this same point. It will substantially \nimprove the preparation of teachers at the high school level. It has \nbeen shown to do that in the States that have adopted it. I believe \nthis would be a very good policy for us to adopt as part of this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to take this opportunity. It will be 6 years, \nagain, before we pass a reauthorization of the Higher Ed Act and we \nneed to get on with the business of improving teaching in this country. \nThis amendment will help to do that.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I must oppose the amendment offered by my colleague \nfrom New Mexico. He has done a wonderful job in assisting us in taking \na serious look at the problems we have with respect to teachers and \nwhether or not they have a major in the subject which they will be \nteaching.\n  The problem with this amendment is that it mandates to the States \nthat they must do something. The bill itself provides incentives for \nthem to make sure that the people wanting to be teachers have studied \nthe things which they will teach. We do it by enticement and through \nassistance with loan programs--with programs--whereas this amendment \nwould order it done.\n  It is a mandate, and I think it is inappropriate and that it would be \ncounterproductive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The question now is on agreeing to the Harkin \namendment.\n  There are 2 minutes equally divided.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, my amendment cuts the tax on subsidized \nstudent loans by 25 percent--from 4 percent to 3 percent. So it puts \nmore actual money into the pockets of students so they can buy \ntextbooks. It also continues to pay guaranty agencies over the next 5 \nyears.\n  If you hear an argument that somehow this is going to put our \nguaranty agencies at risk and jeopardize the banks, I point out that \neven under my amendment by cutting this tax by 25 percent on students, \nthe guaranty agencies will get almost $4.6 billion over the next 5 \nyears, more than enough to handle any contingency.\n  So this basically is a tax cut for students. It is supported by a \nlong list of colleges and student organizations. I think it is the \nleast we can do for our students--to give them a tax break, also.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \nHarkin amendment. It sounds nice but it really doesn't do what was \nanticipated. It saves maybe $42 a year for the students; that is, if \nthe program doesn't go belly up.\n  It undoes a very careful balance between the share of the risk that \nthe student takes, that the guaranty agencies take, and that the \nFederal Government takes. It unbalances it. It would put about 22 \nguaranty agencies out of business.\n  The present system, which is the FFEL system, is working very well. \nThe direct lending is helped with competition. The last thing we want \nto do is put out the system which takes care of 80 percent of the \ncolleges and 66 percent of all loans.\n  It is a dangerous amendment. And I strongly oppose it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nIowa.

We needed to get it done so that \nthey would have time to go to conference and get it completed without \nany doubt before this session ends. Students all across America depend \non it. As a former employee in a placement and financial aid office at \na university, I know how important these loan and grant programs and \nwork study programs are. I thank Senator Jeffords, the chairman, and \nSenator Kennedy for staying with it today to get this bill completed.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. President, I am extremely pleased that the Senate has completed \naction on S. 1882. It is a good day for the Senate and a good day for \nAmerica's students and their families.\n  The prompt action on this measure today would not have been possible \nwithout the concerted effort of Members of the Senate--particularly \nthose serving on the Labor and Human Resources Committee--and their \nstaffs over the past 18 months.\n  Each and every member of the Committee made a positive contribution \nto the development and refinement of this measure. I very much value \nthe time, effort, and commitment they have brought to this task.\n  I would also like to extend my sincerest thanks to the many staff \npeople who sacrificed their evenings and weekends to further this \ncause.\n  I would like particularly to recognize the efforts of Townsend Lange \nwith Senator Coats, Marianna Pierce, Jane Oates, and Jennifer Kron with \nSenator Kennedy, and Suzanne Day and Megan Murray with Senator Dodd. \nThese individuals--along with my own staff members Scott Giles, Susan \nHattan, Cory Heyman, Pamela Moran, and Jenny Smulson--went ``above and \nbeyond'' in terms of their diligent work on each and every aspect of \nthis measure.\n\n  I would like also to recognize and thank the staff of other members \nof the committee--all of whom have shown great dedication to this \ncause:\n\n           Jackie Cooney with Senator Gregg;\n           Lori Meyer with Senator Frist;\n           John Connelly with Senator DeWine;\n           Chad Calvert with Senator Enzi;\n           Jenny Saunders with Senator Hutchinson;\n           Julian Haynes with Senator Collins;\n           Angie Stewart with Senator Warner;\n           Robin Bowe and Holly Hacker with Senator McConnell;\n           Bev Schroeder with Senator Harkin;\n           Deborah Connelly with Senator Mikulski;\n           Alexander Russo and Rena Subonik with Senator Bingaman;\n           Roger Wolfson and Robin Burkhe with Senator Wellstone;\n           Mike Egan with Seantor Murray;\n           Elyse Wasch with Senator Reed.\n\n  I also want to acknowledge the extraordinary assistance offered by \nDebb Kalcevik, Robin Seiler, Josh O'Harra, and Justin Latus with the \nCongressional Budget Office, Mark Sigurski with Senate Legislative \nCounsel, and Margot Schenet, Jim Steadman, and Barbara Miles, with the \nCongressional Research Service.\n  This process has been a collaborative and bipartisan one every step \nof the way. It has produced a measure of which we can all be proud.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to take a moment of the Senate's \ntime to, first, congratulate Senator Jeffords and his staff and thank \nmy staff and a number of our colleagues. This is an enormously \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  I didn't really have a chance in the final moments to indicate the \nimportance and significance of this legislation, but to the parents of \nthis country who may be following this discussion this evening, as a \nresult of this legislation, the students who will be attending colleges \nafter its implementation, which will be later in this year, will be \nsaving anywhere from $650 to $3,200 over the course of a loan. The bill \nalso provides for loan forgiveness for teachers, some $8,000 for highly \nqualified teachers who will teach in low-income communities.\n  It has very, very important quality teaching training programs. This \nwas a high priority of the chairman. A great deal of time was taken on \nit. We have scarce resources, but the resources that were available \nwere really targeted to strengthening the teaching and the training of \nteachers. As the debate indicated, I believe there are strong \nevaluation programs in the bill, and they are very, very significant.\n  This bill increases the Pell grant to some $5,000. Then it continues \nalong with some important initiatives for students with disabilities, \ncampus-based child care, distance education, and a range of other kinds \nof initiatives, building on a very solid record.\n  The fact that we were able to get this legislation through in one day \nis a clear indication of the very, very strong bipartisan support, and \nI think the vote is a real tribute to the chairman and his leadership \nand to the other members of the Human Resources Committee.\n  I thank my staff: Marianna Pierce who has been working on this \nlegislation for many, many months, over a year; Jennifer Kron; Jane \nOates; former fellows Gloria Corral, Maria McGarrity, Eileen O'Leary \nand Danielle Ripich.\n  I also thank Deborah Kalcevik from CBO and Margot Schenet, Jim \nStedman and Barbara Miles at CRS; Mark Sigurski from the Office of \nLegislative Counsel, as well as on my staff, Michael Myers.\n  I in particular thank Senator Jeffords and his staff. I know he has \nmentioned them.\n  I thank Senator Coats who was very much involved in this legislation, \nand his staff, Townsend Lange.\n  From my friend and colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd: Suzanne\n\n[[Page S7873]]\n\nDay, Megan Murray, MaryEllen McGuire. They were all invaluable, as was \nthe Senator, in working very effectively during the course of the whole \nday on this legislation.\n  I thank Tom Harkin for his initiatives, Paul Wellstone, Jeff \nBingaman, all who were very much involved in the debate; Patty Murray, \nBarbara Mikulski and other members of the committee who were active and \ninvolved today; Jack Reed who follows in a very long and distinguished \ntradition on the Education Committee in the great traditions of our \ndear friend Claiborne Pell, who was chairman of the Education Committee \nand made monumental contributions to the education of young people \nacross this country.\n  To all of them, I am enormously grateful. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, very briefly, I see my colleague from Ohio \nhere, I want to add my voice to those who have spoken in praise of \nSenator Jeffords, the chairman of the committee, his staff, and the \nwonderful job they did in leading this piece of legislation and working \nwith Senator Kennedy as the leading Democrat on our side.\n  What we witnessed today is a wonderful example of how the legislative \nprocess ought to work. It is hard to imagine taking on a piece of \nlegislation that has a 5-year lifespan to it, a higher education bill \nthat affects so many millions of Americans. We did this in one day in \nlarge measure because the committee worked very closely together, Mr. \nPresident. A lot of work went into trying to resolve issues as a \ncommittee. There were a couple we couldn't, so we left those to our \ncolleagues, which is the way it should be here when you can't come to a \nfinal resolution.\n  That shows remarkable leadership on the part of the chairman and the \nranking Democrat, that they can take a bill as complicated and as \ncomprehensive as this, one as long in duration as this and bring it to \nthe floor and, in the space of virtually 12 hours, provide the kind of \nunanimous--it may have been unanimous, I don't know what the vote was \nhere--almost unanimous vote in support of the Higher Education Act for \nour Nation.\n  I want others to know that this is a good example of how we ought to \nwork here. I hope others will heed this example.\n  For Dan Coats, who is not on the floor this evening, our colleague \nfrom Indiana, this will be the last higher education bill he will be \ninvolved in, as he made the decision to leave the U.S. Senate at the \nend of his term. Certainly, there will be other bills between now and \nwhen the session ends. I am certain Senator Coats feels a sense of \npride, as he should, having played a major role in the last higher \neducation bill he will be involved in in the U.S. Senate. I commend him \nfor his efforts.\n  Let me join in commending staff: Mark Powden for his fine work, Susan \nHattan, Scott Giles, Jenny Smulson, Corey Heyman.\n  Senator Kennedy's staff: Marianna Pierce did a wonderful job on the \nDemocratic side working on this and keeping us well informed and trying \nto work out amendments during the committee process and on the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/09/senate-section/article/S7815-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I rise tonight to make some comments about \nAmerica's strategy in the long and vitally important struggle we are \nwaging against illegal drugs. When it comes to ensuring a bright future \nfor our children, there are very few things we can do that are more \nimportant than protecting them from drugs.\n  Earlier today, President Clinton and Speaker of the House Gingrich \nunveiled a major billion-dollar advertising campaign, a campaign \napproved by this Congress to reach our children with a hard-hitting \nmessage about the dangers of drugs. Mr. President, in my view, this is \na very worthwhile project; it is something that we should do; it is \nsomething that I believe will in fact make a difference. It comes not a \nmoment too soon.\n  Advertising is important in virtually every sector of our society. \nThose of us who run for public office use TV and radio; products are \nsold every day. I think the evidence is clear that we can reach our \nyoung people; we can reach everyone through very effective antidrug \nadvertising.\n  Mr. President, investing in antidrug education campaigns is \nimportant, but education is just one of the key components. It must be \npart of a balanced overall strategy if we are to truly fight drug \nabuse. To succeed, we have to rely on more than just creative minds on \nMadison Avenue. We need the help of teachers, doctors, parents, and \nmany more, to help reduce demand through education and through \ntreatment. We need the help of law enforcement officers, we need the \nhelp of prosecutors, judges, to arrest and then send drug pushers to \nprison. And we need drug enforcement agents, Coast Guard crews, and \neven members of our military to seize drugs at the source or in transit \nbefore they come into our country. It takes all these individuals, and \nso many more, to wage a comprehensive--to wage a balanced, effective \nwar on drugs. History proves the fight against drugs is only successful \nwhen it is balanced and when it is in fact comprehensive.\n  Mr. President, sadly--sadly--our overall drug strategy today is \nneither balanced nor comprehensive. Our drug strategy today is \nimbalanced because of a lack of commitment for the international and \nfor the interdiction components of the antidrug effort. Let me repeat, \nI believe that we are not making enough effort in the international \narea and in the interdiction components of the antidrug effort.\n  Now, what do I mean by the interdiction component? What do I mean by \nthe international component? Let me define ``international effort,'' \nwhat I mean by that, and what I mean by ``interdiction efforts.''\n  International efforts include any direct assistance, resources and \ntraining the United States provides to foreign countries specifically \nfor counternarcotics matters.\n\n[[Page S7874]]\n\n  By interdiction efforts, I mean to include the seizing of drugs, the \ndisruption of drug-trafficking routes outside our borders from where \nthe drugs are produced in source countries, through the so-called \ntransit zones, then up until they reach our border.\n  Basically, Mr. President, what we are talking about is everything \nfrom the production of the drugs all the way until they hit our border. \nIt is in this effort in the past few years we have not made the effort, \nnot made the sufficient effort.\n\n  Sadly, the current administration, despite its promises in this area, \nhas been either unwilling or unable to maintain the support needed for \na successful comprehensive and balanced international and interdiction \nstrategy.\n  It is, Mr. President, because of this imbalance that the current \nadministration has failed to uphold the tremendous successes of the \nReagan and Bush administrations in reducing illegal drug use, \nparticularly among young people. In fact, the evidence shows that drug \nuse has been on the rise. This must be of great concern to all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, I am going to be talking in the balance of this speech \nabout that lack of effort in the international area and that lack of \neffort in the interdiction area. I want to also say, though, that part \nof the problem has been that initially this administration did not \nfocus on the drug problem. It was not a high priority. The President, \nfor years, did not use the bully pulpit of the Presidency to talk about \nthis issue. And I think this contributed to the problem as well.\n  The fact is, over the course of the previous decade, international \nand interdiction programs beyond our borders were essential parts of a \nbalanced plan to reduce drug use, a plan that also included drug \neducation, drug treatment, and local law enforcement efforts. When we \nused all of these, Mr. President, we made some progress.\n  But beginning in 1993, the administration abandoned this balanced \napproach and shifted resources away from the international and \ninterdiction components of our antidrug efforts. Simply put, this \nadministration has deemphasized effective strategies beyond our borders \nthat are designed to keep drugs from entering our country and infecting \nour communities.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is time to reverse this current policy. \nThis evening, I call on my colleagues to join me in restoring--in \nrestoring--a balanced drug control strategy that will put us back on a \ncourse toward ridding our schools and our communities of illegal and \ndestructive drugs.\n  By doing this, we can in fact make a difference. By restoring our \nprior commitment to source and transit zone interdiction efforts, we \ncan once again reduce the trafficking of drugs.\n  Let me address this issue in more detail. As I said at the beginning \nof my remarks, effective international and effective interdiction \nprograms are a necessary and key component of any national drug control \nstrategy.\n  During the period from 1985 through 1992, the U.S. Government waged a \ncomprehensive and a balanced antidrug effort. The evidence clearly \nshows that with a balanced strategy we were making great progress. We \nsignificantly reduced drug use.\n  In 1987, the Federal drug control budget was divided as follows: 29 \npercent for demand reduction programs. These, of course, include \neducation, treatment, prevention. Thirty-eight percent of the budget in \nthat year--38 percent of the budget--went for domestic law enforcement, \nand 33 percent went for international and interdiction efforts.\n  The total national drug control budget at that time was $4.79 \nbillion. Now, what were the results of this very balanced--very \nbalanced--approach? We achieved some progress, with some success.\n  In 1988 to 1991, total drug use was down 13 percent, cocaine use \ndropped by 35 percent, marijuana use was reduced by 16 percent.\n\n  How did interdiction contribute to this decline? First, major efforts \nto limit the easy access to drugs by street dealers caused the number \nof potential drug users to fall off. Second, limiting success through \ninterdiction drove up the street price of drugs dramatically. Because \nof interdiction, drugs became more difficult to find and more expensive \nto buy.\n  During this period of time, our drug interdiction strategy was \nserious business. President Bush called illegal drugs the ``gravest \ndomestic threat facing our Nation today.'' In 1989, President Bush \ntasked the Defense Department to play an important role in the drug \nwar. Specifically, the Defense Department was tasked to engage in the \ndetection and monitoring of drugs in transit towards the United States. \nAs a Member of the House of Representatives at that time, I can recall \nvery well the investment we dedicated toward the international and \ntoward the interdiction components of the war on drugs. These \ninvestments did make a difference.\n  All this changed in 1993. The Clinton administration immediately \npursued policies that upset this careful balance in drug funding. \nAlthough we have seen a considerable increase in the overall national \ndrug control budget, the proportion of resources dedicated to \ninternational and to interdiction efforts has dramatically declined \nover the past 5 years.\n  In addition, interdiction no longer remains a priority within the \nDepartment of Defense. In fact, the Defense Department currently ranks \ncounternarcotics dead last in importance, dead last in its global \nmilitary force policy.\n  Let me spend a few minutes talking about this major shift in policy. \nLet me refer Members of the Senate to my second chart. Of the $13.3 \nmillion national drug control budget for the year 1995, 35 percent was \nallocated for drug demand reduction programs--35 percent--53 percent \nfor law enforcement, but only 12 percent for the international and the \ninterdiction components combined. So we went from one-third of the \ntotal budget to 12 percent, a dramatic change. Think of it--only 12 \npercent of the total drug control budget was dedicated to these \nefforts, down from 33 percent just a few years before. Although the \noverall drug budget increased threefold from 1987 to 1995, the piece of \nthe drug budget pie allocated for international and interdiction \nefforts has dramatically decreased. This is not only unfortunate, it is \nalso unacceptable.\n  There was then and continues to be no real effort made, no real \ncommitment made, no real resources given, for international and \ninterdiction efforts. We are spending some money, but it has been a \ndramatic decrease in the message of our total effort. I believe the \nresults are clear and the consequences have been devastating.\n  Counternarcotics funding for defense fell 57 percent between 1992 and \n1995. Coast Guard funding fell 32 percent during that same period. As a \nresult, a number of Defense Department and Coast Guard ship days \ndevoted to drug interdiction dropped from 4,448 in fiscal year 1993 to \n2,845 in 1995. Further, not surprisingly, Coast Guard seizures dropped \nfrom a little over 90,000 pounds in 1991 to a little over 28,000 pounds \nin 1996. In addition, the number of flight hours by airborne warning \nand control systems, AWAC planes, dropped from 38,100 hours in fiscal \nyear 1992, clear down to 17,713 hours in fiscal year 1996, a 54 percent \nreduction. Had it not been for the change in leadership in Congress in \n1995, this very troubling situation would have been far, far worse.\n\n  However, the damage of an unbalanced strategy has been done. Cocaine \nseizures had dropped, the price of cocaine had dropped, and there was \nan increase in drug use. Overall drug use among teens aged 12-17 rose \nby 70 percent. Drug-abuse-related arrests more than doubled for minors \nbetween 1992 and 1996. Since 1992, there has been an overall 80 percent \nincrease in illicit drug use among graduating high school seniors. This \nnegative effect has sent shockwaves through our communities and our \nhomes.\n  The rise of drug use is not at all surprising. With the decline of \nemphasis on drug interdiction, it became far easier to bring drugs into \nthe United States and thus far easier to purchase drugs. A significant \nprice decline caused by the increased availability of cocaine and \nheroin made it easier for casual adult users and our youth to buy these \ndrugs. The Office of National Drug Control Policy reported that small \n``pieces'' or rocks of crack once sold for $10 to $20 and are now \navailable for $3 to $5.\n\n[[Page S7875]]\n\n  Mr. President, what disturbs me about this current national drug \ncontrol strategy is that this unbalanced trend continues. As we can see \nin the second chart, in the late 1980s there was a generally balanced \ndistribution among the three different functions--demand reduction, law \nenforcement, and international interdiction efforts. In 1987, you can \nsee, they are fairly balanced. Compare that to the distributions for \nthe years 1994, 1995, and then 1998. One can see that our previous \nbalanced approach certainly no longer exists.\n  The red on the chart is the international and interdiction \ncomponents--again, Mr. President, basically our entire antidrug effort \nfrom the source countries to the transit zones, right up to the border \nof the United States. That is what this red represents. What you find \nis, it was basically a third when we started, when we looked at 1987, \nbut by the time we get to 1995 and 1998 it is a much smaller \npercentage, down to as low as 12 percent. That is the problem.\n  Our previous balanced approach simply no longer exists. The strategy \nhas changed, and, sadly, so have the results. This really is the untold \nstory of what has gone on in regard to our antidrug efforts during the \npast few years. It is a story that I think has to be told, and it is a \nstory that I think the Senate, the House, and the American people \nsimply have to pay attention to. We have to change this trend. We need \nto restore a balance, a balanced strategy.\n  Let me make it clear that I strongly support funding to keep with the \ndemand side of the drug situation; that is, finding a way to persuade \nAmericans, particularly young people, that doing drugs is wrong, that \nit destroys lives, families, schools, and communities. Truly, in the \nend, reducing demand is the only permanent way to really overcome the \nthreat of drugs. As long as there is demand for drugs, there will \nalways be a supply. That is why education and treatment, both--\neducation and treatment--remain essential long-term goal components of \nour antidrug efforts.\n  However, reducing the demand for drugs is not going to happen \novernight. It will take many years to change minds regarding the use or \nabuse of drugs. I believe one way to reduce demand is to have an \neffective interdiction policy, one that will seriously reduce the level \nof drugs into this country. We must find ways to raise the costs of \nnarcotics trafficking, making it far more difficult for drug lords to \nbring these drugs to our Nation and in making the drugs far more costly \nto buy.\n  It is sad to say, the drug cartels don't have a budget process or a \nbureaucracy to slow them down. Unfortunately, the job is not getting \ndone. As I have mentioned before, the Caribbean is becoming more and \nmore the transit route of choice for drug traffickers. I have made two \nvisits to the transit zone in the Caribbean in the past few months. \nDuring my last visit, I learned that our agents in the Bahamas seized \nmore cocaine in the first 3 months of 1998 than in the previous 3 years \ncombined. This may sound great, it may sound like we are making \nprogress, but our agents there inform me that although they would like \nto take tremendous credit for these seizures, their belief, their \nconcern, is that the higher amount seized represents probably just a \nsmall fraction of the total amount of drugs coming through this \narea. They told me that they think the amount of drugs coming through \nis significantly up, and they are only getting a fraction of what is \ncoming through.\n\n  For example, Mr. President, of the total drug air events in the \nBahamas from April 1997 to April 1998, our U.S. agents told me that \nthey believe there was only an 8 percent success rate in stopping drug \nair flights that had been detected. They are working hard and they are \ndoing the best they can, but that means that over 92 percent got away. \nWithout a doubt, there is a larger, larger flow of drugs entering the \nUnited States and a larger, larger flow of drugs coming through this \npart of the world.\n  Mr. President, when I was in Key West for a short visit in May, I was \nbriefed on specific interdiction efforts in the Eastern Pacific. I was \nsurprised to find that in the Eastern Pacific the coast is literally \nclear today for the drug lords to do their business. We have virtually \nnothing going on to stop drug trafficking in this area. It is wide, \nwide open. This is simply unacceptable.\n  The U.S. Government is not effectively dealing with this increasingly \nlarge threat in the eastern Pacific. We have virtually no presence \nbecause of a lack of funding and commitment. I was briefed about an \noperation called Caper Focus, which would have focused on interdiction \nefforts in the area. We would have had a number of surface assets and \naircraft to patrol the waters and to do interdiction. This operation, \nunfortunately, was canceled--canceled before it started--because of a \nDepartment of Defense decision to send the needed surface assets \nelsewhere. To date, this issue has not been resolved and the coastal \nwaters in the Eastern Pacific are wide open--wide open--for drug \nbusiness.\n  Mr. President, it is situations like this that greatly disturb me \nand, I think, should disturb all Americans. As a Nation, we are not \ndoing all we can to fight drugs beyond our borders. The drug lords in \nSouth America are well aware that the United States no longer considers \ninterdiction an important facet in its drug program. It is no \nexaggeration to say that they are having a field day. Although the \nCoast Guard and agencies can monitor drug trafficking operations, they \nstand by helpless because they lack the necessary equipment to turn \ndetection into seizures and arrests.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is time to provide the resources \nessential for our agencies to effectively complete the job that they \nhave been assigned, and the job that they so desperately want to do--\nthe job to protect our borders from the importation of illegal \nnarcotics. The most effective way to stop the drug business is to find \nways to make it more difficult for them to engage in this illicit and, \nfrankly, immoral practice. We need to have a renewed commitment and \nrededication of resources toward drug interdiction.\n  Mr. President, there is a clear link between the rise in the drug use \nand the decline of resources devoted to interdiction. The interdiction \nefforts conducted from 1985 to 1992 made a difference in reducing drug \nuse. Interdiction does drive up the price of doing business in drugs, \nand this drives up the price and drives down the purity of cocaine on \nthe street, or any other drug. Also, it is important to note that \nseizing or destroying a ton of cocaine in source or transit areas is \nmuch more cost effective than trying to seize the same quantity of \ndrugs at the point of sale. No doubt, interdiction is a key factor \ndriving down drug use, and you do it by driving up drug prices.\n  Mr. President, the answer to this current problem is clear: We need a \nbalanced antidrug approach. That means we have to restore source \ncountry/transit zone interdiction efforts. I believe that we can in \nfact do this. I believe we can restore the strategy we had not so many \nyears ago before the current administration hobbled these efforts. We \nneed to reduce the flow of cocaine and heroin into the U.S., we need to \ndrive up the cost of these drugs, and we need to reduce their \navailability and support efforts to reduce demand. This will work.\n  Mr. President, I have been working with colleagues both in the Senate \nand the House in developing this comprehensive interdiction eradication \nand crop substitution program. So I intend to take the floor again soon \nand outline how we can restore our international interdiction efforts \nand how we can restore the balance we need to once again effectively \nfight the scourge of illegal drugs.\n  Mr. President, Abraham Lincoln once said, ``We cannot escape \nhistory.'' Well, history shows that only with a comprehensive, balanced \nantidrug strategy can we actually reduce drug use. So it is time for \nour drug strategy to embrace history, not escape it.\n  Mr. President, I will discuss this matter in the future in more \ndetail and with more specifics, as far as what I think we need to do. \nBut the bottom line is that we need that balanced approach. We need to \nget back to doing what we were doing a few years ago, when one-third of \nour budget was devoted to interdiction, stopping drugs before they \nreached the United States. We need to do everything--we need to have \ndrug treatment, we need to have drug education, we need to have \ndomestic law enforcement, and we need to work at our borders. All of \nthese things\n\n[[Page S7876]]\n\nare important. But we also must do the final thing. The final thing is \nto stop the drugs at the source, in the source country, and in transit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/09/senate-section/article/S7873-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7876-S7877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  BUD SELIG--COMMISSIONER OF BASEBALL\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Alan H. ``Bud'' \nSelig, on his unanimous selection today to serve as baseball's ninth \npermanent commissioner.\n  Alan ``Bud'' Selig is a very good friend of mine.\n  Admittedly today's announcement is somewhat anti-climactic as Bud \nSelig's tenure has already surpassed that of four of his eight \npredecessors as commissioner. But this is truly a special day and a \ngreat accomplishment for a deserving and wonderful American.\n  Senator Herb Kohl of Wisconsin and Bud were college classmates. Most \ncollege classmates would consider it a great success if later in life \nthey were to share season tickets to a ballpark. This was a unique \ncollege roommate relationship in that both of them ended up being \nowners of major league franchises within their own city.\n  I must admit that I can think of few college rooming groups in our \nNation's history who have attained such success. Most roommates simply \naspire to one day share a set of season-tickets, but for each roommate \nto own one of the home town professional sports teams must surely be \nunprecedented.\n  While Bud may be an owner, he has always remained first and foremost, \na fan, and that is why I think that he has been and will continue to be \na successful commissioner. He understands the power of the game and the \njoy and disappointment that it can deliver to its fans.\n  Bud, you have an important job ahead of you, and some large footsteps \nthat you must walk in. But I have every confidence that you will serve \nin a manner worthy of the position and its history. Congratulations.\n  When Milwaukee joined the major leagues in 1953, Bud became a Braves \nfan and subsequently the largest public stockholder in 1963. But he saw \nhis beloved Braves move to Atlanta in 1965 and he then sold his stock.\n  But in recognition of the importance of baseball to the city, Bud \nformed an organization to bring baseball back to Milwaukee. After \nseveral heartbreaking failures Bud was successful in 1970 when a \nSeattle bankruptcy court awarded the Seattle franchise to the \ninvestment group led by Bud Selig, and the modern-day Milwaukee Brewers \nwere born.\n  Bud has led the Brewers since the move to Milwaukee, and has upon his \nselection as commissioner placed his interest in a trust. His daughter \nWendy is currently serving as the president of the club.\n  Not only is Bud an asset to the game of baseball, but he is a pillar \nin his community. He is a member of the board of the Green Bay Packers \nfootball team and the University of Wisconsin medical school. He was a \nfounder of athletes for youth, helped establish the child abuse \nprevention network and serves on the board for businesses against drunk \ndriving. He is also a trustee of the Boys and Girls Club.\n  From the day that he took the reigns of baseball's executive council \nhe has been faced with serious and difficult issues. He presided over \nthe 230-day strike that wiped out the World Series for the first time \nin 90 years and led to a sharp drop-off in attendance and popularity. \nBut eventually, he was able to help secure a new collective bargaining \nagreement with the players association, and the game has been moving in \nthe right direction ever since.\n  Bud Selig has implemented a number of changes to the game that have \nbeen overwhelmingly popular with baseball's fans.\n  As a Red Sox fan, I want to personally thank the commissioner for \nimplementing the popular wild card system. When I look in the sports \npages today to check the standings, I don't see Boston as being 11 \ngames out of first place. Instead, I see them with a five game lead in \nthe wild card race. For that, I and much of New England thank the new \ncommissioner.\n  He has also instigated interleague play that has brought tremendous \nexcitement to cities all across America. For years, the Yankees-Mets or \nCubs-White Sox debate took place in bar rooms and diners, but today \nit's taking place on the baseball diamond, where it should be.\n  Thanks to Bud Selig's leadership, baseball fans are no longer talking \nabout labor programs. Instead they're talking about the quest to \nsurpass Roger Maris's 61 home runs or Hack Wilson's RBI record. They're \ntalking about whether or not the Yankees can break the record for most \nwins in a season. They're talking about the playoff hopes of the Red \nSox and the Mets. And not only are they talking about baseball, but \nthey're also going to the ball park, as major league attendance has \nalmost completely returned to its pre-strike levels.\n  Today's vote is a testament to the job that Bud had done as interim \ncommissioner. When he took the post in a temporary role in 1992, few \npeople would have ever imagined that an owner could be approved as \nfull-time commissioner. But Bud Selig is a commissioner for the future \nof baseball, and he will continue doing an admirable job tackling the \nproblems of the modern game.\n  Perhaps the biggest problems facing baseball today is the dichotomy \nbetween rich and poor teams. And few Commissioners could be as uniquely \nwell-suited to address this issue. As the owner of a small-market team \nBud Selig understands the difficulties that the Milwaukees and \nMontreals of the world have going up against teams like the Braves and \nthe Yankees.\n  He was instrumental in securing a revenue-sharing agreement between \nlarge and small market teams, and I am confident that he will continue \nseeking ways to address this issue.\n  In addition to a valuable perspective, Bud Selig also possesses the \nleadership skills and demeanor that will be necessary to take baseball \ninto the next century. He's a far cry from the iron-fist of Judge \nKinnesaw Mountain Landis. Instead, Bud Selig rules by consensus, and \nhis consensus building skills will help him provide the unified \nleadership that will keep baseball on the right track as it heads into \nthe 21st century.\n  On a personal note, I want to thank Bud Selig for his efforts to help \nexpedite the move of the Yankees double-A farm team to Norwich, \nConnecticut. This ball club has played in Norwich for a few years now, \nand it has really helped to bring that community even closer together. \nThey play in a beautiful ball park, that I'm proud to say is named \nafter my father--Senator Thomas Dodd. The dedication of that stadium \nand the playing of the first minor league game in Norwich was a special \nday for me, and Bud Selig took the time from his busy schedule to spend \nthat day with me and the people of Connecticut. And for that, I am \nthankful.\n  So our deep and sincere congratulations to Bud.\n  In closing, I would like to read a passage from one of Bud Selig's \npredecessors that highlights the significance of the job that he has \njust taken.\n  A former Connecticut resident who served as commissioner of baseball, \nA. Bartlett Giamatti, who passed away, former president of Yale \nUniversity, wrote:\n\n       I believe baseball is a beautiful and exciting game, loved \n     by millions--I among them--and I believe baseball an \n     important, enduring American institution. It must assert and \n     aspire to the highest principles--of integrity, of \n     professionalism of performance, of fair play within its \n     rules. It will come as no surprise that like any institution \n     composed of human beings, this institution will not always \n     fulfill its highest aspirations. I know of no worldly \n     institution that does but this one, because it is so much \n     a part of our history as a people, and because it has such \n     a penchant on our national soul, has an obligation to the \n     people for whom it is played to, its fans, and well-\n     wishers to strive for excellence in all things to promote \n     the highest ideals.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Alan H. ``Bud'' \nSelig, on his unanimous selection today to serve as baseball's ninth \npermanent commissioner.\n  Alan ``Bud'' Selig is a very good friend of mine.\n  Admittedly today's announcement is somewhat anti-climactic as Bud \nSelig's tenure has already surpassed that of four of his eight \npredecessors as commissioner. But this is truly a special day and a \ngreat accomplishment for a deserving and wonderful American.\n  Senator Herb Kohl of Wisconsin and Bud were college classmates. Most \ncollege classmates would consider it a great success if later in life \nthey were to share season tickets to a ballpark. This was a unique \ncollege roommate relationship in that both of them ended up being \nowners of major league franchises within their own city.\n  I must admit that I can think of few college rooming groups in our \nNation's history who have attained such success. Most roommates simply \naspire to one day share a set of season-tickets, but for each roommate \nto own one of the home town professional sports teams must surely be \nunprecedented.\n  While Bud may be an owner, he has always remained first and foremost, \na fan, and that is why I think that he has been and will continue to be \na successful commissioner. He understands the power of the game and the \njoy and disappointment that it can deliver to its fans.\n  Bud, you have an important job ahead of you, and some large footsteps \nthat you must walk in. But I have every confidence that you will serve \nin a manner worthy of the position and its history. Congratulations.\n  When Milwaukee joined the major leagues in 1953, Bud became a Braves \nfan and subsequently the largest public stockholder in 1963. But he saw \nhis beloved Braves move to Atlanta in 1965 and he then sold his stock.\n  But in recognition of the importance of baseball to the city, Bud \nformed an organization to bring baseball back to Milwaukee. After \nseveral heartbreaking failures Bud was successful in 1970 when a \nSeattle bankruptcy court awarded the Seattle franchise to the \ninvestment group led by Bud Selig, and the modern-day Milwaukee Brewers \nwere born.\n  Bud has led the Brewers since the move to Milwaukee, and has upon his \nselection as commissioner placed his interest in a trust. His daughter \nWendy is currently serving as the president of the club.\n  Not only is Bud an asset to the game of baseball, but he is a pillar \nin his community. He is a member of the board of the Green Bay Packers \nfootball team and the University of Wisconsin medical school. He was a \nfounder of athletes for youth, helped establish the child abuse \nprevention network and serves on the board for businesses against drunk \ndriving. He is also a trustee of the Boys and Girls Club.\n  From the day that he took the reigns of baseball's executive council \nhe has been faced with serious and difficult issues. He presided over \nthe 230-day strike that wiped out the World Series for the first time \nin 90 years and led to a sharp drop-off in attendance and popularity. \nBut eventually, he was able to help secure a new collective bargaining \nagreement with the players association, and the game has been moving in \nthe right direction ever since.\n  Bud Selig has implemented a number of changes to the game that have \nbeen overwhelmingly popular with baseball's fans.\n  As a Red Sox fan, I want to personally thank the commissioner for \nimplementing the popular wild card system. When I look in the sports \npages today to check the standings, I don't see Boston as being 11 \ngames out of first place. Instead, I see them with a five game lead in \nthe wild card race. For that, I and much of New England thank the new \ncommissioner.\n  He has also instigated interleague play that has brought tremendous \nexcitement to cities all across America. For years, the Yankees-Mets or \nCubs-White Sox debate took place in bar rooms and diners, but today \nit's taking place on the baseball diamond, where it should be.\n  Thanks to Bud Selig's leadership, baseball fans are no longer talking \nabout labor programs. Instead they're talking about the quest to \nsurpass Roger Maris's 61 home runs or Hack Wilson's RBI record. They're \ntalking about whether or not the Yankees can break the record for most \nwins in a season. They're talking about the playoff hopes of the Red \nSox and the Mets. And not only are they talking about baseball, but \nthey're also going to the ball park, as major league attendance has \nalmost completely returned to its pre-strike levels.\n  Today's vote is a testament to the job that Bud had done as interim \ncommissioner. When he took the post in a temporary role in 1992, few \npeople would have ever imagined that an owner could be approved as \nfull-time commissioner. But Bud Selig is a commissioner for the future \nof baseball, and he will continue doing an admirable job tackling the \nproblems of the modern game.\n  Perhaps the biggest problems facing baseball today is the dichotomy \nbetween rich and poor teams. And few Commissioners could be as uniquely \nwell-suited to address this issue. As the owner of a small-market team \nBud Selig understands the difficulties that the Milwaukees and \nMontreals of the world have going up against teams like the Braves and \nthe Yankees.\n  He was instrumental in securing a revenue-sharing agreement between \nlarge and small market teams, and I am confident that he will continue \nseeking ways to address this issue.\n  In addition to a valuable perspective, Bud Selig also possesses the \nleadership skills and demeanor that will be necessary to take baseball \ninto the next century. He's a far cry from the iron-fist of Judge \nKinnesaw Mountain Landis. Instead, Bud Selig rules by consensus, and \nhis consensus building skills will help him provide the unified \nleadership that will keep baseball on the right track as it heads into \nthe 21st century.\n  On a personal note, I want to thank Bud Selig for his efforts to help \nexpedite the move of the Yankees double-A farm team to Norwich, \nConnecticut. This ball club has played in Norwich for a few years now, \nand it has really helped to bring that community even closer together. \nThey play in a beautiful ball park, that I'm proud to say is named \nafter my father--Senator Thomas Dodd. The dedication of that stadium \nand the playing of the first minor league game in Norwich was a special \nday for me, and Bud Selig took the time from his busy schedule to spend \nthat day with me and the people of Connecticut. And for that, I am \nthankful.\n  So our deep and sincere congratulations to Bud.\n  In closing, I would like to read a passage from one of Bud Selig's \npredecessors that highlights the significance of the job that he has \njust taken.\n  A former Connecticut resident who served as commissioner of baseball, \nA. Bartlett Giamatti, who passed away, former president of Yale \nUniversity, wrote:\n\n       I believe baseball is a beautiful and exciting game, loved \n     by millions--I among them--and I believe baseball an \n     important, enduring American institution. It must assert and \n     aspire to the highest principles--of integrity, of \n     professionalism of performance, of fair play within its \n     rules. It will come as no surprise that like any institution \n     composed of human beings, this institution will not always \n     fulfill its highest aspirations. I know of no worldly \n     institution that does but this one, because it is so much \n     a part of our history as a people, and because it has such \n     a penchant on our national soul, has an obligation to the \n     people for whom it is played to, its fans, and well-\n     wishers to strive for excellence in all things to promote \n     the highest ideals. I am told that I am an idealist. I \n     hope so. I will continue to locate ideals I hold for \n     myself and my country in the national game as well as in \n     others of our national institutions.\n\n  ``Bud'' Selig, I think, embraces those thoughts that Bartlett \nGiamatti expressed some years ago before his untimely and early death. \nI am very confident that we will all be proud of his tenure as \ncommissioner of baseball.\n  I wanted to take this moment to congratulate ``Bud'' Selig and his \nfamily this evening. It is a proud night for them, and certainly it is \na good night for baseball and for America as well.\n\n[[Page S7877]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/09/senate-section/article/S7876-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         U.S. FOREIGN OIL CONSUMPTION FOR WEEK ENDING JULY 3RD\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute has \nreported that for the week ending July 3 that the U.S. imported \n7,328,000 barrels of oil each day, 1,632,000 barrels a day less than \nthe 8,960,000 imported during the same week a year ago.\n  While this is one of the rare weeks when Americans imported slightly \nless foreign oil than the same week a year ago, Americans still relied \non foreign oil for 53.7 percent of their needs last week.

A bill to provide for fairness in the home for closure \nprocess; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                    Foreclosure Fairness Act of 1998\n\n Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation \nthat will improve the single family home foreclosure process. As we all \nknow, bankruptcies have reached an all time high. It has also recently \nbeen reported that a record number of homeowners are shifting debt from \ncredit cards to their homes. According to some estimates, there are \n500,000 foreclosures taking place annually.\n  I am greatly concerned that sometime in the future we may see a \ngreater number of foreclosures on single family homes. I hope this will \nnot be true, but if it is, I am introducing legislation to greatly \nimprove the process for the homeowner.\n  Currently, a common practice in most States is causing tens of \nthousands of consumers to be treated unfairly when their homes are sold \nfollowing foreclosure proceedings.\n  In all but three States, when a home is sold in a foreclosure sale, a \nlawyer normally advertises the event in an obscure local publication \nand in terms that the average person would have a hard time \nunderstanding. And the sales are typically held at times and places \nthat are not designed to encourage bidding on the home. The sale may \ntake place on the courthouse steps or in the backroom of law firm's \noffice.\n  Because the general public is rarely aware of these sales, it is not \nuncommon for the lending institution and the lawyer to be the only \npeople present.\n  In the long run, it is the homeowner who is the double loser. First, \nthe homeowner has lost his home because of an inability to meet the \nmortgage payments. Second, the foreclosure sale usually does not result \nin the home bringing fair market value and this results in the now \nformer homeowner facing a deficiency judgment that might not have \noccurred if the home had been sold in a public manner by auction.\n  I think this process needs to be improved. Today, I am introducing a \nbill that would allow the homeowner to choose to have his or her \nforeclosure conducted by auction, in a manner that maximizes \ncompetitive bidding, and most importantly, is open and convenient to \nthe general public.\n  Under this process, in my view, both the homeowner and the lender \nwill benefit greatly, because the property, when sold, will generate a \ntrue fair market value. There will most likely be no deficiency \njudgement against homeowners, and lenders will not have to collect \ntheir losses from insolvent homeowners.\n  Mr. President, my legislation has already undergone testing in three \nStates, Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts. The first two States \nrequire a true auction, not a lawyer's secret sale, under State law, \nwhile Massachusetts uses the real auction procedures based on a court \norder. In all three States, the program has worked with great results \nand both homeowners and lenders gain from its usage.\n  Nothing in this legislation will affect State law regarding any other \nprovision of foreclosures, except that the homeowner has the right to \nselect an auction sale. Further, my legislation provides an exemption \nfor State laws that are substantially similar in nature.\n  Mr. President, I think this is a good bill that will help consumers \nwhen they are in a dire financial condition. Consumers can take comfort \nin the fact that they will have the option to a full, fair, open and \npublic sale of their home should it come to foreclosure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Johnson, Mrs. \n        Murray, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Abraham, Ms. Snowe, and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 2283. A bill to support sustainable and broad-based agricultural \nand rural development in sub-Saharan Africa, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n                       AFRICA: SEEDS OF HOPE ACT\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleague from \nMaryland, Senator Sarbanes, Senator Moynihan, Senator Murray, and \nSenator Johnson, to introduce the ``Africa: Seeds of Hope Act''--\nlegislation to promote small-scale agricultural and rural development \nin Africa. The bill also would recognize the important benefits such \noverseas agriculture advances could hold for our own farmers here in \nthe United States.\n  Mr. President, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization, \naround 215 million people are undernourished in sub-Saharan Africa. \nThis number is expected to increase dramatically in the next century. \nSimilarly, the number of Africans who are unable to produce the \nprovisions they need to lead healthy, productive lives is rising.\n  Food is the most basic necessity of life. Yet, millions of Africans \nlead lives of needless suffering because they don't have the skills and \ntools necessary to provide for themselves and others. As a result, many \nAfrican countries are dependent on the outside world for humanitarian \nassistance and basic nutrition. Africa's food imports are projected to \nrise from less than 8,000,000 metric tons in 1990 to more than \n25,000,000 metric tons by the year 2020.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the most effective way to improve \nconditions for Africa's poor is to increase the productivity of their \nagricultural sector. Whenever I travel to developing countries, I try \nto spend time looking at the countries' agriculture. I have seen \nfirsthand that rural areas can succeed through innovative agricultural \ndevelopment. It does in fact work.\n  Mr. President, about 70 percent of Africa's poor lives in rural \nareas. That's where the major problem is, and that's where this bill \ncan make a difference.\n  This legislation has an important link with another bipartisan trade \nbill--the African Trade Growth and Opportunities Act, which I \ncosponsored and hope the Senate will pass sometime in the near future. \nThat legislation is also an important step in aiding a continent in \nneed of strong economic leadership.\n  Before we can have effective trade, however, there needs to be a \nreciprocal market--a springboard from which we can foster substantive \ntrade relations. This is why this bill we are introducing today is so \ncritical to American interests in that region.\n\n  Mr. President, let me outline a few highlights of this bill:\n  First, it would encourage Federal agencies and international \norganizations to make rural development issues a priority--by teaching \neffective farming methods to small-scale sub-Saharan African farmers \nand entrepreneurs;\n  Second, it would provide African small farmers and entrepreneurs with \nimproved access to credit and other resources necessary to stimulate \nproduction and micro-enterprise;\n  Third, it would mobilize new investments in African agriculture and \nrural development through the US Overseas Private Investment \nCorporation; and\n  Fourth, it would facilitate the coordination of national and \ninternational agricultural research and extension efforts aimed at \ndeveloping the skills of African researchers, extension agents, \nfarmers, and agribusiness people--in fact, the bill would allow \nAmerican universities to play a pivotal role in this effort.\n  Mr. President, African nations are in dire need of agricultural \ndevelopment. This bill can help them gain the knowledge they need to \nsucceed. At the same time, as a Senator from a State with a rich \nagricultural tradition, I believe we must be sensitive to the needs of \nour own American farmers. I believe the United States and our farmers \ncould benefit from the passage of the bill.\n  This bill could open new export opportunities for American \nfarmers, especially those who produce value-added goods. As the \neconomies in sub-Saharan Africa develop, the overall standard of living \nwill increase. In turn, the people of Africa will be in a better \nposition to purchase a variety of goods, including American \nagricultural commodities and equipment. This is where our export \nmarkets can flourish.\n\n  Another significant point to consider is that food stability is a \ncritical factor in preventing civil strife within nations. Our \ninvestment in international agriculture and rural development will help \nreduce demands for U.S. disaster and famine relief.\n  Also, the most rapidly increasing markets for U.S. products are in \ndeveloping countries. Hence, helping these\n\n[[Page S7883]]\n\neconomies grow through their agricultural sector will in the end help \nour own economy.\n  Mr. President, international agricultural development assistance has \ndecreased over time. In fact, in the past decade alone, U.S. AID money \nfor this program has dropped by 70 percent. We should re-focus our \nefforts in this important program and this bill will do that.\n  I want to commend my House colleagues, Doug Bereuter and Lee \nHamilton, for their work on the companion bill, H.R. 3636. Through \ntheir vision and leadership, they are building bipartisan support for \nthis initiative as well.\n  Mr. President, this legislation has the ability to make a real \ndifference in the lives of millions of people. Doing so serves our \nhumanitarian and economic interests. This bill would help these \ncountries make important progress in meeting basic human needs. I \nencourage and urge my colleagues to support this important and timely \nmeasure.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today in \nintroducing the ``Africa: Seeds of Hope Act of 1998.'' This legislation \nwill support sustainable and broad-based economic growth in sub-Saharan \nAfrica by directing bilateral aid and investment programs toward small-\nscale farming and rural development. At the same time, by fostering \nresearch and extension activities and helping to build local markets, \nthis initiative will provide important opportunities for mutual \ncooperation between U.S. and African farmers, educators, scientists and \nentrepreneurs.\n  Recognizing the high rates of malnutrition, poverty and hunger in \nmany African countries, this bill is designed to promote food security \nand agricultural productivity by expanding access to credit and \ntechnology, improving information and farming techniques, and creating \nmore efficient market mechanisms. The legislation would accomplish this \nin several ways. First, it ensures that the United States Agency for \nInternational Development (USAID) will devote adequate funding to \nprograms and projects that improve food security and meet the needs of \nthe rural poor. It requires the participation of affected communities \nin all phases of project planning and development, and strengthens \ncoordination with non-governmental organizations, cooperatives, land-\ngrant and other appropriate universities, and local marketing \nassociations that have relevant expertise.\n  Second, the bill highlights the role of microcredit assistance in the \noverall strategy against rural poverty. Lack of access to credit, \nparticularly among women, has restricted the growth of small-scale \nagriculture, the availability and use of appropriate technology, and \nthe establishment of an adequate and reliable food supply.\n  Third, this legislation mobilizes new resources for investment in \nAfrican agriculture and rural development through the Overseas Private \nInvestment Corporation (OPIC), working with small businesses and other \nU.S. entities to develop the capacities of small-scale farmers and \nrural entrepreneurs.\n  A fourth way in which the bill promotes food security and \nagricultural productivity is by directing USAID and the Department of \nAgriculture to develop a comprehensive plan to coordinate and build on \nthe research and extension activities of U.S. land-grant universities, \ninternational agricultural research centers, and national agricultural \nresearch and extension centers. In this way, the initiative encourages \nthe latest agricultural methods and most successful business practices, \nwhile ensuring they are appropriate to local conditions and adapted to \nspecific climates.\n  Finally, this legislation establishes the Bill Emerson Humanitarian \nTrust, which is intended to serve as a reliable mechanism for providing \nemergency food aid overseas. Using unexpended balances in existing \naccounts, this bill converts the Food Security Commodity Reserve into a \ntrust account that will allow for more timely and cost-effective \nresponses to humanitarian crises.\n  Mr. President, as funding for international affairs has been reduced, \nit is programs like these, which address the needs of the world's \npoorest, that have been hit hardest. This bill draws attention to the \nimportance of sustainable agriculture and targets U.S. assistance \nprograms in Africa toward building food security and self-sufficiency. \nI am pleased to join with my distinguished colleague from Ohio, Mr. \nDeWine, in introducing this legislation, and I look forward to working \nwith him, the other cosponsors, and the Administration in moving it \ntoward enactment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Ford, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \n        Byrd, and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 2281. A bill to amend the Tariff Act of 1930 to eliminate \ndisincentives to fair trade conditions; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n         continued dumping or subsidization offset act of 1998\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Continued \nDumping or Subsidy Offset bill. I am pleased that Senators Hollings, \nFord, Dodd, Byrd, and Rockefeller have joined me as original cosponsors \nof this legislation. My friend and colleague from Ohio, Congressman \nRalph Regula already has introduced similar legislation in the House. \nThis bill represents a strong step towards creating a more level \nplaying field for domestic producers. It strengthens the Tariff Act of \n1930, which currently imposes duties and fines for dumping and \nsubsidization.\n  This new bill takes the 1930 Act a step further, by transferring the \nduties and fines to injured U.S. companies to compensate for damages. \nThis approach is designed to discourage foreign companies from dumping \nand subsidization, since it would actually assist U.S. competitors at \ntheir expense. In order to counter the adverse effects of foreign \ndumping and subsidization on U.S. industries, the Senate should pass \nthis bill.\n  Current law has simply not been strong enough to stop harmful trading \npractices. It is an unfortunate truth that foreign producers have \ncontinued to engage in dumping to increase or maintain unfair market \nshares. This dumping occurs in the face of existing U.S. trade laws and \ninternational agreements within the WTO.\n  Specifically, the problem with the law is that foreign producers are \nwilling to pay current U.S. antidumping and countervailing duties out \nof the profits of dumping. In other words, there is no real \ndisincentive to stop dumping. It's still good business for foreign \ncompanies. Furthermore, since some foreign producers receive continued \nsubsidization, this enables them to maintain market share that \nunsubsidized prices would not sustain. As a result, U.S. companies are \ncontinually injured by the actions of these foreign producers.\n  The law also does not contain a mechanism to help injured U.S. \nindustries recover from the harmful effects of foreign dumping and \nsubsidization. The foreign practices have reduced the ability of our \ninjured domestic industries to reinvest in plan, equipment, people, \nR, technology or to maintain or restore health care and pension \nbenefits. The end result is this: continued dumping or subsidization \njeopardizes renewed investment and prevents additional reinvestment \nfrom being made. Unless we act, domestic firms will face continued \nprice depression. This is an unfair and unacceptable trading practice \nby foreign firms.\n  Under current law, any fines and duties imposed on foreign traders \nfor illegal dumping practices go directly into U.S. Treasury coffers. \nIt is important to note that U.S. trade laws are not intended to raise \nrevenue for the Treasury. Rather, such laws are intended to see that \nU.S. companies face conditions of fair trade in the market. The bill I \nam introducing today would further that good by helping create a more \nlevel playing field and two ways mentioned earlier:\n  First, the legislation would award duties and fines to injured \ndomestic companies, and provide businesses relief from adverse effects \nof foreign dumping and subsidization.\n  Second, this transfer of funds from foreign companies to their U.S. \ncompetitors may provide the disincentive to dump, which is a \nfundamental problem with current law. This would reduce the economic \nbenefits of dumping and subsidizing.\n  Many companies and workers are currently not being given the level \nplaying field intended by our trade laws and international trade \nagreements. The Continued Dumping or Subsidy Offset bill is the first \nstrong step\n\n[[Page S7884]]\n\nto correct his real problem by assisting domestic companies and further \ndiscouraging unfair trading practices by foreign traders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/09/senate-section/article/S7882-1", "month":

Chief Abiola was \napparently stricken by heart failure during a meeting with senior U.S. \nofficials, including Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering and \nAssistant Secretary of State for Africa, Susan Rice, on July 7. In \ngreat ironic tragedy, the U.S. delegation was in Nigeria, in part, to \npush the new government of that country for the release of Abiola and \ndozens of other political prisoners. There was broad speculation that \nAbiola would have been released within days.\n\n[[Page S7893]]\n\n  Mr. President, Abiola's death comes during a tumultuous moment in \nNigerian history, just one month after the death of military leader \nGen. Sani Abacha. Gen. Abacha was by any definition an authoritarian \nleader of the worst sort. He routinely imprisoned individuals for \nexpressing their political opinions and skimmed Nigeria's precious \nresources for his own gains. With the replacement of Abacha by the \ncurrent military ruler, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, there has been reason \nto be optimistic about Nigeria's future. Although he has not yet moved \nto repeal the repressive decrees that place severe restrictions on the \nbasic freedoms of Nigerians, Gen. Abubakar has taken some positive \nsteps, including the release of several prominent political prisoners, \nand has indicated a willingness to move his country once and for all in \nthe direction of democracy. But he had yet to deal with one of the more \nvexing issues related to such a transition, and that is the role that \nChief Abiola would assume.\n  News of Abiola's death has sent shock waves through the country. \nSince last night, there have been sporadic riots throughout the \ncountry, and particularly in Lagos, the center of Abiola's supporters. \nAt least 19 people are known to have died in the ensuing violence. And, \naccording to news reports, heavily armed police continue to patrol the \nstreets.\n  Abubakar is making efforts to calm the country. First, he has \nordered, with the consent of the Abiola family, a complete autopsy, \nunder the supervision of Abiola's own doctor, of the cause of death. \nThis is extremely important in order to quell the rumors already \ncirculating that the military injected Abiola with poison prior to his \nmeeting with the American officials. Abubakar also today announced the \ndissolution of the Abacha-appointed Cabinet. These are, indeed, \npositive steps, but they are not enough.\n  Earlier this session, I introduced the Nigerian Democracy and Civil \nSociety Empowerment Act, S. 2102. The provisions of my bill include \nbenchmarks defining what would constitute an open political process in \nNigeria. Despite all the tumultuous events that have taken place in \nthese past few weeks, I still believe these benchmarks are important, \nand I continue to call on Gen. Abubakar to implement as soon as \npossible these important changes, such as the repeal of the repressive \ndecrees enacted under Abacha's rule, so that genuine reform can take \nplace in Nigeria.\n  Finally, in this time of great uncertainty in the country, I urge all \nNigerians to exercise restraint. Let's wait to see what Abubakar \nchooses to do next. Let's wait to evaluate the results of the autopsy. \nNigeria has suffered enough already. It would be a shame if Abiola's \ndeath were to lead the country into armed conflict.\n  Let us hope this will not be the case.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/09/senate-section/article/S7892-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7893-S7898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             NATO EXPANSION\n\n Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the real issue in the debate on \nNATO expansion is the very character of the alliance in the future. \nNATO has been successful in the past because its mission has been \nfocused. Now, the Senate is being asked to give its stamp of approval \nto a mission-expanded NATO. Passing this resolution of ratification \nwithout the Ashcroft amendment will be ratifying a NATO to serve as a \n``force for peace from the Middle East to Central Africa,'' to use the \nwords of Secretary Albright. There have been misconceptions about my \namendment in the Senate and in the press. Allow me to address some of \nthose.\n  First, let me emphasize that this amendment is based on the language \nof the North Atlantic Treaty itself. For the Administration, which is \nopposing this amendment, I have one question: what do you have in mind \nfor NATO that is not contained within the treaty itself? All my \namendment does is restate the language of the treaty, specifically \narticle 4. My amendment will not restrict NATO's ability to respond to \ncollective defense threats from outside NATO territory. My amendment \nwill not restrict NATO from responding to the new threats of post-Cold \nWar world like weapons of mass destruction and international terrorism.\n  The very purpose of NATO has been to prepare for collective defense \nthreats emanating from outside the North Atlantic area. Any threat from \noutside the treaty area which posed the threat of an attack on NATO \nterritory would be covered by the treaty and allowable under this \namendment.\n  This Administration, however, has something much different than \ncollective defense in mind. NATO is in danger of changing, but the \ntransformation is from Administration officials pushing for a global \nNATO. The United States Constitution has provisions for altering \ntreaties, and it is called obtaining the Senate's advice and consent. \nIf we want a global NATO, the treaty should be resubmitted for the \nSenate's consideration.\n  For those of us who are concerned that NATO will get into far-flung \noperations, former officials Bill Perry and Warren Christopher write \nthat the unanimous consent required among NATO members will guard \nagainst reckless deployments (New York Times, Oct. 21, 1997). For Mr. \nPerry and Mr. Christopher, the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate is \nreplaced by the NATO bureaucracy. Thank you, but I like the United \nStates Constitution just fine.\n  Secretary Acheson had it right in 1949--the treaty would be altered \nby constitutional processes. Acheson stated: ``. . . the impossibility \nof foretelling what the international situation will be in the distant \nfuture makes rigidity for too long a term undesirable. It is believed \nthat indefinite duration, with the possibility that any party may \nwithdraw from the treaty after 20 years and that the treaty as a whole \nmight be reviewed at any time after it has been in effect for 10 years, \nprovides the best solution'' (Letter transmitting the treaty to the \nPresident, April 7, 1949).\n  Acheson recognized that the world would change. His answer for how \nNATO would respond--countries can withdraw from the treaty or the \ntreaty could be reviewed. Notice Acheson did not mention a review of \nNATO's Strategic Concept, on which the Senate has no vote, but a review \nof the treaty, with any modifications subject to Senate advice and \nconsent.\n  If this treaty was so elastic as to be stretched to cover any \nconceivable military operation, why would Acheson even talk about \nreviewing the treaty? Acheson did have a view of an alliance \nestablished for a specific purpose, with a limited scope.\n  In the letter transmitting the treaty to President Truman, Secretary \nAcheson acknowledged the parameters of the treaty and stated flatly \nthat the North Atlantic Council will have ``. . . no powers other than \nto consider matters within the purview of the treaty . . .'' (Letter to \nPresident Truman transmitting the NATO treaty, April 7, 1949). If \nAcheson viewed the treaty as limitless in scope, why did he testify \nabout the careful limits of the various articles? Why did he explicitly \nstate that NATO could not consider matters outside the purview of the \ntreaty?\n  The Foreign Relations Committee, in its report on the treaty, took \npains to show NATO was not an ``old fashioned military alliance.'' The \nreport states: ``. . . in both intent and language, it is purely \ndefensive in nature. It comes into operation only against a nation \nwhich, by its own action, has proved itself an international criminal \nby. . .attacking a party to the treaty . . . If it can be called an \nalliance, it is an alliance only against war itself'' (SFRC Report, \nJune 6, 1949).\n  The Ashcroft amendment is designed to advance U.S. interests by \nkeeping NATO focused on this historical mission of collective defense. \nWithout the Ashcroft amendment, the Senate is setting NATO--the most \nsuccessful military alliance in history--on the course of becoming a \nmini-UN with a standing army. My amendment will preserve the historical \nstrength and effectiveness of NATO by keeping the alliance focused on \nthe mission of the treaty itself. The Ashcroft amendment will only \npreclude the global policing operations outside the scope of the \ntreaty.\n  Drift in NATO is already underway. Frederick Bonnart writes of the \nMadrid summit in July 1997 where expansion was endorsed: `` . . . \nbehind the euphoria, a hollowness has appeared that had not been \nevident before. The leaders seem unclear about the purpose of the \norganization, and therefore about the political and military shape it \nis to take. Worst of all, strains have shown\n\n[[Page S7894]]\n\nup in the alliance that indicate weaknesses in its most vital asset: \nits cohesion'' (Intl. Herald Tribune, July 25, 1997).\n  Cohesion means something in a military alliance. If you want to turn \nNATO into the bureaucratic free-for-all of the UN, then oppose the \nAshcroft amendment. If you want to keep NATO on a successful course, \nvote for this amendment.\n  The Administration and some of my colleagues are arguing that NATO \nhas no parameters, that's its mission can evolve, and that the Senate \nhas no role to play in this evolution. Some of the Senators who are \ncriticizing this amendment were championing the Senate's constitutional \nprerogatives during the ``reinterpretation'' debate over the ABM treaty \nin the 1980's.\n  This Administration is setting NATO on a crash course to policing the \nbrushfires of Europe and beyond. The lives of American soldiers are at \nstake if NATO is transformed into a mini-UN with a standing army. The \nfirst Somalia experience you have with NATO, and the alliance's \ncredibility will be undermined.\n  The historical setting for the establishment of NATO, the Senate \nrecord surrounding ratification, and the treaty language itself make it \nclear that collective defense was the clear mission of the alliance.\n  Treaties are not formed in a vacuum. Two world wars were not enough \nfor the United States to abandon a 149-year tradition of no peacetime \nmilitary alliances. It took Soviet aggression in Bulgaria, Hungary, and \nPoland; a civil war in Greece which threatened to install a communist \ngovernment; the coup in Czechoslovakia in February, 1948; the threat of \ncommunist victory in Italian elections in April, 1948; a tightening \nblockade of Berlin, and threatening moves by the Soviet Union to \nsubjugate Norway to a non-aggression pact to bring the United States to \nthe point of making a peacetime alliance with Europe.\n  When analyzing the Treaty itself, you see a document that commits the \nU.S. to carefully defined military contingencies. NATO is given the \nflexibility to consult on an array of issues, it is charged with \ncoordinating mutually constructive economic policies, it is allowed to \ninvite new members to join when doing so would advance the security of \nthe North Atlantic area. But when it comes to the use of military \nforce, careful limits are placed on NATO's scope.\n  Careful parameters are seen clearly in article 5, the heart of the \nTreaty: ``The parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of \nthem in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against \nthem all; and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack \noccurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or \ncollective self-defense recognized by Article 51 of the Charter of the \nUnited Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking \nforthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such \naction as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to \nrestore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.''\n  This article establishes the principal of collective defense. The use \nof armed force in this article and in other parts of the treaty is \ndiscussed only within this framework of collective defense: (1) The \npreamble of the treaty states that NATO allies ``are resolved to unite \ntheir efforts for collective defense and for the preservation of peace \nand security;'' (2) Article 3 states that ``In order to more \neffectively achieve the objectives of this Treaty, the Parties, \nseparately and jointly, by means of continuous and effective self-help \nand mutual aid, will maintain and develop their individual and \ncollective capacity to resist armed attack;'' (3) Article 9 establishes \na council for the alliance, now called the North Atlantic Council, \nwhich is charged with establishing ``immediately a defence committee \nwhich shall recommend measures for the implementation of Articles 3 and \n5,'' the two articles which outline the collective defense mission.\n  Article 5 excluded NATO's involvement in civil wars in general. The \nCommittee Report states ``. . . purely internal disorders or \nrevolutions would not be considered `armed attacks' within the meaning \nof article 5.'' Article 5 applied only when a NATO member had an \ninternal civil war aided by an outside power or when a civil war \noutside NATO threatened an attack on a member.\n  NATO's geographical scope was defined carefully in article 6. Article \n6 goes on to define ``armed attack'' and the territorial parameters in \nwhich the armed attack must occur for Article 5 to be invoked to \ninclude the territory of any NATO member, the islands under the \njurisdiction of any of the Parties in the North Atlantic area north of \nthe Tropic of Cancer, the forces, vessels, or aircraft of any of the \nParties, when in or over these territories or any other area in Europe \nin which occupation forces of any of the Parties were stationed on the \ndate when the Treaty entered into force or the Mediterranean Sea or the \nNorth Atlantic area north of the Tropic of Cancer.\n  As is clear in articles 5 and 6, when the deployment of U.S. troops \nwas possible, the U.S. drafters of the Treaty took extra precaution to \ndefine parameters.\n  Article 4, the article the Administration would use to create a \nglobal NATO, reinforces the alliance's collective defense mission. \nArticle 4 states ``The parties will consult together whenever, in the \nopinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political \nindependence or security of any of the Parties is threatened.''\n  This language is not the basis for a global NATO engaged in \nflashpoints from the Middle East to Central Africa. Article 4 \nreinforces NATO's collective defense mission. Words like ``security'' \nand ``political independence'' were taken seriously in 1949. The world \nhad lived through two world wars and the Cold War was beginning. \nSecurity was not given the casual, domino-theory definition of today. \nTake, for example, comments by Deputy Secretary of State, Strobe \nTalbott: ``If there were to be instability and conflict of any kind, \nwhatever the origin of it, in Central or Eastern Europe, it would be a \nthreat to the Continent as a whole'' (Voice of America Interview, April \n10, 1997).\n  As Lawrence Kaplan, perhaps the dean of NATO historians, writes:\n\n       The alliance's preoccupation with expansion seemingly \n     prevents an exploration of the problems `out of area' issues \n     raise. The Rome Summit [1991 NATO summit at which the \n     Strategic Concept was adopted] did mention Article 4, which \n     calls for consultation whenever any member believes that its \n     territorial integrity, political independence or security is \n     threatened. But this article is too vague, compared with \n     Article 5 to serve as a guide for the future. (Lawrence \n     Kaplan. NATO & Out of Area Issue. March 13, 1998).\n\n  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee Report on the NATO Treaty in \n1949 reinforces the careful limits of the Treaty language itself. The \nfirst paragraph of the Report, entitled ``Main Purpose of the Treaty,'' \nstates:\n\n       The basic objective of the treaty is to [make] clear the \n     determination of the members of the North Atlantic community \n     to safeguard their common heritage of freedom by exercising \n     collectively their inherent right of self-defense in the \n     event of an armed attack upon any of them . . .'' (U.S. \n     Congress. SFRC. North Atlantic Treaty Report, June 6, 1949. \n     Pg. 1)\n\n  With regard to article 3, the Report states,\n\n       Questions have also been raised as to whether the United \n     States, under article 3, would be obligated to assist the \n     other parties to develop the capacity of their overseas \n     territories to resist armed attack. The objective of the \n     treaty is to maintain the peace and security of the North \n     Atlantic area. During the negotiations there were no \n     suggestions that this article should be interpreted as \n     applying to any other area. The United States is under no \n     obligation to assist the other parties . . . in resisting \n     armed attack outside the area defined in article 6 (U.S. \n     Congress. SFRC. North Atlantic Treaty Report, June 6, 1949. \n     Pg. 11)\n\n  With regard to article 4, in testimony on NATO in 1949, Senator \nVandenberg stated that he wanted to make it clear in the Committee \nReport on the treaty that article 4 ``was as limited as the balance of \nthe pact'' (Testimony before the SFRC, May 4, 1949).\n  It is no surprise, then, that the SFRC Report carefully ties the use \nof article 4 to the collective defense mission of the alliance. The \nReport states that\n\n       A situation arising anywhere might be cause for \n     consultation, provided that it constituted a threat to one or \n     more of the parties and might involve obligations under the \n     treaty. The committee underlines the fact that consultation \n     could be requested only when the element of threat is present \n     and expresses the opinion that this limitation should be \n     strictly interpreted.\n\n\n[[Page S7895]]\n\n\n  The Report goes on to state that\n\n       Article 4 carries no obligation other than that of \n     consultation. (U.S. Congress. SFRC. North Atlantic Treaty \n     Report, June 6, 1949. Pg. 12)\n\n  In discussing the obligation to consult, the Committee Report states \nthat consultation takes place when a threat ``might involve obligations \nunder the treaty.''\n  It is important what those obligations were. Referring to the \nCommittee report:\n\n       1. To maintain and develop, separately and jointly and by \n     means of continuous and effective self-help and mutual aid, \n     the individual and collective capacity of the parties \nto resist armed attack (art. 3);\n\n       2. To consult whenever, in the opinion of any of the \n     parties, the territorial integrity, political independence, \n     or security of any of them is threatened (art. 4);\n       3. To consider an armed attack upon any of the parties in \n     the North Atlantic area an attack against them all (art. 5); \n     and\n       4. In the event of such an attack, to take forthwith, \n     individually and in concert with the other parties, such \n     action as the United States deems necessary, including the \n     use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of \n     the North Atlantic area (art. 5).\n\n  The obligation to consult is linked to other obligations in the \ntreaty, all of which pertain to some aspect of collective defense. As \nSecretary Acheson said, article 4 was broader in scope than article 5 \nand gave NATO flexibility to respond to out-of-area threats related to \ncollective defense. Almost without fail, article 4 was discussed within \nthe context of responding to aggression less than armed attack--\npolitical aggression by a hostile power.\n  Secretary Acheson himself linked article 4 to NATO's collective \ndefense mission, stating that any action taken after consultation \nshould be ``in the spirit of the treaty'' (Letter transmitting the \ntreaty to the President, April 7, 1949).\n  Floor statements by key Senators in 1949 make the limits of article 4 \nclear. Comments by both Senators Connally and Vandenberg, the Chairman \nand ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee in 1949, reveal \nan understanding of article 4 in the light of NATO's collective defense \nmission.\n  Senator Connally stated in his opening remarks on July 5, 1949 that\n\n       I think that article 4 goes a long way to emphasize that \n     the period of dividing and conquering has come to an end. The \n     consultation provided for in that article addresses itself to \n     the threatening of the territorial integrity, the political \n     independence, or the security of any of the parties. \n     Consultation is not an unnecessary luxury; it is a logical \n     requirement to gain the objectives of the treaty. For one \n     thing, article 4 . . . rightly faces up to the brutal fact \n     that peaceful peoples have become more and more conscious of \n     a sinister kind of danger--indirect aggression. Let us not \n     forget that no bombs were dropped by the Soviet Union on \n     Bulgaria, Hungary, or Czechoslovakia. (Congressional Record, \n     July 5, 1949, Pg. 8814)\n\n  Senator Vandenberg stated in his opening remarks the following day \nthat:\n\n       The question arises whether articles IV and V of the pact \n     cover armed aggression against colonial or dependent or \n     otherwise related areas of the signatories outside the area \n     of the North Atlantic community as geographically defined in \n     article VI. My own understanding is clear and unequivocal. \n     The answer is ``No.'' There can be no other logical answer. \n     The doubts seem to have arisen because article IV, relating \n     solely to consultations, is unlimited in the circumference of \n     these consultations. But there is not a word of obligation in \n     it except to talk things over.'' (Congressional Record, July \n     6, 1949, Pg. 8896)\n\n  Senator Vandenberg again:\n\n       The obligations are spelled out in articles III and V. It \n     is significant, in this connection, that when article IX \n     establishes a council to implement the treaty, it directs the \n     council's attention specifically to articles III and V. It \n     omits article IV in this connection. This is as it should be. \n     It is by significant design. Our pledge of action under the \n     United Nations Charter is general . . . But out pledge of \n     action under the North Atlantic Pact is limited and specific. \n     It applies only to armed aggression in the area clearly \n     defined in article VI which is the North Atlantic community, \n     set up by metes and bounds. (Congressional Record, July 6, \n     1949, Pg. 8896)\n\n  Moving to article 5, the Committee Report identifies Article 5 as the \n``heart of the treaty,'' and goes on to define what constitutes an \narmed attack. The Report states that ``article 5 would come into \noperation only when a nation had committed an international crime by \nlaunching an armed attack against a party to the treaty.'' (U.S. \nCongress. SFRC. North Atlantic Treaty Report, June 6, 1949. Pg. 13)\n  The Committee Report's discussion of article 6 further reinforced the \nterritorial basis of the Treaty, stating that ``Article 6 specifies the \narea within which an armed attack would bring the provisions of article \n5 into operation. Thus, the obligations under article 5 are strictly \nlimited to the area described.'' (U.S. Congress. SFRC. North Atlantic \nTreaty Report, June 6, 1949. Pg. 15)\n  The Foreign Relations Committee obtained a commitment from the \nPresident in 1949 that the Senate would be able to give its advice and \nconsent for new NATO members. New members are important, but new \nmissions are just as critical. The mission of NATO is changing \nradically, and the Senate has not engaged in the debate.\n  After the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO planners scrambled to \nfind new missions for the alliance: countering the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction, advancing the political ``interests'' of \nNATO members, NATO as a police force and crisis manager.\n  The catch-phrase that defined this effort was that NATO must go \n``out-of-area or out of business.'' After the Cold War, NATO began \nevolving into an organization to pursue new missions.\n  The Strategic Concept of 1991 pushed the traditional functions of \nNATO--to provide for collective defense and serve as a strategic \nbalance in Europe--to the bottom of the list of the alliance s \nfundamental security tasks.\n  The security task that rose to the top was for NATO to be ``one of \nthe indispensable foundations for a stable security environment in \nEurope . . . in which no country would be able to intimidate or coerce \nany European nation or to impose hegemony through the threat or use of \nforce.'' (1991 Strategic Concept in NATO Handbook, p. 239)\n  This is an amazing expansion of mission. No longer is collective \ndefense the singular mission of the alliance, but NATO has the \nimpossible task of stopping intimidation and coercion throughout NATO \nand non-NATO Europe alike.\n  In NATO's Strategic Concepts of the past, collective defense was \nparamount.\n  The State Department has provided my office with the three NATO \nStrategic Concepts that preceded the 1991 version: the Strategic \nConcepts of 1950 (with a revised version in 1952), 1957, and 1967.\n  The contrast between the first three Strategic Concepts and the 1991 \nversion is striking. The mission of collective defense permeates the \nfirst three Strategic Concepts. Collective defense is carefully defined \nas the North Atlantic area described in article 6 of the Treaty. When \npotential out of area security developments are discussed, they are \nmentioned in the context of NATO members having the capacity to \nmaintain their commitments to NATO while individually addressing the \nout of area threats that may affect their interests.\n  NATO's Strategic Concept of 1957 explicitly states that ``NATO \ndefense planning is limited to the defense of the Treaty area. . .'' \nand that ``NATO military authorities have no responsibilities or \nauthority except with respect to incidents which are covered by \nArticles 5 and 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty'' (1957 Strategic Concept \nof NATO, p. 12).\n  Throughout NATO's Strategic Concepts, the means of collective defense \nchanged, from ``massive retaliation'' in the 1950's to ``forward \ndefense and flexible response'' in the 1960's, but the mission itself \nremained the same.\n  NATO has an uncertain course for the future, however. The New \nStrategic Concept of 1991 presented the first significant shift in NATO \naway from its traditional military mission. The Strategic Concept says \nthat the ``. . . clear preparedness to act collectively in the common \ndefense remains central to the Alliance's security objectives.'' The \nreliability of this assertion is belied by NATO s activity since 1991, \nhowever.\n  Stan Sloan, one of the senior NATO analysts at CRS, states that since \nthe formation of the New Strategic Concept in 1991, ``. . . most of \nNATO's military activities have been focused on `non-Article 5' \nrequirements, most significantly in Bosnia.'' (Stanley Sloan. NATO's \nEvolving Role & Missions. CRS\n\n[[Page S7896]]\n\nrpt.97-708F. Mar. 4, 1998, Pg. 4) No longer is collective defense the \nsingular mission of the alliance, but NATO is committing to the \nimpossible task of stopping intimidation and coercion throughout NATO \nand non-NATO Europe alike.\n  Nelson Drew writes of this development:\n\n       While the word ``peacekeeping'' did not appear in either \n     the new Strategic Concept or the Rome Declaration, it was \n     difficult to envision a means by which NATO or the NACC \n     [North Atlantic Cooperation Council] could make good on their \n     commitment to stability and peace throughout the trans-\n     Atlantic community without consideration of an Alliance role \n     in peacekeeping activities.'' (Nelson Drew. NATO Confronts \n     `Test Case from Hell.' INSS: McNair Paper 35)\n\n  NATO was not created to douse regional brushfires in Europe, Asia, \nand the Middle East. When the deployment of NATO forces was considered, \nit was for collective defense. NATO's institutional development has \nfollowed the alliance's expanded mandate: NATO's goals as a police \nforce and crisis manager have resulted in new institutional capacities. \nNATO has agreed to make its resources available, on a case by case \nbasis, for brushfire operations under the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe, the United Nations, and the European Union (NATO \nHandbook, p. 332-34).\n  In the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, the Partnership for Peace, \nand the Combined Joint Task Force Concept, NATO has taken many positive \nsteps to promote cooperation with other countries, but also has \nsignaled that international policing actions will be an important part \nof NATO's activity in the future.\n  This institutional transformation signals little strategic thinking. \nNATO signals its intention to be an international police force and \ncrisis manager by its internal transformation. The Administration \nrefuses to establish parameters for how far NATO expansion will \nproceed. Where are the limits on NATO's mission and membership? \nAlliance cohesion is at risk.\n  The Administration views the Partnership for Peace as the ``path to \n[NATO] membership for countries wanting to join'' (U.S. Security \nStrategy for Europe and NATO, DOD, June, 1995). NATO makes brushfire \ntroubleshooting an important part of the PFP and the Euro-Atlantic \nPartnership Council (EAPC). The Administration launches the Combined \nJoint Task Force (CJTF) concept to make it easier for NATO to engage in \ncrisis management.\n  The question must be asked as to how far NATO will expand its mission \nand membership. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was quoted in the \nWashington Post as saying that NATO should become a ``force for peace \nfrom the Middle East to Central Africa'' (Washington Post, Feb. 22, \n1998). President Clinton, in his recent trip to Africa, spoke of the \nneed for some type of ``multi-national force'' for responding to \nAfrican crises (White House Bulletin, March 27, 1998). Is this really \nthe kind of mission the Administration wants NATO to have?\n  Other countries take NATO signals seriously. For example, allow me to \nquote from the latest issue of Defense News: ``Kosovo Fray Forces NATO \ns Hand.'' ``The violent uprising in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo may \nforce NATO to extend its military influence across the Balkan region. . \n.'' (Defense News, March 22, 1998). A U.S. official quoted in the \narticle said ```Macedonia is a Partnership for Peace country \npotentially in trouble from external sources. It needs help. It is not \nout of the realm of possibility . . . that a NATO-led mission in \ncooperation with PFP countries could take over when the UN deployment \nwithdraws on August 31.''\n  On March 11, Albania called the first emergency consultation within \nthe framework of the PFP. NATO diplomats responded with a plan for ``a \nrobust Partnership for Peace program for rapid implementation in \nAlbania.'' (Defense News, March 22, 1998). This PFP program reportedly \nwill include military training and steps to secure Albania s northern \nborder.\n  If we want to send American soldiers into these cauldrons of ethnic \nunrest, then let's have that debate. Nothing in this amendment would \npreclude the U.S. from deploying its forces anywhere. This amendment \nhas to do with preserving the integrity of NATO. Just don't use the \nbanner of a successful military alliance to entangle U.S. troops in \nEurope's brushfires.\n  Comments by both former and present senior Administration officials \nindicate a radical shift in the scope of NATO. Former Secretary of \nDefense William Perry and former Secretary of State Warren Christopher \nstated in a New York Times editorial: ``Shifting the alliance s \nemphasis from defense of members territory to defense of common \ninterests is the strategic imperative'' (New York Times, Oct. 21, \n1997).\n  Secretary of State Albright has confirmed NATO's shift to defense of \ninterests. I questioned her on two separate occasions before the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee. Secretary Albright confirmed that \nadvancing out-of-area interests would be the modus operandi for NATO, \nbut gave no realistic limits. In other forums, Secretary Albright has \nbeen quoted as saying that NATO should evolve into ``a force for peace \nfrom the Middle East to Central Africa'' (WP, William Drozdiak. Feb. \n22, 1998). Strobe Talbott, one of the senior officials at the State \nDepartment, stated that geopolitical and military considerations can be \nput aside and ``other nonmilitary goals shape the new NATO\" (Jesse \nHelms, Wall Street Journal, March 23, 1998). Talbott reportedly looks \nfavorably on Russia joining NATO.\n  Inconsistency in the Administration's policies is creating more \nconfusion in the alliance, however, and hurting U.S. leadership in \nNATO. Take, for example, Administration policy to combat the spread of \nweapons of mass destruction. The U.S. almost goes to war against Iraq \nin February over the threat of WMD. The U.S. maintains a sizeable force \nin the Persian Gulf to deter Iraqi aggression. Secretary of State \nMadeleine Albright states that fighting WMD should become the new \n``unifying threat\" that binds NATO allies together (Washington Post, \nFeb. 22, 1998).\n  The Administration's actions speak louder than words, however. In \nspite of the rhetoric and the object lesson of Saddam Hussein, the \nClinton Administration has entered into nuclear cooperation with China, \nthe world's worst proliferator of weapons of mass \ndestruction technology (CIA report, June 1997). The President refused \nto halt nuclear cooperation even as China was caught trying to send \nIran hundreds of tons of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride.\n\n  This material is used to enrich uranium to weapons grade and was \nbeing sent to Iran's Isfahan Nuclear Research Center--the principal \nIranian site to manufacture the explosive core of an atomic device \n(Washington Post, March 13, 1998). Clinton allows sensitive missile \ntechnology to be exported to China, undermining a Justice Department \ninvestigation of similar possible transfers by Loral Space and Hughes \nElectronics (New York Times, April 4, 1998).\n  The missile technology possibly transferred by Loral and Hughes could \nbe used on Chinese nuclear ICBM's (Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles) \nto reach the United States. Just so happens that Bernard Schwartz, CEO \nof Loral, is the DNC's largest personal contributor.\n  With policies like that, U.S. has no credibility in tasking NATO with \nnew mission to fight the proliferation of WMD.\n  European comments on NATO's future mission are just as troubling. \nPresident Chirac, at the NATO/Russia Founding Act, stated: ``NATO, \ninitially conceived to face a clear-cut and massive threat, is now a \nlighter, more flexible organization adapted to its new crisis \nmanagement and peacekeeping missions.''\n  In a telling statement about the current evolution of the alliance, \nNATO Secretary General Javier Solana stated ``NATO was born when Europe \nwas divided, and now it has become a leading instrument in the \nreconstruction of the continent. This is an incredibly dynamic process. \nIf this pace continues, it is hard to predict what NATO will be like \njust three years from now.'' (Washington Post, July 6, 1997)\n  Crisis management and brushfire engagements are the kinds of missions \nand the kinds of problems NATO was never intended to address. As Mark \nEsper writes in the Washington Times: ``NATO was designed for \ncollective defense of its member states, not for suppressing civil wars \nin peacekeeping\n\n[[Page S7897]]\n\nmissions that jeopardize the alliance's core purpose.'' (Washington \nTimes, Feb. 15, 1998)\n  From the defense of territory to the defense of ``common interests'' \nis a quantum leap. Charging NATO to defend nebulously defined interests \nwould have been unacceptable to the Senate in 1949 and it should be \nunacceptable for the Senate today.\n  Resting on fifty years of NATO's success is not the way to ensure \nthat U.S. interests are preserved and NATO remains a viable alliance in \nthe future. ``Just trust us'' is essentially what the Administration is \nsaying, as they transform NATO into a mini-United Nations with a \nstanding army for ill-defined brushfire operations.\n  Beware the Administration strong on NATO expansion but weak on \ndefense. The U.S. is making a collective defense commitment to new NATO \nmembers while slashing defense. Those countries comprise 301,000 square \nmiles of new territory and 2,612 miles of new NATO frontier to which \nthe collective defense commitment is extended.\n  Here are some of the statistics for U.S. defense cuts (in real 1999 \ndollars) between 1990 and 1998:\n  Military Personnel funding: fell by 28% (from $102 bn in 1990 to \n$71.7 bn in 1998);\n  Procurement: fell by 53% (from $98 bn in 1990 to $45.5 bn in 1998); \nTotal National Defense Spending: fell by 27% over last eight years \n(from $375 bn in 1990 to $273 bn in 1998);\n  Army divisions reduced from 26 in 1991 to 18 in 1998;\n  Active Air Force tactical wings reduced from 35 in 1991 to 20 in \n1998.\n  The Clinton Administration is finding more things to do with a \ndownsized force. Outside normal training and alliance commitments, the \nArmy conducted 10 ``operational events'' between 1960-91 and 26 since \n1991. The Marine Corps conducted 15 ``contingency operations'' between \n1982-89 and 62 since the fall of the Berlin Wall. According to the Army \nChief of Staff Dennis Reimer, the Army reduced manpower by 36% while \nincreasing the number of deployed operations by 300% (CRS).\n  Officers from deployable Army units now spend 180-190 days away from \nhome annually. Shortly after announcing that U.S. troops would stay in \nBosnia indefinitely, Clinton increased funding by 20% to expand U.S. \ninfluence overseas--not funding for military personnel, though, but \nmoney for the Peace Corps (National Review, Feb. 9, 1998). President \nReagan's deputy undersecretary of defense, Dov Zakheim states: ``. . \n.like Gulliver's enfeeblement by the Lilliputians, [the U.S.] will be \ntied down in so many parts of the world for so long that it will be \nhard-pressed to respond to major threats against which only \noverwhelming force would prove effective'' (Defense News, April 12, \n1998).\n  Over-extension is hurting readiness. Misguided deployments harm \nreadiness, inhibit weapons modernization, and undermine morale. The \nArmy just completed its worst recruiting year since 1979. Just one \nthird of the Army's women and just over half of the men believe that to \nfight and win in combat is the Army's principal mission (National \nReview, Feb. 9, 1998).\n  The ``two major regional conflict'' strategy of this Administration \nis becoming increasingly unrealistic. The U.S. would be hard pressed to \neven replicate the Desert Storm operation.\n  Hillen writes in the National Review: ``In 1998, almost all the \nactive Army's heavy-tank and armored-cavalry units outside of Korea and \nBosnia would have to go to the Persian Gulf in order to equal the \nfighting power of America's VII Corps in 1991. And VII Corps was only \none of three American corps engaged in Desert Storm'' (National Review, \nFeb. 9, 1998).\n  Inconsistent foreign policy is the root of the problem. Effective and \ncredible diplomacy addresses potential crises before the deployment of \nU.S. troops is needed. This Administration's foreign policy \ninconsistency is almost reflexively compensated by the deployment of \nAmerican armed forces. The National Defense Panel created by Congress \nin 1996 said of the Administration: ``. . .the current approach to \naddressing national security engages the Department of Defense and \nservices too often and too quickly in situations that should have been \nresolved by nonmilitary means'' (Defense News, April 12, 1998).\n  The Saddam Hussein's of the world that threaten the U.S. need to be \ndealt with, but the complacent policy of this Administration over the \nlast six years has left U.S. troops dangling in the Persian Gulf. Our \ntroops serving in Southwest Asia and Bosnia deserve better leadership \nfrom this Administration.\n  The Administration's ``assertive multilateralism is a fig leaf for \nlack of leadership. This Administration has an instinct to strike for \nthe capillaries, to use the phrase of Jonathan Clarke. Policy drift \nwith no finality in addressing national security threats, coupled with \nthe brush fire mentality of this Administration, is squandering U.S. \nnational defense resources.\n  The Administration wants to apply its foreign policy muddle to NATO, \nto hollow out the clear mission of the alliance just as the U.S. \nmilitary is being stretched thin and to use NATO as another tool for a \nglobalist agenda with little application to real U.S. national security \ninterests.\n  When U.S. armed forces are struggling, reliable cost estimates for \nNATO expansion become more important. There have been a wide range of \ncost estimates for NATO expansion. The Administration's initial \nestimate (Feb, 1997) was $27-35 billion, with a U.S. share $100-150 m \nper year for ten years. This initial Administration's estimate, not \nsurprisingly, was revised downward last December: the U.S. now only has \nto pay $40 million per year over ten years.\n  The estimate of Congressional Budget Office (March, 1996) was a bit \ndifferent. Different scenarios ranging from minimal reinforcement of \nfour new members ($60.6 bn total) to NATO stationing a limited number \nof forces forward in new member countries ($124.7 bn total)\n  The wide range of cost estimates is more confusing than helpful, but \none thing is clear: the cost estimates rise precipitously when NATO \ntake steps to provide a limited defense to these new members. The \nSenate should not accept the lowball estimates. We should consider the \nends of our actions in expanding NATO--the real costs of actually \ndefending these countries.\n  If U.S. resources are stretched too thin, will Europe take up the \nslack? Not some of our European NATO allies. NATO allies have agreed \nonly to pay for the cheapest expansion estimate yet: the $1.5 billion \nprice tag from the NATO cost study accepted by the North Atlantic \nCouncil in December, 1997. Beyond the paltry $1.5 bn estimate, French \nPresident Jacques Chirac has stated bluntly that ``France does not \nintend to raise its contribution to NATO because of the cost of \nenlargement'' (Washington Post, July 24, 1998).\n  Not the new NATO members. These countries are still throwing off the \nvestiges of a command economy and don't want to commit the resources to \na full scale modernization effort.\n  Dale Herspring, an expert on the region, writes: ``. . .the East \nEuropeans have done little to prepare themselves to meet NATO's \nmilitary standards. Hungary and the Czech Republic in particular are \ntrying to join NATO `on the cheap'. . .In fact, the military situation \nof all three countries is disastrous. Planes are crashing, morale is \nplummeting, and equipment is outdated. Unless the parliaments of these \ncountries get serious or the West. . .decides to foot the bill, the \nCzech Republic and Hungary will never meet NATO standards.''\n  The U.S. and other NATO allies are riding the bandwagon of \n``extending the borders of freedom in Europe'' and failing to see the \nreconstruction effort these countries face. What if a crisis comes, and \nwe have to defend these countries with limited interoperability and \neven less effective command and control cooperation? The Washington \nPost reported on March 18 that all three countries would struggle to \nfind a few hundred officers who speak English to NATO standards.\n  Mr. President, before I conclude, I would like to respond to several \narguments I have heard during this debate against my amendment. First, \nthere has been a document circulated outlining Secretary of State Dean \nAcheson's comments during a press conference on March 18, 1949.\n  I am familiar with the document. Let me begin by saying that if you \nare basing your argument for a global NATO on a press interview \ntranscribed in the second person, your argument is on\n\n[[Page S7898]]\n\nshaky ground indeed. A careful review of the record of this press \ninterview with Secretary Acheson on March 18, 1949 reveals that his \ncomments did not imply a global NATO beyond the careful scope of the \ntreaty.\n  Acheson states that Article 4 is broader than Article 5, which it is. \nArticle 4 gives NATO the flexibility to respond to threats related to \ncollective defense, but which may not be precipitated by an armed \nattack.\n  When asked if there ``was no provision [in the treaty] which looked \ntoward these Parties acting as a unit in regard to some matter not \ncovered by the Treaty,'' Secretary Acheson, as paraphrased, said, and \nrightly so, that the allies ``might act as a unit or they might not, \nbut that there was nothing in the Treaty which required them to do \nso.'' Secretary Acheson reiterated in this very interview what he had \nsaid in his letter to the President transmitting the NATO treaty: that \nNATO only had authority to deal with matters under the purview of the \ntreaty.\n  This is essentially what I have said all along. The countries that \nmake up NATO can act together on any security matter they desire. But \nNATO itself is designed for a specific mission. When asked if ``there \nwas no provision for anything except consultation, except actual armed \nattack on one of the signatories, the Secretary replied that there were \nArticles one, two, three, and four.''\n  These articles certainly identified some of the political and \neconomic goals of NATO's collective defense mission. After looking at \nthe careful language of articles 5 and 6 of the Treaty, however, it is \npreposterous to argue that NATO can turn itself into a global policeman \nbased on the general language of article 1.\n  When Secretary Acheson says that there is no limiting clause, the \ntranscript seems to indicate he is referring to article 4, which is not \nnecessarily limited by geography. Acheson did not mean that the treaty \nhad no limits. In the letter transmitting the treaty to President \nTruman, Acheson stated flatly that the North Atlantic Council will have \n``. . .no powers other than to consider matters within the purview of \nthe treaty. . .'' (Letter to President Truman transmitting the NATO \ntreaty, April 7, 1949). The articles of the treaty speak for themselves \nand don't imply in the slightest a military mission unrelated to \ncollective defense.\n  Second, some would try to portray a vote on this amendment as a vote \non Bosnia. Let me state clearly that this amendment is not intended to \nbe another vote on the Bosnia mission. The NATO mission in Bosnia is \nrelated to the out of area debate we are having today, but this vote is \nmore about avoiding the Somalia's of NATO's future than rehashing the \ndebate over Bosnia.\n  The amendment I am offering explicitly refers to future NATO military \nmissions. Making this another vote on Bosnia would miss the purpose: to \nkeep NATO on a sound course for the future.\n  One could argue that if you supported the Bosnia mission, you would \nnot offer this amendment. I disagree. You may support Bosnia, but you \nmay support NATO more and recognize the threats a Somalia experience \nposes to NATO. I doubt there is anyone in the Senate who has not grown \nmore concerned with each missed deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. \ntroops from Bosnia.\n  There is nothing in this amendment that stops the U.S., unilaterally \nor with other countries, from engaging in ethnic conflicts like Bosnia. \nIf we want to send our soldiers to the flashpoints of Europe and Asia, \nthen let's have that debate. Don't cloak these missions in the banner \nof a successful military alliance not intended for such purposes. Don't \nentangle the U.S. in the brushfires of Europe, Asia, and Africa through \nNATO.\n  Third, and on a somewhat related note, some would argue this \namendment constrains the President as commander in chief. My amendment \nhas nothing to do with the President's authority as Commander in Chief. \nNothing in this amendment limits the President's ability to deploy U.S. \nforces unilaterally and in concert with other nations to defend the \nUnited States.\n  This amendment has to do with the question of what the President can \ndo through the North Atlantic Treaty. In that treaty, to which the \nSenate gave its advice and consent based on a shared understanding \nborne out by 40 years of alliance practice, the U.S. was making a \nsecurity commitment limited by the mission of collective defense within \na carefully defined geographical area.\n  The Senate should give its advice and consent if NATO is to expand \nits mission.\n  To conclude, these and other issues deserve extensive debate. The \nrisks of an ill-defined NATO are real. The Senate should not allow this \nalliance to shift from collective defense to fitful multilateralism. \nThis Administration is stretching NATO's scope to cover the globe. The \nAshcroft amendment is the right answer to ``Treaty Creep.''\n  The statements and policies of Administration officials belie a \nfailure to grasp the purpose of a military alliance. There is no long-\nterm vision of where the expansion process will stop. The U.S. is \nslashing defense while increasing security obligations abroad. Beware \nthe Administration strong on NATO expansion, but weak on defense.\n  The resistance of Administration officials to define where the \nexpansion of NATO's mission and membership will stop indicates how far \nArticle 5 has diminished in importance. Secretary Albright has stated \nthat ``. . .no European democracy will be excluded because of where it \nsits on the map.'' The Administration's dismissal of the logistical and \nstrategic constraints of war may work for Foggy Bottom. In the real \nworld, real soldiers die in defense of real borders.\n  Treaty creep will cost American lives, harm U.S. interests, and \nundermine NATO. The drift in this Administration's foreign policy is \nthreatening the future of a focused NATO which serves American \ninterests. The Senate should not be complacent with fifty years of NATO \nsuccess. This body has a role to play in the scope of U.S. treaty \ncommitments.\n  Changing NATO into a mini-UN with a standing army is not something \nthe American people will support. We have been lucky in Bosnia. The \nfirst time NATO has a Somalia experience in pursuit of an expanded \nmission, U.S. support for the alliance will be undermined. Voting for \nthe Ashcroft amendment is the best way to be clear about NATO's \nmission--the territorial defense of Western Europe. This amendment is \nthe best way to advance U.S. interests through NATO.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/09/senate-section/article/S7893-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7898-S7899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL MARION CARL\n\nMr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, when General George Marshall was \nasked during World War II if America had a secret weapon, he said, \n``Yes. Our secret weapon is the best darned kids in the world.''\n  This morning, Mr. President, I traveled to Arlington Cemetery to \nattend the funeral service of one of those best darned kids. I speak of \nMajor General Marion Carl, who was acknowledged as one of America's \ngreatest military aviators, and who was tragically murdered in his \nOregon home last week during an attempted robbery.\n  I did not have the privilege of knowing General Carl. But one cannot \nread the words of those who did know him or the summaries of his long \nand courageous service to our country, which included stints as a World \nWar II fighter ace, a military test pilot, and a squadron commander in \nVietnam, without concluding that General Carl was a true American hero.\n  I join with all Oregonians in expressing my condolences to General \nCarl's wife, Edna, and to their two children and grandchildren. I also \nask that an article from the Oregonian summarizing the memorial service \nheld for General Carl in Roseburg be printed in the Record following my \nremarks.\n  More that any words I can offer, this article summarizes the life and \ncareer of a man who will always be remembered for his humility, his \nloyalty, his bravery, and his service to his country.\n  The article follows:\n\n          Mourners Pay Final Respects to Slain Oregon War Hero\n\n                           (By Janet Filips)\n\n       Roseburg.--In a dignified funeral that offered a quiet but \n     stirring mix of the patriotic and the private, grieving \n     family, friends and admirers bid a sad farewell to one of \n     America's greatest pilots Monday morning--a man who lived \n     with an uncommon combination of\n\n[[Page S7899]]\n\n     heroics, humility and humor until he was slain during a \n     bungled burglary June 28.\n       No hourlong funeral can capture the fullness of a long and \n     distinguished life such as that of Maj. Gen. Marion E. Carl, \n     82. But it can give telling glimpses, starting with slides \n     depicting the tall, lean Carl with airplanes and his smiling, \n     handsome family.\n       A Marine Corps brass quintet played ``Ruffles and \n     Flourishes,'' ``Danny Boy'' and the ``Marine Corps Hymn.'' \n     Vocalists movingly sang ``America the Beautiful'' and ``A \n     Wing and a Prayer.'' A pair of white-gloved Marines in dress \n     blue uniforms guarded the flag-draped casket, spotlighted on \n     the shadowed stage.\n       In it, the fallen general wore the same style of dress \n     blues, with ribbons discreetly signifying his medals. And \n     in the pocket over his heart, his wife, Edna Carl, had \n     tucked his favorite photos of her, their two children and \n     two grandchildren.\n       Most revealing of all, longtime military buddies spoke of \n     the incomparable Marion Carl before a diverse crowd of about \n     750 who came to Umpqua Community College's Jacoby Auditorium \n     to pay their final respects to Carl, a native Oregonian drawn \n     to studying aircraft and pushing boundaries on behalf of his \n     country in wartime and peace.\n       ``Marion was a real hero. I'm not talking about purple-\n     haired ballplayers,'' said eulogist Joseph R. Rees, a friend \n     of Carl for 53 years. ``He set a benchmark for youth, for all \n     of us.''\n       Despite a career of record-setting accomplishments, said \n     Rees, humility was Carl's byword, integrity his daily \n     password and loyalty the way of his friendship. Carl had the \n     attributes people hope to find in their sons and daughters \n     and political leaders, said Rees, who turns 76 today.\n       Carl could rapidly assess situations, then take decisive \n     action without being hobbled by politics or fear.\n       Those traits are not to be mistaken for recklessness, added \n     Ress, who lives about seven miles up North Bank Road from the \n     Carl home.\n       ``Marion knew where fear belonged,'' Rees said. ``He just \n     didn't let it get in the way when he knew something had to be \n     done. Now, we saw that, just a few nights ago.''\n       A week ago, Carl, who was in the middle stages of \n     Alzheimer's had been awakened by shouting in his living room \n     and stumbled into the middle of a burglary. He was fatally \n     shot after lunging at a young man who had just fired a short \n     at his wife. Sunday afternoon, the suspected killer was \n     apprehended in Pasadena, Calif.\n       A second eulogist, Brigadier Gen. Joseph H. Foss, is a \n     Congressional Medal of Honor holder and the Marine's top ace \n     of all time, and 26 enemy planes to his credit. But Foss, 83, \n     of Scottsdale, Ariz., lauded Carl as the top aviator.\n       Foss recalled his first ride, as a cadet in 1940, with Carl \n     as an instructor in Pensacola, Florida. ``He did everything \n     with that airplane that an airplane could possibly do for \n     1\\1/2\\ hours. I was green,'' Foss said. ``From that day on, I \n     respected him as the No. 1 pilot in the World. If young folks \n     would set their eyes on people like that, we wouldn't have \n     punks like the one who ended his life.''\n       Amid occasional sobs and sniffle from the mourners, Foss \n     drew applause when he blasted current school studies of \n     history that replace the study of pivotal American battles \n     with ``a dumb thing called political correctness.''\n       Col. Hap Langstaff, 77, of Sacramento, described Carl's \n     ``astounding'' knowledge of aircraft, his uncanny ability to \n     track animals in the wild and his willingness to bend the \n     rules to sneak in hunting trips in Eastern Oregon while \n     stationed in Washington, D.C., in 1959. He shared stories of \n     climbing into a T-28 aircraft on Fridays after work, \n     flying all night to Mitchell, buzzing a narrow dirt road \n     to clear the cattle off, then landing on a ranch.\n       ``We always got deer,'' Langstaff said, ``Back in \n     Washington, D.C., Marion had difficulty explaining how cow \n     manure got on the landing gear.''\n       After the laughter, Langstaff's voice broke as he said, \n     with a salute: ``I'm going to miss you, Marion.''\n       At the service's end, the crowd stepped outside for a \n     stirring farewell: The sharp rat-a-tat of a 21-gun salute, \n     taps played by two buglers, and a fly-by--against warm blue \n     skies--of a pair of vintage planes from the Tillamook Air \n     Museum: the F4U Corsair and the F4F Wildcat.\n       The funeral drew top military men and former co-workers \n     from around the country, including one of Carl's former aides \n     in Vietnam.\n       ``I'm so damn angry, and I'm sad, but I'm so grateful for \n     all the time we spent together,'' said Lyle Prouse, 59, now a \n     pilot for Northwest Airlines and an Atlanta resident. ``He \n     was not a typical general. We were always out there in the \n     middle of things. He stepped in and did whatever needed to be \n     done, no matter the consequences.''\n       Prouse and his wife rearranged their schedules to be at the \n     funeral, he said, ``just because I loved him so much.''\n       Whenever Maj. Gen. Ken Houghton of La Jolla, Calif., hears \n     the famed saying from Iwo Jima, ``Uncommon valor is a common \n     virtue,'' he is reminded of Carl. ``This,'' he said, \n     ``epitomizes Gen. Carl.''\n       After a gathering at the Roseburg Country Club, Carl's \n     casket was escorted to the Eugene Airport later Monday \n     afternoon, where it was flown to Washington, DC, for \n     internment Thursday, with full military honors, in Arlington \n     National Cemetery in Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/09/senate-section/article/S7898-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF HEIDELBERG COLLEGE\n\n Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and \ncongratulate Heidelberg College in Tiffin, Ohio, as it celebrates the \n40th Anniversary of its educational exchange program with Heidelberg \nUniversity of Heidelberg, Germany. The program between the two schools \nis the longest standing exchange program between an American and a \nGerman university in the post-World War II period.\n  When Heidelberg College was founded in 1850 by members of the German \nReformed Church, it was named after the Heidelberg Catechism which was \nwritten at Heidelberg University in 1563. In 1958, cooperative \nrelations were established between Heidelberg College and Heidelberg \nUniversity and a student exchange program, the American Junior Year at \nHeidelberg University, was initiated. In 1973, the exchange became \nreciprocal with German students also studying at Heidelberg College. \nOver the course of the 40 years of cooperation, more than 1,400 German \nand American students have been able to participate in an academic \nexchange under the auspices of the Junior Year program.\n  Heidelberg College has a rich tradition of global education dating \nfrom the second half of the 19th century when missionaries were trained \nfor service in Japan. Over the past two years, the College has \nrevitalized its commitment to global education through the \nestablishment of the Heidelberg College Center for Global Education. \nThe Center for Global Education is the cornerstone of Heidelberg's \neffort to place an international focus on its curriculum, its majors, \nand its programs. Through its Advisory Council for Global Education, \ncomposed of local, regional, national, and international leaders, a \nnumber of priorities and future directions for global education at \nHeidelberg College have been identified in order to make it a \nworthwhile initiative that will influence the lives of thousands of \nyoung people for years to come.\n  I have been a long-standing advocate of increased exposure to global \neducation for American students of all ages. I believe that it is \nfundamental for American students to have the opportunities to \nexperience different cultures, languages, and individuals in order to \ncompete in a world which is increasingly interdependent. I extend my \nbest wishes to Heidelberg College for continued success in providing \nstudents from Ohio, and around the world, access to quality global \neducation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/09/senate-section/article/S7899-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7899-S7913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CORRECTION TO THE RECORD\n\n  An error occurred in the printing of Daschle amendment No. 3063 in \nthe Record of July 7, 1998.

coverage is undergoing a course of treatment from the \n     provider at the time of such termination, the plan or issuer \n     shall--\n       (A) notify the individual on a timely basis of such \n

coverage between a group health plan and a health \n     insurance issuer is terminated and, as a result of such \n     termination, coverage of services of a health care provider \n     is terminated with respect to an individual, the provisions \n     of paragraph (1) (and the succeeding provisions of this \n     section) shall apply under the plan in the same manner as if \n     there had been a contract between the plan and the provider \n     that had been terminated, but only with respect to benefits \n     that are covered under the plan after the contract \n     termination.\n       (3)

under this subsection with respect to \n     provider's treatment of the pregnancy shall extend through \n     the provision of post-partum care directly related to the \n     delivery.\n       (4) Terminal illness.--If--\n       (A) a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee was determined \n     to be terminally ill (as determined under section \n     1861(dd)(3)(A) of the Social Security Act) at the time of a \n     provider's termination of participation, and\n       (B) the provider was treating the terminal illness before \n     the date of termination,\n     the transitional period under

rates applicable prior to the start of the \n     transitional period as payment in full (or, in the case \n     described in subsection (a)(2), at the rates applicable under \n     the replacement plan or issuer after the date of the \n     termination of the contract with the health insurance issuer) \n     and not to impose cost-sharing with respect to the individual \n     in an amount that would exceed the cost-sharing that could \n     have been imposed if the contract referred to in subsection \n     (a)(1) had not been terminated.\n       (2) The provider agrees to adhere to the quality assurance \n     standards of the plan or issuer responsible for payment under \n     paragraph (1) and to provide to such plan or issuer necessary \n     medical information related to the care provided.\n       (3) The provider agrees otherwise to adhere to such plan's \n     or issuer's policies and procedures, including procedures \n     regarding referrals and obtaining prior authorization and \n     providing services pursuant to a treatment plan (if any) \n     approved by the plan or issuer.\n       (d) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to require the coverage of benefits which would not \n     have been covered if the provider involved remained a \n     participating provider.\n\n     SEC. __106.
