Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of the Bumpers amendment No. 2228 on which there \nshall be 30 minutes of debate equally divided. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Colleagues, not long ago we debated what we called unfunded mandates \nto the cities and States of the country. A lot of tears were shed on \nthis floor, because we said we were imposing all sorts of obligations \non the cities and the counties and the States and making them pick up \nthe tab for it. I am here this morning to tell you about the biggest \nunfunded mandate of all.\n  In 1975, the Congress--this body, along with the House--passed what \nis called the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA, and we \nsaid in 1975 in the legislation that we wanted disabled children taken \ncare of and that we would pay 40 percent of the cost. Twenty-three \nyears later we are paying 9 percent of the cost.\n  The schools of this Nation have been literally bankrupting themselves \nto make up the difference. You are talking about billions of dollars \nthat the United States made a solemn obligation to pay and has reneged \non.\n  Having said that, let me tell you about the most unwarranted tax \nloophole in the Nation, and it is called a depletion allowance. It goes \nto the oil companies. It goes to natural gas companies. It goes to coal \ncompanies. And it goes to people in the mining industry who hardly paid \na red cent for the gold, silver, platinum, palladium, zinc, copper--you \nname it--that they take off Federal lands.\n  I stood here on this floor--this is about the 8th or 9th year--and \neverybody knows the arguments. Everybody knows that it is the biggest \nripoff going on in America today. And you talk about--you talk about--\ndoing away with the Internal Revenue Code and betting on the come that \nsomehow or other we will get a new revenue code before this one \nexpires--listen to this.\n  You go down to the Gulf of Mexico and you bid $1 billion to drill for \noil and gas in the Gulf of Mexico, and you are entitled to a depletion. \nYou ought to get a depletion allowance. And how much is it? Oh, it is \nabout--well, I do not have it here. I think it is 15 percent. Fifteen \npercent they get for a depletion allowance because they paid $1 billion \nfor it. And everybody--the coal companies--we let coal competitively. \nWe let our oil and gas leases competitively. But for some reason or \nother we give away all the gold and silver and platinum and palladium \nand other hard-rock minerals we have.\n  So what else do we do? We not only give them away, we pay them to \ntake it. How do we do that? Here it is. Let us assume that Stillwater \nMining Company in Montana, for example, which says there is $35 billion \nworth of platinum and palladium under a 2,000 acre tract, they intend \nto mine it and they intend to pay the Government roughly $10,000 for \nit--$10,000 for $35 billion worth of minerals that belong to the \ntaxpayers.\n  Oh, the poor taxpayers. How we lament their plight in this body. \nExcept when it comes to hard-rock mining. And then you know what the \ntaxpayers get? They get nothing. You know what they pay? They buy this \nland for $2.50 an acre. Stillwater will pay about $10,000 for $35 \nbillion. That is what they are going to pay for it. And here is what \nthey pay the Federal Government. That is what they pay the taxpayers in \nroyalties--zip, zero, zilch. Not a red cent.\n  What else do they get? They get a depletion allowance of 15 percent \non gold. They get a depletion allowance on silver of 15 percent. They \nget a depletion allowance on platinum of 22 percent and on palladium of \n22 percent.\n  That is right. The American taxpayer--the American taxpayer--is the \nbig sucker in this whole thing. Here is an opportunity to fulfill an \nunfunded mandate and remove one of the most scandalous loopholes on the \ntax books of this Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  How much time does the Senator from New Hampshire desire?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GREGG. If I could have that.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yielded myself 5 minutes and nobody interrupted me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If I could explain, we started late. The order \nwas for the vote to actually occur at 9 o'clock, so we had a total of \n25 minutes to divide instead of 30.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I had asked unanimous consent that we be given 30 \nminutes, but the Chair said in the opening this amendment would be 30 \nminutes, equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I ask unanimous consent that 30 minutes be provided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Arkansas.\n  First, the underlying purpose of the amendment is legitimate. The \nfact is that these companies buy this opportunity to go on to Federal \nland at basically zero dollars. They make millions, billions of dollars \nover the years off of this land. They pay no depletion. They pay no \ntaxes. They get a depletion allowance that gives them a tax deduction \neven though they didn't have to pay anything for the land to begin \nwith, which makes absolutely no sense. The depletion allowance is the \nconcept that you are using up an asset which you paid something for. \nThey didn't pay anything for the land, so why should they get a \ndepletion allowance?\n  The Senator's amendment on the facts on substance is correct. More \nimportantly, the Senator's amendment is taking this totally \ninappropriate deduction and applying the revenues which would occur by \neliminating it to something which is totally appropriate, and that is \nspecial education.\n\n[[Page S3026]]\n\n We all know that this administration has, regrettably, underfunded \nspecial education in its budget. We have attempted to correct that in \nthe Republican budget, but we haven't gotten as far as we need to go. \nThus this opportunity to put an additional revenue stream into special \neducation is extraordinarily important. It means that kids who are in \nthe special needs program, who are today being pushed into a position \nwith other kids who are not in special needs programs over a \nconfrontation of resources, will be put in less of a situation which is \ndetrimental to them.\n  The Federal Government committed to pay 40 percent of the costs of \nthe special needs child. As a result of Republican initiatives, we have \ngotten from a 6 percent level to a 9.5 percent level, but we are still \nwell short of the 40 percent commitment. This amendment by the Senator \nfrom Arkansas will help us move another step toward that 40 percent \ncommitment. It will help relieve local taxpayers who are paying the \nFederal share of the tax burden of supporting special needs children \nfrom having to pay the difference between 9.5 percent and 40 percent, \nor some part of that.\n  So, essentially, the proposal of the Senator from Arkansas is right \non two counts. First, it is right on the concept of eliminating the \ndepletion allowance because there is absolutely no justification for a \ndepletion allowance where people pay essentially nothing for the lands \nthey are mining and the land is owned by the public. Secondly, it is \nright because it will help special needs children and it will start to \nfulfill or assist in fulfilling the obligation of the Federal \nGovernment to fund the 40 percent share which we said we would fund \nwhen we started this program.\n\n  It is a good amendment. I strongly support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we have five Senators who will split \ntime, 3 minutes each. We will not use all of our time, but we will \nstart with Senator Craig, 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me say first to the Senators from \nArkansas and New Hampshire, this has to be one of the most gratuitous \ntaxes on the mining industry you have yet come up with.\n  Let me be blunt, let me be honest: Every citizen benefits from the \nwealth of the products that flow from mining, and certainly disabled \nAmericans have benefited considerably from light metal technology and \nadvanced computer technology that depends on our mining industry. It \nhas made them mobile. It has made them active. It has changed their \nlives.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire knows better than to say that mining \nindustries don't pay taxes. They are in the 32 percent bracket on the \nprofits of those industries. Everyone knows that, and that kind of \nstatement ought to be taken from the record because it simply is not \ntrue.\n  What is true is that the mining industry is characterized by \nrelatively rare, commercially valuable metal deposits and mineral \ndeposits. There is high economic risk, geologic unknowns, high capital \nrequirements, and long lead times for the development of the mining \ncompanies. We know that, and that is why this Congress years ago \nprovided that depletion allowance, because mining industries invest so \nmuch upfront for a resource that is rapidly depleting as they mine it \nout.\n  It recognizes, by this action and by what Congress has already done, \nunique natural mineral extraction provides for this country the \nvaluable base for our industrial-based economy. It is difficult to \nreplace minerals. Much of the money must be used for exploration and \ndevelopment, millions and millions of dollars upfront, like no other \nindustry that we have seen, only to play in a market that is oftentimes \ndramatic, in a world market with changing values, and as a result there \nare dramatic losses and, yes, dramatic profits. But the one thing that \nis clear and constant across it is a recognition of the constant use or \nthe depletion of the resource that they have discovered.\n  I am disappointed that the Senator from Arkansas would try to offset \nthis against disabled people. It just simply doesn't make sense. This \nCongress has been tremendously responsive to disabled people--the \nSenator from Arkansas has, the Senator from Idaho and New Hampshire and \nall of us--and now to play this kind of gratuitous game simply doesn't \nmake a lot of sense.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield to the Senator from Nevada, Senator Bryan.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I will correct some misimpressions that may \nhave been unintentionally offered here on the floor of the Senate. I \nthink it is helpful to put this in some context.\n\n  This proposal, which has been offered by the Senator from Arkansas on \nprevious occasions, was in my idea never a good idea, but now the \ntiming could not be worse because the status of at least one aspect of \nthat industry, the gold industry in my State, is facing some very \ncritical times. The international price of gold on the markets of the \nworld has dropped precipitously, substantially below $300 an ounce. The \nbreak-even cost in the gold industry is approximately $296, so in my \nown State of Nevada, which leads the Nation and is one of the largest \ngold-producing areas in the entire world, we have had just in the last \nyear more than 2,000 layoffs and a substantial number of mines that \nhave closed, and the spot price of gold has been as low as $283 an \nounce. So this is a very, very difficult time for this industry.\n  The proposal offered by the Senator from Arkansas would, indeed, have \na catastrophic impact upon the industry, and it would have a serious \nimpact upon thousands of people in my own State. About 120,000 people \nin America work directly in the hardrock mining industry. In the State \nof Nevada, more than 15,000 have been employed at the high-level mark \nbefore these layoffs occurred. These are good-paying jobs. We talk a \nlot in America about good jobs that provide a full range of benefits, \nan adequate salary base to provide a decent living standard for \nAmerica's workers. The average wage for mining in my State is nearly \n$49,000 a year. That is higher by far than any other industry.\n  Finally, let me conclude by saying that the impression given that \nsomehow the mining industry gets a free ride, doesn't have to pay any \ntaxes, could not be further from the truth. The Natural Mining \nAssociation last year estimates that over $600 million in Federal taxes \nwas paid. According to a recent GAO report, the average tax rate for \nthe mining industry from 1987 to 1992 was 35 percent. That is compared \nwith other industries: the auto industry, 23 percent; chemical \nindustry, 19 percent; 33 percent for the transportation industry. In my \nown State, the gold industry paid more than $141 million in State and \nlocal taxes in 1995, including $32.7 million in property taxes.\n  I note my time has expired. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President I am very pleased to join with my friend, \nthe Senator from Arkansas, and my friend, the Senator from New \nHampshire, in offering an amendment that enables States to comply with \nthe IDEA Program Act.\n  Mr. President, I promised to hold a town meeting or listening session \nin each of Wisconsin's 62 counties each year of my first term as a \nSenator. At these meetings I very frequently hear from both parents and \nschool officials talking about the merits of the IDEA program. They \nstruggle to meet the high costs of disabled education and need \nadditional Federal funding for the program. Of course, this amendment, \nas good as it is, will by no means meet all of these needs. However, it \nwill finally provide some deserved relief for this deserving \nconstituency.\n  The funds our amendment provides for the IDEA program are derived, as \nthe Senator from Arkansas has indicated, from the elimination of the \npercentage depletion allowances tax deduction for companies mining on \nU.S. public lands. What this does is simply close an outdated subsidy \nthat contributes to environmental degradation. We can assist States \nproviding for our Nation's disabled youth by using some of these funds \nthat are going for tax loopholes.\n\n[[Page S3027]]\n\n  Mining companies have a special percentage depletion tax deduction \nthat they can take which other companies can't receive. Under \npercentage depletion, the deduction for recovery of a company's \ninvestment is a fixed percentage of ``gross income''; namely, sales \nrevenue from the sale of the mineral. This percentage is specifically \ndefined in the Tax Code, and under this method total deductions may \nexceed the capital that the company actually invested.\n  The rates for percentage depletion are quite significant. Section 613 \nof the U.S. Tax Code contains depletion allowances for more than 70 \nmetals and minerals at rates ranging from 10 to 22 percent.\n  In today's budget climate, we are faced with the question of who \nshould bear the costs of exploration, development and production of \nnatural resources. The question is, should it be all taxpayers or the \nusers and producers of the resource?\n  Given that we face significant constraints in funding other budget \npriorities such as the IDEA program, these subsidies are really nothing \nmore than a tax expenditure that shifts a greater tax burden to other \ntaxpayers to pay for the IDEA program to compensate for the special tax \nbreaks provided to the mining industry.\n  I am delighted to join with the other Senators in this very \nappropriate shifting of our priorities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 3 minutes to Senator Reid of Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, schools are helped every day by mining. \nMining pays taxes that provide all types of things for education. It \ntakes millions and millions of dollars to find the minerals that are \nhidden in the ground. You don't just walk out and say, here, I am going \nto dig a gold mine or find copper here. It takes millions to find these \nminerals.\n  The United States is a net exporter of gold. It was only 10 or 12 \nyears ago we were here on the Senate floor and throughout the country \ntelling people we need to do things so that we can become a net \nexporter, especially of minerals. At that time we were depending on \nSouth Africa, which was in deep trouble in the world, and the former \nSoviet Union. We are now an exporter of many of the minerals we weren't \njust a few years ago. That is good.\n  I want to show you some recent Nevada newspaper headlines, many from \nthe same day. ``Getchell loses $29.4 million in '94.'' ``Echo Bay Mines \nloses $240 million in 1997.'' ``Placer Dome loses $249 million in \n1997.'' ``Meridian Gold loses $69.2 million in 1997,'' a small company. \nIt is very, very difficult. ``Vista Gold to lay off 135 workers.'' \nSmall company, big layoffs. ``Newmont lays off 155 at Carlin, 460 \ntotal.'' ``Layoffs Reach Beyond the Mining Industry.''\n  Mr. President, it is not only Nevada experiencing these headlines. \nYesterday, in the paper--I wish it were an April Fools' joke; it \nisn't--``487 Arizonans Lose Their Jobs as Copper Prices Fall.'' The \nUnited States mineral industry is suffering significantly and when the \nminerals industry suffers so does the rest of the economy.\n  Here is from one newspaper's AP story. ``And the ripple effect of \nlayoffs at Newmont Gold has spread to Carlin. Even some of the service \nindustries are starting layoffs at this time.''\n  Another newspaper article. ``Homestake Mining Reports '97 Loss of \n$168.9 million. Homestake laid off its nearly 900 strong work force \nwhile restructuring is under way and still isn't saying how many of \nthose will be rehired according to spokesperson Steeves.''\n  The minerals industry is suffering significantly. They are doing \ntheir best to hang on to maintain employment. The best paying blue-\ncollar jobs in the entire Western United States are mining jobs. \nThousands of people are being laid off. Gold prices are at an 18-year \nlow. And now we are being told that they are pigs, that they are using \nall of these tax benefits. The fact is thousands of people have good \njobs because of mining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if Senator Bumpers might not object to a \nrequest that we each have 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Not at all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I pose that question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would Senator Thomas like to speak for 1 minute?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Yes. I thank the Senator very much.\n  I simply want to join my friends in opposition to this amendment, for \ntwo reasons. One is that the basic facts that we set out here are not \nvalid. More importantly, this is not the place to do that. We have been \ndealing with things like mining reform, and we ought to do that and we \ncan do that. Unfortunately, to some here it is either their way or the \nhighway, so it never happens. But this is not the place. I rise in \nopposition to this amendment.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 3 minutes to the chairman of the Energy \nCommittee, Senator Murkowski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, let's be sure we understand each other. The budget \nresolution before us already provides a $2.5 billion increase for the \nIDEA program, that is, individuals with disabilities, and it does so \nwithout raising taxes and creating a new entitlement program. The \nSenator from Arkansas is aware of that. When you strip away all the \nrhetoric, the issue boils down to the basic question of whether this \nSenate wants to go on record to support a nearly $311 million tax \nincrease on the domestic mining industry.\n  Retention of the depletion allowance, for those who do not understand \nit--and there are a few--is important to the health of the domestic \nmining industry because it recognizes the nature, the uniqueness of the \nmineral industry as an extraction industry by providing a realistic \nmethod of measuring the decreasing value of a mineral deposit which \ndeclines when you take it out, while generating the necessary capital \nto build a replacement project, so we can have employment. Metal prices \nare down, as has been evidenced. Gold has dropped from over $400 an \nounce to $300 an ounce, the lowest price in 18 years.\n  On a daily basis, newspapers throughout the West announce further \nmine closures.\n  The Senator from Arkansas wants to tax the industry now. Lost jobs, \nlost futures. I ask my colleagues if they really believe this country \nhas lost its hunger for raw materials, or do we simply want to send the \nindustry overseas, import our minerals from overseas? If you do not \nthink increased costs of operation such as proposed by the amendment by \nSenator Bumpers pose a real threat to the domestic mining industry and \nlocal economies, ask the people of Lead, SD. ``Homestate Mining just \nlaid off 466 workers at the Lead mine due to increased costs of \noperations and diminished gold prices.''\n\n  This is not the time to be launching punitive action against an \nindustry that contributes over $130 million annually to the American \neconomy. We have a bill in my committee to accomplish comprehensive \nmining reform. The Senator from Arkansas is aware of that. I will be \nholding hearings on comprehensive reform on April 28. That is the \nplace, in the hearing room, and the time to go about reforming mining \nlaw, not in a 10-minute debate on the floor of the Senate during \nconsideration of the budget.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to join with me and defeat Senator \nBumpers' amendment.\n  One more time. Do not be fooled. This budget resolution already \nprovides a $2.5 billion increase for the IDEA program without raising \ntaxes and creating a new entitlement program. So I encourage my \ncolleagues to recognize what this is. It is a $311 million tax on our \nmining industry that is going to cause a job loss, and we are going to \nbe more dependent on imported minerals.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. How much time do I have remaining?\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has 5 minutes 44 \nseconds.\n\n[[Page S3028]]\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield myself such time as I may use.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, isn't it wonderful that the hard rock \nmining companies don't pay taxes? Isn't that just remarkable? We give \nthem billions of dollars' worth of minerals for $2.50 an acre, we allow \nthem to create environmental disasters, we allow them to take the \nminerals and not pay one dime in royalty, and they are not subject to \npay any taxes. Isn't that just wonderful? The oil companies, who right \nnow are getting about 50 percent as much for their oil as they got a \nyear ago, not only have to pay billions for the rights to drill for oil \non Federal lands, but they also have to pay royalties. And they pay \ntaxes.\n  If somebody walked in here and made the argument that was just made \nabout the fact that mining companies pay taxes, if somebody made the \nsuggestion that oil companies not pay taxes, you would be laughed out \nthat door. If the same argument were made for coal companies who pay \nzillions just for the right to take the coal and a 12.5 percent \nroyalty, and if we suggested that they not have to pay taxes, you would \nbe laughed out the door.\n  What is it about the rock mining industry? We give them billions of \ndollars' worth of gold, silver, platinum, palladium; they create \nenvironmental disasters; they don't pay a dime in royalties; they take \na depreciation allowance on top of that of 15 to 12 percent; we give it \nto them and then pay them to take it. The children of this Nation--we \ngive 9 percent to the school district to take care of disabled \nchildren.\n  I can tell you who is going to win in this battle here today. It \nisn't going to be the disabled children, it is going to be the same \npeople who have won for the last 8 years, as I presented it. It will be \nthe mining companies. They will continue to get Federal lands for \nnothing. They will continue to get a depletion allowance to mine it. \nThey will continue not paying Uncle Sam one dime in royalty. If they \ncome to your house and say, ``You have this tract of land out back \nloaded with gold, and we would like to mine it,'' do you know what they \nare willing to pay? Eighteen percent royalty. But they come to the U.S. \nGovernment and say, ``You have this tract of land that has gold on \nit.'' We say, ``Oh, really? Please take it. Please leave an \nenvironmental disaster to the tune of $76 billion for the taxpayers to \nclean up. Please don't pay us any royalty. We do need a few billion \ndollars more for disabled children, but not from you.''\n  One of these days, the people of this country are going to rise up in \nrighteous indignation when it finally soaks in on the American people \nwhat is going on in this industry and how Congress is aiding and \nabetting one of the biggest scams in the history of the world.\n  Colleagues, when you walk in here to vote today, look at that chart. \nYou have a choice of removing an unjustified tax loophole that is not \navailable to anybody else--nobody else. You can remove it from the \nbiggest mining companies in the world--not the United States, in the \nworld--and give it to the disabled children of this country, the school \nboards which have been waiting for us to fulfill a 23-year promise to \nprovide 40 percent of the cost of taking care of disabled children. So \nfar, we have paid the paltry sum of 9 percent.\n  I yield the floor and save remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico has 3 minutes 14 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, many of us have heard people say, ``Kick \nthem when they're down.'' I guess we all recall when we were in high \nschool. If you went to a high school football game, the cheerleaders \nwould say, ``Hit them again. Hit them again, harder, harder.''\n  Mr. President, the mining industry in the United States led by the \ncopper industry is in a deplorable economic state. As a matter of fact, \ncopper is down 30 percent. Already in America, copper mines have been \nclosed. All mineral resources in the world are down substantially. Oil \nproduction in the United States is down. Stripper wells are going out \nof business rapidly. We are more and more dependent upon foreign \nsources for our mineral resources, and for our oil.\n  Frankly, the GAO tells us that the mining industry pays an enormously \nhigh tax. In fact, the study says on average they pay 32 percent of the \nincome. They already contribute $14 billion to the Federal Government \nin revenues.\n  Mr. President, it is obvious that this amendment will cause more \ndisrepair in the industry, fewer jobs, laying off people. In fact, we \nmight call it the ``Unemployed Miner Act.''\n  Second, in terms of money for disabled young people, let me first say \nthe budget before us has $2.35 billion in new money for IDEA, for the \ndisabled young people of our country. We think that is a very, very \nsignificant add-on when the President only put a few million dollars in \nhis. We think it is the right place to put the money. But we have \nalready put it in our budget. We don't need to destroy the mining \nindustry in order to live up to our responsibility under IDEA and to \ndisabled children. We found the money to do it in our budget.\n  It seems to me that to pick one tax, one deduction, the depletion \nallowance, and from that assume that the mining industry, coal mining \nand all the others, are not paying any Federal taxes is an absolute \ngross exaggeration, if not an untruth. As far as environmental \ndegradation, since we have had environmental laws, our mining companies \nare not causing environmental degradation. They are bound by every \nsingle environmental law of this land. And a statement that they are \npolluting today is also a gross exaggeration, if not truly an untruth.\n  When time is all yielded, I will move to table and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Arkansas has 1 minute 25 seconds.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, how much time do the opponents have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from New Mexico has \nexpired.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I will not belabor this any further. \nEverybody knows the argument. It is just a question of whether you are \nwilling to do right or not. We are mining $2 billion worth just in gold \na year off Federal lands that we have given the mining companies--gave \nthem. They pay no royalty. They didn't pay anything for it. I forget \nwho it was who talked about how valuable minerals were. Eighty percent \nof the gold mined in this country goes for jewelry. And we are willing \nto subsidize that to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars a year \nwhen we have disabled children in school waiting for us to fulfill a \npromise? It is just as simple as that.\n  I yield the remainder of my time and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to table the Bumpers amendment, and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

PATRICK MURPHY, OF ILLINOIS, TO BE UNITED STATES \n          DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of G. Patrick \nMurphy, of Illinois, to be United States District Judge for the \nSouthern District of Illinois.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n[[Page S3029]]\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of \ntwo outstanding judicial nominees from my state of Illinois, G. Patrick \nMurphy and Michael P. McCuskey.\n  It is therefore appropriate that I also say a few words about a \nmatter of critical importance: the exceptionally large number of \njudicial vacancies in our federal court system.\n  Currently, there are 83 vacancies in the federal judiciary. This \naccounts for approximately one out of every ten federal judges. Thirty \nof the vacancies have been in existence for 18 months or longer and are \ntherefore regarded as ``judicial emergencies.''\n  Illinois presently has seven vacant judgeships. One of these, in the \nU.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, dates back \nto November of 1992. Another, in the Central District, dates back to \nOctober of 1994. Two of the nominees for these vacancies are awaiting \naction by the Senate Judiciary Committee and two will be confirmed \ntoday by the full Senate. In the Southern District, the chief judge \nwent for more than a year without having time to hear a single civil \ncase because his criminal docket was so full. In the Central District, \nmajor civil trials have had to be postponed because of the shortage of \njudges. Commenting on the imminent retirement of a third judge in his \ndistrict, Marvin Aspen, the chief judge of the Northern District, \nrecently told the Chicago Sun-Times that ``if Congress does not move \nquickly . . . in a short time we could have a serious backlog.'' Last \nweek, Judge Aspen called the number of judicial vacancies nationwide \n``an unprecedented scandal.'' The chief judge of the Southern District, \nPhil Gilbert, says that they are currently managing to get the job \ndone, but they ``badly'' need additional judges. Michael Mihm of the \nCentral District says that they are also continuing to function, but \nthey are definitely feeling the pinch. They have had to delay at least \none major civil trial, and are increasingly dependent on visiting \njudges. Litigants are often forced to travel long distances to get \ntheir day in court.\n  The situation in the Southern and Central Districts of Illinois is \ndire. There are four judgeships in the Southern District, and 2 of them \nare vacant, a vacancy rate of 50%, which is much higher than the \nnationwide rate of 10% vacancies. The Central District numbers are \nexactly the same. The Southern District vacancy is one of the oldest in \nthe country. As of today, 1,972 days have passed without a judge in \nthat seat. And the Central District seat has been vacant for 1,275 \ndays.\n  Today, two Illinois nominees for those districts will be confirmed by \nthe full Senate. These nominees, Mike McCuskey and Pat Murphy, have \nbeen pending on the floor for 147 days. There is no question of their \nqualifications; both were unanimously recommended by the Judiciary \nCommittee in November.\n\n  Mike McCuskey was born in Peoria, and has served as a state court \njudge for the last nine years. Prior to attending law school, he taught \nhigh school history, and coached baseball. He worked his way through \nlaw school as a security guard. Judge McCuskey has a reputation as an \noutstanding jurist, fair, firm and thorough. He is also known for his \ncommunity service, such as reading to grade school children and \nemceeing senior citizen activities at the County Fair.\n  Pat Murphy was born in Marion, Illinois. He enlisted in the Marines \nat the age of 17, and spent his 18th birthday in Vietnam. Upon \nreturning to Illinois, he attended college and law school with the help \nof the GI Bill. After both of his parents died, he helped raise his \nfour younger siblings, although, as he puts it, they all raised each \nother. Mr. Murphy has extensive legal experience, with over 100 jury \ntrials and 200 bench trials under his belt. The first year he was \neligible, he was elected to the prestigious American College of Trial \nAttorneys. He has a sterling reputation among all who have worked with \nhim or against him. He is also known for his generosity to veterans, \ngiving pro bono representation to any veteran who asks for help.\n  As both of these nominees have languished on the Senate calendar, the \ndelay has taken its toll on their personal lives. Several weeks ago, \nJudge McCuskey was forced to choose between his home and his current \nstate court job. Last year he signed a housing contract, which was \nfinalized in March. Since he entered the contract, the rules of \nresidency for a state court judge changed. This confirmation vote comes \njust in time for him. He can now move into his new house without \nworrying about losing his state court judgeship. If this confirmation \nvote did not come today, he would have been forced to default on his \ncontract. Pat Murphy is a solo practitioner. He has been unable to \npredict his ability to continue to represent clients. Yet, he has had \nto make a living over the last one hundred and fifty days.\n  Consideration of these nominees has been long overdue, and I am so \npleased that they will finally be confirmed by the full Senate. Both of \nthese men are highly qualified and will be a credit to the federal \njudiciary. Moreover, the vacancies they fill will help resolve a crisis \nin Illinois--a crisis that is evident throughout our nation.\n  As Chief Justice Rehnquist stated in his 1997 Year-End Report on the \nFederal Judiciary, ``Vacancies cannot remain at such high levels \nindefinitely without eroding the quality of justice that traditionally \nhas been associated with the federal judiciary.'' The Chief Justice \nplaced much of the blame squarely on the Senate. He said, ``Some \ncurrent nominees have been waiting a considerable time for a Senate \nJudiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote. The Senate confirmed \nonly 17 judges in 1996 and 36 in 1997, well under the 101 judges it \nconfirmed during 1994.''\n\n  By failing to move expeditiously on judicial nominations, the \nmajority party in the Senate is failing to live up to its \nresponsibilities to the American people. President Clinton has made 134 \njudicial nominations during the 105th Congress, but the Senate has \nconfirmed only 51 of these individuals. As the Chicago Tribune \neditorialized earlier this year, ``If Republicans don't like the \nchoices, let the Senate debate them and vote them down. Doing nothing, \nas the Senate has done lately, is cowardly and cynical.''\n  Worse yet, it is affecting the quality of justice in the United \nStates. The increase in the number of judicial vacancies in combination \nwith the growth in criminal and civil filings has created a huge \nbacklog of federal cases. According to Chief Justice Rehnquist, since \n1990, the number of cases filed in courts of appeals has increased by \n21 percent and those filed in district courts have grown by 24 percent. \nThere was a five percent increase in the criminal caseload in 1997. \nThis resulted in the largest federal criminal caseload in 60 years.\n  According to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, the number \nof active cases pending for at least three years rose 20 percent from \n1995 to 1996. In 1997, Federal courts handled a record number of cases. \nBankruptcy filings jumped more than 50 %, civil and appellate cases \nincreased for the fourth consecutive year, and criminal caseloads were \nmore crowded than at any time in the last 60 years. According to the \nmost recent data provided by the Department of Justice, there are more \nthan 16,000 federal cases that are more than three years old.\n  Time magazine wrote last year that ``some Republicans have as much as \ndeclared war on [President] Clinton's choices, parsing every phrase \nthey've written for evidence of what they call judicial activism.'' \nThis has discouraged qualified candidates from subjecting themselves to \nthe confirmation process. For instance, last September, Justice Richard \nP. Goldenhersch of the Illinois Court of Appeals, withdrew his name \nfrom consideration for a federal judgeship, stating that, because of \nthe ``poisoned atmosphere of the confirmation process, my nomination \nwould be pending for an indefinite period of time.'' He stated that the \nprotracted nature of the process was ``particularly unfair to the \npeople of the Southern District of Illinois, who deserve a fully \nstaffed court ready to hear their cases.''\n  In condemning President Clinton's judicial nominations, one of my \nRepublican colleagues described the judicial branch last year as being \nfull of ``renegade judges, [who are] a robed, contemptuous intellectual \nelite.'' And in explaining why the confirmation of a California appeals \ncourt judge had been delayed for two years, a senior member of the \nRepublican majority stated, ``If\n\n[[Page S3030]]\n\nyou want to blame somebody for the slowness of approving judges to the \nNinth Circuit, blame the Clinton and Carter appointees who have been \nignoring the law and are true examples of activist judging.''\n  The President's record of judicial appointments belies any assertion \nthat he has sought to stack the federal judiciary with the types of \njudges referred to by my colleagues. The New York Times commented last \nyear that what ``may be most notable about Clinton's judicial \nappointments may be reluctance to fill the court with liberal judges.'' \nThe Times noted that a statistical analysis by three scholars \n``confirms the notion that the ideology of Clinton's appointees falls \nsomewhere between the conservatives selected by [Presidents] Bush and \nReagan and the liberals chosen by President Carter.'' The Times quoted \nan author of the study, Professor Donald Songer of the University of \nSouth Carolina, as stating that Clinton's appointments were ``decidedly \nless liberal than other modern Democratic presidents.'' Professor \nSonger stated that, from an ideological standpoint, President Clinton's \njudges were most similar to judges selected by President Ford.\n  Republican members of the Senate thus cannot claim that they are \nsafeguarding the judiciary from liberal jurists. Indeed, it is they \nwho, in the words of Time magazine, are currently engaged in ``what has \nbecome a more partisan and ideological examination of all judicial \nnominees.'' As my colleague from Vermont, Senator Leahy, stated last \nSeptember, the ``continuing attack on the judicial branch [by \nRepublican Members of Congress], the slowdown in the processing of the \nscores of good women and men the President has nominated to fill \nvacancies on the Federal courts around the country, and widespread \nthreats of impeachment [against federal judges] are all part of a \npartisan ideological effort to intimidate the judiciary.''\n  Mr. President, Chief Justice Rehnquist has called the independence of \nthe judiciary ``the crown jewel of our system of government.'' Our \ncourts are revered around the globe precisely because of their ability \nto administer justice impartially and without regard to the prevailing \npolitical climate. Republicans in Congress are seeking to undermine \njudicial independence and freedom of action. A key element of their \nstrategy has been to put a choke hold on the process of confirming \nnominees sent by President Clinton. This state of affairs must not be \nallowed to continue. As Chief Justice Rehnquist has stated, ``The \nSenate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, \nbut after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him up or \ndown.'' Let the Senate heed the words of the Chief Justice and commit \nitself to enabling the federal judiciary to be, as the Supreme Court \npediments proclaim, the guardian of our liberty and the guarantor of \nequal justice under the law.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I come to the floor to congratulate Senator \nDurbin and Senator Moseley-Braun on finally, at long last, achieving a \nvote on the nominations of Patrick Murphy and Judge Michael McCuskey. \nThe Senators from Illinois have had to labor long and hard just to \nreach this point. I know that Senator Durbin did everything that he \ncould think of to bring to the attention of the Republican leadership \nthe need to consider and confirm these two judicial nominees who have \nbeen languishing on the Senate calendar without action for the last six \nmonths. I, too, have spoken about the plight of the Federal courts in \nthe Southern and Central Districts of Illinois more often over the last \nseveral weeks and months than I would like to remember.\n  We thank the Democratic Leader, Senator Daschle, for his efforts on \nbehalf of these nominees and on behalf of achieving a vote. And I thank \nthe Majority Leader for finally scheduling this vote and for working \nthrough whatever problems existed on the Republican side of the aisle \nthat have delayed these nominations from early November to the end of \nthe last session and for the first three months of this new session.\n  It is long past time for the Senate to consider the nominations of \nPatrick Murphy and Judge Michael McCuskey. The Senate Judiciary \nCommittee unanimously reported these two nominations to the full Senate \non November 6, 1997--almost six months ago. Their confirmations are \ndesperately needed to help end the vacancy crisis in the Federal \nDistrict Courts of Illinois.\n  Pat Murphy is an outstanding judicial nominee. A decorated Marine, he \nhas practiced law in the State of Illinois for 20 years as a trial \nlawyer and tried about 250 cases to verdict or judgment as sole \ncounsel. During his legal career, Mr. Murphy has made an extensive \ncommitment to pro bono service--dedicating approximately 20 percent of \nhis working time to representing disadvantaged clients in his \ncommunity.\n  Judge Michael McCuskey is also an outstanding judicial nominee. Judge \nMcCuskey served as a Public Defender for Marshall County in Lacon, \nIllinois, for 8 years and has served as a State court judge for several \nyears, first on the bench in the 10th Judicial Circuit and then on the \nThird District Appellate Court of Illinois. The American Bar \nAssociation recognized his stellar qualifications by giving Judge \nMcCuskey its highest rating of well-qualified for this nomination.\n  The mounting backlogs of civil and criminal cases in the dozens of \nemergency districts, like the Southern and Central Districts of \nIllinois, are growing more critical by the day. Indeed, in the Southern \nDistrict of Illinois, where Pat Murphy will serve when confirmed, Chief \nJudge Gilbert has reported that his docket has been so burdened with \ncriminal cases that he went a year without trying a civil case.\n  The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court has called \njudicial vacancies ``the most immediate problem we face in the federal \njudiciary.'' There is no justification for the Senate's delay in \nconsidering these two fine nominees for Districts suffering from \njudicial emergency vacancies.\n  I have urged those who have been stalling the consideration of the \nPresident's judicial nominations to reconsider and to work with us to \nhave the Judiciary Committee and the Senate fulfill its constitutional \nresponsibility. Those who delay or prevent the filling of these \nvacancies must understand that they are delaying or preventing the \nadministration of justice. Courts cannot try cases, incarcerate the \nguilty or resolve civil disputes without judges.\n  Last week the Chief Judge of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals \ncertified that the persisting vacancies on that Court require him to \ncertify an emergency situation and to begin canceling hearings and \nproceeding with only one Second Circuit Judge on certain 3-judge \nappellate panels. There is a nominee for the Second Circuit on the \nSenate calendar awaiting Senate consideration, Judge Sonia Sotomayor.\n  I came to the Senate floor last week to plead with the Republican \nleadership to proceed to consideration of the nomination of Judge Sonia \nSotomayor to the Second Circuit. I renew that plea today and urge a \nvote on this nomination before the Senate adjourns for a 2-week recess. \nWe should not go on recess while the Second Circuit needs action on \nnominees to alleviate a crisis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of G. Patrick Murphy, of Illinois, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the Southern District of Illinois?\n  On this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

It doesn't \nsuggest whether after the current Tax Code is sunsetted there will be a \nflat tax, a VAT tax, a national sales tax; it just says sunset the Tax \nCode.\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, says the \nfollowing:\n\n       I believe that a comprehensive overhaul of the Tax Code \n     should be in place before any action is taken to sunset the \n     existing Tax Code.\n\n  The Tax Executives Institute, which represents thousands of \ncorporations around the country, has said the same thing. It would be \nirresponsible to say let's get rid of the Tax Code without telling \npeople what they are going to put in its place. What do you say to \nsomebody who is going to buy a home tomorrow and they expect their \nmortgage interest deduction is going to be----\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, may we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is correct. There \nwill be order in the Senate.\n  Mr. FORD. I think the Senator from North Dakota should have some of \nhis time back because nobody has heard him.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, last evening, the Senator from New Mexico \ncharacterized the amendment as an amendment which supports the current \nTax Code. It is a clever way to debate, I guess, what this amendment is \nabout. I support reforming the current Tax Code, making it better, more \nsimple, more fair, but I don't believe we ought to say, ``Let's abolish \nthe current Tax Code and tell the American people there is nothing that \nwe are going to put in its place this moment, you guess about that; you \nguess about that.''\n  It may be a national sales tax of 30 or 35 percent. That is what the \nrecent study from the Brookings Institute says it would have to be. \nMaybe it is a flat tax where a billionaire pays the same rate as a \nperson who works for $20,000 a year.\n  Let me conclude. The Senator from Maryland makes the point that I \nmade last night. How would anybody tomorrow plan their expansion, plan \ntheir next action if they didn't know what the Tax Code was going to be \nin the year 2002?\n  How will anybody decide to buy a house wondering whether they are \ngoing to have a mortgage interest deduction?\n  How will anybody decide about their charitable contributions if they \ndon't know that the tax system is going to allow that as a deduction? \nThat is the point.\n  This is not the thing to do. The chairman of the Finance Committee \nsaid so and many, many others around the country, including the \nPresident, said so.\n  Let us strike this provision and replace it with the language I have \nsuggested that supports the mortgage interest deduction, the charitable \ndeduction, and others in the current code. We can improve the current \ncode, and we should, but we ought not allow this provision to stay in \nthe Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New Mexico has 1 minute.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, could we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Please, could we have order in the body.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I compliment the occupant of the Chair, \nthe distinguished Senator from Kansas, and I compliment the \ndistinguished Senator from Arkansas, Senator Hutchinson. They have \ngiven us an opportunity to see to it that we reform the Tax Code of the \nUnited States. It has been talked about for so long and nothing ever \nhappens. They have devised a way where they are saying to the \ncommittees of the U.S. Congress, and to the President, let us get on \nwith it. And here is the leverage: If you do not, we will not have a \nTax Code in the year 2001.\n  I believe this is the only way you are going to get tax reform when \nthose who are in charge of the job--with all the special interests \ngobbling them up not wanting any change. I think the only way it will \noccur is if this sense-of-the-Senate proposal becomes law. It is not \nlaw today when we approve of it. It will become law when a committee \nsends a bill to the President. But we ought to go on record saying we \nwant reform, we want major reform of a broken down code, and we want it \nsoon, not 15 more years of debate.\n  If I have any additional time, I yield it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n[[Page S3032]]\n\n         Amendment No. 2279 to Amendment No. 2218, As Modified\n\n (Purpose: To express the Sense of the Senate regarding passage of an \n  IRS restructuring bill that provides real relief for taxpayers and \n provides appropriate oversight as well as to express the Sense of the \n             Senate that the tax code should be terminated)\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I have a second-degree amendment to the Dorgan \namendment I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Hutchinson] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2279 to amendment No. 2218, as modified.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Parliamentary inquiry. How much time does the Senator from \nArkansas have on his second-degree amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the order, there is 1 minute on each \nside.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Did the unanimous consent request entered into last night \nprohibit second-degree amendments?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No, it did not.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Second-degree amendments would be allowed? I did not hear \nyour answer to Senator Ford. How much time is allowed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute on each side.\n  Mr. FORD. One minute.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I do not believe we need to be voting on the Dorgan \namendment, which is simply a vote on behalf of the status quo. We need \nan affirmative vote on the need to sunset the current Tax Code.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator withhold?\n  Could we have order in the body?\n  Mr. BYRD. May we have a reading of the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will please read the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n       Strike all after the first word of the matter proposed to \n     be inserted and insert the following:\n\n     SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING PASSAGE OF THE SENATE FINANCE \n                   COMMITTEE'S IRS RESTRUCTURING BILL.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the House of Representatives passed H.R. 2676 on \n     November 5, 1997;\n       (2) the Finance Committee of the Senate has held several \n     days of hearings this year on IRS restructuring proposals;\n       (3) the hearings demonstrated many areas in which the \n     House-passed bill could be improved;\n       (4) on March 31, 1998, the Senate Finance Committee voted \n     20-0 to report an IRS restructuring package that contains \n     more oversight over the IRS, more accountability for \n     employees, and a new arsenal of taxpayer protections; and\n       (5) the Senate Finance package includes the following items \n     which were not included in the House bill:\n       (A) removal of the statutory impediments to the \n     Commissioner of Internal Revenue's efforts to reorganize the \n     agency to create a more streamlined, taxpayer-friendly \n     organization,\n       (B) the providing of real oversight authority for the \n     Internal Revenue Service Oversight Board to help prevent \n     taxpayer abuse,\n       (C) the creation of a new Treasury Inspector General for \n     Tax Administration to ensure independence and accountability,\n       (D) real, meaningful relief for innocent spouses,\n       (E) provisions which abate penalties and interest after 1 \n     year so that the IRS does not profit from its own delay,\n       (F) provisions which ensure due process of law to taxpayers \n     by granting them a right to a hearing before the IRS can \n     pursue a lien, levy, or seizure,\n       (G) provisions which forbid the IRS from coercing taxpayers \n     to extend the 10-year statute of limitations for collection,\n       (H) provisions which require the IRS to terminate employees \n     who abuse taxpayers or other IRS employees,\n       (I) provisions which make the Taxpayer Advocate more \n     independent, and\n       (J) provisions enabling the Commissioner of Internal \n     Revenue to manage employees more effectively.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     budget resolution assume that the Senate shall, as \n     expeditiously as possible, consider and pass an IRS \n     restructuring bill which provides the most taxpayer \n     protections, the greatest degree of IRS employee \n     accountability, and enhanced oversight.\n\n     SEC 302. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE SUNSET OF THE \n                   INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that a simple and fair \n     Federal tax system is one that--\n       (1) applies a low tax rate, through easily understood laws, \n     to all Americans;\n       (2) provides tax relief for working Americans;\n       (3) protects the rights of taxpayers and reduces tax \n     collection abuses;\n       (4) eliminates the bias against savings and investment;\n       (5) promotes economic growth and job creation;\n       (6) does not penalize marriage or families; and\n       (7) provides for a taxpayer-friendly collections process to \n     replace the Internal Revenue Service.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the provisions of this resolution assume that all taxes \n     imposed under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall sunset \n     for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2001 (or in \n     the case of any tax not imposed on the basis of a taxable \n     year, on any taxable event or for any period after December \n     31, 2001) and that a new Federal tax system will be enacted \n     that is both simple and fair as described in subsection (a) \n     and that provides only those resources for the Federal \n     Government that are needed to meet its responsibilities to \n     the American people.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 1 minute of debate on each side.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, if I might just explain the amendment. \nThere are two major provisions to the amendment. One would say that \nuntil we are able to replace this Tax Code, we need to restructure and \nreform the IRS. Senator Roth has done a marvelous job in highlighting \nthe abuses of the Internal Revenue Service. This puts us on record, in \nthe sense of the Senate, that we should as expeditiously as possible \nprovide taxpayer protections.\n  The second major provision is that we should set a date certain in \nwhich this massive, incomprehensible Tax Code will be sunsetted, and we \nwill have a replacement code written 6 months in advance of that.\n  We give the sense of the Senate in those two respects.\n  This chart in the Washington Post shows what we did in the Taxpayer \nRelief Act regarding one provision, IRA rules. We complicated it from \nthis to this. The American taxpayer knows that. We need to simplify, we \nneed to reform the IRS. And there is nothing irresponsible about \nsetting a sunset date on sunsetting the existing Tax Code.\n  We sunset the ISTEA bill, we sunset the higher education bill, we \nsunset the farm bill. But we just add to, and add to, and add to the \nTax Code. We have elections. We have a process. We have hearings. We \nwill have a responsible process by which we write a replacement code \nand the American people will come to a consensus.\n  I ask your support for this second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask for the yeas and nays. I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I ask for the yeas and nays, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I believe I have a minute in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. The Senator from North Dakota \nhas 1 minute.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is, with all due respect, a sloppy \nway to legislate. I do not--I guess I heard part of this being read a \nmoment ago. The reason it is offered, I assume, is some do not want to \nvote on the amendment that I offered.\n  I wrote the amendment, noticed it to the Senate. Everyone had an \nopportunity to read it, look at it yesterday, make a judgment about it. \nNow we have an amendment that is sent to the desk as a second-degree. \nCertainly you have a right to do that, but we are going to vote on my \namendment. However, your amendment is disposed of, I might say to the \nSenator, my amendment is going to be offered as a second-degree. We are \ngoing to vote on my amendment. So we can do it sooner; we can do it \nlater. One way or the other, we are going to vote on my amendment. It \njust seems to me that in a day in which we are going to be dealing with \n30, 50, 60 amendments, if we start doing second degrees because \nsomebody doesn't want to vote on an amendment, we will be here until \nnext Tuesday.\n\n[[Page S3033]]\n\n  As I said, the Senator has every right to offer a second degree. I \ndon't contest that. I'm saying we are not going to get out of here if \nthis is the way the Senate is going to do its business. We will not get \nout of here.\n  I wrote an amendment. I made it available to everybody in the Senate \nto see, review, look at it, to make a judgment. I expected when I came \nhere this morning we would have a vote. That is what I thought the \nunanimous consent was about last evening. Now I discover we have a \nsecond-degree and we go through a reading. We will be here forever if \nthis is the way we will do business.\n  Again I say if you think you will avoid a vote on this, you will not. \nWhen we dispose of this, if I'm recognized, I will offer a second \ndegree. If I'm not, I will be here because I'm going to get recognized \nand I will offer a second degree, and when I do, we will vote on my \namendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this sense-of-the-Senate amendment would \nput the Senate on record in support of sunsetting the tax code on \nDecember 31, 2001, before a system was set up to replace it and without \nassurance that such a system would be in place.\n  There is no question that the Internal Revenue Code is too \ncomplicated and needs reform. In fact, as a result of the tax bill \nwhich was signed into law last year, 285 new sections were added.\n  One of the problems with the amendment before us is that it would do \naway with the current tax system without a guarantee that it would be \nreplaced in a timely and orderly manner, if at all, so people can plan \ntheir lives. The sunsetting is not dependent on the adoption of a \nreplacement. Households and businesses rely on provisions of the tax \ncode for budgeting purposes.\n  Mr. President, we need a new tax code, but we also must make sure \nthat a simplified and fairer tax code is in place. To pretend that we \ncan sunset the current code without knowing what will take its place \nand without having the guarantee of a replacement in a timely manner, \nis misleading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Hutchinson amendment No. 2279. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) is necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 59, nays 40, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 62 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--59\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kempthorne\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--40\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Helms\n       \n  The amendment (No. 2279) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I have a second-degree amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota (Mr. Dorgan) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2280 to amendment No. 2218, as modified.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE TAX TREATMENT OF HOME \n                   MORTGAGE INTEREST AND CHARITABLE GIVING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) current Federal income tax laws embrace a number of \n     fundamental tax policies including longstanding encouragement \n     for home ownership and charitable giving, expanded health and \n     retirement benefits.\n       (2) the mortgage interest deduction is among the most \n     important incentives in the income tax code and promotes the \n     American Dream of home ownership--the single largest \n     investment for most families, and preserving it is critical \n     for the more than 20,000,000 families claiming it now and for \n     millions more in the future;\n       (3) favorable tax treatment to encourage gifts to charities \n     is a longstanding principle that helps charities raise funds \n     needed to provide services to poor families and others when \n     government is simply unable or unwilling to do so, and \n     maintaining this tax incentive will help charities raise \n     money to meet the challenges of their charitable missions in \n     the decades ahead;\n       (4) legislation has been proposed to repeal the entire \n     income tax code at the end of the year 2001 without providing \n     a specific replacement; and\n       (5) sunsetting the entire income tax code without decribing \n     a replacement threatens our Nation's future economic growth \n     and unwisely eliminates existing tax incentives that are \n     crucial for taxpayers who are often making the most important \n     financial decisions of their lives.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the levels in this resolution assume that Congress supports \n     the continued tax deductibility of home mortgage interest and \n     charitable contributions and that a sunset of the tax code \n     that does not provide a replacement tax system that preserves \n     this deductibility could damage the American dream of home \n     ownership and could threaten the viability of non-profit \n     institutions.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me explain to my colleagues that the \nfindings are the same as the underlying amendment that I offered with \nthe exception that at the end, under ``Sense of Congress''--I will \nsimply read very briefly what I have added.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the levels in this \n     resolution assume that Congress supports the continued tax \n     deductibility of home mortgage interest and charitable \n     contributions--\n\n  That was my previous amendment--\n\n       and that a sunset of the Tax Code that does not provide a \n     replacement tax system that preserves this deductibility \n     could damage the American dream of home ownership and could \n     threaten the viability of nonprofit institutions.\n\n  This is a second degree that I am offering.\n  I don't know that I need to say much more about it except that it \nessentially is a vote on what I had offered in the first instance.\n  My intent here is very simple. It is not to denigrate those who have \ndifferent ideas than I have about this issue. It is, however, to say \nthat I think suggesting that we throw away the current Tax Code, as \nimperfect as it is and as much in need of reform as it is, without \nsuggesting what will come in its place is to say to all Americans who \nare homeowners that we are not sure that we are going to have a tax \nsystem in the future that allows you to deduct your home mortgage \ninterest, we are not sure we are going to have a tax system in the \nfuture that allows charitable contributions to be deducted.\n\n[[Page S3034]]\n\n  So I think the responsible thing to do is to say to the American \npeople that when there is a sunset, if there is, that there is a \nreplacement that will be included in these provisions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yield's time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, 15 minutes ago, 59 Senators voted in \nfavor of what I think all of us support: reforming and restructuring \nthe IRS and protecting the taxpayers to a date certain on sunsetting \nthe Tax Code that no one in this country defends.\n  Do not be fooled. This amendment is a second-degree amendment offered \nby my dear colleague from North Dakota that would undo much of what we \njust did. We don't want to undo that. There is nothing in the sense of \nthe Senate that we just adopted that would threaten in any way \ncharitable deductions or home mortgage deductions or any of the other \nparticular aspects of the current code that you may like. It would say \nthat on a date certain we are going to have a new code that is fairer \nand simpler, more comprehensible to the American people, and that it is \na tax code that they deserve.\n  I ask my colleagues to reject this second-degree amendment designed \nonly to undo what we just expressed to the American people--that we \nbelieve the IRS is out of control and that we have a code that needs to \nbe simplified and that needs to be made more fair.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, has all time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that on the remaining stacked \namendments there be no second-degree amendments in order.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to table the second-degree amendment that is \npending and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, might I propose a parliamentary inquiry?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in a nondebatable posture.\n  Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The second-degree amendment that I am offering does not \nin fact replace what the Senate voted on previously. Is that not \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The language is added \nonto the amendment as amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from New Mexico to lay on the table the amendment of the \nSenator from North Dakota No. 2280.

I ask unanimous consent to speak for 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I think Senator Domenici's motion to \ntable gave all of us on this side of the aisle time to look closely at \nwhat the second-degree amendment by the Senator from North Dakota \nactually did. I have no objection to that second-degree amendment. I \nthink it merely expresses--it does not undo or reverse the sense of the \nSenate that we adopted earlier with 59 votes. It expresses support for \nthe charitable tax deduction and the homeowner deduction. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in support of Senator Dorgan's second-degree \namendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I request unanimous consent to speak for \n30 seconds simply to say the intent of the second-degree amendment was \nto say to the American people that whatever the merits of reforming our \nTax Code--and most of us, myself included, think it does need reform--\nthat when we decide to change the Tax Code, if we decide to do that, \nits replacement shall give some assurance to the American people that \nwe are not going to scrap their ability to deduct their home mortgage \ninterest, to scrap the ability to deduct charitable contributions. That \nis the purpose of that second-degree amendment. I appreciate very much \nsupport on that amendment.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the second-\ndegree amendment of the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The amendment (No. 2280) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are ready for the next amendment, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2170\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next amendment is amendment No. 2170, \noffered by the Senator from Colorado, Senator Allard.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered on the motion to waive the Budget \nAct.\n  Mr. ALLARD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Colorado is \nseeking recognition.\n\n[[Page S3035]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 1 minute.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I want to just briefly explain what my \namendment does. Right now, the total debt that we are facing in this \ncountry is $5.6 trillion. The interest that we pay on that total debt \nis more than the entire defense budget, and I believe we need a plan to \npay down that total debt.\n  My amendment proposes such a plan. It takes the surplus that is \nreflected in the budget proposal that is before us here on the floor of \nthe Senate today, and takes those first 5 years and allocates them \ntowards that debt pay-down plan. It says that after the 5 years that \nare reflected in the budget plan, then we dedicate $11.7 billion a year \ntowards paying down the debt. If we will do that, we can pay down the \ndebt in 30 years and save more than $3.7 trillion in interest.\n  The $11.7 billion which we set aside after the 5 years which is \nreflected in this budget, that is less than 1 percent of the total \nbudget. I am here to ask the Senate to join me in putting in place a \nplan to pay down the total debt.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Allard \namendment. It is going to impose excessively rigid strictures on the \nway we function. What it says, very simply, is that any time that \nincome does not exceed expense, that revenues do not exceed outlays, \nthere is a 60-vote point of order to make any change to accommodate it.\n  Just think what the consequences might be. We use our opportunities \nhere to sometimes adjust to an economy that is in stress. We could be \nendangering our national security, because though a declaration of war \nmay not have been made, the fact of the matter is that military \npreparation may be necessary in advance of that.\n  What happens if our outlays exceed our revenues? We cannot go ahead \nand take care of our necessary business. What happens in times of \ndepression when, in fact, revenues may be down and we may have a need \nto increase our expenses to help us carry our citizens through that \nperiod of time?\n  What it does is it excessively restricts our ability to function. \nProper fiscal policy is an important part of operating our Government. \nI urge my colleagues to vote no on the request to waive the Budget Act.\n\n\n                     Motion to waive The Budget Act\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act with respect to the Allard amendment No. 2170. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Three-fifths of the Senators present and voting, not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion to waive the Budget Act is not agreed \nto.\n  The point of order is sustained, and the amendment falls.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What is the next amendment?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2195\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 2195, the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, motion to waive the \nBudget Act, is the order of business.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this amendment establishes a reserve \nfund to allow revenues, taxes paid by large corporate taxpayers, to be \nused in a manner that is directly connected to environmental cleanup.\n  Right now, the bill that we are considering permits only the use of \n$200 million out of a total revenue base of $1.7 billion to be used for \nenvironmental cleanup. Frankly, I think that is wrong.\n  What we need to do is make sure that these funds are available for \nthe purpose that it is collected. We don't want to see it going to tax \nbreaks or other programs. Only $200 million of this will be used to pay \nfor the ``orphan shares,'' those shares for which no polluter can be \nfound. It is insufficient to take care of the job. That is the way \nSuperfund was originally designed.\n  I hope we can waive the budget point of order that has been raised.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. This is another reserve fund. The reserve fund has the \nadvantage, for the proponent, of creating a new series of entitlement \nprograms, thereby indirectly breaking the caps. If you would try to \nspend these in the normal way, we would be breaking the budget.\n  So it creates a series of potentially new entitlement programs. If we \never get taxes increased or other programs cut, the resources can be \nput into this reserve fund. I don't believe we ought to be doing this. \nI have objected to them regularly here on the floor when there is no \nreal source of money.\n  I think we should sustain the budget point of order on this one and \nnot start another approach to a new series of entitlement programs.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby the ranking member of the Budget Committee, the senior Senator from \nNew Jersey and my fellow member of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, Senator Lautenberg.\n  This amendment will allow the Congress to increase funding for \nimportant natural resources and environment programs without increasing \nthe deficit or lowering the surplus. That is an important point.\n  We would be able to address additional needs in these areas without \naffecting the overall deficit or surplus. The amendment would do this \nby allowing the excess receipts from a reinstated Superfund taxes to \noffset the cost of the programs.\n  What kind of programs might be funded through in this amendment? We \ncould hasten the cleanup of hazardous waste sites. We could provide \nassistance to states to protect waterways from polluted runoff. We also \ncould fund construction and maintenance for our deteriorating national \nparks, wildlife refuges, and other public lands.\n  These priorities were included in the President's proposed \nEnvironmental Resources Fund for America, but they are not included in \nSenate Concurrent Resolution 86.\n  The amendment would allow the authorizing committees, including the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee on which Senator Lautenberg and \nI sit, to set direct spending levels for environmental and natural \nresources programs. Furthermore, it would allow any excess funds from \nan extension of the Superfund tax to offset the added costs.\n  The Republican budget assumes that if a Superfund tax is reinstated, \n$200 million would be used to pay for that\n\n[[Page S3036]]\n\nportion of the cleanup that is attributable to parties that are \nbankrupt or otherwise cannot pay their share. The balance of $1.5 \nbillion each year could be used to offset the cost of unspecified \nspending or tax breaks.\n  By contrast, the Lautenberg amendment would direct the money from the \nSuperfund tax to needed environmental improvements--investments in the \nfuture of our natural resources and sustained health of our \nenvironment, not just for us, but for our children.\n  Directing more resources to states to help address the problem of \npolluted runoff will be an investment in the future of clean water.\n  Cleaning up Superfund sites is an investment that can protect public \nhealth and foster economic redevelopment.\n  Maintaining our national parks--our national treasures--is an \ninvestment that we must make, or see that part of our heritage fall \napart.\n  Mr. President, I commend the Senator from New Jersey for his \namendment and urge my colleagues to support it for the future health of \nour citizens and the environment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I strongly support Senator Lautenberg's \namendment to increase funding for the protection of the environment and \nour nation's natural resources. This important amendment would \nestablish an environmental reserve fund, so that receipts from a \nreinstated Superfund tax can be used for environmental protection \ninitiatives.\n  The environmental and natural resources programs funded in the \nPresident's Budget are critical to our efforts to protect these \nresources which are so vital to our society.\n  Several critical programs proposed by the President are not included \nin the Budget Resolution. Among others, these include operations and \nmaintenance funds for the administration of the National Wildlife \nRefuge System and program support for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService's execution of the Endangered Species Act. Both of these \nprograms are critical to the State of Florida and our ability to \nprotect and preserve unique ecosystems, habitats, and species.\n  Today's 93 million acre National Wildlife Refuge System has its roots \nin the state of Florida. It was public outrage over the devastation of \nwading bird populations in Florida that led to the establishment of the \nPelican Island Federal Bird Reservation in 1903. This action is \nrecognized as the genesis of the National Wildlife Refuge System.\n  Each year, nearly 30 million people visit our National Wildlife \nRefuges and enjoy activities such as wildlife observation, hiking, \nfishing, photography, hunting, and environmental education. These lands \nare home to millions of migrating birds, big game, and hundreds of \ncritically endangered species.\n  In the State of Florida, there are 25 National Wildlife Refuges that \nare an essential part of our natural heritage. I learned this lesson \nfirsthand in May 1990 when I did my 241st workday at the ``Ding'' \nDarling Wildlife Refuge on Sanibel Island. Working with refuge \nnaturalists, I spent the day surveying the refuge's bird population, \ncleaning up mangrove areas, reinforcing water retention ponds and \nspeaking with local citizens who had a keen interest in the refuge's \nfuture.\n  I also learned that the success of wildlife refuges since 1903 had \noccurred not because of any action taken by the House or Senate, but in \nspite of congressional neglect. While Congress has been willing to fund \nrefuges, it had failed to ascribe a mission for the refuge system or \nclearly define environmental objectives for each individual refuge.\n  This situation was corrected with the passage of the National \nWildlife Refuge System Improvement Act in 1997. I was pleased to play \nan instrumental role in this law's enactment. It provides new \nprotection to the more than 500 national wildlife refuges, and is a \ngreat step forward in our efforts to preserve the unique species and \necosystems located in these areas.\n  However, these lands must be maintained if they are to remain \nnational treasures. The President has requested an increase of $25.8 \nmillion in FY 99 for the Fish and Wildlife Service operation and \nmaintenance of the National Wildlife Refuge System. These funds would \nbe used in the State of Florida for projects such as protection of the \nFlorida Panther in the Ten Thousand Islands National Wildlife Refuge. \nThey would support the Florida Keys Invasive Exotics Task Force, which \nis working to protect the Florida Keys from invasive exotic plants \nwhich threaten the restoration of the South Florida Ecosystem.\n  The current budget resolution does not support this increase. The \nLautenberg Amendment, which I have co-sponsored, will help ensure that \nthe National Wildlife Refuge system receives the funds that are so \ncritical to its future.\n  In addition to the National Wildlife Refuge System, the President's \nBudget request for an increase of $35.7 million in FY99 for the Fish \nand Wildlife Service's threatened and endangered species program is a \ncritical element in our ongoing efforts to improve the level of \nprotection of endangered species. As currently written, the Senate \nBudget Resolution does meet the President's request. Senator \nLautenberg's amendment will give us the opportunity to review this \ndecision and provide the required funds to this critical program.\n  I believe that the Endangered Species Act is one of our nation's most \ncritical environmental statutes. While it goes without saying that the \nAct could be more effective in recovering endangered and threatened \nspecies, I believe that the ESA has helped to forestall further \ndeclines and possibly even the extinction of many of our most imperiled \nspecies.\n  Senate approval of this Amendment will give us the ability to review \nthe current needs of the ESA program and appropriate the required funds \nto support these programs.\n  Funding for implementation of the ESA is critical both today and into \nthe future. As the Senate considers the Endangered Species \nReauthorization Bill introduced by Senators Chafee, Baucus, Kempthorne, \nand Reid, our commitment to provide funds to support the revisions in \nthe ESA Reauthorization Bill will be essential. Without this \ncommitment, we run the risk of losing an opportunity to boost the \nworthy cause of endangered species conservation.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I make the point this is not a new entitlement. It is \ndirect spending and the revenue source would be it.\n\n\n                     Motion to waive the budget act\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2213 offered by Mr. Bond of Missouri.\n  The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the section 202 Elderly Housing Program is \nthe most important housing program for elderly low-income Americans \nproviding both affordable low-income housing and supportive services \ndesigned to meet the special needs of the elderly. The President's \nbudget request proposes reducing the funding from a current year level \nof $645 million to $109 million, an 83 percent cut.\n  On behalf of myself, Senator Mikulski, and numerous other colleagues, \nwe offer this sense-of-the-Senate resolution to say that we must \nmaintain the section 202 program. The alternative is to provide \nvouchers. Vouchers for the typical resident, an elderly woman, frail, \nin her seventies--to give her a voucher to go out and walk to find a \nnew apartment, or new dwelling place, is simply unacceptable.\n  I urge my colleagues to show an overwhelming vote in support of the \nprogram that maintains housing that our frail elderly so badly need.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I apologize, but we cannot hear the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will have to come to order before \nwe proceed.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, we promised the school districts of this \ncountry that if they would abide by the rules we set for taking care of \ndisabled children in school, we would foot 40 percent of the bill. We \ncried tears galore around here about unfunded mandates to the cities \nand the States and the counties, and we took care of it. Here is the \nbiggest unfunded mandate of all. We promised the school districts of \nthis country 40 percent for disabled children, and so far, after 23 \nyears, we are giving them 9 percent.\n  You get a double whammy. You get a chance to fulfill that mandate \nand, No. 2, take care of a totally unjustified tax break we give the \nmining companies. We give them Federal lands for $2.50 an acre, they \nmine the gold and silver off of it, and we pay them to take it, a 15 \npercent depletion allowance. So I would take that depletion allowance \nand give it to disabled children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, this year this Senate will vote for $2.5 \nbillion in new money to go to the disabled. We are doing our part for \nthe first time. What the Senator from Arkansas fails to say is he is \nproposing half a billion dollars in new tax increases on the working \nmen and women of the mining industries. It is not that simple. If you \nwant to vote for a big tax increase, then vote not to table this \namendment. But if you want to vote to maintain a strong mining industry \nin this country that is the foundation of our industrial might, then \nyou ought to vote to table because we are doing the right thing this \nyear. We are funding for the disabled with an additional $2.5 billion. \nI ask my colleagues to vote to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my \namendments numbered 2191 and 2192. In doing this, I do not in any way \nminimize the seriousness of the outlay problems that national defense \nfaces in fiscal year 1999 and thereafter. I want to commend the \nchairman of the Budget Committee for working with the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee and myself to reach an agreement on an \namendment to help alleviate this problem. We appreciate the assistance \nof the chairman of the Budget Committee as well as his assurances that \nhe will work with CBO, OMB and the Secretary of Defense to resolve this \nproblem.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 2191 and 2192) were withdrawn.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Thurmond for his kind \nremarks. Obviously, he has, for a number of weeks now, been very \nconcerned about the situation with reference to the Defense Department \nand the many things we must do in order to be militarily prepared to \ntake care of our men and women in the military.\n  I believe the issues that confront us have more to do with how you \nmake estimates of what the program is going to cost than anything else. \nWe are trying to work something out where those will be more \nrealistically evaluated than perhaps have been in the past. I thank the \nSenator for his compliments and pledge I will do everything I can to \nget this done right.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, again, I wish to thank the able \nchairman.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to inquire of the floor \nmanager of the bill, what order of amendments do we have now? I have an \namendment that I am certainly prepared to take up at this time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand that we have, between the \nminority and the majority, a list of six amendments that we would like \nto present. Senator Brownback is No. 1 on that list; followed by \nSenator Boxer; followed by Senator Specter; followed by Senator \nLautenberg; and then we would have another one in there, and we do not \nknow whether it would be Senator Connie Mack or otherwise; and Senator \nKennedy.\n  I want everyone to know that we are trying very hard to get to a \npoint where there is not very many amendments left for full debate. It \ndoes not mean we have yet arrived at how many would be entitled to a \nvote under the ``vote-arama'' with 1 minute. We are working on that \nright now. We need a lot of cooperation. But I think it is fair to \nproceed, I say to the leader, with this amendment. This is not one of \nthe three or four we would choose to resolve these issues, but we had \nalready made that commitment. And we will work on it as best we can.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2177\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2177 to be the \npending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Amendment No. 2177 previously proposed by the Senator from \n     Kansas [Mr. Brownback].\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. As I understand, I have 15 minutes to make the \npresentation under the unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I don't know that I will take that amount of time. If \nthe Chair will advise when I have used 10 minutes, I will appreciate \nthat.\n  I ask, as well, that Phil Gramm be added as a cosponsor to this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. The Brownback amendment is a simple amendment that \ncalls for a change in the budget law, the pay-go rules of the budget \nlaw, to allow for discretionary spending program eliminations, all \nthose key words, to be used for tax cuts or to save Social Security. It \nallows for that usage to be able to do those things.\n  Now, according to current budget law--and I realize some of this can \nbe arcane to a number of people--we cannot make cuts in discretionary \nspending programs in order to finance tax cuts. You have to make cuts \nin mandatory spending programs like Social Security and Medicare to pay \nfor tax cuts. That is just not fair and it is not right and it is \nwrong.\n  That is why we put forward this amendment. At this time I will read \nthe amendment because it is short, sweet, and to the point and it is \nimportant.\n\n       It is the sense-of-the-Senate that the functional tools \n     underlying this resolution assume that--\n       (I) the elimination of a discretionary spending program may \n     [with emphasis on the ``may''] be used for either tax cuts or \n     to reform the Social Security system.\n\n  There is some other language under that.\n  That is the extent, basically, of the amendment.\n  Now, I want to ask people, I know a number of folks watching this \nhave concerns about what is taking place in waste in Government \nspending. We have a $1.7 trillion Government on an annual basis. We \nhave things in that Government--like tobacco subsidies, like corporate \nwelfare--that when I go home and talk to people in Kansas, they say, \nwhy in the world are you still spending money on tobacco subsidies? Why \nare you spending money on corporate welfare? Why don't you cut those \nprograms? I don't think most people recognize the system works to \nprotect those programs like tobacco subsidies.\n  For instance, what you get is a system in place where there are a few \npeople protecting tobacco subsidies, or corporate welfare, and a lot of \npeople who want to eliminate it, but the few people can offset the \ngreater number because if you eliminated tobacco subsidies today, what \nhappens to the money? It just gets spent somewhere else. So people \nargue strongly in favor of their program no matter how wasteful it \nmight be and say, even if you cut this, it will not reduce the budget, \nit will not cut taxes, it will just be spent somewhere else. That is \nthe system. The system works against our getting rid of Government \nwaste.\n  Now, what if we created a competitive force back the other way? What \nif you said, OK, if we eliminate tobacco subsidies, we can use that to \npay for a tax cut. Or, if we eliminate corporate welfare, we can use \nthat to save Social Security. So they create a competing force of \npeople who want tax cuts or save Social Security against the domestic \ndiscretionary spending programs that in many cases are very wasteful of \nprecious taxpayer dollars. So that all this amendment attempts to do is \nto create that competing force to knock out some of this wasteful \nGovernment spending that everybody knows is here but nobody can ever \nseem to get at.\n\n  We are at the point of record high levels of taxation. The average \nAmerican family pays nearly 40 percent of\n\n[[Page S3039]]\n\ntheir income for taxes at all levels. It is the highest level since \nWorld War II. People are starting to ask why. Why are we paying such a \nhigh level of taxation? You add to that we are also broke, $5.4 \ntrillion worth of debt, we have unfunded obligations more than double \nthat amount, and yet we waste money on tobacco subsidies or we waste \nmoney on corporate welfare, and people don't get it.\n  The problem of it is the set of rules that we are operating under \nthat create a system where the few, who protect a portion of waste that \nmay be good for their constituents but is not good for the rest of the \ncountry as a whole, have a far greater stake in the system than the \npeople who want to eliminate it, who, if they eliminated it, it just \ngoes to be spent somewhere else and nothing happens to the debt or \nlevel of taxation or Social Security.\n  This amendment is very simple and straightforward on that. You \neliminate--and it is not just cutting; it is eliminating programs. A \nlot of times people might cut back on a discretionary spending program. \nSay we cut tobacco subsidies $100 million and use that for offsetting \ntax cuts somewhere--corporate welfare is a better example in that \narea--the next year we just add it back. We still have the tax cut that \nis pulling and draining resources from the Federal Treasury, which \nfrankly I don't mind because it goes back to taxpayers' pockets, but on \nthe other side you haven't paid for that tax cut. What we say is \neliminate--not just shave, not reduce, but eliminate --a program so \nthat this one doesn't come back and you can have an actual true offset.\n  So, Mr. President, it is past the time for us to start changing the \nsystem that has yielded to us a $1.7 trillion Government, that \nmaintains tobacco subsidies at a time when everybody in the world knows \nthis contributes to the causes of cancer. We are trying to stop young \npeople from starting to smoke, and yet we are still subsidizing tobacco \nsubsidies. We still have corporate welfare all over the place, and we \ncan't seem to get at it. This change in rule, this little change in \nrules would help us get at these issues. That is why I put this \namendment forward.\n  At the appropriate time I will ask for the yeas and nays. I reserve \nthe remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \namendment by the Senator from Kansas. This amendment calls for a change \nin the Budget Act that would allow discretionary programs to be \ncompletely eliminated in order to provide new tax breaks for purposes \nother than the initial direction for this funding. I'm not sure that I \nunderstand who would determine that. Would it be the Budget Committee \nthat would determine that? Would it be the specific committees? Would \nwe go to Environmental and say, eliminate this environmental cleanup \nprogram? Or would we go to the Department of Transportation and say, \neliminate safety programs, eliminate parts of the programs that are not \nfinanced through the trust fund?\n  This would be an incredible departure from the rules that are \nestablished in the balanced budget agreement. It could threaten just \nabout anything--education, anticrime efforts, environmental programs--\ndefense, as well, by the way.\n  We know that we have a debate here between those who would typically \nlike to spend more for defense or those who say, look, we have spent \nenough on defense to keep our security intact. How about the Coast \nGuard? You could come from a landlocked State and say, what do we need \nthe Coast Guard for? How about other departments? Some might disagree \nwith us on a program to protect our water or any number of programs \nthat are often represented regionally.\n  Frankly, I see this as a terrible prospect to contemplate. The Budget \nAct is designed to ensure that if we incur permanent obligations such \nas permanent tax cuts or new mandatory spending, we pay for these \nobligations with permanent savings.\n  That is what the pay-as-you-go plan rules are all about. It has \nworked out well for many years. This amendment would change these \nrules. It says we should make cuts in temporary spending--that is, \nannually appropriated discretionary programs--and use those temporary \ncuts to fund permanent tax breaks. Well, it doesn't take a CPA to \nfigure out that this can create serious problems in the long run. \nCutting funding for a program in one year doesn't mean those savings \nare going to remain available in future years. Once you have a tax \nbreak on the books, its costs regularly occur, year after year.\n  I am not opposed to tax cuts for ordinary Americans. In fact, I \nsupported targeted relief like the expanded child care credit that the \nPresident proposed. But I think we ought to pay for tax cuts with \npermanent savings. I am also concerned that Senator Brownback's \nproposal could encourage further cuts from programs that educate us and \nhelp us continue the pursuit of a cleaner environment, put the cops on \nthe streets, and make sure that our service people are well housed and \nequipped to do their duty.\n  The budget agreement is already calling for substantial real cuts in \ndiscretionary programs. Under the agreement, nondefense discretionary \nspending in 2002 will reach its lowest level in almost 40 years as a \nshare of GDP. These cuts are getting close to the bone, and we need to \nbe careful about cutting further, especially if further budget cuts are \nto be used for large tax breaks that could very well blow a hole in the \nbudget for the future.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will agree that this is no \ntime, nor is it the correct process, for radical surgery on the Budget \nAct. If we want to do that, we can discuss it within the Budget \nCommittee. This is a new subject. Let us not create fiscal problems in \nthe future by allowing short-term cuts to pay for long-term costs, \nbecause I suspect that in there, there is a mission, and that is to \nkind of take care of the people who are largely at the top of the \nladder, who benefit from most of the tax cut proposals we have seen.\n  Let's not encourage further cuts in programs that deal with education \nand crime. Do you want to tell veterans--I am a World War II veteran. I \nserved 3 years in the Army overseas during the war. Do you want to tell \nmy colleagues--and many are not as fortunate as I am, to have this kind \nof a position--do you want to tell them that someone may want to cut \ntheir programs on behalf of the tax cuts for the well off? I don't see \nit, and I sure don't want to tinker with defense. I am not what you \ncall a traditional hawk, Mr. President.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes 36 seconds. The \nSenator from New Jersey has 9 minutes 12 seconds.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to respond to a few of the \nstatements. I think the Senator from New Jersey, whom I appreciate, and \nI appreciate his service in the U.S. Senate, probably made the exact \naccurate point. That is, if you are going to cut veterans programs for \ntax cuts, people will come unglued, and it will not happen, because \nthere will be a number of veterans out there saying, ``What are you \ndoing cutting veterans programs and paying for tax cuts? I am not going \nto let you do that.'' And that would work.\n  If we went out and said, you know what, we are going to eliminate \ntobacco subsidies to pay for tax cuts, or we are going to cut the \ncorporate welfare for the wealthiest 50 corporations in America and pay \nfor a tax cut with that, would people come unglued? I sense an applause \nline in Kansas for something like that.\n\n  If I go to Kansas and say, ``I am going to cut veterans programs and \nwrite tax cuts,'' they will say, ``We are going to give you your head \nfor that one.'' That is the whole point here. The system is currently \ntilted toward no tax cuts and growing Government, because if you are \ngoing to provide for a tax cut, you have to cut Social Security or \nMedicare basically to pay for that tax cut. That is wrong. We should \nnot be cutting Social Security and Medicare. We should not be cutting \nthem at all, let alone offset them against a tax cut. The system was \nset up exactly this way to build Government and make it bigger.\n  Why are we at $1.7 trillion and growing? It is because the system is \nbuilt to\n\n[[Page S3040]]\n\nbuild. Why do we still subsidize tobacco? This makes absolutely no \nsense. So what we are trying to do here is make a little change.\n  The Senator from New Jersey raises another very important point about \npermanent savings paying for permanent tax cuts. I think that is a \nvaluable issue to raise. That is why, in the measure, we state that you \nhave to eliminate the program--not just cut it back, but eliminate the \nprogram to pay for tax cuts.\n  So let's take my example again. If we go to tobacco subsidies and say \nwe are going to eliminate tobacco subsidies and pay for this tax cut, \nit will be a small tax cut. What about the next two then? Do you think \nthey are going to be able to add back in tobacco subsidies once you get \nit finally pulled out by its roots? I don't think so. What if you are \nable to pull out corporate welfare by its roots to pay for that tax \ncut? Are we going to be able, the next year, to add back in that \ncorporate welfare? I don't think so, once it is pulled out. There is \nsuch a system of inertia to build the bill that I think we are going to \nbe able to get at this with this little change in the budget rules.\n  This is exactly the time to be doing this, as we will be looking \nforward to the future as to how we are going to protect, preserve, and \nsave Social Security. We need to do that. What are we going to do to \nfurther tax cuts on this burdensome level of taxation that we have for \nthe American people? This little budgetary change will actually help us \nmake some sense and sanity out of this place to a lot of the American \npublic.\n  So that is why I am putting this forward. Suggestions can be put \nforward by Members of Congress and by the Finance Committee on how you \ndo it. That is the same way we do tax cuts right now--from Members, \nfrom people from the Finance Committee.\n  This is a good provision. If you asked the American people about \nthis, they will say that is the way the place ought to work, instead of \nthis arcane way that we have set it up that actually hurts the American \npublic and maintains wasteful programs. That is why I am going to urge \nmy colleagues to vote in favor of this measure.\n  Mr. President, I retain the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I didn't hear the Senator's closing \ncomment. Did he yield back his time or reserve it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He reserved the balance of his time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I have respect for the Senator from \nKansas. We have gotten to know each other a little bit. When we \ndisagree, it is with a purpose of accomplishing something. When he \ntalks about getting a big applause line in Kansas if there were to be \nthe elimination of the subsidy for tobacco, well, I happen to agree \nwith the Senator on the elimination of the subsidy for tobacco, but I \nwonder whether it would get an applause line in North Carolina or \nKentucky or South Carolina. What if I were to say, well, let's reduce \nthe cost for the Corps of Engineers, we don't have to do all that \nflooding work, or maybe eliminate the program for agricultural \nsubsidies because in New Jersey our farmers are pretty close to market \nand they don't need a lot of subsidy, they don't draw down subsidy?\n  The point I make--without being too challenging, or too pedantic--is \nthat what the Senator described is exactly the problem, a Nation with \n50 States, one Nation wanting each of us here--and there isn't anybody \nhere who hasn't stood up to protect a program in their State without \nfeeling that they are doing the right thing. I don't know of anybody \nhere.\n\n  We have to respect those differences. I am not saying promote \ntobacco. I am not saying encourage agriculture. I am not saying that we \nought to have our ports dredged and no one else ought to have an \nopportunity to move their economies along. When we lose our beaches in \na storm, it is no different than a flood in Kansas, or a drought, or a \ntornado. It is our economy that is kept going. But, apart from that, \nthe notion that we could suddenly change the rules and say, OK, who is \nit that is going to decide we are going to eliminate this program? I \nguarantee you that there will be quite a debate in this body about what \nprograms get eliminated. There is only one way you can do this. That is \nthrough a deliberate, slow, and tedious discussion among us. It is \ncalled debate. It is called discussion, dialog.\n  I hope that the Senator from Kansas would not prevail with this. I \nthink it would be a disastrous conclusion.\n  Imagine risking some of the services that we talked about. How would \nwe feel about reducing the program in FEMA, the Emergency Services \nProgram, where everybody calls up, picks up the phone, dials the big \n911, saying, ``Help. Get out here. Hurry.'' We wouldn't have the funds \nto do it because we were giving tax breaks to well-off people. That \nwould really create a stir in this country. I will tell you, it would \nbe louder than an applause line.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, if I could respond to some of the \ncomments of my colleague from New Jersey, for whom I have a great deal \nof respect. He makes the exact point I am making. Tobacco subsidies \naren't cut because North Carolina and Kentucky and a few other States \nprotect those basically. Everybody else says, ``Look, if you cut it, we \nare really not going to do it. We are not cutting taxes. We are not \ncutting spending.''\n  So, all right, I will go along on it. We are trying to create \ncompetitors. If somebody comes up with a good idea, a program, and a \nneed, we are going to fund it. We have proven throughout history that \nwe will fund that. That is why actually today there is nothing so \npermanent as a temporary Government program. That is one of President \nReagan's lines. Because we will do it. The problem is we never undo it, \nor we never stop doing it. We don't have any competing force back the \nother way.\n  I think it would be a very helpful debate if we would have these \nregularly on the floor about, Should we actually be spending this money \non corporate welfare? What if we gave it back to the taxpayer or used \nit to preserve and protect Social Security? That would be a good, \nhealthy idea, because instead of the way we do it right now, which is \nbasically we are going to add that spending, we will never look back \nhere at what we previously paid for over the past 60 years because \nthere is no competing force on the other side of it.\n  That is why I am suggesting this would be an excellent change for \nthis body. It would be an excellent force that would be set up in favor \nof the taxpayer, in favor of good government, in favor of Social \nSecurity.\n  How much time is remaining on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas has 3 minutes. The \nSenator from New Jersey has 5 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If the Senator from New Jersey would be willing to \nyield back his time, I would be willing to yield back at this time and \nask for the yeas and nays at the appropriate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield my time in fairness to the Senator from \nKansas. I am going to, obviously, oppose the amendment.\n  I yield the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2176\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2176.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2176.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the March 30, 1998 edition \nof the Record.)\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask that the following Senators be added \nto this amendment: Senators Daschle, Sarbanes, Murray, Johnson, \nKennedy, Bingaman, and Landrieu.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in picking up where the Senator from \nKansas left off, I think it is important when we recommend a priority, \nwe figure out a way to pay for it.\n\n[[Page S3041]]\n\n  I am going to give you and my colleagues in the U.S. Senate an \nopportunity to cut funding, which is what the Senator from Kansas is \nvery concerned about, out of the Government travel budget--cut that \nfunding by one-tenth of 1 percent--and take those funds away from \ntraveling bureaucrats and put them into after-school programs.\n  I know you are a family man with many children and grandchildren. \nOften we talk about the joys of parenting and grandparenting. I think \nwe all are concerned not only about our own children and grandchildren, \nbut about America's children. I believe that is true across the party \nline.\n  I think if we ask ourselves the question right now, right here, what \nour children will be doing after school today, I really do not think \nthe answer would come back in a way that satisfies us as U.S. Senators, \nas parents, as grandparents, and, frankly, as community members. \nUnfortunately, many of our children after school have no place to go, \nare alone, get into trouble with gang members, or are lured into gangs. \nFrankly, if you look at the crime statistics, which I will show you \nlater on a chart, the highest crime rate among juveniles occurs from 3 \nto 6 p.m.\n  Here, we have an opportunity with this amendment, which I am very \nproud to offer today, to take a stand to fund up to 500 after-school \nprograms for our children and to cut out unnecessary Government travel. \nIt seems to me it is a choice that, as my children say, is a ``no-\nbrainer.'' It makes sense.\n  If you look at the faces of these children, and just look at their \nhands that they are holding up to answer a question--this is an after-\nschool program in Sacramento, Sacramento START, which I have seen. You \ncan see in the faces of these children that they are interested, that \nthey are engaged, that they are involved, that they are learning. \nClearly, being in this program after school means they are not alone, \nthey are not getting into trouble, they are not sitting home alone \nwatching television, waiting for a working parent to arrive.\n  I want to show you some other photos of these children. Here is \nanother one from Sacramento START. This program, which my amendment \nencourages, includes drug counseling and anticrime measures. They \ninvite policemen and firemen and businesspeople in. Here you can see \nthe children engaged with this police officer; they are very engaged in \nwhat he is explaining to them.\n  I am going to show you a couple of other photographs of these \nchildren.\n  Here is one from the city of Oakland's after-school program. It is a \nmusic after-school program where the children are preteens. We talk a \nlot about preventing teenage pregnancy and the need for abstinence and \nthe need for our children to understand that their self-esteem is \nimportant to them. Here we see the faces of these children and how they \nare engaged in this music program. Why? Because there was some funding \nthat they scraped together to put together an after-school program. \nThese programs are holding together in a very difficult way, and they \nwant to see the National Government get involved.\n  Here is another photo. This one is from Sacramento, also. You can see \nthat this is an environmental lesson. They have, it looks like, a \ncrocodile. The children are engaged in learning about science.\n  We love our children in this country. We cannot afford to abandon \nthem just because the school bell rings at 3 o'clock. Our \nresponsibility does not end at 3 o'clock.\n  Let me show you the crime statistics.\n  When do juvenile offenders commit violent crimes? You can see the \nspike up at 3 p.m., and it doesn't begin even turning down until 6 p.m.\n  If we overlay on this chart after-school programs that keep our \nchildren busy, we can see the real need for these programs. I might add \nthat the victims of these crimes are also juveniles. The victims and \nthe perpetrators of these crimes are juveniles.\n  I think when we support such an amendment as this, we are not only \ngoing to increase the academic performance of our children across the \nboard--and I will explain that--but we also absolutely take a step \nforward to reducing the crime rate.\n  Mr. President, I ask that you let me know when I have 3 minutes \nremaining in my presentation.\n  Let's see what some law enforcement people are saying about after-\nschool programs. This is a proclamation signed by Fight Crime: Invest \nin Kids. Fight Crime is made up of 170 of the Nation's leading police \nchiefs, sheriffs and prosecutors, and the presidents of the Fraternal \nOrder of Police and the International Union of Police Associations, \nwhich together represent 360,000 police officers. Let's hear what they \nsay about the need for after school programs.\n\n       No one knows better than we----\n\n  The law enforcement people----\n\n     that the most important weapons against crime are the \n     investments which keep kids from becoming criminals--\n     investments which enable all children to get the right start \n     they need to become contributing citizens, and which show \n     them that, as adults, they will be able to meet their \n     families' basic needs through honest hard work.\n\n  What else is being said? Further:\n\n       We therefore call on all public officials to protect public \n     safety by adopting commonsense policies to . . . provide for \n     all of America's school-age children and teens, after-school \n     programs.\n\n  So if you are pro--and this is important--pro-law enforcement, let us \nnot turn our backs on law enforcement, who is urging us provide \n``after-school programs and access to weekend and summer programs that \noffer recreation, academic support and community service experience.''\n  Let's see what the police chief of Los Angeles has said.\n\n       Police leaders know America's commitment to putting \n     criminals in jail must be matched by its commitment to \n     keeping kids from becoming criminals in the first place.\n\n  We are at a turning point in our country. We now know how important \nour children are to our future. We now know that if we invest in them, \nwe save 10 times, 20 times on the other end when they are good \ncitizens, when they learn, when they have self-esteem, when they get \nhelp with their homework. These are all important things that will \nhappen from my amendment.\n  Remember, if you want to fight crime, this is certainly one way to do \nit.\n  What do we say in our amendment? We say that local school districts \nshould design the program to meet the local needs. They will be \ncompeting with other local districts across this country. If we get a \ngreat application from Ohio and it brings in the police and it brings \nin the business community and it brings in the local college, all of \nthose things will give that program higher scores. We say that the \nschools must offer at least two of the following activities: academic \nassistance; mentoring; recreational activities; or technology training. \nThey have the option of offering any of the following in their program: \ndrug, alcohol and gang prevention programs; health and nutrition \ncounseling; or job skills preparation.\n  We also believe that this amendment is setting our Nation on the \nright track. Across the country we pay millions and billions of dollars \nfor school facilities. We do not use these facilities after school. We \nput a lock on the door because it is 3 o'clock. So what happens? Our \nkids leave those buildings and they get in trouble. Then we wonder why \nwe have to build more prisons for our society.\n  I would love to see us break this pattern of partisanship today. This \nis not a program that is new. Education is not new. These programs are \nout there already. They are working. If we in fact believe that our \nchildren are important--the Boxer amendment simply says cut out travel \nfor the bureaucrats. They can take a little less travel. Put it into \nthe classroom after school. Our children face many more risks today \nthan our children faced when I was growing up. We know that. We know \nabout drugs. We know about gangs. We know about the war of after-school \nhours. We know from our crime fighters that we need to get these kids \noff the streets.\n\n  I want to tell you about LA's Best after-school enrichment program. \nThere are 5,000 students in 24 elementary schools who participate. LA's \nBest children, well, they just like school a lot more. I have been \nthere. I have seen them. I invite anyone to go there. Some of these \nschools are in tough neighborhoods and some of them are in less tough \nneighborhoods. But the results of this program show that the\n\n[[Page S3042]]\n\nchildren who participate like school more. Their grades significantly \nimprove. They show positive behavioral changes. There is less crime at \nLA's Best schools. LA's Best children feel safe.\n  Let's hear what the children say. We always talk here about how we \nlove our children. Let's hear what they say.\n\n       LA's Best is the best place to be after school. I like the \n     games and the work. I like going to the computer lab and I \n     like going to the Library. But most of all I like the people.\n\n  Another child says:\n\n       If we didn't have LA's Best, I would probably still be \n     going home to an empty house.\n\n  We used to call those kids latchkey children, home alone after \nschool.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, let me tell you about Sacramento START.\n  I will close here and reserve my time.\n  The children in Sacramento START are showing a 75 percent increase in \ntheir grades because they are getting help with their homework, \ntutoring and mentoring, and they feel good about their lives when they \ngo to Sacramento START. The homework of these children has improved--by \n85 percent in quality and completion.\n  Why would we not step in to support these important programs? The \nPresident has suggested in his budget that we do so, in a much larger \nway. This is a small, small measure here, cutting out one-tenth of 1 \npercent of the Government travel budget and putting it into programs \nsuch as Sacramento START, such as a program like we have in the \nTenderloin district in San Francisco, such as LA's Best, and give our \nkids something to say yes to.\n  Here is the closing photograph, because to me it says it all. This is \na beautiful photograph from a program in the Tenderloin district in San \nFrancisco. These are kids after school, loving what they have there in \nthat after-school program, enjoying their life, being kept busy \nlearning, and it shows on their faces.\n  I hope we will have an overwhelming vote for this. I hope we will \nbreak down this terrible partisanship that is dominating today and cast \na vote for our kids, cut our Government travel, go home and feel a \nlittle bit better about what we are doing here.\n  I yield the floor. Actually, I will reserve the few moments that I \nhave.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If the request could be deferred.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I defer that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, how much time do the proponents of the \namendment have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 1 minute 23 \nseconds.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. So the Senator is yielding me 1 minute?\n  Mrs. BOXER. If my colleague would like to support this amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will support it because I think it is a terrific \namendment. I commend the distinguished Senator from California for her \nleadership. Too many kids spend more of their waking hours without \nsupervision, without constructive activity, and it is only in school \nthat they are able to have some supervision that makes sense. As many \nas 5 million kids are home alone after school each week. The prospect \nof a child alone without proper supervision is sometimes too grim to \neven think about when we think about those who would molest them, those \nwho would invade the privacy of the home, those kids who might get \ntheir hands on a weapon. We have seen what happens there.\n\n  I want to see that this amendment carries. It puts things in proper \nfocus. We talk here constantly about children and about how important \nthey are in our lives and what it means to every one of us. Anybody who \nhas been a parent, a grandparent, niece or nephew, aunt or uncle, knows \nabout the relationships that children need and require in terms of \ntheir growth and development.\n  So I support the amendment of the Senator from California. We want to \nmake sure there are quality after-school programs. The kids who do have \ngood programs can do better in their schoolwork, get along better with \ntheir peers. I think it is a great amendment, and I want to see it pass \neven modestly if it passes. It doesn't have to be overwhelming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired for the proponents. The \nopponents have 15 minutes remaining.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask it be in order for Senator Specter \nto proceed with an amendment that he has, and that time in opposition \nto the Boxer amendment, which is 15 minutes, be retained to be used by \nthe opponents subsequent to the debate as agreed to heretofore on the \nSpecter amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. May I ask the chairman a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Of course.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. Chairman, I know you are reserving your time to speak \non the Boxer amendment. I am hoping to get back when you do that.\n  Would it be possible for me to just take 1 of your 15 minutes, \nbecause I don't know where you are going to come out on this, but just \nso I can at least have 1 minute to respond?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure, when I said the opposition will have 15 minutes, \nwe will have 14 and we will give 1 of them to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is very sweet of you. I appreciate that, Mr. \nChairman. I hope maybe we are not in opposition, maybe we can come to \nagreement on this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2254, as modified\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I call amendment No. 2254.\n  Mr. President, before the amendment is read, I ask unanimous consent \nI be permitted to modify the amendment. What I intend to do here is to \nchange the source of the funding for an additional $2 billion for the \nNational Institutes of Health. Instead of taking it from the tobacco \nreserve fund--instead, to have an across-the-board cut of four-tenths \nof 1 percent. That is the modification which I seek to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection to the modification.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Did I understand the distinguished Senator to say that \nhe had no objection to the modification?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I did say that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the modification \nnot be read because it simply strikes certain lines, which will be \nunintelligible, but the import of it is to have a four-tenths of 1 \npercent cut across the board.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 17, line 9, increase the amount by $2,000,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 10, increase the amount by $2,000,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 8, decrease the amount by $2,000,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 9, decrease the amount by $2,000,000,000.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I compliment the managers of the bill, especially my \ndistinguished colleague Senator Domenici, for his very prodigious work \non this budget and the budgets in the years that I have been here, \ngoing back to 1981.\n  I offer an amendment to what Senator Domenici has done with some \ntrepidation, but I do so because I think it is a very important matter, \nand I offer this amendment really in my capacity as chairman of the \nappropriations subcommittee which has jurisdiction over the funding for \nHealth and Human Services and for the National Institutes of Health.\n  As I read the budget resolution with my expert staff, there is not \nfunding for the subcommittee to be able to add funds for the National \nInstitutes of Health. The distinguished chairman\n\n[[Page S3043]]\n\nand I have had some disagreement on the import of the budget \nresolution, but as I read it, with my experts on the staff, there is \nonly $350 million for outlays, which would not accommodate the kind of \nincrease which this Senate is on record as being committed to.\n  Last year, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution was adopted to double NIH \nfunding over the next 5 years, and that has been a rallying cry and one \nwith which I agree. Were that standard to be met, it would mean more \nthan $2.5 billion a year.\n  Notwithstanding that amendment having been adopted for fiscal year \n1998, the year we are in, when the Budget Committee returned last \nyear's budget, the health account was cut by $100 million. Therefore, \nSenator Harkin, my distinguished ranking member on the subcommittee, \nand I had set a target of a 7.5 percent increase for NIH, which is a \ngood bit below the doubling over 5 years. We thought that was all we \ncould afford.\n  We then offered an amendment, similar to the one now being offered, \nfor an across-the-board cut to enable us to increase NIH funding by \n$1.1 billion. That amendment was defeated 63 to 37, so that when it \ncame to expressing our druthers, or our preferences, we were very \ngenerous as a Senate body, and said we would double NIH funding over 5 \nyears, or more than $2.5 billion a year. But when it came time to \nspecify where the money was going to come from and have a hard dollar \namount, that was defeated, as I say, 63 to 37. We are very generous \nwith our druthers, but we are not very generous with our dollars.\n  We had a hearing, coincidentally, just yesterday in our regular \nquarter for the experts at the National Institutes of Health to come in \nand testify about the grants which are made, about 28 percent of those \nwhich are offered, and there would be a very, very substantial \nadditional number of grants awarded if the additional funds were there.\n  We have a total budget of $1.7 trillion. I believe that it is a \nmatter of assessing our priorities. It is my submission in this \namendment, with my distinguished ranking member, Senator Harkin, that \nwe ought to up the ante by at least $2 billion. I know that when it \ncomes across the board, it is goring a lot of oxen, and there will be \nmany who will object because it comes out of their funds. If we are \ngoing to articulate our priority for NIH, then we ought to put our \nmoney where our mouths are and put up the money to actually fund it.\n  I changed the thrust of the amendment, as noted, to move away from \nthe tobacco reserve fund, because that is a giant pot we are talking \nabout on the tobacco settlement, but I think it is pie in the sky. It \nis questionable, speculative, and perhaps doubtful that those funds \nwill be realized.\n  In making the plans for our subcommittee, I want to know where we \nstand. That is why we are talking about hard dollars in this amendment. \nIt is not too hard to say, ``Well, we'll get it from the tobacco \nreserve fund, because it really is highly speculative as to whether it \nwill ever exist.''\n  I believe that with the identification of many of the genes by the \nNational Institutes of Health, we are on the brink of conquering \ncancer, on the brink of conquering Alzheimer's, on the brink of \nconquering Parkinson's, on the brink of conquering heart disease, on \nthe brink of conquering AIDS, on the brink of conquering many of the \nmaladies which afflict mankind, but it takes dollars.\n  When you allow 28 percent of the grants, that means 72 percent of the \ndoors are closed; 72 percent which are not allowed. If we open those \ndoors, I think we will be enormously productive in seeing to it that we \nmake the maximum effort to pursue breast cancer and prostate cancer and \ncervical cancer and Alzheimer's and a long list of maladies which \nconfront us at the present time.\n  That is the essence of the amendment, Mr. President. I know my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Harkin, wishes some time, so let me \ninquire at this point how much time is left on the 15 minutes of \nallocation.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Eight minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I will have printed in the Record a \n``Dear Colleague'' letter on the amendment which I had intended to \noffer, as I described earlier, opening the tobacco reserve to permit it \nto be used for biomedical research. This letter was circulated on March \n31, 1998, cosigned by Senator Harkin, Senator Boxer, Senator Hollings, \nand myself. We had a list of some 18 cosponsors to Senate Resolution \n170, which was a sense-of-the-Senate resolution which I had submitted \nearlier in the session.\n  It had been my intention to have a freestanding sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution to increase NIH funding by $2 billion. I had made an effort, \nwith the cooperation of our distinguished majority leader, to have that \nlisted as a freestanding resolution which I had hoped to bring to a \nvote before the budget resolution came up. We had anticipated voting on \nit on Monday or Tuesday, but it was not cleared. So we did not have an \nopportunity to bring up that resolution.\n  The point of the resolution was to see how many people would say, as \na matter of druthers or sense of the Senate, that they would support \nit, and contrast it to the number of people who would support the hard-\ndollar transfer. I do not know--the budget resolution moves so fast--\nhow many more of the 18 who are cosponsors of Senate Resolution 170, \nwhich is sense of the Senate, will join here. These four Senators on \nthis letter support increasing biomedical research by $2 billion.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe ``Dear Colleague'' letter to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 31, 1998.\n       Dear Colleague: We intend to offer an amendment to expand \n     the tobacco reserve fund to permit funding to be used for \n     biomedical research. In addition this amendment would also \n     expand the reserve to allow funds to be used for anti-tobacco \n     education and prevention, counter-advertising, smoking \n     cessation, transition assistance programs for tobacco \n     farmers, and other public health research and prevention \n     programs. The Senate is on record regarding doubling the \n     funding over the next five years for the National Institutes \n     of Health. To do that would require an average annual \n     increase of $2.7 billion. This amendment would make it \n     possible to increase funding for biomedical research by \n     $2,000,000,000 as the first lesser step in reaching the goal \n     of doubling the National Institutes of Health.\n       In the past few years, this nation has seen dramatic \n     research developments that are offering great promise for \n     developing treatments for a host of diseases. These \n     developments have been made possible because Congress has \n     year after year increased the funding to fight the war \n     against disease.\n       There has never been broader bi-partisan support for \n     comprehensive tobacco legislation. We therefore urge our \n     colleagues to join with us in supporting this amendment as \n     the first step toward adopting a tobacco reserve fund which \n     can accommodate enactment of historic legislation to protect \n     the health of this nation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tom Harkin,\n     Ernest Hollings,\n     Arlen Specter.\n     Barbara Boxer.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is a budget year when the total \namount of money available for discretionary spending out of which the \nNIH is funded was agreed to last year in the bipartisan budget \nagreement. It is a total dollar number for all of the Government that \nis not entitlement programs.\n  So it is for education, it is to run the agencies of our Federal \nGovernment, it is for the money the IRS needs to pay its workers, and \non and on.\n  While it is very close to a freeze this year, there is an additional \nbudget authority of $1.9 billion year over year and an additional $6.1 \nbillion in outlays, about one-half percent. For those who say this \nportion of Government is growing dramatically, for the next 4 years, \nbecause of the agreement, it will be growing at about this amount or \nless, literally close to a freeze for a sum total of 4 additional \nyears. Very tough.\n  Nonetheless--nonetheless--the President of the United States, in the \nPresident's budget, provided some restraint\n\n[[Page S3044]]\n\nby way of reductions in expenditures. I will just go through to give \nyou examples. The President's budget, in function 150, international \naffairs, reduced that total function by $530 million; function 300, \nthat is the environment, a $260 million reduction; function 350, \nagriculture, $240 million; function 370, housing and commerce, that is \n$640 million; function 400, a $1.25 billion reduction.\n  They go on all the way through. And the sum total in cuts is $7.83 \nbillion. That means the President provided room for programs that he \nwanted and reduced these. What we have done in our budget resolution is \nwe have taken these reductions but we have given different priorities \nto how we would spend the money.\n  I want to say to my good friend, Senator Specter, there is no one \nhere who, when it comes right down to being in the trenches where you \nprovide money for NIH, there is nobody who has been more of a leader \nthan he. And, frankly, his subcommittee, which covers a myriad of \nprograms--education, NIH, and on and on--is a subcommittee that is \nconstantly under pressure.\n  I am not going to suggest, as some, that it always needs more and \nmore money. Rather, I will say it is under difficult pressure because \nof the kinds of programs they have to fund. Having said that, in the \nbudget resolution, where we have some responsibility to establish \npriorities, somebody else follows us and perhaps can change some, but \nwe know that their subcommittee has most of the priorities that we are \nfor and that he would like to fund. There is no other function with \nmore priorities, other than perhaps the function of defense, which \nstands there singularly all the time.\n  What we did, we funded that program, because of its being a priority, \nby increasing significantly the NIH assumption for expenditures. We \nalso increased in that function education because we knew that from the \nRepublican standpoint we wanted to fund the disability program in \neducation, and we wanted to fund some flexibility programs for the \nStates so they could do some things on their own, being relieved of \nsome mandates that we had given them.\n  In that alignment and that set of determining where we spend money \nand with that backdrop, we have provided in this budget resolution a \nlarger increase in NIH, in the assumption for NIH--the assumption; the \nbudget resolution isn't binding--we have provided the largest increase \nof any domestic program that is appropriated. That amount is $1.5 \nbillion in the first year. That is an 11 percent increase. Then, in \nestimating our assumptions for the remaining 4 years, we increase that \na total of $15.5 billion for the premier institution researching health \nin the world--the American National Institutes of Health.\n  We do not determine in the budget resolution which of the numerous \nNIH activities get what amount of money. I have been to the \nsubcommittee with the distinguished chairman presiding, making a very \nstrong, strong pitch that we put more money in researching mental \nillness. He recalls that. We were able over the years to raise those \nkinds of institutes to a level of funding where I can give you two or \nthree which are now on the cutting edge again and which have excited \nyoung scientists and the very best to get into fields they might not \nhave that are critical to our solving some of the enormous problems of \nthe suffering of human beings, not only Americans but humans.\n\n  So I am an advocate. But I guess I would say, in a tight budget, \n``Enough is enough.'' And $1.5 billion is enough; $15.5 billion over 5 \nyears is enough. And I cannot do any better. I cannot make the funding \nany more sure in a budget resolution than I have done in this budget \nresolution. If Senator Specter is to prevail, we cannot assure anyone \nthat the desired level of NIH funding will be what Senator Specter \nassumes by his amendment, because he is once again going to be back \ninto the competition of taking all the money that his committee gets, \nand deciding among hundreds of programs how much the NIH gets. So that \nis one side of this coin.\n  Now, with every coin, there are two sides. When you add, you have to \ntake away. Because the distinguished Senator did not try to break the \nbudget. He did not try to break the caps, because he pledged last \nyear--and he kept his pledge--that we would stay on this path of a \nbalanced budget and the caps.\n  There are some who would like to break the caps for any good \nproposal. The distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania is not doing \nthat. He is saying, let us cut other domestic programs to pay for the \nnew increase over and above the $1.5 billion that we provided. And the \nSenator included defense in the .4 percent cut. So defense gets cut \nacross the board, and domestic programs get cut across the board. So \ndefense gets cut $1.1 billion over 1 year in order to pay for this $2 \nbillion increase. I will just tick off some so everybody knows. The \nveterans get a $76 million reduction; the environment gets an $89 \nmillion reduction; agriculture, because it is smaller, gets a $17 \nmillion reduction; transportation, $160 million; and on and on.\n  It may very well be that the U.S. Senate today wants to say, in \naddition to what the budget resolution contains, with all the other \nprograms being restrained dramatically, that in order to give it $2 \nbillion more, we ought to do these things, including cutting defense \n$1.1 billion. I do not believe the Senate will do that. But if they \nchoose to do that, then obviously the appropriators will have to give \nthat every consideration. I do not see how we can do the defense one, \nbecause we are already having a very difficult time meeting the defense \nneeds with the numbers that are in the budget and the firewall that \nprotects.\n  Let me just share a thought with the distinguished Senator. I say to \nSenator Specter, you said you want to do this to defense also. I would \nlike you to think about that, because if you do, then I believe the \nfirewall prevails and you may have a supermajority requirement. But I \nleave that to you; that is not for me.\n  Having said what I have said, I do not want to detract from the fact \nthat the National Institutes of Health are a fabulous community of the \nbest scientists in the world. When you really look at what they are \ndoing, they are on a course to cure many, many aspects of human \nsuffering and human disease. When you add to what they are doing in the \nnormal research, you add something like the genome mapping, the mapping \nof all the chromosomes of the human body, and those are being looked at \nin terms of their relationship to disease. You have a formidable group \nof scientists and research equipment moving in a path of, perhaps, what \nmay be called the generation yet to come, which will be a wellness \ngeneration. That could be, when the dread diseases are no more.\n\n  So I don't want to sound like this is just a typical entity. It is a \nvery prominent and important one. I do believe, consistent with limited \nresources and because we have to tax our people, we have limited \nresources. Some think they are taxed too much already. I believe the \nbudget resolution treats this formidable research community fairly \nwell.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six and a half minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I may have the attention of the \ndistinguished chairman, Senator Harkin has made a request to have 5 \nminutes reserved and he is at another hearing. I wonder if we might \naccommodate him at a later time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You have 5 minutes remaining?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will try to work it in.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my distinguished colleague and friend, Senator \nDomenici, for his comments. He has enumerated programs which will be \ncut. It is a matter of priorities.\n  When he has recited there is an assumption of $1.5 billion for the \nNational Institutes of Health, I have to disagree, because the Budget \nCommittee assumes only an outlay increase of $350 million over the \nlevel from fiscal year 1998. There are also increases in education and \nchild care programs. So there could not possibly be an increase at NIH \nwith an increase of only $350 million in outlays.\n  As Senator Domenici has recited a number of cuts, let me just recite \na\n\n[[Page S3045]]\n\npartial list of the people who come to me as chairman of this \nsubcommittee, who want increases in funding for breast cancer, cervical \ncancer, colon cancer, Alzheimer's disease, cystic fibrosis, diabetes--\nincluding juvenile diabetes--kidney ailments, amyotrophic lateral \nsclerosis, Parkinson's, schizophrenia, scleroderma, epilepsy, heart \ndisease, prostate cancer, pulmonary disorders, AIDS, osteoporosis, \nHuntington's disease, to mention only a few.\n  The fact is that many Senators receive awards from Alzheimer's or \nParkinson's or AIDS, et cetera. This is a matter of priority, pure and \nsimple.\n  Senator Domenici is a valued member of the committee. He and I sit \nnext to each other on the Appropriations Committee, have for years, and \nhe comes and talks about mental illness programs. We have accommodated \nthat as a very high priority. That is what the Senator has to do, \nestablish the priorities. I say that it is worth the four-tenths of 1 \npercent cut across the board for this high priority for the National \nInstitutes of Health.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I reserve the remainder of my time, and I ask unanimous \nconsent the 3 minutes remaining in opposition and 5 minutes remaining \nby the proponent be retained subsequent to the debate on the Kennedy \namendment, which will start now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2183\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question now is the Kennedy \namendment numbered 2183.\n  The Senator has 15 minutes to explain his amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  This sense of the Senate is very, very simple and, I believe, \nextraordinarily compelling. I find it difficult to understand why it \nwould not be accepted.\n  I think the best way to really explain it is to go through the \namendment itself, because it is so simple and so compelling. All we are \nsaying is that it is a sense of the Senate that we should pass a \npatient's bill of rights.\n  It says that Congress finds that patients lack reliable information \nabout health plans and the quality of care that health plans provide. \nWe have had demonstrated this through a number of different hearings in \nthe Labor Committee and in other Committees. Secondly, it says that \nexperts agree that the quality of health care can be substantially \nimproved, resulting in less illness and less premature death. We have \nheard this statement or similar statements from the business community, \nfrom the provider community, in hearings before the Presidential \nCommission and the Labor Committee, and in many peer-reviewed journal \narticles written by experts in the field of quality measurement and \nimprovement. No one can argue with this finding.\n\n  Third, this amendment finds that some managed care plans have created \nobstacles for patients who need to see specialists on an ongoing basis \nand that some have required women to get permission from their primary \ncare physician before seeing a gynecologist. These were central \nfindings, again, of the President's Commission on the Quality of Health \nCare and, again, these rights are overwhelmingly supported by the \nAmerican people and by the doctors and other professionals who care for \nthem.\n  Fourth, this amendment finds that a majority of consumers believe \nthat health plans compromise their quality of care to save money. One \nstudy shows an astonishing 80 percent of the American people have \nreached that conclusion. All you have to do is see the movie ``As Good \nAs It Gets,'' and see Helen Hunt's extraordinary performance. Attend \nany movie theater in this country if you have any questions on this \nparticular issue, and they will be resolved.\n  Fifth, this amendment finds that the Federal preemption under the \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 prevents States from \nenforcing protections for 125 million workers and their families \nreceiving health insurance through the employer-based group health \nplans. This factual statement has been repeatedly confirmed by the U.S. \nDepartment of Labor and by the courts. In fact, Federal judges have \npleaded with Congress to fix ERISA. State insurance commissioners see \nthese problems on a daily basis, but their hands are tied with respect \nto these plans. There is no reason at all to maintain this special \nexclusion for one group of health plans. Those who make medical \ndecisions that result in death or injury must be held accountable for \nthose decisions.\n  Sixth, Mr. President, the Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection \nand Quality in the Health Care Industry has unanimously recommended a \npatient's bill of rights to protect patients against abuses by health \nplans and health insurers. Let me repeat this--the President's \nCommission, which included representation from health plans, \ncorporations, consumers, providers and others, unanimously recommended \nthat each patient be accorded the protections reported in their Bill of \nRights. Regardless of whether they receive their health insurance \nthrough an employer or on their own.\n  So, this sense of the Senate says that the assumption underlying this \nresolution provides for enactment of legislation to establish a \npatient's bill of rights for participants in health plans. Then, Mr. \nPresident, we point out very briefly exactly what those protections \nought to be, and if there are Members in the Senate who want to differ \nwith these, I welcome the opportunity to debate those or discuss them.\n  This amendment says that our legislation should include the following \nprovisions.\n  First, a guarantee of access to covered services, including emergency \ncare, specialty care, gynecological care for women, and prescription \ndrugs. Does anyone really dispute that we ought to be able to ensure \npatients have access to the coverage and health care that they have \npaid for?\n  Second, provisions to ensure the special needs of women are met, \nincluding protecting women from being forced to endure drive-through \nmastectomies. There are more than half a dozen Members of the Senate \nwho have various pieces of legislation to address that particular need. \nThis sense of the Senate refers to those efforts.\n  Third, provisions to ensure the special needs of children are met, \nincluding access to pediatric specialists and centers of pediatric \nexcellence.\n  Mr. President, this is an extremely important and significant need. \nAll you have to do is listen to parents and pediatricians. Senator Reed \nis a leader in this particular issue. We know the kinds of challenges \nthat exist, particularly for newborn babies. It used to be that 90 \npercent of the kinds of health difficulties that newborns faced were \nexcluded from any coverage of health insurance.\n  Some insurance forms say any particular needs of a child that occur \nwithin the first 10 days of life ``will be outside the coverage of this \ninsurance policy.'' The fact of the matter is that 90 percent of the \ndifficulties occur during that period of time. But so many mothers do \nnot know that. We are still facing very, very important needs in terms \nof protecting children in this country.\n  Four, provisions to ensure that special needs of individuals with \ndisabilities and the chronically ill are met, including the possibility \nof standing referrals to specialists or the ability to have specialists \nact as the primary care provider.\n  Forcing a patient who has a legitimate need to see a specialist to \njump through extra hoops before every appointment is counter-productive \nand more expensive in the long run. Persons with disabilities and \nchronic illnesses face these kinds of challenges every single day. They \ncan cite chapter and verse about the various exclusions and barriers \nthey face--not just physical barriers, but barriers put up by their \nhealth insurance. They have special needs and they need special \nprotections.\n  Five, a procedure to hold health plans accountable for decisions and \na procedure to provide for appeal of a health care decision to an \nindependent impartial reviewer.\n  This is to make sure that when these accountants in many of the \ninsurance companies say ``no'' to a patient--say that they are not \nentitled to that particular health care service--there is an appeal \nprocedure that can bring about a timely and independent decision. I \nwon't take the time now, nor do I have the time, to point out the \nnumber of\n\n[[Page S3046]]\n\nindividuals who have lost their lives or been permanently disabled \nbecause the plan's accountant or an insurance executive turned thumbs \ndown on a procedure recommended by the treating physician.\n  Six, measures to protect the integrity of the physician-patient \nrelationship, including a ban on gag clauses and on improper incentive \narrangements.\n  We have had testimony time and again that says that doctors cannot \ntell the patients about all of their options because the plan denies \nthem the chance to do so. That is absolutely, completely wrong. We have \nother instances where doctors have moved ahead and prescribed expensive \ntreatment, only to effectively be dropped from the panels of various \nHMO's. We want to protect the physicians in these circumstances. We \nwant to permit the physicians to be able to do what they should be able \nto do, and that is to be able to practice medicine to the best of their \nabilities.\n  Finally, measures to provide greater information about health plans \nto patients and improve quality care.\n  Mr. President, that is the sum and substance of this amendment. I \nreally question how anyone can take issue with the findings and how \nanyone can take issue with the kinds of protections that we believe \nought to be accepted by the Senate and included in a patients' bill of \nrights.\n  This particular measure has the strong support of the American \nMedical Association, and of the AFL-CIO. It has the support of the \nNational Breast Cancer Coalition; it has the support of Families USA; \nit has the support of the mental health community, including the \nNational Alliance for Mental Illness, the National Mental Health \nAssociation and the American Psychological Association; it has the \nsupport of the Consumers Union and countless other consumer and patient \ngroups representing hundreds of thousands of people.\n  So I hope that we can have this measure accepted as a sense of the \nSenate on this budget, and then we will go about the business of \ndebating on the floor of the U.S. Senate the actual legislation that \nincorporates these provisions. If some Senators have better ideas and \nthey want to adjust or change something, we will have the opportunity \nto do so. But let's go on record at this time, on this occasion, to say \nthat we want to make sure that the patients in this country are going \nto be guaranteed the kind of protections that we would want for every \nmember of our families, and that we are going to put health care needs \nfirst, rather than the bottom line of the health insurance industry. \nLet's say that we are going to permit our doctors, not industry \naccountants, to practice medicine.\n\n  Mr. President, I withhold the rest of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time remains on the proponents' \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes remain.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There is a total of 15 on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Don Nickles is on the way. I want to discuss \nthe issue a little bit with the Senate.\n  Mr. President, my good friend, the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts, said that he doesn't know how anyone could disagree with \nthese findings--the findings of a national commission appointed by the \nPresident. Well, just so everyone understands, the very commission made \nthe findings, and then the commission itself split on whether they \nshould be put in law or not. So I say, with reference to a sense of the \nSenate and whether we ought to adopt them in law, at least we ought to \nstart with the premise that half of a commission was concerned about \nthe broad picture of health care costs in America and other things and \nsuggested that perhaps it would be better not to put them in law but to \nhandle them some other way.\n  Let me talk a little bit about the upside of what is going on in \nAmerica with reference to health care costs during this very short era \nwhen we have moved away from fee for service toward managed care and \nHMOs. In doing that, let me hearken back to the joy that permeates this \nbody and the American people when they hear that we have the budget \nunder control. We are in an era of balance.\n  Mr. President, it is almost unequivocal that had we not gone to \nmanaged care and HMOs, we would not be celebrating a balanced budget \ntoday. That is because under the other system--and I note that the \ndoctors support regulating HMOs more--but under the doctor system, up, \nup and away went the costs. We had 3 or 4 years when the Federal \nGovernment's accounts that paid for health care were going up, \ncompounded in double digits every year, which meant that in short order \nyou would not be able to pay for Medicare, you would not be able to \nafford Medicaid because, even if we had the ability to borrow and \nborrow and incur debt, the States would not have been able to pay for \nit. So let's make sure that everybody understands this short era of \nmoving to managed care and HMOs has brought within the reach of many, \nmany Americans and many American businesses health care coverage they \ncould not have afforded under the old system.\n  As a matter of fact, it was interesting. As I listened to my friend \nfrom Massachusetts, I thought about a couple of speeches I gave when we \nwere talking about our not being competitive with Japan on automobiles. \nI was able to say to audiences that one of the reasons we are not \ncompetitive is because the automobile is carrying around in the trunk \nfour times the health care costs the Japanese car is, because our \nhealth costs were so enormous as compared with theirs. I am not \nsuggesting theirs is as good as ours, but neither am I suggesting that \nours is four times better than theirs.\n  So I think when we talk about tying HMOs and managed care into some \nkind of rigidity in an effort to solve some problems that may be solved \notherwise, we better be careful as to how much we do and how much we \nmandate versus how much we handle in other ways in an effort to get \nquality.\n  I also indicate, just by way of an observation, that it is a lot \neasier to find the shortcomings of HMOs and managed care than it was \nthe old system, because this one is all focused in on management \nrunning a system. Before, it was hundreds and hundreds of doctors. To \nbe able to focus on the lack of quality care is much easier. That works \nboth ways. It is good because it calls it to our attention. But it \nought to be easier to get quality care than it was before without \nhaving to write it into rigid law.\n  I note the presence of my friend, the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  I want to close by just saying that before we make it so impossible \nfor managed care and health care to control costs within reason and \ndeliver health care, everybody should understand that whatever we do we \nought to get quality at the best price. We ought not get quality at the \nexpense of those who are paying for it, and at the expense of the U.S. \nGovernment. That is what I think ultimately we should do when we get \ndown to trying to legislate. This isn't legislating. It is just us \ngiving our opinion and our ideas as a Senate. When it comes right down \nto it, that is what we are going to be talking about sincerely in our \ncommittees and on the floor.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 9 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. On the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of this resolution. Members of the \nSenate and the House often wonder about America and the districts and \nStates, and try to perceive the issues that American families really \ncare about. I invite the Members of the Senate to go to the movie \ntheater and see ``As Good As It Gets,'' with the top actor award\n\n[[Page S3047]]\n\ngoing to Jack Nicholson and the top actress award going to Helen Hunt. \nAt one point in this movie, Helen Hunt, the mother of an asthmatic \nchild, vents on her beliefs about HMOs and managed care. Do you know \nwhat happens in movie theaters across America? They break out in \napplause--applauding the fact that this poor woman on the screen is \nstruggling with an asthmatic child and is caught up with the \nbureaucracy of managed care.\n  I will concede the point made by the Senator from New Mexico. Managed \ncare is designed to reduce costs. The people who manage these systems \nare trying to reduce costs, reduce services, and, of course, maximize \ntheir profits. The resolution offered by the Senator from Massachusetts \nlooks at it from the perspective of the patient, of the family, and of \nthe physician. Are we going to speak to that as well?\n  This goes beyond the bottom line. This goes to a basic question. If I \ngo into a doctor's office with my wife, myself, or one of my children, \ncan I trust that doctor giving me advice based on his medical education \nand the science that he has available? Or is he telling me that the \noption for my family is one dictated by some manual, some code, some \nbook out of a managed care office in some part of the country that \nbears no relationship to my personal need?\n  That is what this is about--the trust that we need to restore so \npatients seeing doctors know they are getting medical advice and not \ninsurance recommendations.\n  Second, accountability--that these managed care plans are held \naccountable. Today, they dictate to doctors what they will do, the \nprocedures that are allowed, where they will take place, and how long \nthey will last. Forget the patient. We are talking about the bottom \nline. When they make a mistake--and sometimes these mistakes are \nfatal--they are not held accountable under the law.\n  What Senator Kennedy is suggesting here is not only restoring the \ntrust between doctors and patients but also restoring accountability in \nthe system. So that when the managed care clerk off somewhere in Omaha, \nNE, pages through the manual to decide your fate in that hospital bed \nthey are held accountable--not just for the bottom line but what \nhappens to your health, your family, and your future.\n  I am glad we are having this debate. I think this is just the opening \nsalvo.\n  For those who think everybody is rosy in America, American families \ncould care less, and managed care is all perfect, please take a trip to \nthe movie theater and see ``As Good As It Gets.''\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Pennsylvania and the remainder of my time to Senator \nNickles following that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I would just suggest that if you went to a movie theater you would \nnot see a Government-regulated movie because no one would go to it \nbecause it would be of such poor quality. It would be so burdened down \nby bureaucracy and red tape, because it simply could not produce the \nquality that the free market produces.\n  There have been dramatic changes in health care. This continues every \nday. I met the other day with the chairman of the national board that \ncertifies health care plans. She told me they are constantly updating \nquality standards, constantly updating to see whether patients are \ngetting the kind of care and access through these plans that are \ncertified. It is important to let this dynamic system of health care \noperate in the system of the free market which has brought us so far. \nDo not burden it down with all sorts of bells and whistles and \nbureaucracies and red tape that will just stifle innovation, stifle \nquality, stifle progress in medicine, result in more uninsured, result \nin less comprehensive care. This is about patients.\n  Look, I am not a great fan of managed health care. But I am a fan of \nthe marketplace working and getting the response. I would suspect that \nthe Senator from Illinois knows that there are managers of health care \ncompanies who probably saw that movie. In fact, they didn't have to see \nthat movie. For years, they have been coming to my office--and I know \noffices around this Capitol--and they have been going out in America \ngetting the message. The Senator is right. A lot of people are upset \nabout managed care. I am not a big fan of it, but I understand that, in \ntime, the marketplace, the employers, and the employees will work much \nmore effectively through that place in changing the system to produce \nquality where people will go somewhere else. Employers will go \nsomewhere else. In fact, they are already. It is working out there. It \ntakes time.\n  What we don't need to freeze in place is some Government standard \nimplemented by a bunch of bureaucrats who take 4 years to implement \nregulations to control something that is already out of date. Let the \ndynamism work. Don't put the hand of the Federal Government over the \nsystem that has improved the quality of health care so dramatically for \nso many millions of people. Allow that system to continue to improve. \nAllow that system to continue to grow to serve more people more \ncompassionately. Yes; there are problems. But don't add the ultimate \nproblem--Government suffocation to a dynamic system where ``change'' is \nthe operative word of the day.\n  Senator Kennedy suggests that his bill is supported by the \nPresident's commission. His hand-picked commission does not support the \nlegislation that the Senator has proposed. He would give you that \nimpression. They recommended no legislation. They recommended the \nmarketplace. It is in the process of working. It is working. In many \nareas it is working, and will continue to work. Managed care is still a \nrelatively new thing.\n  Again, I repeat. I am not a big fan of managed care. But it is new. \nIt is improving. Like any new product, it takes time to work out the \nbugs and to get to the point where they are doing the kind of customer \nsatisfaction and quality that we need. But the last thing we need is to \nput the Government in charge of health care plans, the Government in \ncharge of regulating what is quality and what is not. Oh, my goodness. \nCompare any private sector organization on quality. Compare what goes \non at HCFA, at the IRS, or a whole variety of other agencies. Are we \nnow, in Government, the arbiters of quality? Think about that. Do you \nreally want the Government of the United States through their \nregulation process to dictate to you what quality is? I don't think so.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nKennedy amendment, which expresses the sense of the Senate that we \nshould pass legislation establishing a patients' bill of rights.\n  Mr. President, legislation to reform the way health plans often treat \npatients is long overdue. The integrity of the doctor-patient \nrelationship is being whittled away, and that must be stopped. For \nexample, many health plans have gagged their doctors, preventing them \nfrom presenting their patients with all possible treatment options. \nThat's wrong.\n  Mr. President, Democrats have introduced a bill that would remedy \nmany of the problems that consumers are facing in their managed care \nhealth plans. Our bill would put an end to drive-through mastectomies. \nIt would ensure that individuals with disabilities and others with \nspecial needs have direct access to specialists. And it would ensure \nthat children have access to pediatric centers of excellence.\n  Mr. President, the American people are demanding that we enact a \nmanaged care reform bill this year. And that's exactly what Senator \nKennedy's amendment promises we will do. I commend the Senator for \noffering his amendment, and I urge all of my colleagues to vote for it.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want the record to show that while I \nam not supporting the Kennedy amendment, I am supportive of many of the \nprinciples behind this amendment. I took the lead in sponsoring \nlegislation (S. 701) last year to provide Medicare beneficiaries with \nconsumer protections such as: (1) detailed comparative information and \naccess to a 1-800 number for Medicare beneficiaries to choose the best \nhealth plan; (2) an expedited appeals process for urgent cases; (3) a \nprohibition on gag clauses that restrict patient/physician \ncommunications; (4) access to specialty care when needed, with special \nattention to the chronically ill; and (5) limits on the\n\n[[Page S3048]]\n\nuse of financial incentives by managed care plans. Many of these \nprovisions were enacted in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Often, \nMedicare sets the example for the private sector, and this is my hope.\n  I believe consumers should have good information about their health \nplans; that they should have protections in place for a fair and timely \nappeals process; that they should have access to specialty care when \nneeded; and that physicians should be able to discuss all treatment \noptions with their patients.\n  Regulating the private sector is more difficult because regulations \ncost money. These costs are shifted onto employers and ultimately \nemployees. I will want to evaluate proposed legislation based on the \nimpact this will have on employees' health benefits. I do not want to \ndo anything to increase the number of uninsured, which is as much as 41 \nmillion Americans who lack health coverage. I commend my colleague from \nMassachusetts for raising this important issue, but as we all know \n``the devil is in the details.'' I would like this issue to be debated \nand for legislation to be proposed and analyzed thoroughly for any \nunintended consequences to ensure that we are not doing more harm than \ngood. We cannot afford to increase the number of uninsured and must be \ncareful not to hurt those that currently have coverage.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Your side has 5 minutes. The other side has 4 \nminutes.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Generally speaking, Mr. President, the proponents should \ngo last.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will be happy to go. We generally \nalternate back and forth. It doesn't make any difference.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the Kennedy amendment. \nAt a certain point I will be offering a second-degree amendment.\n  Senator Kennedy's amendment--maybe I should read from it. It is a \nsense of the Senate that Congress should pass the bill called the \n``Consumer Bill of Rights,'' I believe.\n  Now, I might mention the Senator introduced this bill 2 nights ago. I \nhave a copy of the bill which was introduced, the companion bill which \nis in the House. It is 68 pages. It is the Federal Government getting \ninvolved in many areas that possibly my colleagues haven't had a chance \nto examine. I know this bill has only been introduced for a couple \ndays, but it is a pretty far-reaching bill. It is a bill that treats \nprivate plans differently than union plans. It is a bill that says we \nin Government know best. It is a bill that has lots and lots of \nmandates. It is a bill that will increase the cost of health care. It \nis a bill that does not track the President's Commission on Quality \nCare.\n  I met with some of the Commission on Quality Care just recently. They \ndidn't have a consensus to legislate. As a matter of fact, there was a \npush by the administration and others that we need to legislate a \npatients' bill of rights. But that was not the consensus of the \ncommission. As a matter of fact, the commission did not recommend \nlegislation. Yet even though the commission, which studied this issue \nfor 10 months, didn't recommend legislation, here comes a bill, 68 \npages, and now, without even having the ink dry on the bill, we have \npeople saying let's pass this.\n  It has a great title. I agree it is a great title. I compliment my \ncolleague from Massachusetts. Boy, any time you say something has a \nbill of rights, it has to be good. Unfortunately, the closer you look \nat this legislation, it is not good. I don't think it is good if you \nincrease costs for patients. I don't think it is good if you increase \nFederal mandates. I don't think it is good if you increase costs to \nwhere a lot of people cannot afford insurance. And I don't think there \nis a relationship between increasing regulations and increasing \nquality. As a matter of fact, it may be inversely related; you may have \nmore Federal regulations and more money and resources that health care \nproviders have, and instead of using those for providing quality, they \nare going to be using them to provide for compliance and health care \nquality goes down.\n  So while I compliment my colleague from Massachusetts for having a \ngreat title on this proposal that is only 2 days old, I don't think the \nCongress should be committing itself to passing it. I think it would be \na serious mistake.\n  I might mention, this is not just the Senator from Oklahoma saying \nthis. I am looking at health care providers who have serious \nreservations. I will just give you one example. This is a quote from \nthe American Hospital Association regarding the bill which was recently \nintroduced:\n\n       However, the President's quality commission confirmed there \n     is no consensus that Federal legislation introduced today by \n     House and Senate Democrats is the way to achieve these best \n     objectives. The AHA believes the private sector can and must \n     meet the challenge to protect consumers and improving the \n     quality of care. Federal legislation should be considered \n     only if all private sector efforts fail.\n\n  We have not even given them a chance. We are saying we know best and \nwe are going to mandate it. We are going to dictate it.\n  Mr. President, I will reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  I am absolutely appalled at the response of our friends and \ncolleagues on the other side. First of all, the President's panel \nunanimously said that these rights ought to be available to every \nAmerican consumer, No. 1.\n  Now, what good does it do to have a right if you don't have a remedy? \nThat is like saying we are for the Bill of Rights but we don't want to \nput it in the Constitution. Come on, Senators. You have to have a \nbetter answer than that. It doesn't hold up.\n  No. 2, this is not our legislation; this is a sense-of-the-Senate. I \nlistened to my friend from Pennsylvania. He is talking about a slogan, \nnot a program. What does he object to in here? Do you object to drive-\nby mastectomies? Do you object to making sure that women are going to \nhave gynecological and obstetrical care? If you do, let's say it. Do \nyou object to being able to get the best information and not have your \ndoctor gagged?\n\n  This is what is in this amendment. This is what is important, not \njust some gray areas. So let's respond to what is in this sense-of-the-\nSenate. We have outlined it. It incorporates what the President's \ncommission unanimously recommended should be available to every single \nconsumer.\n  That is all we are saying--no specific legislation but extending it \nto every consumer. And if you think it is bureaucratic to say we are \nnot going to permit health care plans to deny you at the emergency room \nwhen you have chest pains and are short of breath and may be having a \nheart attack, then go and defend that position.\n  Ask any consumer in this country. Ask any woman in this country. Ask \nany disabled person in this country. They are entitled to the best that \ntheir particular policy has guaranteed.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I am not going to yield to anyone about \ndefending HMOs. I introduced the legislation and passed it in 1974. I \nsupported it. We passed it five times here, and I led the fight for it.\n  All I want to do is to make sure that all of the HMOs are going to \nlive up to what the best of the HMOs are living up to today. The best \nof the HMOs today support this. They support our resolution. We just \nwant to make sure that every HMO is going to provide that kind of \nprotection for the consumers they have enlisted and whose premiums they \nare accepting and using to pay very substantial salaries to their \nexecutives.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Just a couple of comments.\n  My colleague said that the President's Commission on Quality endorses \nthese proposals, but they specifically did not endorse legislation. \nThere is a big difference. Do we want to encourage the private sector \nto improve quality and access and information? You bet. But when you \ncome up with a 68-page bill and say here is what you must do, there is \na difference. The President's commission did not say legislate. The \nSenator's sense-of-the-Senate says legislate. The underlying sense-of-\n\n[[Page S3049]]\n\nthe-Senate resolution provides for enactment of legislation to \nestablish a patients' bill of rights which was just introduced 2 days \nago that will increase health care costs. I think that is a serious \nmistake.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. No, not on my time. I only have a minute left.\n  So I just make the comment that people can talk about these goals. I \nwill agree with the goals. But when you try to mandate them by \nlegislation, saying that we know better, that we are going to dictate \nto the Mayo Clinic, here is what you must do, we are going to dictate \nto the Cleveland clinic; we know better, Congress knows better, the \nSenator from Massachusetts knows better, we are going to dictate it by \nlegislation, I disagree. I do not think that will improve quality. I \nthink it would be a serious mistake.\n  I urge my colleagues at the appropriate time to vote no on the \nKennedy amendment, and I will offer a second-degree amendment shortly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 1 minute 25 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much remains on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Their time has expired.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2281 to Amendment No. 2183\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate concerning the enactment \n                     of a patient's bill of rights)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time and \nsend the amendment to the desk.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Parliamentary inquiry. I believe time has to expire \nbefore the Senator can send a second-degree amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yielded back his time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Regular order.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Regular order.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts had the floor. \nHe yielded his time back and sent the amendment to the desk.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. So the second-degree amendment of the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts is the pending business.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2281 to Amendment No. 2183.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following:\n\n     SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING A PATIENT'S BILL OF RIGHTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) patients lack reliable information about health plans \n     and the quality of care that health plans provide;\n       (2) experts agree that the quality of health care can be \n     substantially improved, resulting in less illness and less \n     premature death;\n       (3) some managed care plans have created obstacles for \n     patients who need to see specialists on an ongoing basis and \n     have required that women get permission from their primary \n     care physician before seeing a gynecologist;\n       (4) a majority of consumers believe that health plans \n     compromise their quality of care to save money;\n       (5) Federal preemption under the Employee Retirement Income \n     Security Act of 1974 prevents States from enforcing \n     protections for the 125,000,000 workers and their families \n     receiving health insurance through employment-based group \n     health plans; and\n       (6) the Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and \n     Quality in the Health Care Industry has unanimously \n     recommended a patient bill of rights to protect patients \n     against abuses by health plan and health insurance issuers.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense Senate that the \n     assumptions underlying this resolution provide for the \n     enactment of legislation to establish a patient's bill of \n     rights for participants in health plans, and that legislation \n     should include--\n       (1) a guarantee of access to covered services, including \n     needed emergency care, specialty care, obstetrical and \n     gynecological care for women, and prescription drugs;\n       (2) provisions to ensure that the special needs of women \n     are met, including protecting women against ``drive-through \n     mastectomies'';\n       (3) provisions to ensure that the special needs of children \n     are met, including access to pediatric specialists and \n     centers of pediatric excellence;\n       (4) provisions to ensure that the special needs of \n     individuals with disabilities and the chronically ill are \n     met, including the possibility of standing referrals to \n     specialists or the ability to have a specialist act as a \n     primary care provider;\n       (5) a procedure to hold health plans accountable for their \n     decisions and to provide for the appeal of a decision of a \n     health plan to deny care to an independent, impartial \n     reviewer;\n       (6) measures to protect the integrity of the physician-\n     patient relationship, including a ban on ``gag clauses'' and \n     a ban on improper incentive arrangements; and\n       (7) measures to provide greater information about health \n     plans to patients and to improve the quality of care.\n       (8) a requirement that the network of providers included in \n     the plan are adequate to ensure the provision of services \n     covered by the plan.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 20 minutes of debate divided \nequally on the amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if the other side wants to yield back \ntheir time, I am prepared to yield time and move ahead to a rollcall \nvote on this.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Otherwise we will have a long quorum call, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from New Mexico yield back \ntime?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2282\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate concerning health care \n                                quality)\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to consideration of the \namendment?\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I had understood, there had been \nrepresentations that were made that the Senator from Oklahoma would be \nable to get a vote on his amendment and then we would go ahead with a \nvote on my amendment, the Kennedy-Durbin-Boxer amendment. That is my \nunderstanding. If my understanding is correct, I have no objection. Is \nthat the----\n  Mr. NICKLES. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have no objection, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has sent to the desk \nan amendment. If there is no objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2282.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON HEALTH CARE QUALITY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Rapid changes in the health care marketplace have \n     compromised confidence in the our Nation's health system.\n       (2) American consumers want more convenience, fewer \n     hassles, more choices, and better service from their health \n     insurance plans.\n       (3) All Americans deserve quality-driven health care \n     supported by sound science and evidence-based medicine.\n       (4) The Federal Government, through the National Institutes \n     of Health, supports research that improves the quality of \n     medical care that Americans receive.\n       (5) This resolution assumes increased funding for the \n     National Institutes of Health for\n\n[[Page S3050]]\n\n     1999 of $15,100,000,000, an 11-percent increase over current \n     funding levels, which are 7 percent higher than in 1997.\n       (6) As the largest purchaser of health care services, the \n     Federal Government has a responsibility to utilize its \n     purchasing power to demand high quality health plans and \n     providers for its health programs and to protect its \n     beneficiaries from inferior medical care.\n       (7) The Federal Government must adopt the posture of \n     private sector purchasers and insist on high quality care for \n     the 67,000,000 medicare and medicaid beneficiaries and the \n     9,000,000 Federal employees, retirees, and their dependents.\n       (8) The private sector has proven to be more capable of \n     keeping pace with the rapid changes in health care delivery \n     and medical practice that affect quality of care \n     considerations than the Federal Government.\n       (9) As Congress considers health care legislation, it must \n     first commit to ``do no harm'' to health care quality, \n     consumers, and the evolving market place. Rushing to \n     legislate or regulate based on anecdotal information and \n     micro-managing health plans on politically popular issues \n     will not solve the problems of consumer confidence and the \n     quality of our health care system.\n       (10) When health insurance premiums rise, Americans lose \n     health coverage. Studies indicate that a 1 percent increase \n     in private health insurance premiums will be associated with \n     an increase in the number of persons without insurance of \n     about 400,000 persons.\n       (11) Health care costs have begun to rise significantly in \n     the past year. The Congressional Budget Office (referred to \n     as ``CBO'') projects that the growth in health premiums will \n     be 5.5 percent in 1998 up from 3.8 percent in 1997. CBO \n     continues to project that premiums will grow about 1 \n     percentage point faster than the Gross Domestic Product in \n     the longer run. CBO also warns that new Federal mandates on \n     health insurance could exacerbate this increase in premiums.\n       (12) The President's Advisory Commission on Consumer \n     Protection and Quality in the Health Care Industry developed \n     the Consumer Bill of Rights and Responsibilities. This \n     includes information disclosure, confidentiality of health \n     information, and choice of providers.\n       (13) The President's Commission further determined that \n     private sector organizations have the capacity to act in a \n     timely manner needed to keep pace with the swiftly evolving \n     health system.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying this resolution assume that \n     the Senate will not pass any health care legislation that \n     will--\n       (1) make health insurance unaffordable for working families \n     and increase the number of uninsured Americans;\n       (2) divert limited health care resources away from serving \n     patients to paying lawyers and hiring new bureaucrats; or\n       (3) impose political considerations on clinical decisions, \n     instead of allowing such decisions to be made on the basis of \n     sound science and the best interests of patients.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, this is a first-degree amendment and now \nhas 30 minutes equally divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I have sent my amendment to the desk for \nvarious reasons, one of which is, my colleague from Massachusetts has \nan amendment which he calls a Patients' Bill of Rights. It sounds like \na good title, but, frankly, I am concerned it will increase costs, I am \nconcerned it will increase regulation, and because it will increase \ncosts, the number of uninsured will rise, and without question it will \nincrease regulation.\n  The bill that he refers to, the bill that he recently introduced--it \nalso has the same title--called the Patients' Bill of Rights Act of \n1998, is 68 pages long and has a lot of details in it. It has a lot of \nthings that every health care plan in America would have to provide. \nThat would cost a lot. It has a lot of the same language that is in the \nso-called PARCA, the Patients Access to Responsible Care Act. Estimates \nwere made on that bill that it would increase costs 23 percent. That is \na big increase. If you increase health care costs 23 percent, you are \ngoing to put a lot of people who had insurance in the uninsured \ncategory. I think that would be a serious mistake. People who have done \ntheir homework on this legislation, and maybe are experts in it, have \ncome out and said, ``We have reviewed this Patients' Bill of Rights and \nfind it severely lacking.''\n  Here is a quote from the Health Care Leadership Council. They said, \n``a vote for the Kennedy amendment is a vote for greater involvement by \nlawyers and bureaucrats in our health care system. To improve American \nhealth care we need to empower individuals, not government. We need \nevery medical dollar to go to medical services, not to lawyers and \nlegal fees.''\n  One of the reasons for the reference to lawyers and legal fees is \nthat it would allow insurers and businesses to be sued for not \nproviding coverage; not just for the coverage, but also for pain and \nsuffering, for punitive damages. So you would have health care insurers \nas well as businesses, who would be worried more about litigation than \nconsumer care. I think that would be an enormously expensive provision, \nand people need to know it.\n  I will continue with the Health Care Leadership Council. They said:\n\n       The bureaucratic regulations that would result from the \n     Democrats' patient bill of rights legislation would add \n     unnecessary complexity to the health care system. Complexity \n     steals time from patients and forces health care providers to \n     focus on regulatory compliance instead of improving the \n     quality of care.\n\n  The Chamber of Commerce of the United States, which represents \ncompanies throughout the country says:\n\n       We urge your opposition to an amendment expected to be \n     offered by Senator Kennedy to the budget resolution today \n     expressing the sense of the Senate that a patient bill of \n     rights proposal should be enacted this session . . .\n       The goal of improving health care quality can be better \n     achieved through the power of the marketplace.\n\n  The National Federation of Independent Business says:\n\n       The Kennedy amendment would dangerously place the Senate on \n     record in support of health care mandates prior to carefully \n     examining the issues of cost, coverage, regulation and \n     litigation. Additionally, it is premature given the work of \n     respective health care task force groups in the Senate and \n     House and private-sector efforts. Thus, we hope you will not \n     rush to legislate on the basis of antidotes rather than sound \n     decisionmaking. Big Government mandates substitute Government \n     intervention for quality innovations currently taking place \n     in the private health care market are the wrong prescriptions \n     for America's health care system.\n\n  Also, I have a letter from the Council on Affordable Health \nInsurance:\n\n       Bill of rights is a cruel hoax when the cost of those \n     rights will result in health insurance which is unaffordable \n     for those privately purchasing or causes employers to drop \n     health insurance coverage altogether. Both Congress and the \n     States have enacted laws to make health insurance accessible \n     to almost every American who seeks coverage. Access to health \n     insurance is meaningless if Congress makes it unattainable \n     because of regulations placing it financially out of reach \n     for many Americans.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Healthcare Leadership Council,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 1, 1998.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     Assistant Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: We understand that Senator Kennedy \n     intends, during Senate floor debate on the Budget Resolution, \n     to offer an amendment placing the Senate on record as \n     supporting enactment of the provisions incorporated in the \n     Patients' Bill of Rights legislation introduced by Senate and \n     House Democrats yesterday. It is critical that the Senate \n     strongly oppose this amendment.\n       The approach toward health care embodied in the Kennedy \n     amendment is exactly the wrong medicine for our health care \n     system. The Democrats' bill introduced yesterday would raise \n     costs, increase the numbers of uninsured people and eliminate \n     consumer choices.\n       A vote for the Kennedy amendment is a vote for greater \n     involvement by lawyers and bureaucrats in our health care \n     system. To improve American health care, we need to empower \n     individuals, not government. We need every medical dollar to \n     go to medical services--not to lawyers and legal expenses.\n       The bureaucratic regulations that would result from the \n     Democrats' Patients' Bill of Rights legislation would add \n     unnecessary complexity to the health care system. Complexity \n     steals time from patients and forces health care providers to \n     focus on regulatory compliance instead of improving the \n     quality of care.\n       As you know, the members of the Healthcare Leadership \n     Council are the chief executives of the nation's leading \n     health care companies and organizations, America's health \n     care innovators. We are working toward a market-based \n     approach to making health care more accessible, more \n     affordable and of the highest quality for all Americans. \n     Again, we strongly urge the Senate to reject the government \n     micromanagement approach to health care that is embodied in \n     the Kennedy amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Pamela G. Bailey,\n                                                        President.\n\n[[Page S3051]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                        Chamber of Commerce of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 31, 1998.\n     To Members of the U.S. Senate:\n       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce--the world's largest business \n     federation, representing more than three million businesses \n     and organizations of every size, sector, and region--strongly \n     opposes proposals that will increase the cost of health \n     coverage. We urge your opposition to an amendment expected to \n     be offered by Senator Kennedy to the Budget Resolution today \n     expressing the sense of the Senate that a patient bill of \n     rights proposal should be enacted this session.\n       Health care reform easily has been one of the most \n     emotional, complex and divisive domestic issues facing our \n     nation. Many members of Congress have responded by \n     considering a wide variety of proposals to regulate the \n     health care marketplace, impose additional mandates, or most \n     dangerously to expand medical malpractice liability. The \n     Chamber strongly opposes these measures and may consider \n     votes in connection with these proposals for inclusion in our \n     annual ``How They Voted'' voting guide.\n       ``Patient bill of rights'' proposals--such as that \n     advocated by a majority of the deeply flawed Clinton managed \n     care commission--more closely resemble provider than patient \n     protections. Higher costs for health coverage will be the \n     certain result of further government micro-management of the \n     health care marketplace and increased litigation, making \n     health coverage less affordable and available to small \n     businesses and individuals. Of what use is the ``perfect'' \n     health plan if businesses cannot afford to offer and \n     employees cannot afford to accept health coverage?\n       The goal of improving health care quality can be better \n     achieved through the power of the marketplace. The Chamber \n     has recently joined other members of the business community \n     in forming the Employer Quality Partnership, a new coalition \n     intended to empower the health coverage purchaser--whether \n     employer or individual consumer--with the tools necessary to \n     evaluate health plan quality in a changing marketplace. In \n     addition, we strongly supported the development of the \n     American Association of Health Plan's Patients First \n     initiative.\n       The expected Kennedy amendment is, at best, premature given \n     the work of the respective health care taskforce groups in \n     the Senate and House and private sector efforts like the \n     Employer Quality Partnership and Patients First. We urge you \n     not to commit today to legislation that will certainly prove \n     a losing proposition tomorrow.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  R.

We share your \n     view that patients would be hurt by any health care mandate \n     bill that increases premiums on American families, reduces \n     coverage or causes a new wave of costly litigation and \n     regulation.\n       Concerns about congressional action increasing costs and \n     reducing coverage are well-founded. An example is the \n     Democrats' Patient Bill of Rights Act, unveiled just \n     yesterday, which combines many of the worst elements of so-\n     called ``patient protection'' proposals. It would result in \n     further government micro-management of the health care \n     marketplace and increased litigation, making health coverage \n     less affordable and available to small businesses and \n     individuals.\n       Ironically, by increasing costs and forcing millions of \n     low-wage workers to choose between higher premiums or \n     dropping coverage for their families, the Democrat proposal \n     would hurt the very people who need help the most. Studies \n     show that last year some six million Americans declined \n     health insurance, largely because of cost, and these workers \n     are ``more likely to be young, Hispanic or black, or \n     unmarried and have low wages or low education levels''. \n     (Health Affairs, Vol. 16, No. 6)\n       America has the finest health care system in the world \n     because our private health care market--unlike a government \n     run system--improves to meet consumers' needs. There is much \n     that is currently being done voluntarily by health care plans \n     and employers throughout the marketplace to improve the \n     quality of care. However, if we trade the innovation and \n     excellence of our private health care system for the \n     regulation of a government-run system, this progress and \n     innovation will be stifled. Furthermore, it won't be doctors \n     making decisions about our health care--it will be \n     Washington.\n       The Kennedy amendment would dangerously place the Senate on \n     record in support of health care mandates prior to carefully \n     examining the issues of cost, coverage, regulation and \n     litigation. Additionally, it is premature given the work of \n     the respective health care taskforce groups in the Senate and \n     House and private sector efforts. Thus, we hope you will not \n     rush to legislate on the basis of anecdotes, rather than \n     sound decision-making. Big government mandates, which \n     substitute government intervention for quality innovations \n     currently taking place in the private health care market, are \n     the wrong prescription for America's health care system.\n           Sincerely,\n     Dan Danner,\n       Chairman, The Health Benefits Coalition, Vice President, \n     National Federation of Independent Business.\n\n\n                Health Benefits Coalition Participants:\n\n     National Federation of Independent Business\n     U.S.Chamber of Commerce\n     The Business Roundtable\n     National Association of Manufacturers\n     National Restaurant Association\n     Associated Builders and Contractors\n     National Association of Health Underwriters\n     American Automobile Manufacturers Association\n     National Business Coalition on Health\n     American Insurance Association\n     Food Marketing Institute\n     The ERISA Industry Committee\n     National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors\n     Food Distributors International\n     CIGNA\n     American Association of Health Plans\n     Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans\n     National Retail Federation\n     Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association\n     Citizens for a Sound Economy\n     Society for Human Resource Management\n     Council for Affordable Health Insurance\n     Aetna U.S. Healthcare\n     Prudential HealthCare\n     Health Insurance Association of America\n     Healthcare Leadership Council\n     Humana Inc.\n     International Mass Retail Association\n     Self-Insurance Institute of America, Inc.\n     New York Life/NYLCARE Health Plans\n     Premier\n                                                       Council for\n\n\n                                  Affordable Health Insurance,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, April 1, 1998.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     Assistant Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: On behalf of the Council for \n     Affordable Health Insurance, representing 3 million \n     policyholders we are writing to voice our strong opposition \n     to the Kennedy amendment No. 2183 to S. Con. Res. 86. The \n     Kennedy amendment, Sense of the Senate resolution regarding \n     Patient's Bill of Rights, although nonbinding would place \n     Senators on record in favor of enacting legislation to \n     establish a patient's bill of rights. A Bill of Rights is a \n     cruel hoax when the cost of those rights will result in \n     health insurance which is unaffordable for those privately \n     purchasing or causes employers to drop health insurance \n     coverage all together.\n       The ``rights'' listed in the Kennedy amendment amount to a \n     litany of mandated benefits, and mandated providers. One only \n     need to look to the states to see what these rights have cost \n     policyholders. In the state of Maryland, there are over 40 \n     state mandates. These mandates; some benefit related, others \n     provider related, add more than 20% to the cost of insurance \n     premium in that state. Major studies have been released in \n     the last year that show the uninsured in the United States is \n     increasing. The reason for the increase is not lack of access \n     but lack of affordability!\n       Both the Congress and the states have enacted laws to make \n     health insurance accessible to almost every American who \n     seeks coverage. Access to health insurance is meaningless if \n     the Congress makes it unattainable because of regulation \n     placing it financially out of reach for many Americans.\n       The Kennedy amendment is premature when both the Senate and \n     the House have established Health Care Task forces to \n     carefully examine this issue. We are strongly opposed to the \n     Kennedy amendment and urge Congress not to enact legislation \n     which will increase the cost of health care insurance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Angela M. Hunter,\n                                      Director of Federal Affairs.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I reserve the remainder of my time, because I have a \ncouple of colleagues who wish to speak on this.\n  I ask that the second-degree amendment No. 2281 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2281) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time do I have, Mr. President? Is it 15 minutes \non our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 7 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I disagree with some of Senator Nickles' findings, but \nI\n\n[[Page S3052]]\n\nhave no quarrel with the general words, and I urge the Senate to \nsupport his amendment and then go ahead and support our sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment, because the sense-of-the-Senate amendment \nincorporates the basic kind of protections that are essential in order \nto protect working families in this country.\n  I might differ with some of the particular words that the Senator has \nprovided in his resolution. I was just handed the resolution a moment \nor two ago. It says:\n\n       Sense of the Senate. It is the sense of the Senate that the \n     assumptions underlying this resolution assume that the Senate \n     will not pass any health care legislation that will--\n       (1) make health insurance unaffordable for working \n     families.\n\n  How can you differ with that? I am not for making health insurance \nunaffordable.\n  And:\n\n       (2) divert limited health care resources away from serving \n     patients to paying lawyers and hiring new bureaucrats. . .\n\n  I certainly agree with Senator Nickles on that one.\n  And:\n\n       (3) impose political considerations on clinical decisions. \n     . .\n\n  That is basically what we are talking about in our amendment. \nRestoring the patient-provider relationship.\n  I hope the entire Senate will support the Nickles amendment, and then \nwe get back to our amendment, the real enchilada, the real McCoy. The \nessential protections we have spoken of today are included in the sense \nof the Senate advanced by myself, Senator Durbin, Senator Boxer and \nSenator Sarbanes. Our amendment asks the Senate to pass legislation to \nensure that women in this country are going to get the gynecological \nand obstetrical care they need. It identifies and ends the evils of \nforced drive-through mastectomies. It says that a person who has a \nmedical emergency does not have to drive past the nearest emergency \nroom to a more distant one in the plan. It says that we will eliminate \nthe use of gag clauses, and respect our medical professionals and the \ndecisions they make. And it says that health plans will be held \naccountable for their decisions that deny care for patients and result \nin serious illness or death for those individuals. Why should we \ncontinue to shield negligent plans?\n  This Senator listened carefully, and neither the Senator from \nOklahoma nor the Senator from New Mexico nor the Senator from \nPennsylvania have addressed for one single moment the six essential \nelements of our sense-of-the-Senate resolution--the elements of which \nare strongly endorsed by the American Medical Association, the National \nBreast Cancer Association, Families USA, Consumer's Union, the \nemergency physicians, groups representing people with mental and \nphysical disabilities, pediatricians across this country and a great \nnumber of consumer and patient groups that understand exactly what is \nat risk.\n\n  We are going to vote. We are going to vote not only this afternoon, \nbut we are going to vote continuously in this Congress until we pass \nthis legislation. This afternoon is the first time.\n  But I certainly hope that Senator Nickles' amendment will be \nsupported, and I hope, if I can have the attention of the Senator from \nOklahoma, that he will accord the same courtesy and support to our \namendment as well, and we will have a happy afternoon here together.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, I say to my friend from \nMassachusetts, for his leadership on these issues.\n  I certainly am going to support the Nickles amendment, as the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts has stated. The Nickles amendment simply says we \nshouldn't do anything when we legislate on this issue of a patient bill \nof rights to make things worse for patients. Of course we wouldn't do \nthat. But the ultimate vote comes on Senator Kennedy's amendment, \nbecause that is a positive statement of things we must do and we should \ndo for the average American who has an HMO plan and who deserves to \nhave quality health care.\n  I think we should vote for the Nickles amendment and then for the \nKennedy amendment.\n  I want to tell a couple of stories, because they really illustrate \nwhy the Kennedy amendment is so important.\n  In the course of looking at the HMO issue, I met a gentleman named \nHarry Christie from Woodside, CA. He had a daughter who, at age 9, \ndeveloped a very rare cancer. And it required a very delicate operation \nthat could really only be performed by a surgeon who had experience in \ndealing with what they call Wilms' tumors.\n  So Mr. Christie, as any parent, loving his child with all of his \nsoul, went to find out which physicians could do this operation and \nfound out who they were, went to his HMO, and said, ``I assume that you \nwill pay for a specialist to perform this delicate operation on my \ndaughter.'' The HMO said, ``Sorry, Mr. Christie, we do not have such a \nspecialist on our staff. You will have to take a general surgeon, a \nvery good general surgeon, or you will have to simply pay for this out \nof your own pocket.''\n  Mr. Christie made the argument to no avail: ``This is my child. She \nis 9 years old. This is a delicate operation. This is a rare tumor. And \nI will not have someone with no experience, no matter how good a \nsurgeon, take a knife to my child.'' Well, they said, ``You're out of \nluck.'' Mr. Christie had to come up with $50,000, and he did. Years \nlater, his daughter is now 14. She is cured of this disease. She had a \nsuccessful operation. What if Mr. Christie had not been able to come up \nwith the $50,000? She may never have recovered.\n  What is it that we are doing here? We tell people we believe in \nquality health care, and yet we stand here and say we cannot do \nanything about it. The Kennedy amendment says that if your plan does \nnot have a specialist that you must have for you or your family, yes, \nyou can go outside that plan.\n  We held a press conference on this important bill that we hope will \npass the U.S. Senate soon. And we heard over satellite from a gentleman \nnamed David Garvey from Illinois. He had an HMO; he thought it was \nterrific. Everyone loves their HMO until they get sick. Then, \nunfortunately, too many find out it was not what they thought it would \nbe. What happened to this family is, Barbara Garvey, his wife of 30-\nsome years, got a very rare immune condition. She was on vacation in \nHawaii. And the HMO said, ``No, no, no, no. We cannot treat her in \nHawaii. She has to be flown on a commercial airplane, at your expense, \nback to Illinois.'' Well, to make a very sad story shorter, she never \nsurvived that experience because her immune system was so damaged in \nthis particular anemia condition that she could not withstand the \ninfections that she got on that airplane.\n  We have to take action. There is nothing in the Nickles amendment \nthat disturbs me at all. Of course, when we take action, it ought to be \nwith all the concerns that Senator Nickles puts in. Of course we should \nnot fix a plan because of political reasons--I do not even know what \nthat means--but we should do it because we want to help the people of \nthis country get quality health care. That means specialists, and that \nmeans, as Senator Kennedy has pointed out, a plan where doctors will \nnot be gagged. We do not want doctors gagged. We want doctors to be \nable to tell you the truth about your condition. And if there is a \nremedy that might be a little more expensive, you deserve the right to \nknow. That is in the Kennedy amendment.\n  A woman who needs an OB-GYN--and many of us use our own OB-GYNs as \nour first line of support. We do not go to an internist, should not \nhave to go through a gatekeeper, to get that kind of help. So we have a \nwonderful opportunity today to support both the Nickles amendment and \nthe Kennedy amendment. We have an opportunity to say that patients in \nAmerica who pay premiums deserve to have the quality put back in health \ncare. This is a chance for us to make that statement.\n  I hope we will cross over party lines on both these amendments and go \nhome feeling we have made a statement that is important to the American \npeople and follow it up with real action on a real patients' bill of \nrights.\n  I yield back my time to Senator Kennedy.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield to the Senator from Tennessee 4 minutes. How \nmuch time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes 15 seconds.\n\n[[Page S3053]]\n\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. I rise to speak in favor of the amendment from the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma and in opposition to the amendment of the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma, which I think we are \ngoing to have widespread agreement on, basically says that--\n\n       The Senate will not pass any health care legislation that \n     will--\n       make health insurance unaffordable for working families and \n     increase the number of uninsured Americans . . .\n\n  And in addition, it will not pass any health care legislation that \nwill--\n\n       . . . impose political considerations on clinical \n     decisions, instead of allowing such decisions to be made on \n     the basis of sound science and the best interest of patients.\n\n  I would like to take the time and say why passage of the Nickles \namendment means we should defeat the Kennedy amendment. Basically, \nphysicians do not treat patients unless we know that the anticipated \nrisks to that patient are outweighed by the benefits. If we were to \npass the amendment by Senator Kennedy, the Senator from Massachusetts, \nthose unintended disadvantages would far outweigh the good intentions \nthat we have.\n  No. 1 is the issue of cost. We know that if we are mandating benefits \ntoday the cost of health insurance goes up. When health insurance goes \nup, those hard-working men and women, the single mom, working mom with \nthe child, can lose her health insurance.\n  So we feel good because we are out there arguing quality. However, \nwhat we are really doing is putting mandates on the American people. I \ncan guarantee you, because the data shows it, we drive health care \ncosts up when we impose mandates. Who is hurt? The people we think we \nare helping--the working poor people who are out there.\n  A study by the Lewin Group showed that a 1 percent increase in \npremium implies that 200,000 people will lose their insurance. In fact, \nthey said 200,000 to 400,000 people will lose their insurance. Yet, \nwhen we hear a little increase of 1 percent in your insurance premium \nwe think anybody can take that. They do not. People will lose their \ninsurance with these mandates. We should make the commitment, which the \nNickles resolution does, not to pass legislation that drives the price \nof health care costs up and makes the uninsured a bigger problem.\n  No. 2, good science. We need good science. Some mandates in some \ncases may be OK, but let us base that on good science where we are \nreally helping people.\n  Length of stay--mastectomy. Let me point out length of stay, how long \nyou stay in a hospital, is not even mentioned in the landmark NIH \nconsensus statement and guidelines for the management of breast cancer. \nIn the guidelines that were determined by consensus to effect quality \nof care, the length of stay is not mentioned. In fact, in this \nparticular bill where we talk about length of stay, length of stay is \nnot necessarily the right issue.\n  A 1996 study of 525 women who underwent outpatient mastectomies at \nHenry Ford Hospital in Michigan reported increased quality, accelerated \nphysical recovery, earlier return to occupational activities, and \nnumerous improved psychological advantages.\n  My point is, if we are talking quality, this rubric of quality, we \nneed to look at critical quality issues. Inpatient versus outpatient \nisn't necessarily a quality issue. It is an oversimplification. There \nare numerous studies.\n  A 1995 study at the New Jersey College of Medicine of 133 women who \nunderwent outpatient partial mastectomies showed a lower rate of \npostoperative infection and a higher rate of satisfaction in comparison \nto a group having surgery on an inpatient basis.\n\n  In addition, the amendment itself also has other mandates, mandating \nreimbursement for prescription drugs. That is something that Medicare \ndoes not even do. If you mandate coverage for prescription drugs, I \nwill guarantee you, you are going to drive the costs of health care \ninsurance up to the point that you are going to be driving people out \nof the marketplace where they will not have access to even an adequate \nlevel of health care.\n  Thus, in closing, I rise to support--and I hope we will have a 100-0 \nvote for the Nickles amendment. Listen to what the Nickles amendment \nsays. Let us not hurt quality of health care when we think we are \nhelping it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields the time?\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield the Senator from Maine 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has 6 minutes. The \nSenator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  All of us agree that medically necessary patient care should never be \nsacrificed to the bottom line, and that medical decisionmaking should \nremain in the hands of medical professionals, and not in the hands of \naccountants. The question is, how can we best achieve that goal? Is the \nanswer, as the Senator from Massachusetts suggests, massive new Federal \nregulations, mandates, and a preemption of the State's traditional role \nto regulate insurance? Or is the answer to trust the private-sector \norganizations that have made great progress in improving the quality of \nhealth care plans? Or is, perhaps, the answer somewhere in between? Is \nthe answer carefully crafted, minimal Federal legislation that supports \nthe efforts in the private sector?\n\n  The reason this issue is so important is because we don't want to \ntake a misguided step in the name of improving quality and end up \nmaking health insurance unaffordable for millions of Americans.\n  The Lewin Group recently released an important study that deserves \nthe attention of all of our colleagues. It estimates that every 1 \npercent increase in private insurance premiums results in an additional \n400,000 Americans who become uninsured. A 1 percent increase in costs \nbrings 400,000 additional uninsured Americans.\n  Health insurance rates are already projected to increase by more than \n5 percent in 1998. In fact, the Los Angeles Times reported earlier this \nweek that California's largest HMO was seeking an 11 percent increase \nin some rates. Therefore, we face an extremely delicate balancing act \nas we attempt to respond to concerns about quality without resorting to \nunduly burdensome Federal Government controls and mandates that will \nfurther drive up the cost of insurance and reduce access. Furthermore, \nwe want to make certain that our efforts actually improve the quality \nof health care and not simply increase the amount of Federal \nregulation.\n  Under the leadership of the Senator from Oklahoma, I serve on the \nRepublican health quality task force. We recently heard from the \ndirector of the Mayo Clinic, who voiced their own reservations about \nthe Federal Government's ability to regulate quality. To quote Dr. Bob \nWaller:\n\n       Quality is a continuous process that must be woven into the \n     fabric of how we think, act and feel. Government regulation \n     places a stake in the ground that freezes in place a quality \n     standard that may become obsolete very quickly. The \n     Government simply cannot react quickly to the changing \n     quality environment. The goal of quality is to continuously \n     improve patient care--not to achieve some defined regulatory \n     objective.\n\n  Congress, in its haste to do good, should take care not to violate \nthe first principle of medicine, which is, ``first of all, do no \nharm.'' Congress should not be acting precipitously, but rather should \nengage in a thoughtful and thorough debate on how best to ensure that \nAmericans continue to enjoy the highest quality health care in the \nworld. The amendment offered by the assistant majority leader adopts a \nreasoned, balanced approach to improving health care quality. All of us \nshould be able to agree, as the amendment states, that Congress should \nnot do anything to make health insurance unaffordable for working \nfamilies and to increase the number of uninsured Americans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time allotted to the Senator has expired.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the \namendment offered by the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 53 seconds.\n\n[[Page S3054]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  I urge our colleagues to support the Nickles amendment. I have \noutlined, as the Senator has, and, while I disagree with some of his \nstatements, I think the Senate ought to go on record in favor of it. \nBut I also invite others to support the amendment offered by myself, \nSenator Durbin, Senator Boxer and others, which basically says the \nSenate should pass a patients' bill of rights. Our amendment and the \nrights embodied in it is commonsense.\n  As we know around here, if you don't have a remedy for a right, you \ndon't have a right. We have a Bill of Rights that we have enshrined in \nthe Constitution of the United States. We have that to ensure all of \nour rights. All we are saying now is let us go on record in support of \nthe rights that are included in this sense of the Senate.\n\n  This amendment says that we will protect women from being thrown out \nof the hospital hours after a mastectomy and against the advice of \ntheir physician. We will assure that women are going to be able to get \ndirect access to the gynecological and obstetrical care they need. \nThese are rights that many plans say they already offer. With this \namendment, we will make sure that they are realized.\n  We will make sure that children with special needs have access to \nqualified pediatric specialists. We will make sure that we protect the \nrights of persons with disabilities. These rights are written in some \nof the various insurance policies, but too often they are not realized. \nWe want to make sure that every American, if they have a heart attack \nor a stroke, can go to the nearest emergency room.\n  Here are the basics, and they have been undisputed. No one has \nchallenged that. Let's get aboard and say let us, in this Congress--\nRepublicans and Democrats--draft legislation that will protect those \nconsumers. That is what the President's commission did unanimously. It \nsaid these ought to be the rights of every single American. We have a \nchance this afternoon for the Senate of the United States to say \n``yes.'' Every good plan already provides these rights. Consumers need \nprotections against those insurance companies who put profits ahead of \npatients. Many organizations representing patients and doctors are on \nour side. Only those who profit from the current abuse are opposed to \nus.\n  I hope the Senate will go in favor of this resolution.\n  I yield the remaining time to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has 2 minutes \n23 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his, as \nusual, stalwart defense of what is right in health care. I am struck by \nthe referral of the Senator from Maine to the increased number of \nuninsured, which has always been put out by those--particularly the \ninsurance companies--who oppose any kind of adding on to health care \ncoverage or the quality of health care coverage in this country.\n  It is the oldest irony in the books. They have never supported \nanything, anything that I can remember, over the last 10 years that \nincreased health insurance coverage. They have opposed everything. She \nquotes them--and she was even shot down by the Republican appointed CBO \nDirector June O'Neill, who says in her letter, ``CBO has not estimated \nhow PARCA [the bill referred to in the estimates under discussion] \nmight affect the number of people covered by insurance.''\n  So on the one hand there is no argument, there is no case to be made \nabout the increase; and secondly, in talking about this consumer bill \nof rights, we are talking about very, very fundamental things.\n  I had to take my own son into an emergency room within the last 2 \nweeks with my wife. There was nobody in the emergency room except us. \nIt was held open, Sibley Hospital, because it was open and we were able \nto take advantage of it. It is the most important room in a hospital. \nThis bill would guarantee that an emergency room would be open for \neverybody in America--not just people named Rockefeller or Kennedy--24 \nhours a day, 365 days a year. That is necessary.\n  I have another relative who has been through a mastectomy. People who \nsay mastectomy quality is going up and people are not being urged to \nget out of hospitals simply don't know the facts because I have seen \notherwise and I know otherwise.\n  I suggest we support the amendments of the Senator from Oklahoma and \nthat we support the Senator from Massachusetts, both.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Massachusetts has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate the fact that my colleagues on the \nDemocratic side say they will support our amendment, but I want to \ninform them that our amendment is in direct contradiction with their \namendment.\n  Our amendment says we shouldn't do anything to increase health care \ncosts. My colleagues want to say that the proposal by the Senator from \nMassachusetts doesn't increase costs. They can say it, but it is not \ntrue.\n  The facts are the Lewin Group, for example, did a study on the so-\ncalled PARCA bill and said it increased costs 23 percent. Granted, the \nbill that the Senator introduced 2 days ago and is calling upon the \nSenate to pass may not be exactly the same thing, but it has a lot of \ncommon elements, and it will increase costs.\n  The Nickles resolution says we shouldn't increase costs because that \nincreases uninsured. Common sense. And it says we shouldn't require \nhealth care providers to spend a lot of money defending themselves \ninstead of providing quality care.\n  The proposal by my colleague from Massachusetts refers to the patient \nbill of rights. His bill of rights says we should pass legislation. I \nmention that the President's commission did not say we should pass \nlegislation. They are not consistent. Should we try to improve quality \ncare? Sure. Should we pass legislation mandating a fixed definition of \nquality care? I don't think so.\n  To give an example, a letter from Bob Waller of Mayo Clinic says, \n``Providers of care are in the unique position based on the personal \ncommitment to the well-being of the individual patient to drive quality \nimprovement initiatives. Nothing could stifle innovation quicker than \nexternal mandatory standards.'' Now, that is not from some insurance \ncarrier. That is the director of the Mayo Clinic, one of the top \nproviders of quality health care in the world.\n\n  The Cleveland Clinic states:\n\n       We are already subject to extensive Federal, State and \n     private regulations through oversight by private payors and \n     accrediting bodies. Adding yet another layer of regulation \n     will only further complicate matters, add administrative \n     costs to our organization, and in all likelihood have little \n     or no effect on the actual quality of care provided.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have these statements printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                              mayo clinic\n\n       Mayo Clinic, Baylor Health Care System, and the Cleveland \n     Clinic are all raising their voices in opposition to federal \n     regulation of health care quality.\n       Dr. Bob Waller of the Mayo Clinic has stated: ``Quality is \n     a continuous process that must be woven into the fabric of \n     how we think, act and feel. Government regulation places a \n     stake in the ground that freezes in place a quality standard \n     that many become obsolete very quickly. The government simply \n     cannot react quickly to the changing quality environment. The \n     goal of quality is to continuously improve patient care--not \n     to achieve some defined regulatory standard.''\n\n\n                       baylor health care system\n\n       ``There has been an enormous commitment on the part of \n     Baylor Health Care System and providers throughout the \n     country to evaluate and put in place the processes for \n     continuous quality improvement. We believe it must be done at \n     this level. Providers of care are in the unique position, \n     based on their personal commitment to the well-being of the \n     individual patient, to drive quality improvement initiatives. \n     Nothing could stifle innovation quicker than external \n     mandatory standards.''\n\n\n                            cleveland clinic\n\n       ``We are already subject to extensive federal, state and \n     private regulations through oversight by private payors and \n     accrediting bodies. Adding yet another layer of regulation \n     will only further complicate matters, add administrative \n     costs to our organization, and in all likelihood have little \n     or no effect on the actual quality of care provided''.\n\n[[Page S3055]]\n\n    american hospital association (this was in response to senator \n                  kennedy's bill announced yesterday)\n\n       ``The President's quality Commission confirmed there is no \n     consensus that federal legislation like that introduced today \n     by House and Senate Democrats is the best way to achieve \n     these objectives. The AHA believes the private sector can and \n     must meet the challenge of protecting consumers and improving \n     the quality of care. Federal legislation should be considered \n     only if all private sector efforts fail.''\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, these are not insurers. They are \nproviders of care saying that more regulation will do just the \nopposite--it will increase costs. Experts are saying the Kennedy \nproposal will increase costs and therefore increase the uninsured and \nadd a lot of money being expended for defensive purposes in litigation, \nnot for improving quality of care. That is a mistake.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of my amendment, cosponsored by \nSenators Jeffords, Frist, Collins, and others. I thank them for their \ncomments. I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Kennedy amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, my friend from Oklahoma sets up a \nstrawman and then knocks it down. There are not going to be any \nadditional costs for those insurance companies and those HMOs that are \ndoing a good job. Massachusetts' HMOs, for example, are the best in the \nnation. I have the highest regard for them. But there may be an extra \ncost for HMOs that are shortchanging the consumer--the Senator is \nright--but not for those that are doing what they have represented to \nthe consumers. In other words, if they are doing a good job, they have \nnothing to fear. That is why we have the support of a number of HMOs at \nthe present time. This sense of the Senate focuses on the ones that are \nnot doing a good job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the Senators for participating \nin what has been an exciting debate. I have a consent agreement that \nhas been worked out between the majority and the minority.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be debated \nbetween now and approximately 4 o'clock, under the same terms as agreed \nto last night, with the exception of second-degree amendments, which \nare now limited to 10 minutes equally divided:\n  Brownback amendment No. 2177, which has already been debated; Boxer \namendment No. 2167; Specter amendment No. 2254; Lautenberg amendment \nNo. 2244; Kyl amendment No. 2221; the two amendments that we have just \nheard debated, the Nickles amendment and the Kennedy amendment, Nos. \n2282 and 2183, respectively; a Hutchison from Texas amendment No. 2208; \nand the last in this series is the Rockefeller amendment No. 2226.\n  I further ask that at the conclusion or yielding back of time on each \nof these amendments, and any second degrees, all remaining time on the \nbudget be considered yielded back, and the and the Senate proceed to \nstack rollcall votes, under the same terms as last night.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, at \napproximately 4 p.m.--it looks like it will be a little bit after \nthat--today, the Senate will begin what has been fondly called a \n``vote-arama.'' Some might not want to say ``fondly''; they may have \nother words to describe it. I choose that today for no particular \nreason. If all Senators will remain in the Chamber and refrain from \ninsisting on rollcall votes on their amendments, all Members will \nsurvive this cruel process and the Senate can conduct the final vote on \nthis resolution within 3 or 4 hours after 4 p.m.\n  I understand that is wishful thinking, I say to my fellow Senators. \nNonetheless, I urge my colleagues, once we start the ``vote-arama,'' to \nremain here in an attempt to work with us on the amendments that they \nmay have to be included in the ``vote-arama'' or be disposed of \notherwise. We still have a lot of amendments that we have not reached \nagreement on that might end up in the ``vote-arama.''\n  We are making some very significant headway. We started today with 72 \namendments. We have worked to clear a number of those. Today, I think, \nwith the amendments we will shortly adopt by voice vote, we are \nprobably down to about 30 amendments that will fall into the ``vote-\narama,'' and we have not had a chance on each of them to discuss them \nwith the Senators. Perhaps a significant number of those will not \nrequire votes.\n  I yield so that my distinguished friend, the ranking member, can \naddress the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I encourage all to listen carefully to \nwhat is proposed in this UC. The mission is to respond to the \nentreaties by Senators on both sides, ``When are we going to complete \nour work? We have plans to make, we have our appointments to keep.''\n  You cannot have it six ways. What we have done here is we have tried \nto be as considerate as possible. The Senator from New Mexico has \nclearly stated the case. I have a further request that would apply to \nboth sides, and that is, where the subjects are in common in two or \nmore amendments, if those parties would consent to try to consolidate, \nwe can further eliminate any time for discussion. Even though it is \nonly 1 minute on each side, we are looking at a considerable amount of \ntime. I plead with our colleagues--10 minutes on their clock has to be \nthe same as 10 minutes on our clock; they can't be a different 10 \nminutes.\n  So if we are going to keep the voting limited, I urge the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee to exercise all of the ``meanness'' that he can, \nbe a bad guy and criticize and punish and all that. This is serious, \nand if people don't want to be looking at this clock at midnight, then \nthey are going to have to adhere to the rules as we have them. I think \nI heard the Chair declare that the unanimous consent is in place. I \nwould like to get on with the business at hand and do what we can to \nexpedite the program and the time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, following the next amendment, which I \nthink will be the Lautenberg amendment, we will propose to the Senate a \nlong list of amendments that we will accept and propose to accept by \nvoice vote or by accommodation by both sides agreeing. So we will do \nthat and that will take care of another long list of amendments. Then \nwhat will be left will be the ``vote-arama,'' and we will try to narrow \nthose down in our personal conversations with Senators. Our leader will \nbe along shortly to discuss this with Senators, also.\n  According to the order, Senator Lautenberg's amendment will now be \nthe pending business.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2244\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the Lautenberg \namendment, No. 2244.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this amendment presents a modified \nversion of the budget that President Clinton submitted to the Congress \nlast month. The amendment delineates all of the important priorities in \nthe President's budget.\n  First, it maintains strict fiscal discipline and adopts the \nPresident's commitment to save Social Security first. The amendment \nreserves all surpluses--I want to emphasize all surpluses--until we \nsolve Social Security's long-term problems. This will help ensure that \nwhen the baby boomers retire, Social Security will be there for them, \njust like it has been there for their parents and grandparents. Second, \nthis amendment, like the President's budget, makes education a top \nnational priority. It calls for an initiative to reduce class sizes by \nhiring 100,000 new teachers; it promotes higher standards and greater \naccountability; it provides more after-school opportunities for young \npeople; and it would help modernize and rehabilitate many of our \nschools.\n\n  These initiatives are not included in the budget before us. That is \none of its greatest shortcomings.\n  Third, this amendment, like the President's budget, includes a \nhistoric commitment to helping families afford\n\n[[Page S3056]]\n\nquality child care. It would double the number of children receiving \nchild care subsidies by the year 2003. It would provide tax relief to \nworking families who struggle to afford child care, whose biggest \nconcern is that their kids are in good, safe, secure hands and it \ndoesn't matter what your income is or what your assets are. Everybody \nwants that. It includes many other measures to improve the quality of \nchild care. Again, the Republican budget in front of us fails to \ninclude a meaningful child care initiative and would do little for \nworking parents and their kids.\n  Fourth, this amendment, like the President's budget, would expand \nMedicare to provide health care to many older Americans who now lack \nprivate insurance. It would assist those people to help them pay for \ntheir fair share so that there are no additional burdens on the \ntaxpayers at large. The Republican budget rejects this proposal.\n  Fifth, this amendment, like the President's budget, includes a major \ninvestment in research, especially medical research at the National \nInstitutes of Health, with all of the lifesaving possibilities it \npromises. The Republican budget claims to provide funding for NIH, but \nit provides no new money to do so. It merely assumes that the \nAppropriations Committee will cut other programs--cut education, cut \nenvironmental protection--to find the money to provide NIH with more \nresources. That is not likely to happen.\n  Sixth, this amendment includes a significant investment in our \ntransportation infrastructure in accordance with the agreement reached \non ISTEA funding. That includes not only funding for highways but \ntransit and safety matters as well.\n  Seventh, this amendment, like the President's budget, reflects a \ncommitment to environmental protection. It calls for reinstatement of \nthe Superfund taxes on polluters and to use those funds for a variety \nof environmental objectives. The Republican budget, by contrast, uses \nmost revenues from the Superfund tax for purposes that have nothing to \ndo with environmental protection.\n  Mr. President, this amendment accommodates a wide range of Democratic \npriorities that have been shortchanged in the Republican budget--\neducation, child care, health care, environment. We accommodate all of \nthese priorities using real numbers scored by the Congressional Budget \nOffice. This alternative budget fully complies with the discretionary \nspending caps in the balanced budget amendment, and it doesn't spend a \npenny of any surplus to meet the goals that we have had to modestly \nscale back some of the spending included in the President's original \nproposal.\n  We have adjusted the levels of both nondefense and defense \ndiscretionary spending to be consistent with the spending caps, and we \nhave held about $15 billion in the President's funds for America's \ninitiative in reserve. Those reserves will become available upon the \nenactment of tobacco legislation, if that legislation produces more \nrevenues than proposed by the President.\n  I note that all of these priorities could be funded if we enact the \nproposal that Senator Conrad and I have been advocating; that is, to \npromptly increase the cigarette taxes to $1.50 a pack. Mr. President, \nto avoid any confusion on this point, let me explain. We are assuming \nthat many of the President's discretionary initiatives will be funded \nin authorizing legislation, which largely means tobacco legislation. We \nthink that is the most likely way that many of these priorities will be \nfunded. If so, they would all be scored by the Congressional Budget \nOffice under the pay-as-you-go system separate from the discretionary \nspending caps. Of course, as the administration has proposed, this \ncould also be accomplished with the rules change included in \nappropriations legislation.\n\n  The point is that, in any case, the President's priorities can be \naccommodated here within the current rules or with the rules change for \ntobacco legislation.\n  I want to be up front about this. I don't expect a Democratic \nsubstitute to be approved by this Senate. I am not asking for an \nextended debate about this proposal. We aren't looking for a partisan \nfight. We simply wanted to put this forward to reassert our support for \nthe President's budget and to counter those who might try to argue that \nthe President's priorities cannot be accommodated using the \nCongressional Budget Office scoring. We have shown that they can be. If \nthe Senate wants to reject the President's proposals to expand \nMedicare, child care, reduce class size, that is their right. We can \ndisagree. We can disagree on these in good faith. But we shouldn't just \nblame it on the Congressional Budget Office. It will be our choice and \nan expression of our priorities.\n  Speaking for most Democrats, we think that this budget represents the \nvalues and priorities that we care about and that this country ought to \ncare about. It reflects our commitment to fiscal discipline. It saves \nSocial Security first. It would improve the lives of millions of \nAmerican families.\n  Mr. President, I yield the time so that the Democratic leader can use \nas much of that time as remains. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes eighteen seconds.\n  The distinguished Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, let me commend the distinguished ranking member for \nhis excellent statement.\n  Mr. President, it is with some disappointment that Democrats offer \nany substitute at all. The times when we work best are the times when \nwe can find agreement in the Budget Committee, as we did last year. We \nwere disappointed that agreement could not be reached to everyone's \nsatisfaction. So we find ourselves compelled to offer an alternative to \nthe budget now being proposed by the majority.\n  The distinguished ranking member has laid out very thoroughly some of \nthe reasons why our resolution is superior and the reasons why \nDemocrats feel compelled today to express our differences with our \nRepublican colleagues about this budget.\n  Our plan very simply does what the President of the United States \nsaid we should do in his State of the Union address a couple of months \nago. We put Social Security first. We provide targeted tax cuts for \nworking families. We make very important domestic investments so that \nworking families across this country can experience the tremendous \neconomic gain and economic vitality that this country has realized in \nthe last several years. We stay within the spending ceilings \nestablished in last year's budget agreement. We maintain balance in \n1999 and produce budget surpluses well into the next century.\n  We are very proud of what we have been able to achieve thus far. It \nis on the basis of what we have achieved that we now propose a budget \nto build upon those achievements and allow this nation to be as \nsuccessful in the future as we have in the past. Before I describe our \nfiscal priorities, let's take a brief look back at the past.\n  In 1993, the budget deficit was a whopping $290 billion, the highest \ndeficit our Nation had ever experienced.\n  The deficit at that time was projected to grow to over $500 billion \nby the end of the decade. In 1993, the President presented an economic \nplan and the Democratic Congress--unfortunately, without the help of a \nsingle Republican vote--took action.\n  Today, the results are very obvious. The 1993 plan produced the \nlargest deficit reduction in our history. The plan produced the first \nunified balanced budget in 30 years. The plan created 15 million new \njobs. The plan contributed to the lowest unemployment rate in 25 years. \nThe plan put us on the road to the lowest core inflation rate since \n1965. The plan has led to the fastest annual growth rate in real \naverage hourly earnings since 1976.\n  The results could not be more clear. Because we made the commitment \nin 1993, because we turned the economy around, because we were able to \ncome to grips with the significant economic and fiscal problems that we \nwere facing at that time and address them consequentially, we celebrate \nsuccess in 1998. Now it is our responsibility to build upon that \nsuccess.\n  We would like to highlight the differences between our vision for the \nfuture and that of our Republican colleagues. The most visible and the \nmost important of those differences relates to public education. Our \nbudget contains a series of proposals that will provide our children \nwith the educational opportunities they need to successfully confront \nthe challenges of\n\n[[Page S3057]]\n\nthe 21st century. We provide tax credits for local districts that build \nand renovate public schools. We provide funds for local districts to \nhire an additional 100,000 teachers. This proposal will allow schools \nto reduce class size. For grades from 1 to 3, class size will be \nreduced from an average of 22 children down to 18. In addition, we \nprovide opportunities for after-school learning programs. I will not \nelaborate on any of those proposals, because they have each been the \nsubject of a targeted Democratic amendment already offered during this \nbudget debate.\n  The Republican budget freezes spending on the most important \neducational programs. It freezes spending on the new programs I have \noutlined as well as the programs already established to provide \nchildren the opportunity to grow and to learn. As a result, 450,000 \nchildren will be denied access to safe after-school learning centers if \nthis Republican budget passes; 30,000 kids will be denied access to \nHead Start if this Republican budget passes; 6,500 middle schools will \nnot have drug and violence prevention coordinators if this Republican \nbudget passes.\n  There is another important difference--and my colleague, the \ndistinguished ranking member, noted the difference. Democrats have a \nfundamentally different approach to tackling the problem of teen \nsmoking. On this issue there is a very clear difference between the \nRepublican budget and our budget. Every American should carefully \nexamine each side's approach to ending tobacco's insidious hold on \nyoung people in this country. Our proposal ends Joe Camel's reign over \nAmerica's teenagers by fully funding the anti-youth-smoking \ninitiatives, by providing tobacco-related medical research, by allowing \nsmoking cessation programs, by ensuring public service advertising to \ncounter the tobacco companies' targeting of our children today.\n  The Republican budget does none of those, not one. There is no anti-\nyouth-smoking initiative, there is no tobacco-related medical research, \nthere are no smoking cessation programs, there is no public service \nadvertising--there is none. It stacks the deck against meaningful \ntobacco reform and the effort to end teenage smoking.\n  So we see a host of important initiatives in the Democratic plan--\ninvesting in education, anti-teen smoking efforts, health care and an \narray of other proposals designed to build upon the success our plan \nhas enjoyed over the last 5 years. Unfortunately, our Republican \ncolleagues have said no to virtually every single one--no to education, \nno to child care, no to comprehensive solutions to teen smoking.\n  For all these reasons, I ask my colleagues to say no to the \nRepublican budget and to say yes to the way we have proposed to build \nupon our success in the past, to say yes to the Democratic alternative.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from New \nMexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time remains on the Democrat side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has 18 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I see the minority leader is here. Maybe he wants more \nthan 18. He can try to get it off the bill, but I remind him that we \nmade a deal we weren't going to do that, so I will keep my remarks \nbrief.\n  First, Mr. President, I would like to say the basic difference \nbetween this proposal and the President's--and it is very fundamental, \nand everybody should understand it--is that we thought if there was \ngoing to be some new money to spend, that we ought to take a look at \nwhat American programs were most in need of money, and we found that \nthere are two American programs. They are not State programs, they are \nnot city programs, they are not school board programs--they are ``the \nU.S. Government does them, or they don't get done.'' They are the \nSocial Security system and the Medicare system for our seniors--but we \nare all going to get to be seniors, so therefore all of us.\n  What we did in our budget was say very, very simply: If you settle \nthis tobacco agreement--which seems to me to be getting further and \nfurther from reality, but let's just say if it gets settled--put all of \nthe Federal Government's receipts from it into the program that is most \nin need and that has been most adversely affected by smoking. That is \nthe Medicare Program.\n  It is interesting that while the President's program and the Democrat \nprogram--the President suggests $124 billion in new programs, and the \nlitany sounds wonderful. We have heard some of it here this afternoon. \nI can't tell for certain, but it looks like the budget before us does a \nlittle better. It looks like it has $88 billion to $100 billion in new \nprograms, new spending.\n  I ask, whether it is $124 billion in new money or $88 or $90 billion, \nis it right? Is it correct? Is it the right thing to do, to put not one \nnickel toward Medicare, which is the largest American program in \njeopardy? And, as I debated this earlier in the week, I showed in a \nvery simplified, simple chart, what will happen to the Medicare trust \nfund starting in about 10 years. And the deficit line goes in a line \ndownward as if we are aiming it towards the middle of the Earth--which \nwe used to say that's where Hades was, when we were little kids.\n  For starters, that is one big difference, and we are proud of that \ndifference, for we put a very substantial number of billions into that \nvery needy program so those national commissioners trying to put it \ntogether will have some extra resources to save Medicare for the \nseniors of today and the seniors of tomorrow.\n  When you do that, you cannot pay for all the new wish list of \nprograms that have been alluded to here today and that our President \nalluded to in a dramatic speech to the American people as the State of \nthe Union. As a matter of fact, had that wonderful pot of gold--to wit: \nthe cigarette companies' agreement--not been around when the President \nof the United States was preparing his speech, he could not have told \nthe American people that there were any new programs. You know why? \nBecause he agreed. He agreed that for the next 5 years there would be \nlittle or no increases in the discretionary programs of this country. \nThat was the deal. That was the agreement.\n  So, lo and behold, the expectation quotient rises from that night to \nthis moment on the floor of the Senate, when the big pot of gold is \nthere, to start a whole bunch of new American programs. Frankly, as I \nindicated, everybody should know that most of the list of good things \nthat we cannot afford, that the Democrats are speaking to, most of them \nwon't come into existence if we don't have a big, gigantic pot of gold \ncoming from the tobacco companies. That is point No. 1.\n  Point No. 2: With reference to smoking and its relationship and cost \nto the American taxpayer, and to our programs, the distinguished \noccupant of the chair has the most forthright sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution that he will offer during this debate, and I hope we adopt \nit. It just says that every penny we get out of the tobacco settlement \nshould go to Medicare, because Medicare suffers a $25-billion-a-year \nhit because of seniors who, when they were young, smoked, got sick, and \nMedicare pays their bill. Pretty logical. I commend him for it and for \nhis leadership in that regard.\n  Nonetheless, they would ask, aren't we going to take care of some of \nthe needs that we know about because of smoking? And we say yes. But we \ndidn't wait around to do them based upon a settlement; we did it by \nreducing other programs and paying for them. So, for those who wonder, \nthe National Institutes of Health, which everybody says should be \nincreased so they can work on some prevention areas of cancer that have \nbeen affected by smoking, gets a $15.5 billion increase in the next 5 \nyears, the largest in the history of any research entity that the \nUnited States funds.\n  And then, education. You see, we don't forget what we agreed to last \nyear. We have a 5-year agreement on education, and it is one of the \nhigh-priority agreements between the President and the Congress. We \ndidn't forget about it in the second year. We fully fund the increases \nin education, and they are very significant. What we said is, we should \nput $2.5 billion, minimum, for the disabled of our children being \neducated by our public schools.\n  A disgrace exists today with a Federal Government which mandated this \nassistance years ago, committed to pay 40 percent of its cost, and is \nstill paying 9 percent as of this day. While the\n\n[[Page S3058]]\n\nschools foot the bill, we write the laws, even though we agreed last \nyear that education money would first be applied there to bridge the \ngap between the 9 percent and the commitment. The President saw fit to \ngo with new programs and not that; but not us--$2.5 billion. That means \nthose school systems can hire new teachers. We don't have to pay for \nteachers from the Federal Government's tax coffers, which we have never \ndone in history. We say relieve the burden on the schools and they can \nhire them.\n  We put an additional $6.3 billion in education--an increase--so that \nwe can fund in due course some programs which will have flexibility \nbuilt in for our public schools, including such things as teacher \ntraining and those kinds of things that will bring some accountability \nto the public school system of our country. And we are proud of that, \ntoo. It is not as if there is nothing in, it is just we chose these \ninstead of others, and we think these are prudent choices.\n  Then we could go on from there and talk about criminal justice. We \nall know we cannot cut that; it must go up. We increased that in our \nbudget, because it was a high priority item when we made our 5-year \nagreement that we worked so hard together on, Democrat and Republican \nand President.\n  So it is not as if we did not do some of these things that the \nDemocratic leadership is here touting that they would do and we didn't \ndo. It is just that we did not increase net spending by $84 billion. \nThe Democrat budget does. Net tax increases of one type or another--$80 \nbillion in that proposal. We did not do that much. The reduction in the \nsurplus--there is a cutting of the surplus in half, under their \nproposal, from 8 to 4. That is not a lot of billions, as we throw them \naround here, but nonetheless a significant thing to note.\n  Mr. President, I believe the budget we produced in the Budget \nCommittee, if it were to become the cornerstone for this year's \nappropriation bills and tax reduction--for there is $30 billion worth \nof tax reduction in ours. It is provided for by closing loopholes and \nother tax advantages, many of which have been listed as items that we \nshould consider for more than a decade, and some of them 15 years.\n  So ours is pretty well balanced. I am convinced, having familiarized \nmyself as best I can, and I think perhaps with a few exceptions as well \nas anyone in the Senate, ours would be good for the future growth of \nthe American economy and would continue this dramatic, sustained \neconomic growth that is bringing us revenues and bringing us jobs.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, I don't believe there is very much in the \nDemocratic budget or the President's budget that would contribute \nsignificantly to those positive things that we all cherish and want so \nmuch.\n  I yield the floor and reserve whatever time I have.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use a couple minutes of my leader \ntime. I know we are out of time, and I don't want to take any time off \nthe resolution.\n  I know the distinguished Budget chair has made his arguments, and I \nthink they merit some response. I will yield in a moment to the \ndistinguished ranking member as well.\n  Let me just make three points. First of all, the distinguished chair, \nthe Senator from New Mexico, alluded to our budget proposal as one that \nseems to be outside the realm of the agreement we made last July. He \nalso noted the Republican budget is in keeping with these same \ncommitments.\n  Let there be no mistake about this, the Democratic alternative \nadheres to the requirements. It keeps the agreement--agreed to and \nsigned by Republicans and Democrats last July--intact. That is the \nwhole premise upon which we based our alternative budget resolution.\n  We recognize how important that agreement is. We recognize the \nimportance of investments. But as I noted in my opening comments, there \nis a profound difference between the vision expressed in our resolution \ntoward major investments in education, in child care, in those areas \nfor which we believe it is essential this country continue to invest, \nand the Republican proposal which fails to invest in those areas.\n  The second point: He sets up a false choice. He says he believes it \nis important for us to recognize the critical nature of using tobacco \nrevenue to shore up the Medicare program. I agree with that. I too \nthink there is an important need to invest in Medicare to ensure its \nsolvency. However, it is a false choice to say this is the only option \navailable to us as we pass tobacco legislation. Indeed, the Senate \nCommerce Committee itself takes issue with the statement just made by \nthe distinguished Budget Committee chair.\n  Yesterday, on a vote of 19 to 1, the Commerce Committee voted out its \nrecommendations to the Senate with regard to tobacco legislation. They \nnote it is important for us to take some of those revenues and dedicate \nthem to reimbursing public health care programs in Medicare. However, \nthey also say that, in addition to Medicare, it is critical we \nrecognize the importance of prevention and cessation activities, \nefforts to stop teenage smoking, to support health-related research, to \nensure tobacco farmers receive the resources they are going to need, to \nensure that we deal with the tobacco-asbestos trust fund, to ensure \nthat we deal with the problems in Medicaid, and to ensure that problems \nwith black lung are addressed through these resources.\n  In other words, the committee, in the 19-to-1 vote just yesterday, \nsaid we agree with the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, but we \nthink we ought to do more. We think that it is critical that we look at \nhow we prevent teenage smokers from starting, how we assist tobacco \nfarmers in during the transition, and how we deal with research in ways \nthat are not adequately addressed in this budget.\n  I think it is very critical to acknowledge that on an overwhelming \nbasis many in Congress have already indicated their support for \ndedicating tobacco revenues to an array of different needs including \nMedicare.\n  The bottom line is really very fundamental. We have to recognize that \nthis is our one opportunity to state our priorities. Our priorities \nought to be in education. Our priorities ought to be in child care. Our \npriorities ought to be in preventing teenage smoking. That is what our \nbudget does. That is what our priorities are. And that is the \ndifference in vision between Republican and Democratic budgets.\n  I ask the ranking member if he has any need to express himself prior \nto the time I yield the floor?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If I can have 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield 2 minutes of my leader time to the distinguished \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I don't want to take any more time \nthan that, because we have an understanding about the use of time, but \nI do want to say to my friend and colleague, the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, who is so articulate and who is so knowledgeable about the \nbudget, the only thing is he happens to be wrong. Other than that, we \nare in very good agreement.\n  What do I think the chairman is wrong about? Priorities. I think that \nwhen he lays out those things that are taken care of, we say, ``No, \nthey are not taken care of,'' and we will do all we propose, all the \nPresident has offered by staying within the budget caps, and we are \ngoing to use the pay-as-you-go mantra; that is, nothing happens until \nit is paid for. That is the way we see it.\n  When I see the narrowness, the demand that the only way that we spend \nany of our surplus is on Medicare--and I submit, and I proposed this \nthe other day--ask any grandparent, because by the time you get to \nSocial Security, you are pretty much a grandparent, if they would \nrather worry today about shoring up Medicare or keeping their child or \ntheir grandchild from starting smoking.\n  I can tell you what the answer is going to be. They would say, \n``Listen, we have lived a pretty good life, and we are worried about \nMedicare; we want you to help solve the problem, but if you are saying \ntake a choice between keeping my youngster from getting hooked on \ntobacco, which will begin his or her final innings at sometime in life \nwhen it is very inopportune, take care of those kids.''\n\n[[Page S3059]]\n\n  That is what we are asking for. If the revenues come from tobacco, we \nwant those funds to be used for smoking cessation programs.\n  I think it is a fairly simple choice, and that is, do we want to say \nto the American public that we are going to try to deal with all of the \nproblems that we have, but we are only going to do it if we have the \nmoney to spend and, if not, then we are going to have to forego that as \nwell?\n  We committed to a balanced budget. I worked not only amicably but I \nthink efficiently with my friend from New Mexico in getting a balanced \nbudget into place. We were commended by people across this country, \nincluding leaders of both our parties.\n  I want it to continue that way, Mr. President, and I hope we will be \nable to have the votes that say, ``OK, let's give the priorities that \nare for the people a chance to be put into effect.''\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time was used in excess of the \n15 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes 55 seconds of leader's time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to manage that \namount of time in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, outside of this, Senator Stevens wants \nto offer an amendment that is going to be accepted. I ask unanimous \nconsent that he be permitted to do that without it being charged to \neither side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2253, as modified\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2253, and I send \na modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       In the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.    . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING OUTLAY ESTIMATES OF \n                   THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE BUDGET\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created a new era for \n     federal spending and forced the Department of Defense to plan \n     on limited spending over the five year period from fiscal \n     year 1998 through 2002.\n       (2) The agreements forged under the Balanced Budget Act of \n     1997 specifically defined the available amounts of budget \n     authority and outlays, requiring the Department of Defense to \n     properly plan its future activities in the new, constrained \n     budget environment.\n       (3) The Department of Defense worked with the Office of \n     Management and Budget to develop a fiscal year 1999 budget \n     which complies with the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n       (4) Based on Department of Defense program plans and policy \n     changes, the Office of Management and Budget and the \n     Department of Defense made detailed estimates of fiscal year \n     1999 Department of Defense outlay rates to ensure that the \n     budget submitted would comply with the Balanced Budget Act of \n     1997.\n       (5) The Congressional Budget Office outlay estimate of the \n     fiscal year 1999 Department of Defense budget request exceeds \n     both the outlay limit imposed by the Balanced Budget Act of \n     1997 and the Office of Management and Budget's outlay \n     estimate, a disagreement which would force a total \n     restructuring of the Department of Defense's fiscal year 1999 \n     budget.\n       (6) The restructuring imposed on the Department of Defense \n     would have a devastating impact on readiness, troop morale, \n     military quality of life, and ongoing procurement and \n     development programs.\n       (7) The restructuring of the budget would be driven solely \n     by differing statistical estimates made by capable parties.\n       (8) In a letter currently under review, the Director of \n     the  Office of Management and Budget will identify \n     multiple differences between the Office of Management and \n     Budget's estimated outlay rates and the Congressional \n     Budget Office's estimated outlay rates.\n       (9) New information on Department of Defense policy changes \n     and program execution plans now permit the Office of \n     Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office to \n     reevaluate their initial projections of fiscal year 1999 \n     outlay rates.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the Sense of the Senate \n     that the totals underlying this concurrent resolution on the \n     budget assume that not later than April 22, 1998, the \n     Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the \n     Secretary of Defense, and the Director of the Congressional \n     Budget Office shall complete discussions and develop a common \n     estimate of the projected fiscal year 1999 outlay rates for \n     Department of Defense accounts.\n\n     SEC.    . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING OUTLAY ESTIMATES FOR \n                   THE BUDGETS OF FEDERAL AGENCIES OTHER THAN THE \n                   DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The federal civilian workforce in non-Defense \n     Department agencies shrank by 125,000 employees, or 10 \n     percent, between 1992 and 1997.\n       (2) The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 assumed over $60 \n     billion in reductions in nondefense discretionary spending \n     over the period 1998-2002.\n       (3) These reductions were agreed to notwithstanding ever-\n     increasing responsibilities in agencies engaged in fighting \n     crime, combating the drug war, countering terrorist threats, \n     cleaning the environment, enforcing the law, improving \n     education, conducting health research, conducting energy \n     research and development, enhancing the nation's physical \n     infrastructure, and providing veterans programs.\n       (4) All Federal agencies have worked closely with the \n     Office of Management and Budget to balance much-needed \n     programmatic needs with fiscal prudence and to submit budget \n     requests for FY 1999 that comply with the Balanced Budget Act \n     of 1997.\n       (5) Reductions in the President's requests, as estimated by \n     the Office of Management and Budget, to comply with the \n     Congressional Budget Office's estimates could seriously \n     jeopardize priority domestic discretionary programs.\n       (6) There is no mechanism through which the Congressional \n     Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget \n     identify their differences in outlay rates for nondefense \n     agencies.\n       (7) Such consultation would lead to greater understanding \n     between the two agencies and potentially fewer and/or smaller \n     differences in the future.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the Sense of the Senate \n     that the totals underlying this concurrent resolution on the \n     budget assume that not later than April 22, 1998, the \n     Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the \n     Director of the Congressional Budget Office, in consultation \n     with the Secretaries of the affected nondefense agencies, \n     shall complete discussions and develop a common estimate of \n     the projected fiscal year 1999 outlay rates for accounts in \n     nondefense agencies.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am offering a Sense-of-the-Senate \nAmendment which urges the Office of Management and Budget, the \nDepartment of Defense, and the Congressional Budget Office to develop a \ncommon estimate of outlays under the fiscal year 1997 Defense budget.\n  Last year, the Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act of 1997--\nputting the Federal Government on a path to living within its means. \nThe act specified the budget authority and outlay levels for the \nDefense Department for fiscal years 1998 and 1999.\n  The Department of Defense is a $250 billion organization--an \norganization which needs stability to run effectively.\n  The Defense Department relied on last year's Budget Act to build its \nfiscal year 1999 budget.\n  Currently, the fiscal year 1999 budget submitted by the Defense \nDepartment, and scored using OMB rates, complies with the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997.\n  OMB and the Defense Department built their outlay rates based on the \nspecific spending plans of each DOD program and based upon the policy \nchanges contained in the fiscal year 1999 Defense budget. In many \ncases, the Defense Department increased outlay rates over last year's \nlevels.\n  DOD also adjusted working capital fund policies, and billing rates, \nto generate positive balances and keep these funds solvent.\n  Mr. President, the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, which I \nchair, has for the last 3 years, transferred cash into the working \ncapital funds and directed DOD to change its billing rates and \npolicies.\n  The Defense Department has done what the Congress asked. However, the \nCongressional Budget Office has estimated that outlays under the fiscal \nyear 1999 Defense budget will exceed the limit imposed by the budget \nagreement, as well as the OMB quality estimate, by $3.7 billion. These \ndifferences are based on statistical analyses and projections of the \nfuture based on the past. While this may all be theoretically \ninteresting, it has severe implications for the Defense Department.\n  The Defense Appropriations Subcommittee would have to totally \nrestructure the fiscal year 1999 Defense budget to reduce outlays by \n$3.7 billion. We would have to cut military personnel funding \nunexpectedly forcing thousands of soldiers, sailors, and airmen out of \nthe force structure.\n  We would have to cut operation and maintenance funds--funds which \nkeep\n\n[[Page S3060]]\n\nour troops trained and ready, which pay to day-to-day bills for our \nbases, and which repair the aging equipment relied upon by our military \npersonnel.\n  Lastly, we could turn to the procurement and research and development \naccounts--cutting $2-$10 of budget authority for every dollar in \noutlays we must save. This would bring modernization to a virtual halt \nand increase the cost of the remaining, less efficient programs. These \ncuts would not serve the Senate, and Defense Department, or the Nation \nwell.\n  I understand that there may be new and more detailed information on \nthe Defense Department's budget policies and execution plans--\ninformation that the Congressional Budget Office did not consider.\n  It is essential that there be a common agreement on the outlay \nestimate of the Defense budget--an agreement that does not punish DOD \nbased on a disagreement over statistical predictions and historical \ninterpolation.\n  My amendment urges that everyone work toward this common agreement--\nan agreement which I hope will allow us adequate flexibility to \nmaintain balance in the fiscal year 1999 Defense budget.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to address \nmy colleagues on a subject which is of increasing concern to me. I have \nspent a great deal of time on the floor of the Senate during our \nconsideration of the budget resolution for this fiscal year and the \nfollowing 5 years. I have listened intently as the Senate has debated \ntaxes, education, child care, Social Security, Medicare and other \nissues which Senators have raised with respect to this resolution.\n  It has been glaringly evident to me, and I suspect to some of my \ncolleagues, that there has been little or no mention of national \nsecurity issues during this debate. No one has raised the issue of \ndefense spending. Maybe its because defense doesn't rank very high \nthese days in the polls which reflect the concerns of the American \npeople; Or maybe it's because everyone assumes that the defense budget \nis adequate and there is no reason to debate it. I am concerned first \nof all because I believe there is clear shortfall between the ambitious \nforeign policy of this Administration and the resources we are willing \nto provide for national defense.\n  The operational tempo of our military forces is at an all time high. \nAmerican forces are deployed literally around the globe. The foreign \npolicy of this Administration has raised the number of separate \ndeployments to the highest in our history. Our servicemen and women \nspend more and more time away from their homes and families on more \nfrequent and extended deployments. As a result, recruiting grows more \ndifficult and retention is becoming an extremely serious problem--\nespecially for pilots.\n  We are also beginning to see increasing indicators of readiness \nproblems. Spare parts shortages, increased cannibalization, declining \noperational readiness rates, cross-decking of critical weapons, \nequipment and personnel foretell a potential emergence of readiness \ndifficulties that could seriously cripple our military forces in the \nvery near future. The Chiefs of the military services indicate that \nthey are on the margin in readiness and modernization. The Chief of one \nof our military services has recently stated orally as well as in \nwriting that his budget for fiscal year 1999 is, for the third year in \na row, inadequate.\n  While, at the present time, the American people may not be expressing \nconcern about threats to our national security or the readiness of our \narmed forces, we in the Senate are not relieved of our responsibilities \nto ensure that we have capable, effective military forces ready to \ndefend our nation's vital interests. It is our job in the Congress to \nexamine the readiness and capability of our armed forces and ensure \nthat we have provided adequate resources and guidance to the Secretary \nof Defense so that he can carry out his mission with respect to \nour national security. I believe, as I have stated so many times on \nthis floor, that nothing that we do here in the Congress is more \nimportant than providing for our national security. I intend to \ncontinue to make this point whenever I believe that we in the Senate \nmay not be paying enough attention to this most critical issue.\n\n  Mr. President, the Congress has endeavored over the past several \nyears to shore up our defense budgets with annual add-ons. However, \nreductions in the defense budgets over the last 3 years to pay for \nBosnia have denigrated the effect of those congressional plus-ups. \nAlmost half of the $21 billion we added to the defense budgets over the \nlast 3 years which was intended to enhance readiness and modernization \nwas spent instead for operations in Bosnia. With the increased optempo \nof our buildup in the Persian Gulf, the strain on our military forces \nand budgets is more and more evident.\n  As many of you are aware, we face a potentially serious problem of \n$3.6 billion resulting from scoring differences between the Office of \nManagement and Budget and the Congressional Budget. The chairman of the \nBudget Committee, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and I \nwere able to work out an amendment to help alleviate this problem. We \nappreciate the assistance of the chairman of the Budget Committee and \ntrust that in his discussions with the Secretary of Defense, the Office \nof Management and Budget, and the Congressional Budget Office, he will \nresolve this problem. It is critical that this problem be resolved. \nOtherwise, the impact on the defense budget would be devastating to our \nmilitary forces.\n  The Armed Services Committee will begin work on our markup during the \nEaster recess period. We intend to have our bill on the floor before \nthe Memorial Day recess. Under the budget agreement, the Congress will \nnot be adding funds to the defense budget. I know that the majority of \nSenators would not support adding funds to the defense budget in \nviolation of the budget agreement. Therefore, we will conduct our \nmarkup consistent with the budget agreement. However, I have stated in \nthe past and I say again, I believe that we are not providing adequate \nfunds for defense. It remains my firm belief that we should provide \nadditional funds for our national security.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there are a number of cosponsors to this \namendment. The amendment I offer is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment \nwhich directs the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of \nDefense, and the Congressional Budget Office to develop a common \nestimate of outlays under the fiscal year 1999 defense budget. The \nmodification of my amendment adds a corresponding sense-of-the-Senate \nsection which urges OMB, CBO, and the Secretaries of nondefense \nagencies to also develop common estimates for the 1999 outlays for the \nnondefense discretionary programs.\n  I believe this amendment is one that is needed. It is a sense of the \nSenate, but it directs, as far as the Office of Management and Budget \nand CBO and the Defense Department, to find a common ground before we \nstart marking up either the authorization bill or the appropriations \nbill. It has been cosponsored by both sides. I believe it will be \naccepted. I ask for the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2253), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to Senator Stevens, I understand, \nworking with the other side, this amendment includes nondefense where \nthere are serious discretionary estimating inconsistencies.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The chairman is right. We have added the nondefense \nportion. It deals, however, just with the discretionary accounts, both \ndefense and nondefense discretionary. It is a matter that \nAppropriations must have resolved.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I know that Senator Hutchison is \nwaiting, but I want to use some of that 6 minutes. I am not sure I will \nuse all of it. Let me take a little.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2244\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I don't know how we judge right and \nwrong, whether I am right or wrong after an eloquent speech, as my \nfriend called it. But, look, this afternoon we\n\n[[Page S3061]]\n\nare going to vote and sometimes in America, democracy says the one that \ngets the most votes wins. I don't know if that means you are right, but \nI can tell you we are going to win and they are going to lose. I don't \nknow what that means, but I think that is pretty good.\n  In addition, let me suggest, I, too, am worried about what is \nhappening to our young children who smoke. It is wonderful for me to be \nable to say that I smoked heavily until 8 years ago. I have eight \nchildren and not a single one smokes. So I am very pleased about that. \nI don't know what that means either, except it is just a statement of \nfact.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Can I ask a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Did they see you coughing?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. They did not. But they used to leave all kinds of \nlittle notes on my pillow and stuff them underneath.\n  Mr. President, let me just say, it is a question in politics if there \nis ever enough spending by a Government. How much is enough, I ask? Is \n$825 million provided in this budget resolution to take care of \nadvertising to have a positive impact on our children smoking enough or \nshould we have more?\n\n  I tell you, that is twice as much as the President asked for. I \nassume if a Democratic President has some $400 million and we have $825 \nmillion, that probably--probably--we have enough. Having said that, \nthere are so many programs being talked about to come out of that pot \nof gold, that giant piggy bank, many of which nobody knows will even \nwork. If you have national advertising programs and preventive programs \nin drugs where you are going into schools, talking to the kids, running \nadvertising and it is not working a bit--in fact, there are more \ndrugs--one would have a tendency to be a bit skeptical, it seems to me, \nabout whether we know how to do that, be it for drugs or for \ncigarettes.\n  In the final analysis, we have decided in our budget resolution to \ntake every priority that we can find consistent with our 5-year \nagreement and fund them as best we can consistent with the agreement; \nthat there be no new discretionary spending.\n  What is happening now, just so everybody will understand, we asked \nthose experts who talk about our money supply, our interest rates, the \nwonderful economy, what are we supposed to be most concerned about to \nkeep the message out there that we are fiscally responsible and we are \naiming at a balanced budget for a long time? They tell us, ``Don't \nbreach the agreement that you entered into with reference to how much \nyou can spend each year as you appropriate annually.''\n  We all say we will not do that. That is right. But, Mr. President, \nwhat this budget that is before us and what the President chose to do \nis to take another pot of money and say, ``We'll spend it another way \nand it won't count against those agreed-upon expenditures.''\n  That is called new entitlement programs.\n  So this litany of new programs cannot be paid for under the budget \nagreement. But it can be paid for if you choose to create new \nentitlement programs that will go on forever even though the money from \nwhich they are paid has a terminal time. So I believe we did the right \nthing. We look forward to an era of balanced budgets, an era of solid \neconomic growth, an era during which we fix Social Security permanently \nand during which we fix Medicare permanently and we actually put our \nbudget where our mouth is, and that is to do those things.\n  I yield back any time that I might have. And in due course I will \nmake a point of order against the budget. But I do not choose to do it \nnow.\n  I say to Senator Hutchison, if you would let me dispose of a series \nof amendments, I would really appreciate that.\n\n\n Amendments Nos. 2187, 2204, 2217, 2212, 2225, 2233, 2235, 2236, 2237, \n 2239, 2240, 2246, 2248, 2250, 2253, 2258, 2263, 2264, 2266, 2269, and \n                             2270, en bloc\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have a list of amendments by number. \nThere are 21. And I will not cite each one but, rather, I will send the \nlist to the desk for consideration. These amendments have been agreed \nto. And I would like to agree to them en bloc. There is no objection on \nour side and no objection on their side, the Democrat side. They are \nboth Republican and Democrat amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the enumerated amendments \nsent to the desk will be considered en bloc.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2235\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the amendment I am offering with Senator \nLieberman expresses the sense of the Senate that the next budget \nsubmission by the President, and the next Congressional budget \nresolution, should reclassify all civilian research and development \nactivities within the Federal government, now scattered among 12 \nseparate budget functions in the Budget Resolution, into one budget \nfunction--Function 250.\n  Function 250, entitled ``General Science, Space, and Technology,'' \ncurrently is comprised of funding for the National Science Foundation, \nNASA, and some R programs at the Department of Energy.\n  The purpose of the functional analysis in the Budget Resolution is to \nprovide the Congress with insight into important crosscutting themes in \nthe budget. When it comes to the federal investment on R, though, the \ncurrent functional analysis in the Budget Resolution fails. It does not \nfacilitate any sort of cross-cutting discussion about the size and \ndirection of Federally supported science and technology research. In \nfact, our current budget function structure hides more than half of the \nFederal investment in civilian R According to data from the Office \nof Management and Budget, in addition to the agencies and programs \ncurrently in Function 250, 20 other civilian departments and agencies \nhave research and development programs of consequence. My amendment \nwould address this problem by providing more transparency to our \nsupport of Federal R No funds or programs would be shifted among \nagencies. But the President's next budget proposal would highlight \nwhere in each agency R was being supported. If the President were to \nimplement the suggestion in this amendment, I believe that it would \nhave the following beneficial effects.\n  No. 1, when all civilian R is placed into one budget function, it \nwill become much easier for the Congress to examine the entire Federal \nR portfolio. Questions of balance, coverage, and emphasis within that \nportfolio will become easier to ask when the whole picture can be seen \nmore easily.\n  No. 2, the proposed change in my amendment will facilitate the \nability of each authorizing committee to review the Federally supported \nR under its jurisdiction, as one element in preparing its views and \nestimates for the Budget Committee. The amendment will also allow \ncommittees such as the Committee on the Budget or the Committee on \nAppropriations to conduct a global review of federal R early in the \nbudget/appropriations process. The National Academy of Sciences has \nrecommended that such a global look at R take place annually in \nCongress in its 1995 report, Allocating Federal Funds for Science and \nTechnology. The Academy stated that the ``Congress should create a \nprocess that examines the entire [federal science and technology] \nbudget before the total federal budget is dis\nagggregated into allocations to appropriations committees and \nsubcommittees.'' This amendment would facilitate the implementation of \nthis idea, which has broad support in the scientific and technical \ncommunity.\n  No. 3, placing civilian R at mission agencies into Function 250 \nwill reflect the reality that all Federal research and development, \nregardless of sponsoring agency, is interrelated. All Federal R, \nregardless of sponsoring agency, can and does make essential \ncontributions to the general fund of knowledge. These are realities \nthat are well known to the scientific and technical community. In the \nwords of former IBM Vice President Lewis Branscomb, ``One cannot \ndistinguish in any meaningful way `basic' from `applied research' by \nobserving what a scientist is doing.''\n  No. 4, placing civilian R at mission agencies into Function 250 \nwill elevate the prominence of R supported by those agencies in \nfuture budget and policy discussions.\n\n[[Page S3062]]\n\n  I believe that this amendment will result in a valuable contribution \nto our institutional ability to understand and manage one of the most \nimportant parts of the Federal budget\n  I urge the adoption of both amendments.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2236\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment is co-sponsored by \nmyself, Senator Gramm of Texas, and Senator Lieberman. It expresses the \nsense of the Senate in favor of a basic principle that is widely \nsupported in this body. That principle is that we should seek to double \nthe Federal investment in civilian research and development over the \nnext 10 years. This principle is contained in legislation co-sponsored \nby us, the chairman of the Budget Committee, and about 10 other \nSenators.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Sense of the \nSenate Amendment to double federal R investments over the next ten \nyears. Federal support for research and development is all about \ncreating wealth and opportunity and assuring a higher quality of life \nfor our citizens. As policy makers, it is worth our while to focus on \nwealth creation because it enables everything else we want to do.\n  We have an awful lot of data these days that tell us there is a firm \nconnection between R expenditures and subsequent economic growth. One \ncommonly cited figure--derived from Dr. Robert Solow's Nobel prize-\nwinning research--is that 50% of America's post-World War II growth can \nbe attributed to technological innovation--innovation largely driven by \nthe discoveries that flow out of the nation's R laboratories. \nEconomists do not give us the tools to determine the optimum level of \nR spending, but is clear from all the data that we are far, far below \nthe point of diminishing returns. Numerous studies indicate that the \nmarginal rates of return on publicly-financed R investments are \nextraordinarily high. These high rates of return tell us that federal \nR expenditures are an especially efficient investment vehicle, that \nwe are currently underinvesting in R, and that we are underutilizing \nour nation's existing R infrastructure, including its pool of \ntalented scientist and engineers.\n  Why is the government involved in research in the first place? These \ndays industry funds nearly twice as much R as government does, why \ndon't we let them do all of it? The problem with that notion is that \nthe private sector, for the most part, does not fund discovery--\ngovernment does. The private sector funds the later phases of the \ninnovation process--those phases closest to product development. \nPrivately-financed R is mostly D--provides the critical link \nbetween research and the subsequent creation of new wealth and \nopportunity. It is vitally important, but it depends on publicly-\nfinanced R for fundamental knowledge creation.\n  The benefits of knowledge created in the nation's laboratories and \nuniversities are diffuse and typically yield economic returns only \nafter a significant time lag--a time lag well beyond the planning \nhorizon of most commercial firms. Moreover, the benefits cannot be \nanticipated in advance. The chemists and physical scientists who first \nconceived of utilizing nuclear magnetic resonance to determine chemical \nstructure never imagined that their discovery would become the basis of \na whole new medical diagnostic industry. Firms realize that they cannot \ncapture most of the benefits of fundamental research. It is a classic \nmarket failure. The returns are very significant, however, and they are \nfully captured by the society as a whole.\n\n  Because federal investments are typically focused on the early phases \nof the innovation process, they exert tremendous leverage. This is part \nof the reason why the returns on federal R investments are so high. \nThe early phases are the high-risk, high-payoff phases. There may be \nmany misses, but the hits are very large indeed.\n  In recent years, we have not maintained federal R investments at \ntraditional levels as a fraction of either discretionary spending or, \nmore significantly, as a fraction of national income. I would argue \nthat, in a society and an economy that are increasingly knowledge-\nintensive, we ought to be increasing our investments in knowledge \ncreation not reducing them. Nonetheless, federal support for research \nand development has declined substantially since the 1960s as a \npercentage of national income. We have to turn this situation around. \nRobust federal support for R and the American research enterprise is \none of the key elements in sustaining high levels of economic growth in \nthe future. We cannot take America's current economic and technical \nleadership for granted. If we are to maintain our nation's leadership \nposition, we must be prepared to make the requisite investments in our \nR system--the most productive system of its kind in the world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to the \namendments en bloc.\n  Without objection, the amendments are agreed to en bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 2187, 2204, 2217, 2212, 2225, 2233, 2235, 2236, \n2237, 2239, 2240, 2246, 2248, 2250, 2253, 2258, 2263, 2264, 2266, 2269 \nand 2270) were agreed to en bloc.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote by which the amendments \nwere agreed to en bloc.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2229\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I add to the list amendment No. 2229, \nthe Feinstein amendment. And I assume we will have to adopt that \nseparately.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this amendment expresses the sense of \nthe Senate that we must rededicate ourselves to making our public \neducation system the best. These reforms, if implemented by states and \nlocal school districts in partnership with the federal government, will \nimprove: The achievement of students; the quality of teaching; and the \naccountability of public school systems.\n  This sense of the Senate amendment has six elements. It calls on the \nfederal government to work with states, school districts and local \nleaders to accomplish the following goals by the year 2005:\n  (1) Establish achievement levels and assessments in every grade for \nthe core academic curriculum; measure each regular student's \nperformance; and prohibit the practice of ``social promotion'' of \nstudents (promoting students routinely from one grade to the next \nwithout regard to their academic achievement);\n  (2) Provide remedial programs for students whose achievement levels \nindicate they should not be promoted to the next grade;\n  (3) Create smaller schools to enable students to have closer \ninteraction with teachers;\n  (4) Require at least 180 days of instruction per year in core \ncurriculum subjects;\n  (5) Recruit teachers who are adequately trained and credentialed in \nthe subject or subjects they teach and encourage excellent, experienced \nteachers to remain in the classroom by providing adequate salaries; \nrequire all teachers to be credentialed and limit emergency or \ntemporary teaching credentials to a limited period of time; hold \nteachers and principals accountable to high educational standards;\n  (6) Require all regular students to pass an examination in basic core \ncurriculum subjects in order to receive a high school diploma.\n\n\n                 u.s. schools' performance unimpressive\n\n  In 1983--15 years ago--the National Commission on Excellence in \nEducation issued its startling report on the decline of America's \nschools, titled ``A Nation at Risk.'' Our schools today are still at \nrisk.\n  A February report this year revealed that American high school \nseniors are among the world's least prepared in math and science, \nscoring far below their peers in other countries. Overall, U.S. \nstudents outperformed only two countries in the Third International \nMathematics and Science Study--Cyprus and South Africa. In twelfth \ngrade advanced math and physics, U.S. students scored last in physics \nand next to last in math. American eighth graders scored well below the \ninternational average in math.\n  SAT scores today are near their lowest point ever, reports the \nBrookings Institute. The National Assessment of Educational Progress \nreported that math, science, writing and reading achievement have been \nflat for the past quarter century.\n  The U.S. Department of Education last fall reported that 29 percent \nof all\n\n[[Page S3063]]\n\ncollege freshmen require remedial classes in basic skills.\n  The 1997 annual report on our national education goals found that the \nhigh school dropout rate has increased and more teachers reported \nstudent disruptions in their classrooms.\n  The national goals report told us that performance has declined in \nreading achievement at grade 12 and in the percentage of secondary \nteachers who hold a degree in their main teaching assignment.\n  The goals report found no significant improvement in high school \ncompletion rate or reading achievement at grades 4 and 8.\n\n\n            issue 1: achievement levels; no social promotion\n\n  The first provision of my amendment urges the establishment of \nachievement levels and assessments in every grade for the core academic \ncurriculum and calls on state and local schools to stop social \npromotion. Social promotion is the practice of schools' advancing a \nstudent from one grade to the next regardless of the student's academic \nachievement.\n  Forty-nine states are working to establish achievement standards and \nassessments, but few have completed the task. AFT found: ``In most \ndistricts, there are no agreed-upon explicit standards of performance \nto which students are held accountable.''\n  Educators widely agree that tough, clear academic content and \nperformance standards are the only way to determine what students are \nlearning and how quickly or slowly they are learning it. Standards \nshould be the foundation of learning.\n  Social promotion is contrary to tough standards. Saying that social \npromotion is ``rampant,'' AFT leaders found that school districts' \ncriteria for passing and retaining students is vague, that only 17 \nstates have standards in the four core disciplines (English, math, \nsocial studies and science) that are well grounded in content and that \nare clear enough to be used.\n  It is time to end social promotion, a practice which misleads our \nstudents, their parents and the public.\n  I agree with the conclusion of the September 1997 study conducted by \nthe American Federation of Teachers:\n\n       Social promotion is an insidious practice that hides school \n     failure and creates problems for everybody--for kids, who are \n     deluded into thinking they have learned the skills to be \n     successful or get the message that achievement doesn't count; \n     for teachers who must face students who know that teachers \n     wield no credible authority to demand hard work; for the \n     business community and colleges that must spend millions of \n     dollars on remediation, and for society that must deal with a \n     growing proportion of uneducated citizens, unprepared to \n     contribute productively to the economic and civic life of the \n     nation.\n\n\n                         How Widespread Is It?\n\n  None of the districts surveyed by AFT have an explicit policy of \nsocial promotion, but almost every district has an implicit practice of \nsocial promotion. Almost all districts view holding students back as a \npolicy of last resort and many put explicit limits on retaining \nstudents. Districts have loose and vague criteria for moving a student \nfrom one grade to the next. This approach, concludes AFT, is implicit \napproval of social promotion.\n  AFT found last year that 7 states are seeking to end social promotion \nby requiring students to meet the state standards before being promoted \ninto certain grades, an increase over the 4 of the previous year.\n  Mike Wright, a San Diegian, is an example. Cited in the February 16 \nSan Diego Union-Tribune, Mr. Wright say he routinely got promoted from \ngrade to grade and even graduated from high school, even though he \nfailed some subjects. At age 29, he is now enrolled in a community \ncollege program to learn to read--at age 29.\n  Social promotion is a cruel joke. We are fooling students. We are \nfooling ourselves. Students think a high school diploma means \nsomething. But in reality, we are graduating students who cannot count \nchange, who cannot read a newspaper, who cannot fill out an employment \napplication.\n\n\n      The Academic Cost of No Achievement Levels, Social Promotion\n\n  Students' need for remedial work is one measure of the harm of the \nlack of clear achievement levels and the practice of social promotion. \nHere are some examples:\n  A January 1998 poll by Public Agenda asked employers and college \nprofessors whether they believe a high school diploma guarantees that a \nstudent has mastered basic skills. In this poll, 63% of employers and \n76 percent of professors said that the diploma is no guarantee that a \ngraduate can read, write or do basic math.\n  In California, a December 1997 report from a state education \naccountability task force estimated that at least half of the state's \nstudents--3 million children--perform below levels considered \nproficient for their grade level.\n  Nationwide, about one third of college freshmen take remedial courses \nin college and three-quarters of all campuses, public and private, \noffer remediation, says the AFT study.\n  A March 27 California State University study found that more than \ntwo-thirds of students enter Cal State campuses in Los Angeles lack the \nmath or English they should have mastered in high school. At some high \nschools, not one graduate going on to one of Cal State's campuses \npassed a basic skills test. At Cal State Dominguez Hills, for example, \n8 out of 10 freshmen enrollees last fall needed remedial English and 87 \npercent needed remedial math.\n  Sadly, these numbers represent an increase. In the fall of 1997, 47 \npercent of freshmen enrolled at CSU needed remediation, compared to 43 \npercent in each of the previous three years. In math, 54 percent needed \nremedial help, compared to 48 percent in 1994.\n  Similarly, almost 35 percent of entering freshmen at the University \nof California do poorly on UC's English proficiency test and must \nreceive help in their first year.\n  Florida spent $53 million in college on remedial education, says the \nAFT study.\n  In Boston, school principals estimate that half their ninth graders \nare not prepared for high school work.\n  In Ohio, nearly one fourth of all freshmen who attend state public \nuniversities must take remedial math or English (Cleveland Plain \nDealer, July 7, 1997)\n  Employers tell me that their new hires are unprepared for work and \nthey have to provide very basic training to make them employable. For \nexample, last year, MCI spent $7.5 million to provide basic skills \ntraining (USA Today, 1996).\n\n\n           Support for Ending Social Promotion is Widespread\n\n  Fortunately, many policymakers are beginning to realize that we must \nstop social promotion. President Clinton called for ending it in his \nJanuary 27 State of the Union speech. He said, ``We must also demand \ngreater accountability. When we promote a child from grade to grade who \nhasn't mastered the work, we don't do that child any favors. It is time \nto end social promotion in America's schools.''\n  On February 23, the President sent Secretary Riley a memo asking him \nto prepare guidelines for educators on ending social promotion and \nguidelines for using federal funds to adopt sound promotion policies. \n``Neither promoting students when they are unprepared or simply \nretaining them in the same grade is the right response to low student \nachievement,'' the President wrote. ``Both approaches presume high \nrates of initial failure are inevitable and acceptable.''\n  At least three states--Florida, Arkansas and Texas--explicitly outlaw \nsocial promotion.\n  The Chicago Public Schools have ditched social promotion. After their \nnew policy was put in place, in the spring of 1997, over 40,000 \nstudents failed tests in the third, sixth and eighth and ninth grades \nand then went to mandatory summer school. Chicago School Superintendent \ncalls social promotion ``education malpractice.'' He says from now on \nhis schools' only product will be student achievement.\n  Cincinnati's students are now promoted based on specific standards \nthat define what students must know.\n  In my own state, the San Diego School Board in February adopted \nrequirements that all students in certain grades must demonstrate \ngrade-level performance. And they will require all students to earn a C \noverall grade average and a C grade in core subjects for high school \ngraduation, effectively ending social promotion for certain grades and \nfor high school graduation. For example, San Diego's schools are \nrequiring that eighth graders who do\n\n[[Page S3064]]\n\nnot pass core courses be retained or pass core courses in summer \nschool.\n  As long as we tolerate social promotion and the absence of standards, \nwe will never know (1) what our students need to learn and (2) whether \nthey have learned what they should learn. How, I ask, can you measure \nwhat you have accomplished if you don't know where you are going?\n\n\n                    issue 2: more remedial programs\n\n  Some schools are trying to provide after-school help, tutoring and \nsummer school remedial programs as ways of intervening when students \nare having learning problems, but a report by the American Federation \nof Teachers found that only 13 states require local school districts to \nprovide academic intervention for students who fail to meet standards. \nSimilarly, a report of the Council of Chief State School Officers in \n1997 on math and science standards, found that states were doing very \nlittle to ensure that all students master the standards.\n  AFT's 1997 report on state standards found that only 13 states \nrequire and fund intervention programs to help low-performing students, \nup from 10 the previous year.\n  The Chicago Public School, for example, have launched a major \nrevamping of their school system, and have made after-school programs a \npriority in helping students learn.\n\n\n                        issue 3: smaller schools\n\n  The amendment calls on school districts to have smaller schools. In \nCalifornia, some campuses sprawl across acres and acres and schools can \nhave thousands of students. The principal is just a voice over the \nloudspeaker. School personnel hardly know the names of the students.\n  I believe that elementary schools should have no more than 500 \nstudents; middle schools, 750 students; and high schools, 1,500 \nstudents. I believe that in smaller schools children have a stronger \nsense of community and connectedness, that school personnel become \ncloser to and more effective with their students.\n  One study of 744 large high schools found that the dropout rate at \nschools with over 2,000 students was double that of schools with 667 or \nfewer students. Another study of 357 schools revealed that large \nschools have higher rates of class cutting, absenteeism, and classroom \ndisorders.\n  I believe these studies make a compelling case.\n\n\n                      issue 4: longer school year\n\n  My amendment also urges states and school districts to have a school \nyear of at least 180 days. The U.S. school year averages around 180 \ndays, an outdated calendar based on our agrarian past over 100 years \nago.\n\n  Currently, 29 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico \nrequire a minimum of 180 teaching days. California now requires only \n172 teaching days, but a new state law does provide incentive funds for \nadding up to eight professional days to the 172-day school year.\n  Many other countries have longer school years than we do. Students in \nEngland, Germany and Japan go to school between 220 and 243 days a \nyear.\n  A 1993 study entitled ``Timepiece: Extending and Enhancing Learning \nTime'' observed that American school children spend more days out of \nschool than in school and documented ``summer learning loss,'' finding \nthat teachers spend four to six weeks every fall going over lessons \nfrom the previous school year. Similarly, A Nation at Risk recommended \nlengthening both the school day and the school year.\n  Along with setting high standards, we must put more time into \nteaching and learning and thus my amendment recommends 180 days of \ninstructional time, which still would leave us with a school year \nshorter than many of our international competitors.\n\n\n                       issue 5. trained teachers\n\n  Class sizes cannot be reduced without hiring more teachers. And these \nteachers must be trained and credentialed teachers.\n  The National Commission on Teaching and Learning in November 1997 \nbrought us some disturbing findings:\n  More than one-fourth of newly-hired teachers lack qualifications for \ntheir jobs.\n  The U.S. has no real system in place to ensure that teachers get \naccess to the kinds of knowledge they need to help their students \nsucceed.\n  Twenty-three percent of high school teachers do not even have a minor \nin their main teaching field.\n  School systems often waive or lower standards to hire people without \nqualifications to teach.\n  California, unfortunately, is a case example. We have 21,000 teachers \non emergency credentials. In California, nearly 22,000 of the 240,000 \npublic school teachers in California are not fully credentialed or have \nnot passed a basic skills test. Half of California's math and science \nteachers did not minor in those subjects in college, yet they are \nteaching. The October 13, 1997, U.S. News and World Report reported \nthat in Los Angeles, ``new teachers have included Nordstrom clerks, a \nformer clown, and several chiropractors.''\n  The National Commission on Teaching and America's Future ranked \nCalifornia near the bottom of states in the quality of our public \nschool teaching force because we have some of the highest proportions \nof uncertified or undertrained teachers, particularly in math and \nscience. The Commission defined ``well-qualified'' as a teacher with \nfull certification and a major in their assigned field. By this \nmeasure, only 65 percent of the state's teachers meet the standard. \nNationally, that figure is 72 percent. In California, 46 percent of \nhigh school math teachers did not minor in math. The national average \nis 28 percent.\n  California will need up to 300,000 new teachers in the next decade \nbecause of our escalating enrollment. But a 1996 analysis by Policy \nAnalysis for California Education found that my state could only expect \nabout 9,000 new credentialed teachers per year if current trends \ncontinue.\n  Without good teachers, no school reform, however visionary or \nrevolutionary, can improve student learning. This nation needs a major \ninvestment in teacher training, professional development and we need to \npay teachers decent, professional salaries to attract and retain them.\n\n\n                  issue 6: final exams for graduation\n\n  Without achievement levels or tests, students today can leave high \nschool with a diploma.\n  According to the Council of Chief State School Officers, for the \n1995-1996 school year, only 17 states require passing minimum \ncompetency tests for high school graduation. California, for example, \ndoes not require high school graduation exams.\n  The 1997 AFT report on state standards found that only 13 states have \nhigh school graduation exams based on 10th grade standards or higher.\n  Therefore, without standards, with social promotion rampant, a high \nschool diploma means little. It is no measure of achievement. This has \nto stop.\n\n\n             the public expects performance, accountability\n\n  In a recent survey of Californians, 61 percent agreed that our \nschools need a ``major overhaul,'' up from 54 percent who answered the \nsame question two years ago. A mere six percent believe that schools \nprovide a ``quality education.''\n  A poll by Policy Analysis for California Education found that only 17 \npercent of Californians considers the state's schools ``good'' or \n``excellent,'' down from about 33 percent three years ago. A 1997 poll \nin my state found that improving elementary and secondary education has \nreplaced crime and immigration at Californians' top priority.\n  Nationally, a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll last year found that 58 \npercent of Americans say fundamental changes are needed in U.S. \nschools. A Garin-Hart poll last year found only 9% of the public \nbelieves our public education system ``works pretty well.'' Only 27 \npercent gave our schools an above-average rating. A whopping 84% of \npeople favor establishing meaningful national standards.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this amendment \nbecause we must stop shortchanging our students.\n  School achievement must mean something. It must mean more than \nfilling up a seat at a desk for 12 years. A diploma should not just be \na symbol of accumulating time in school. And school systems need to be \naccountable.\n  I hope today the Senate will go on record in support of this modest \namendment that expresses 6 critical principles for school reform.\n\n[[Page S3065]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to the \namendment No. 2229.\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2229) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask the distinguished chairman of the committee, \napproximately how long is he asking authors of amendments to--\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are operating under a time agreement where you are \nin control of 15 minutes and the opposition has 15 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you. We will certainly yield back part of our \ntime. Well, I will wait and see what the opposition is.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2208\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I call up amendment No. 2208 and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       An amendment numbered 2208 previously proposed by [Mr. \n     Domenici] for Mrs. Hutchison of Texas.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Grams as a \ncosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this is what my amendment does. It is \na sense of the Senate that this resolution assumes that any budget \nsurplus should be dedicated to debt reduction or direct tax relief for \nhard-working American families.\n  It is really quite simple. This Congress has labored mightily for the \nlast 2 years to come up with a balanced budget. This budget resolution, \nwhich has been so ably led by the Senator from New Mexico, and helped \nby the Senator from New Jersey, is an example of how difficult it has \nbeen to actually balance our budget. It has not been easy. It has been \ntough to make these hard choices, but Congress has done it.\n  We are talking about a balanced budget and, in fact, surpluses. I am \nsaying, do not fritter away the victory. We have done the tough things. \nNow is not the time to get wimpy. Now is the time to remain tough, so \nthat we will be able to assure our children and grandchildren that they \nwill not inherit the $5 trillion of debt that has been built up in this \ncountry for the last 40 years. It is a time to say we are going to be \nresponsible stewards of this country while we are on the watch deck.\n  It is time for us to say, it is the sense of the Senate that there \nare only two responsible choices for spending any budget surplus: \neither tax cuts for the hard-working American family that is today \npaying over 38 percent of its income in Federal, State and local \ntaxes--and if you add the regulatory burden on top of that, government \nis costing the average American family, at the $50,000 level, 50 \npercent of its income. If we say we are going to give tax cuts to those \nhard-working Americans or we are going to start paying down the debt \nfor our children and grandchildren, and to keep interest rates low, \nthat would be the sense of this Senate for the responsible stewardship \nof our economy.\n\n  We have the highest debt burden today of any peacetime in American \nhistory. Economic research shows that tax cuts actually add to the \neconomy. They generate work; they generate jobs; they generate buying \npower. So it would have a huge impact in a positive way. Debt reduction \nalso has positive returns because certainly it will keep interest rates \nlow and we can continue to invest in our savings.\n  Not only are taxes at record highs today, but the trend is in the \nwrong direction. Since President Clinton came into office in 1993, the \ntax burden as a percent of gross domestic product has climbed 2.1 \npercentage points. Just reducing taxes to the 1993 levels means the \naverage family would have a tax windfall of $2,500. This is their \nmoney. This money is money they earn, and we believe it belongs to \nthem. That is what this sense of the Senate would say to the American \npeople--you earned this money, and it belongs to you, and if we are not \ngoing to give you direct tax relief, the surplus is going to pay down \nthe debt so that you will be able to continue to enjoy the great \neconomy we have and we will also give to our children the same \nstability in a great economy.\n  The amendment is very simple. I ask my colleagues to vote that we \nwill not undo the hard choices and the hard work that we have done in \nthis Congress over the last 3 years, but in fact we will do the right \nthing, and that is, give the money back to the people who earned it or \npay down that debt so that our interest rates can stay low and so that \nwe can stop paying so much interest.\n  Mr. President, I now yield the rest of our time--up to 5 minutes--to \nSenator Grams, the cosponsor of this resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I thank the Senator from Texas for all her fine work on this \namendment.\n  I rise today to offer my strong support to Senator Hutchison's sense \nof the Senate calling on Congress to look at and to reserve any future \nbudget surplus for tax relief and natural debt reduction or Social \nSecurity reform. But this amendment represents, I believe, some very \nsound, responsible fiscal policy, and again I commend Senator Hutchison \nfor her leadership and her efforts on this very important issue.\n  The question of how to use the potential budget surplus has been \ndebated extensively before this Chamber. In my view, tax relief and \ndebt reduction and Social Security reform are all equally important. \nTax relief will reduce the growing tax burden on our American families. \nAs Senator Hutchison pointed out, from 38 percent to more than 50 \npercent of the incomes of our average families in this country are \ngoing to support government rather than supporting their families. But \nif we give tax relief, it will increase incentives to work, save and \ninvest. It will help keep our economy strong. Debt reduction and Social \nSecurity reform will address our long-term fiscal imbalances. These are \ntwo closely related issues, and I believe they go hand in hand. We can \nand we should be addressing both of these at the same time.\n  There are compelling reasons for supporting this amendment. When we \ntalk about how to use the budget surplus, let us not forget those who \ngenerated this surplus in the first place. If, as the administration is \npredicting, we do achieve a budget surplus, that surplus will have come \ndirectly from working Americans, from taxes paid by corporations, from \nindividuals and investors. Clearly, this money belongs to the American \npeople. It has been an overcharge. It is only fair to return it to the \ntaxpayers who earned that money in the first place.\n\n  Families today, again, are taxed at the highest level since World War \nII, with 38 percent to 50 percent of a typical family budget going to \npay taxes on the Federal, State and local level. Last year's tax cuts, \nI believe, moved us in the right direction, but in reality those tax \ncuts were too little, too late, too small. After spending the \nunexpected $225 billion revenue windfall last year, busting the 1993 \nspending caps, Washington delivered tax cuts only one-third as large as \nlawmakers had promised back in 1994.\n  Recent polls show that 89 percent of the American people believe that \ntaxes on all levels of government should not consume more than 25 \npercent of their income. Again, 89 percent of Americans believe that \nall levels of taxes should not consume more than 25 percent of their \nincome, and 77 percent also believe that estate taxes should be \neliminated.\n  Lower tax rates, again, increase incentives to work, save and invest. \nThey help families to maximize their income and improve their standard \nof living. They allow families to allocate their precious dollars to \nmeet their own needs, not to go out and meet the needs of disconnected \nspenders located in Washington.\n  So, again, cut taxes and families today, who are forced to scrimp \njust to cover their monthly bills and their taxes, would find that they \nhave more money to spend on their children's education, on their health \ncare expenses,\n\n[[Page S3066]]\n\non food, clothing and insurance, et cetera. If we are truly interested \nin giving our families the tools that they need to help raise their \nchildren, isn't it about time that Washington cut their taxes instead \nof limiting their choices?\n  Beyond the direct benefits to families, tax cuts can also have a \nsubstantial and very positive impact on the economy as a whole. John F. \nKennedy proved it. Ronald Reagan proved it. So we should not spend a \nbudget surplus that does not yet exist. If a surplus, however, does \ndevelop, the Government has no claim on it because the Government did \nnot generate it. So I do not believe Washington should be first in line \nto reap the benefits of any surplus.\n  A surplus, again, will be the direct result of the hard work of the \nAmerican people, and, therefore, it should be returned to the American \npeople, either in the form of additional tax relief or beginning to pay \ndown this tremendous $5.6 trillion national debt.\n  So, Mr. President, a vote for the Hutchison-Grams amendment is a vote \nfor families. I believe it is a vote for fiscal sensibility in \nWashington, and I urge my colleagues very strongly to give it their \nsupport.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from \nTexas have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes 34 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is the minority going to respond?\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous consent it be \ncharged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I rise to oppose the amendment of the Senator from \nTexas, Senator Hutchison. It would reject President Clinton's call to \nsave Social Security first.\n  Now, the Hutchison amendment calls for diverting part of any surplus \nfor tax breaks. It therefore directly contravenes the President's plan \nto preserve Social Security benefits for baby boomers and other young \nAmericans. For the first time in 30 years, Mr. President, we are \nprobably going to have a budget surplus at the end of 1998--1998; that \nis, the current fiscal year. It ends September 30.\n  The forecast for the coming decade is for continued surpluses--$1 \ntrillion over the next decade. We have tightened our belts, we have \nrestored fiscal responsibility, and these surpluses are largely the \nproduct of our joint hard work.\n  What do we do with the surplus? On this question, the President has \nspoken clearly and unequivocally. I agree, before we spend a penny of \nany surplus, we should save Social Security first. A decade from now, \nthe baby boom generation will begin to retire. Additionally, Americans \nprobably, Lord willing, are going to be living longer and having fewer \nchildren. That means fewer workers will be contributing to Social \nSecurity for each beneficiary. These forces will put severe strains on \nthe Social Security system. It could have a real impact on our economy.\n  If we do not maintain fiscal discipline, plan ahead, we could reduce \nthe quality of life for our children and thus jeopardize the most \nimportant safety net for protecting senior citizens against poverty. \nThat is why the President has been so insistent that we save Social \nSecurity first. That is why the amendment by the Senator from Texas is, \nin my view, misguided.\n  I heard the Senator talk about restraining ourselves, about returning \nmoney to the citizens as quickly as we can. The President shares that \nobjective. What he says when he says save Social Security first, he \ntalks about doing it through paying down the debt. If we look at where \nwe are now, I have to say, the President's leadership in managing this \neconomy is pretty good. This doesn't mean that our friends on the \nRepublican side haven't worked together with us and the administration \nto do things. This isn't pointing a finger. It is recognizing where we \nare: The lowest inflation rate, perhaps, in 30 years, in terms of the \nconsistency and the level of the rate; the lowest unemployment rate in \ndecades; the best growth rate in the economy that we have seen in \ndecades; perhaps the best economic condition that this country has ever \nseen--maybe any country has ever seen.\n  We are on the right track, and we are paying down debt. We have gone \nfrom almost $300 billion when President Clinton took over, down to a \nprospective surplus in 1998, a period of 6 years. That is quite an \naccomplishment.\n  Why is it, at a time like this, that we suddenly recognize, ``My \ngosh, we have a huge deficit out there and we better get it paid \ndown''? The President agrees, except he provides the leadership to do \nit.\n  I urge my colleagues to resist the short-term temptations. Confirm \nthe fact that we want to save Social Security. Confirm the fact that we \nwant to pay down the debt. Let's continue to work together, not point \nfingers at who is at fault. If we are going to point fingers at who is \nat fault, we had better point fingers at those who helped us in the \nexcellent job we have done together, and it was not all done by Alan \nGreenspan, as much respect as I have for him. I want to make sure \nSocial Security will be there to protect younger Americans as it is \nhere today for parents and grandparents.\n  Mr. President, we have had all kinds of attacks on the present \ncondition. Frankly, I scratch my head and say, What are my friends \nlooking at? I see a stock market that is thriving--and I am not here to \nprognosticate the future of the stock market, but I heard a very \ndistinguished economist, a personal friend of mine, on the air this \nmorning. His name is David Jones. He is with a New York firm. He says \nthat he thinks the economy is in pretty good shape in terms of the \nmarket. He doesn't see any reason to get overly concerned about sudden \nmarket dips. He doesn't predict that the market is going to continue \nstraight up, but he predicts it is on a good, solid base.\n  So the worry tree is sprouting buds here. I don't know whether it has \nto do with the political condition we will be facing when we get out \nthere and talk to voters or exactly what it is. I want to be as frugal, \nas thrifty, as the next one, but I also want to make sure we maintain \nthe service of our responsibilities to the people in our society, that \nthose who don't have as much money as some at the top are still able to \nafford a college education for their child so that child can learn, to \nmake sure there is sufficient housing for people, to make sure there \nare jobs for people who are moving from welfare to work. We had better \nhave work for them.\n  There are lots of worries and concerns, as I guess there always are \nwith mankind, no matter what the conditions are. Recognize what we \nhave, recognize where we have come, and at least admit we are doing the \nright kind of a job.\n  So I don't want to do anything that will restrict the way we function \nwith this economy of ours. That is why I don't want to succumb to the \nshort-term temptation and take money out of programs to pay down the \ndebt. We have a program laid out on just how we will do these things.\n  I hope my colleagues will say no to the amendment offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from New Jersey \nthat he can very well vote for my amendment and still do what he says \nhe wants to do, and that is, save Social Security first, because my \namendment just lays out the framework for what our priorities would be.\n  What it says is that there are only two reasons we should spend the \nsurplus: For tax cuts for the hard-working American family, or for debt \nreduction, which would save Social Security.\n  I support saving Social Security first with all of the surplus, and \nthat would be possible under my amendment. But what we are saying is, \nwe are not going to do anything else with the surplus. We are not going \nto go on new spending binges. We are going to live within our income. \nWe are going to prioritize our budget, just like every family in \nAmerica does. We are going to live within that budget. And every penny \nof surplus can only go to one of two purposes: One is tax reductions on \nthe\n\n[[Page S3067]]\n\nhard-working American family, and the second is to pay down debt. If we \ncontinue to pay all the debt, to save Social Security, you can vote for \nmy amendment and be very happy that all of the Congress will support \ndebt reduction as one of our two priorities.\n\n  I hope everyone will support this sense of the Senate, because I \nthink it does set our priorities, just as this budget resolution does. \nThat is what a budget does; it sets the priorities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, is the Senator from Texas ready to \nyield back time? If so, I yield back my time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Kyl as a \ncosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield back the remainder.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2176\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. In the interest of reducing the time, I will accept the \nBoxer amendment numbered 2176, and I yield back the time I was going to \nuse to speak, and she has yielded all her time but 1 minute.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield that time back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2176) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2226\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I believe we will go to Senator Rockefeller, if he is \nready.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I call up my amendment numbered 2226 \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Amendment numbered 2226, previously proposed by the Senator \n     from West Virginia [Mr. Rockefeller].\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, we have a very interesting amendment \nto propose and I think a very important one. I want to say first, I \nfully support highway funding. Obviously, in a State like West \nVirginia, where it is mostly mountainous, highway funding is more \nimportant and more expensive than most places. I supported Senate \npassage of ISTEA. We are spending $217 billion on highway funding this \nyear. When I was Governor, I helped get an amendment passed in this \nCongress, which was actually referred to as the Rockefeller amendment, \nwhich said if States had accumulated money, they went to the head of \nthe line on interstate highway building and got their money from the \nFederal Government first.\n  Again, this is in no way an antihighway amendment, as some are very \nanxious to label it. It is, however, very much a proveteran amendment. \nThe amendment has one purpose and one purpose only: To protect veterans \nfunding from a midnight raid--nothing less--by the administration and \nthe Budget Committee. The raid isn't really a raid, it is a ravage on \nthe authority of the Veterans' Committee to see that the needs of the \nNation's veterans are met. In this case, I am talking particularly \nabout disabled veterans.\n  It is as simple as that. The veterans' account under the budget \nauthority is being cut by $10.5 billion to pay for an enormous increase \nin highway funds. This money is in the veterans' budget baseline. And \ntoday they are taking it away from disabled veterans and putting it \ninto highways, where we already have $217 billion. My point is they \nneed to find another offset.\n  I think my colleagues would want to know just what is being done \nhere, because it is not a pretty sight. First, what is the law about? \nVeterans law generally requires the VA to pay disability compensation \nto veterans for any injuries, diseases, or conditions they incur while \nthey are in service in the military. After long debate, and for very \ngood reasons, the Government long ago decided that veterans disability \ncompensation is not limited to only combat-related conditions. The \nbudget resolution would change that.\n  In 1993, the VA general counsel in a Republican administration \ninterpreted the law to require the payment of disability compensation \nto veterans who could prove they had become addicted to tobacco while \nin military service if that addiction continued without \ninterruption and resulted in an illness and disability.\n\n  It is important to remember that this is a very, very tough test for \nveterans to meet. And very few veterans--only about 8 percent of those \nwho have made such claims--have been able to meet this test so far. In \nmy home State of West Virginia, where there are approximately 200,000 \nveterans watching this debate closely, as of March 10, only 250 \nsmoking-related disability claims have been filed and, of that number, \nonly 6--6--had been granted so far. What this says to me is that these \nare tough claims to substantiate. This tough test is the very reason \nthat so few claims have been filed and why so few have been granted.\n  Even the military now acknowledges that it played a significant role \nin fostering addiction in very young men and women in the service. How \ndid the military do this? One, by distributing free cigarettes in C-\nrations and K-rations. Two, by creating a culture that encouraged \nsmoking at every opportunity, a culture of ``smoke 'em if you've got \n'em.'' And three, by selling tobacco products at vastly reduced prices, \nprices as much as 76% less than in civilian markets.\n  Mr. President, whether or not a veteran became addicted to tobacco \nduring military service, the results of that addiction are issues that \nthe VA has correctly decided, under existing law, should be determined \nby its triers of fact. This is the law currently. This is the law that \nthe Budget Committee would unilaterally change.\n  Now we get to the midnight raid. In approving the fiscal year 1999 \nbudget resolution, the Senate Budget Committee assumes a $10.5 billion \ncut from the veterans account--from disabled veterans, in effect--to \npartially fund the very large increase in ISTEA funds. The Budget \nCommittee made this transfer based upon their decision to totally bar \nany veterans' claims for disabilities resulting from any tobacco-\nrelated illnesses. But not only did the Budget Committee make this raid \non veterans' compensation for disabled veterans under the budget \nresolution, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs' jurisdiction over this \nissue is totally removed. And lo and behold, where does it appear to \ngo? It appears to be solely placed in the realm of the Transportation \nSubcommittee of the Appropriations Committee.\n  Mr. President, this type of gimmickry makes a mockery of our budget \nprocess and of regular order in the Senate. It makes a mockery of the \nsystem of the Senate, which so many of our Senators are fond of talking \nabout. This budget resolution will ultimately result in the erosion not \nonly of the Veterans' Committee's authority, but of all authorizing \ncommittees' authority to determine policy. The budget committee is \nsaying to us on the Veterans' Committee, we who take our work \nseriously, we will decide for you, we in the Appropriations Committee \nwill decide for you; you will not decide policy in the authorizing \ncommittee.\n  Let's put a human face on this issue. Just who are the people that \nthis VA compensation is helping? In Huntington, WV, Robert Christian is \na 71-year-old World War II veteran. He entered the Navy when he was 17 \nyears old. He began smoking cigarettes supplied by the Navy while on a \nship headed to the Pacific, where he was involved in three separate \ninvasions during that war.\n  Robert is just one of thousands of World War II veterans who became \naddicted to cigarettes supplied by the military. Don't talk about \npersonal choice. His cigarettes were supplied by the military. So \nRobert smoked and has been addicted for 24 years. Today, he has \nbronchitis and emphysema as a result of his addiction. He receives \nregular treatments to help him breathe.\n\n[[Page S3068]]\n\n  Because Robert and his physicians were able to make the connection \nbetween his bronchitis and his nicotine addiction, his medical \ndisability has been service-connected by the Department of Veterans \nAffairs. Under the budget resolution, veterans like Robert would not be \nable to seek help. That is a disgrace.\n  His disability check is not a lot of money, I might add. But the real \nasset in this case is his VA health care. Now, as a service-connected \nveteran, Robert is able to go to the VA medical center for treatment of \nhis service-connected condition. He is able to get his health care \nbecause he is service connected. This would change under the budget \nresolution.\n\n  And let's look at my friend, Larry Stotts of Spencer, WV. Larry \njoined the Marines at age 18, and he, too, began smoking the cigarettes \nsupplied in service.\n  Larry is a Korean War combat veteran and one of the Chosin Few. The \nChosin Few are veterans of a bloody battle--in driving snow and sub-\nzero temperatures--at the Chosin Reservoir in Korea in 1950.\n  After years of smoking beginning in the military, Larry has chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease. It is so severely disabling that the VA \nhas granted--under the very law now proposed to be struck down--a 100% \nservice-connected disability and free medical care.\n  So when you take away this Department of Veterans Affairs \ncompensation, remember that VA health care is now being provided on a \npriority basis. It has to do with your service-connected status or \nincome level, and the first priority is for medical conditions linked \nto service in the military. A vote to deny VA compensation for smoking-\nrelated illnesses due to Government-sponsored nicotine addiction, which \nbegan in the service when these young men and women were teenagers, is \nalso a vote to deny veterans health care--not just compensation for \nbeing disabled, but health care to thousands of veterans who turn to \nthe VA for treatment of their smoking-related diseases. This is indeed \na sorry statement about this country's sense of obligation to those who \nserved our country. Mr. President, this issue is much clearer than all \nof this discussion of the law and the cost estimates. The issue is \nstunningly simple. Even if one opposes paying this compensation to a \ndisabled veteran, or even if one is totally comfortable with the cost \nestimates that have been created, there is simply no reason--no \nreason--morally, ethically, or otherwise, to take away money from \ndisabled veterans' programs and use it for other programs like tax cuts \nand highways. It is outrageous that veterans' programs are being looted \nin this way.\n  We are not asking for cuts in all accounts this year. In fact, we are \nnot even demanding that others, such as Social Security disability \nrecipients, lose their smoking-related compensation. No. Only veterans.\n  This year, we single out veterans and say: You, veterans, pay for all \nof this by giving up your rights. We imagine your satisfaction, \ndisabled veterans, at $10 billion extra for highways, paid for by the \nloss of your rights to compensation as a disabled veteran.\n  I oppose this raid. I urge a vote in favor of my amendment, and I \nreserve the remainder of my time.\n  I will ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment after I yield to the \nSenator from Colorado. How much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 3 minutes 5 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I thank my friend from West Virginia. I \nwant to associate myself with his remarks. It is amazing to me how much \nwe praise the actions of our military when they are putting their lives \non the line and how quickly we forget them during peacetime or after \nthey leave the military. This highway bill is important. I believe \nthat, too, that our Nation's highways are in disrepair. But we have \nhuman beings that are also in disrepair in our veterans' ranks. We put \n$217 billion into the highway fund this year, which is almost $40 \nbillion more than anybody expected. We have done a good job on funding \nour highways. I hope that we do an equally good job on funding the \nbenefits for our sick veterans.\n  As my colleague from West Virginia mentioned, the administration--I \ndon't, frankly, think they understand the ramifications of this because \nwhen I was in the service, I can remember, as Senator Rockefeller \nalluded to, that there was no counseling not to smoke. In fact, as he \nsaid, it was ``smoke 'em if you got 'em.'' That was the common thing to \ndo at virtually every break. We were told, ``If you want to smoke, go \nahead, do it.'' There weren't any labels on the packs, and the \ncigarettes were free. You were actively encouraged to smoke. To say \nthat it is somehow the veterans' fault and to say that they voluntarily \nsmoked is a stretch of the imagination. I know we have potholes in our \nhighways, but we ought to also be concerned with the bullet holes that \nwere put in some of the veterans. To raid the veterans' health care \nfunds to put it in the highways, I think, is absolutely outrageous.\n  I want to associate myself with the comments of my colleague from \nWest Virginia. I applaud him for his courageous stand on trying to \nprotect the veterans of our Nation.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is very difficult to listen to words \nlike, ``The President of the United States is looting a veterans' \nhealth care program,'' and ``the Senate Budget Committee continues to \nloot.'' Mr. President, almost everybody on that Budget Committee who \nvoted for this probably votes for everything the U.S. Congress proposes \nfor veterans. But what has happened here is very, very interesting. \nHere is the expansion of a program in a dramatic way. One would assume \nit is rather dramatic, since it is going to cost about $10 billion over \n5 years. Congress has never voted on the program, number one. It is so \ninconsistent, in terms of causal connection between something that \nhappened while you are in the military and your death, that the \nPresident of the United States, on two occasions --not one, but two \nsuccessive budgets--has not funded any money to administer this \nexpanded program.\n  As a matter of fact, this year the President refused to fund it and \nremoved the money needed from the veterans' overall available moneys, I \nassume because the President believed it probably was never going to \nhappen. That is two points. The third point: Not a single claim under \nthis proposed expansion has ever been granted to this day. I take that \nback. The staff says 200 claims have been granted.\n\n  What we are saying is the President is right on this one. Before the \nafternoon is finished, we hope we can talk about another way to see who \nis right without having to do what the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, Mr. Rockefeller, asks for. We are working on that, because, \nif anything, Mr. President, and fellow Senators, we ourselves need some \nclarification about what this program is all about. I want to give two \nexamples. I am not an expert like my friend Senator Rockefeller, who is \non the Veterans' Committee, apparently is, or Senator Specter, who \nworks hard in that area and is chairman.\n  Here is one example. If a young man started to smoke when he was 16 \nyears old and he smoked for 4 years, and he joined the Army when he was \n20 and he smoked for 4 more years, and he only served 4 years and he \ngot out, and then he continued to smoke for 40 years, and he got \ncancer, this expansion of the program never before considered says that \nthe Federal Government, the military, is responsible for his cancer. Do \nyou have that? He started smoking before he went in. He smoked for only \n4 years while he was there. Now he gets a benefit for cancer. If he \ndies, his widow gets a widow's allowance because something happened to \nhim in the military and we should pay for the death and a widow's \nallowance. Frankly, I do not believe anybody who has\n\n[[Page S3069]]\n\nbeen talking about this veteran's benefit understood that.\n  I will give you the more typical one. You join the military. Most of \nthese are going to be people who were not in for a long time because \nthey are the veterans who were coming in while we had the draft. So you \nhave a 20-year-old joining and he smokes. Here is one. He smokes for \nthe 2 years that he is in. Then he continues thereafter to smoke for 40 \nmore years. He dies of cancer. His widow gets a benefit allowance \nbecause he smoked for 2 years in the military, and continued thereafter \non the premise that he became addicted to nicotine in the military and, \ntherefore, we should pay for it.\n  There are all kinds of examples like that. I don't know all of the \nexamples. Of the three that I stated, one of them may not be exactly \nright. But I am in the ballpark about what is happening.\n  I believe we ought to follow the lead of the President and not permit \nthis program to go into effect now. I did not say that we should kill \nthe program. I said I believe we should come up with a way so that we \ndon't implement the program now so that we don't create any false hope \nimmediately, but that we find a way to get this program appropriately \nevaluated and that we find out here in the Congress what it is all \nabout. I am hopeful before too long that we will have an approach to \ntry to do that. I know frequently in these kinds of situations it \ndoesn't do a lot of good to talk and to explain because maybe people \nhave already made up their minds. I hope not on this.\n  Let me tell you, there is no question that we are not denying \nveterans any health benefits they are getting today. If 200 people have \ngotten the claims, it certainly is just the beginning. There will be \nmany more. We ought to take a good look at it before we decide that it \nis right. Frankly, I look forward to taking another look at this in \nsome appropriate way for a reasonable period of time. I hope the \nveterans' groups in this country will say, well, the Senate quite \nappropriately wanted to take a look. They did not say we weren't \nentitled to this. But it is very, very different than anything we have \ndone before. In a sense, it is sort of saying if you smoked at any time \nin the military and smoked thereafter, that the military is responsible \nfor everything that happens to you if you smoke for 25 more years \nbecause somehow or another you became nicotine addicted in those years \nwhile you were in the military.\n\n  I repeat: This does not change all of the veterans' benefits with \nreference to existing programs that are being carried out. I understand \nwith reference to hospital treatment that Senator Rockefeller is \nalluding to the fact that if this isn't continued on and if it doesn't \ncontinue starting right now that some veterans will not be as high up \nin the rank of using the veterans' facilities as they would be if this \nprogram were in effect. But I suggest even there that we ought to take \na look for a reasonable period of time and get this analyzed thoroughly \nbefore we proceed.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from New Mexico yield time to \nthe Senator from Idaho?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Idaho on my time \nin opposition to the distinguished Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I reluctantly stand in opposition to the \namendment by my colleague from West Virginia. I say that because I \nappreciate and share with him membership on the Veterans' Committee. So \nI don't take this opposition lightly. But I recognize its importance \nbecause of the broad sense of obligation we have to our veterans \ncommunity. We in this Nation have elevated veterans and veterans' care \nto a high standard. That is why it is a Cabinet agency. It didn't just \nhappen by accident.\n  We want to care for our veterans. Those men and women who have stood \nin harm's way for the defense of our freedoms deserve that care, and \nall of us appreciate the fact that is a great deal. That is why this \nbudget spends $3 billion more over the next 5 years than was assumed in \nlast year's bipartisan budget agreement. That is a true statement of \ncommitment and obligation to our veterans. But this administration and \nI, and the chairman of the Budget Committee, have very real doubts \nwhether allowing a post-service, smoking-related illness as a part of \ncash compensation to dependents is the right way to go--at a time \ncertainly when our Veterans' Administration is strapped for cash to \nmeet its current obligations to generate and create a new obligation \nthat is estimated will cost $45 billion over the next 10 years and \ncould reach as high as $10 billion a year by the year 2009.\n  That is the reality of what we are talking about. How did we get \nthere? There was a question asked inside the Veterans' Administration \nwhether it was reasonable and right. Could they compensate if this were \ntrue? The answer was yes. But the chairman of the Budget Committee is \nright. Did this Congress authorize it? No; we did not. Can we literally \nstart a new extension of entitlement that could cost $10 billion a year \nwithout Congress speaking to it? I hope not. But that is the character \nof the amendment offered by my colleague from West Virginia.\n  I oftentimes do not like to use the argument that maybe we ought to \nstudy this. But maybe we ought to understand what we might be walking \ninto. Is it really going to be, by the year 2009, a $10 billion \nexpenditure at a time when our veterans' hospitals may be going \nunserved or unmodernized or unadministered, at a time when we are \ntrying to strive for outpatient care, at a time when we are trying to \nbuild obligations for State-managed and shared veterans' nursing homes \nfor the population of World War II veterans as they grow older and \nolder? If this is the kind of expansion of entitlement we are talking \nabout, how much of the other programs of the Veterans' Administration \nwill we be starving out?\n  That is why I have to say no and will oppose the amendment, and hope \nwe can look at the possibility of secondary amendments that would \nanalyze and study to see what this obligation might be. We really do \nnot have the parameters of it.\n  In the Veterans' Committee the other day, chaired by my chairman, \nSenator Specter, there was a general analysis of how they would \ninterpret how they would judge. But, as we know, once you lay down a \nset of regulations and make arbitrary decisions about who is and who \nisn't eligible, all it takes is a court test to say, ``Wait a moment. \nYou have judged me, my husband's, or my wife's illness improperly \nalthough they are deceased and I am entitled.'' And the judge says, \n``Why not? It is the largess of the Treasury. And, by the way, the \nVeterans' Administration is being arbitrary anyway.'' Boom. We have a \nnew expansion of an entitlement because this Congress didn't speak to \nit and this Congress didn't set the tight parameters necessary when we \ncreated new entitlement programs. We allowed an agency and their \nadministrators to interpret and, therefore, to judge and, therefore, to \ndefine. I believe that is arbitrary. I think all of us do.\n\n  Let me remind you: $10 billion a year by the year 2009 is potentially \n$45 billion over the next 10 years. That is a big chunk of money.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If neither side yields time, \ntime is charged equally to both sides.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from \nPennsylvania?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I want to clarify the situation in my \nmind. Senator Craig has not yet offered his amendment. Therefore, 5 \nminutes for responding to that amendment is not at this point available \nto me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Therefore, the Senator from West Virginia has 1 \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 14 seconds.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I will close on this portion.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me ask the Senator if he would like a couple of \nminutes so he can give Senator Specter a couple minutes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I want very much to give the chairman time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from West Virginia.\n\n[[Page S3070]]\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I yield 2 minutes to Senator Specter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized \nfor 2 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I believe that veterans are entitled to \nbe compensated for illnesses related to smoking because that has been \nthe determination of the General Counsel of the Veterans Administration \nand the doctors who have analyzed this program. The Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee had an extensive hearing on this matter a few days ago. The \nreallocation of $10.5 billion to another expenditure line, I believe, \nis unfair to the veterans of America. Young people are taken away from \nhomes. They are put in situations of stress. Cigarettes are provided \neither free or at a low cost. The determination has been made by the \nGeneral Counsel that nicotine dependence is a disease and it is \ncompensable. If the money is not to go for tobacco-related illnesses, \nit ought to remain in the VA funds generally, because the VA funds are \nvery, very limited for the tremendous obligation owed to the veterans \nof America.\n  I believe another source of funding might be available from the \ntobacco funding. And as much as I want to see the highway program \nproceed, and highways are very necessary as a matter of infrastructure \nfor America, I believe the veterans' benefits come first. I do not \nbelieve we need any additional studies on this matter. The analysis has \nbeen made extensively by the general counsel that it is a disease, that \nnicotine addiction is a disease, and the veterans are entitled to be \ncompensated. These funds ought to be made available to the veterans, as \nSenator Rockefeller has proposed.\n  How much time do I have, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 23 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If no one seeks recognition, time will run \nequally on both sides.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I ask the distinguished Senator from New Mexico if \nhe wishes to speak. I would like to maintain my right to close the \ndebate on my amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have never been so certain that my \neloquence had that much to do with matters, as to whether I spoke first \nor last, but normally I have been speaking last here as the floor \nmanager when we are opposing an amendment. But I will not follow that \nnow. I will speak now and let the Senator close.\n  I don't have much additional to say. Frankly, I think it is a \nmistake, however, to categorize the money that the President saved in \nthe budget by saying he was putting this program off. I think it is a \nmistake to categorize it that it all went for highways. The truth of \nthe matter is, it goes to discretionary spending for programs across \nthe board, which include highways. Frankly, what is going to happen is, \nthe programs of this country all go to the Appropriations Committee; if \nthere is not enough money for highways, then they are apt to fund \nhighways and cut NIH, or anything else, if they would like. It is going \nto be a matter of what is the highest priority.\n  So it seems to me we are talking about a program that the President \nof the United States for 2 consecutive years has said should not take \neffect, has provided no money to let it take effect. That, at least, is \nvery questionable, whether the general counsel ruled or not. Congress \nnever voted. And we believe some additional time ought to be taken on \nthis matter.\n  Whatever time I have I yield back at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the distinguished floor manager \nindicates that the President of the United States has done this. I am \nnot trying to protect the President of the United States. I think he is \nwrong on this also. I am trying to protect disabled American veterans \nwho have been addicted to nicotine and who will be barred from getting \ncompensation as a result of this. All I can say is that my amendment \nseeks to strike $10.5 billion that was put artificially, by trumped-up \nmeans, into the veterans' baseline. If there is a study or something to \nlook at it in the future, it will then be too late--my purpose will be \ndead. I want to return to veterans that $10.5 billion which is ascribed \nto roads--which we treasure in West Virginia, but which, because of the \ngood work of my senior colleague, we are doing very well with. And that \nis a common joke around here, and one which I enjoy and respect.\n  But I care about veterans. We have approximately 200,000 of them in \nWest Virginia. We have 26 million of them in this country. This is a \nblatant attempt, under a whole new concept--despite our new \nunderstanding of addiction to tobacco in general, and our new \nunderstanding of addiction to tobacco by veterans in the service--which \nDOD now admits for the first time--to take money away from helping \nveterans and give it to highways.\n  Concrete and rebars and all of those things are important. But so are \nhuman beings who have served in this country's military service and who \nare addicted and have to go through an incredibly hard process to \nbecome classified as disabled to get this kind of help from VA.\n  Yes, as the manager has indicated, some will get their health care \nbenefits. But that is not what we are talking about. We are talking \nabout a process which, because of the addiction, they have to go \nthrough a very difficult process to achieve a status where they can get \ncompensation for their disability due to addiction. It is a fundamental \nAmerican matter, and it is also the law of the land at the current \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I yield back the remainder of my time and send an \namendment to the desk.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2283 to Amendment No. 2226\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk and ask it be reported.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Regular order, Mr. President. Mr. President, I \nbelieve I had----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No; the time of the Senator had expired, and \nthe manager was recognized.\n  The clerk will report the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for himself, \n     Mr. Craig and Mr. Lott, proposes an amendment numbered 2283 \n     to amendment No. 2226.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 14, line 7, strike ``$51,500,000,000.'' and all \n     that follows through line 24, and substitute in lieu thereof \n     the following:\n     $51,500,000,000.\n       (B) Outlays, $42,800,000,000.\n     Fiscal year 2000:\n       (A) New budget authority, $51,800,000,000.\n       (B) Outlays, $44,700,000,000.\n     Fiscal year 2001:\n       (A) New budget authority, $52,100,000,000.\n       (B) Outlays, $45,700,000,000.\n     Fiscal year 2002:\n       (A) New budget authority, $51,400,000,000.\n       (B) Outlays, $45,800,000,000.\n     Fiscal year 2003:\n       (A) New budget authority, $52,000,000,000.\n       (B) Outlays, $46,900,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 8, strike ``-$300,000,000.'' and all that \n     follows through line 25, and substitute in lieu thereof the \n     following:\n     -$300,000,000,\n       (B) Outlays, -$1,900,000,000.\n     Fiscal year 2000:\n       (A) New budget authority, -$1,200,000,000.\n       (B) Outlays, -$4,600,000,000.\n     Fiscal year 2001:\n       (A) New budget authority, -$2,700,000,000.\n       (B) Outlays, -$3,000,000,000.\n     Fiscal year 2002:\n       (A) New budget authority, -$3,800,000,000.\n       (B) Outlays, -$7,000,000,000.\n     Fiscal year 2003:\n       (A) New budget authority, -$5,400,000,000.\n       (B) Outlays, -$5,000,000,000.\n       In lieu of the language proposed to be stricken, insert:\n       (6) For reductions in programs in function 700, Veterans \n     Benefits and Services: For fiscal year 1999, $500,000,000 in \n     budget authority and $500,000,000 in outlays; for fiscal \n     years 1999-2003, $10,500,000,000 in budget authority and \n     $10,500,000,000 in outlays.\n       (7) Sense of the Senate on VA compensation and post-service \n     smoking-related illnesses.\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (i) the President has twice included in his budgets a \n     prohibition on the entitlement expansion that the Department \n     of Veterans Affairs (referred to as the ``VA'') is proposing \n     to allow post-service smoking-related illness to be eligible \n     for VA compensation;\n\n[[Page S3071]]\n\n       (ii) Congress has never acted on this entitlement \n     expansion;\n       (iii) the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of \n     Management and Budget have concluded that this change in VA \n     policy would result in at least $10,000,000,000 over 5 years \n     and $45,000,000,000 over 10 years in additional mandatory \n     costs to the VA;\n       (iv) these increased number of claims and the resulting \n     costs may present undue delay and hardship on veterans \n     seeking claim review;\n       (v) the entitlement expansion apparently runs counter to \n     all existing VA policy, including a statement by former \n     Secretary Brown that ``It is inappropriate to compensate for \n     death or disability resulting from veterans' personal choice \n     to engage in conduct damaging to their health.''; and\n       (vi) Secretary Brown's comment was recently reaffirmed by \n     Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs Togo West, who stated \n     ``It has been the position of the Department and of my \n     predecessor that the decision to use tobacco by service \n     members is a personal decision and is not a requirement for \n     military service. And that therefore to compensate veterans \n     for diseases whose sole connection to service is a veteran's \n     own tobacco use should not rest with the Government.''.\n       (B) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the function totals and assumptions underlying this \n     resolution assume the following:\n       (i) The support of the President's proposal to not allow \n     post-service smoking related illnesses to be eligible for VA.\n       (ii) The study and report required by paragraph (3) will be \n     completed.\n       (iii) The Secretary of the Department of Veteran Affairs, \n     the Office of Management and Budget, and the General \n     Accounting Office are jointly required to--\n       (aa) jointly study (referred to in this section as the \n     ``study'') the VA General Counsel's determination and the \n     resulting actions to change the compensation rules to include \n     disability and death benefits for conditions related to the \n     use of tobacco products during service; and\n       (bb) deliver an opinion as to whether illnesses resulting \n     from post-service smoking should be considered as a \n     compensable disability.\n       (iv) The study should include--\n       (aa) the estimated numbers of those filing such claims, the \n     cost resulting from such benefits, the time necessary to \n     review such claims, and how such a number of claims will \n     affect the VA's ability to review its current claim load;\n       (bb) an examination of how the proposed change corresponds \n     to prior VA policy relating to post-service actions taken by \n     an individual; and\n       (cc) what Federal benefits, both VA and non-VA, former \n     service members having smoking-related illnesses are eligible \n     to receive.\n       (v) The study shall be completed no later than July 1, \n     1999.\n       (vi) The Department of Veterans Affairs and the Office of \n     Management and Budget shall report their finding to the \n     Majority and Minority Leaders of the Senate and the chairmen \n     and ranking minority members of the Senate Budget and \n     Veterans' Affairs Committees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 10 minutes equally divided on each \nside on this second-degree amendment.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes, and then I \nyield 3 minutes to Senator Craig.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator only has 5 total.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield myself 2.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is very simple, and I think it is a \nfair amendment. This amendment says that for the next year this program \nwill be held in abeyance. And during that year, the Veterans' \nAdministration, the General Accounting Office, and the Office of \nManagement and Budget will meet, analyze, and make recommendations to \nthe President of the United States and to the Congress of the United \nStates.\n  I believe that enough has been said here on the floor, enough is \nthere by virtue of the President of the United States deciding what he \nhas decided for 2 consecutive years, that we really ought to make sure \nwe receive the best information about what is the right and fair and \nhonorable thing to do.\n  I do not believe that anybody expects we should pay a widow's \nallowance, and for cancer, for a veteran who spent 2 years in the \nmilitary and smoked, or for a veteran who spent 4 years in the military \nand smoked, and then smoked for 40 years thereafter. I believe we need \nsome clarification and some real details on this, because this is a \nvery large expenditure of money and it should not be denied to veterans \nif, in fact, there is a reasonably causal relationship between a \nveteran's service and the illness from which a veteran died. If there \nis a reasonable causal relationship and it does encompass as many as \nmight claim under this, then we ought to have this group of people \nspend at least a year, or whatever time it takes, and report to us on \nthe effects of the General Counsel's interpretation of a general \nstatute with relationship to nicotine.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished Senator from \nIdaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the chairman of the Budget Committee has \nexplained our intent with this amendment. Let me read it:\n\n       The Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the \n     Office of Management and Budget and the GAO are jointly \n     required to--\n       jointly study (referred to in this section as the \n     ``study'') the VA General Counsel's determination and the \n     resulting actions to change the compensation rules. . .\n       [and] deliver an opinion as to whether illnesses resulting \n     from post-service smoking should be considered as a \n     compensable disability.\n\n  That is one point. The other point, and I think the most important \none that drives this process, that alludes to the potential $10 billion \na year, or $45 billion over the next few years, is:\n\n       . . . estimate the numbers of those filing such claims, the \n     cost resulting from such benefits, the time necessary to \n     receive such claims, and how such a number of claims will \n     affect the VA's ability to review its current claim load.\n\n  In other words, this is not a dodge, this is a sincere effort to \ndetermine the impact of this potential program, that not one dime has \nbeen spent on yet. Are we truly going to damage other veterans' \nprograms that are ongoing, that current veterans believe they are owed \nand, in all right, they are owed? I think we ought to have that \ninformation. That is exactly what this study does.\n\n  Does it shove it off for years and years? Not at all. The study \nconcludes that this has to be completed no later than July 1, 1999. And \nthe Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Office of Management and \nBudget and GAO shall report their findings to the majority and the \nminority leaders of the Senate and the ranking member and the chairman \nof the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee.\n  This is an honest and sincere attempt not to legislate into the dark \nand to risk $10 billion or $45 billion, and to put in jeopardy current \nand future ongoing programs of the Veterans Administration, but to have \na real understanding of where we might be treading.\n  I believe it is responsible, I believe it is right, and I hope my \ncolleagues will join with the chairman of the Budget Committee in \nsupport of this second-degree. Let's find out where we are going before \nwe launch on a commitment that we would never be able to walk away from \nonce we created that obligation to veterans. If we truly have \ndependents out there who start receiving the money, we will never cut \nit off.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the proponent of the amendment has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from West Virginia has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator \nfrom Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I don't know how to say much in a minute and a half. \nLet me just say to my good friend from Idaho that I believe the second-\ndegree amendment is not a step forward. I think it is a great leap \nsideways. A study is not what we are talking about. You don't have to \nbe a rocket scientist to know what is at issue here. This is money that \nwe believe should have gone to veterans for compensation. If it doesn't \ngo directly for compensation, this $10 billion-plus ought to go into \nthe VA budget. It ought to be there for disabled veterans. It ought to \nbe there for health care for veterans.\n  There are a lot of gaps. There are a lot of holes in this VA budget. \nAs is, we are not living up to a contract for veterans. My colleagues \nare absolutely right in what they are doing, and I rise to speak on the \nfloor of the Senate to support the Rockefeller-Specter amendment. I \nhope we will defeat the second-degree amendment and pass this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n\n[[Page S3072]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment in the second \ndegree because an additional study is not necessary. The matter has \nalready been studied extensively by the Veterans Administration. There \nhas been an opinion of the General Counsel that nicotine is a disease \nand that it is compensable. A study might be all right if we did not \ntake $10.5 billion off what ought to be in the Veterans' Affairs \naccount--the Department of Veterans' Affairs account--and put it \nsomewhere else.\n  I believe the underlying amendment by the Senator from West Virginia \nis accurate. The second-degree amendment ought to be defeated.\n\n  I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask the Presiding Officer to tell \nthe Senator from West Virginia when he has only 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. President, the Craig amendment would cut $10.5 billion in \nveterans' funds in the budget resolution.\n  No. 2, the Craig amendment still allows the money to be cut and then \nto reauthorize--as he says, we will do a study for a year--\nincidentally, by the same people, a study by exactly the same people \nwho came up with this solution, to cut the money.\n  But in order to reauthorize the veterans' disability benefit, the \nCongress--everything would then be subject to PAYGO, and my colleagues \nhad better understand that Congress would then have to cut off another \nveterans' benefit. So this is a blind path that we are going down. A \nvote in favor of the Craig amendment is a vote to shift $10.5 billion \naway from disabled veterans.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2284 to Amendment No. 2226\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I send a perfecting amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Rockefeller] proposes \n     an amendment numbered 2284 to amendment No. 2226.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 14, line 7, strike ``$51,500,000,000.'' and all \n     that follows through line 24, and substitute in lieu thereof \n     the following:\n     $51,000,000,000.\n       (B) Outlays, $42,300,000,000.\n     Fiscal year 2000:\n       (A) New budget authority, $50,800,000,000.\n       (B) Outlays, $43,700,000,000.\n     Fiscal year 2001:\n       (A) New budget authority, $50,100,000,000.\n       (B) Outlays, $43,700,000,000.\n     Fiscal year 2002:\n       (A) New budget authority, $48,400,000,000.\n       (B) Outlays, $42,800,000,000.\n     Fiscal year 2003:\n       (A) New budget authority, $48,000,000,000.\n       (B) Outlays, $42,900,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 8, strike ``-$300,000,000.'' and all that \n     follows through line 25, and substitute in lieu thereof the \n     following:\n     $200,000,000.\n       (B) Outlays, -$1,400,000,000.\n     Fiscal year 2000:\n       (A) New budget authority, -$200,000,000.\n       (B) Outlays, -$3,600,000,000.\n     Fiscal year 2001:\n       (A) New budget authority, -$700,000,000.\n       (B) Outlays, -$1,000,000,000.\n     Fiscal year 2002:\n       (A) New budget authority, -$800,000,000.\n       (B) Outlays, -$4,000,000,000.\n     Fiscal year 2003:\n       (A) New budget authority, -$1,400,000,000.\n       (B) Outlays, -$1,000,000,000.\n       On page 31, line 24, strike subsection (6) in its entirety.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 5 minutes on a side on this \namendment.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I yield back the remainder of my time and ask for \nthe yeas and nays on the perfecting amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has yielded \nback all his time.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this puts us right back where we were at \nthe beginning. What I would like to do is remind the Senate that we \nwill have an opportunity to vote on the Domenici substitute which calls \nfor the 1-year study, and that does have the General Accounting Office \nin it also, for those who are wondering whether it is just the \nVeterans' Administration and the OMB.\n  In addition, if we table this Rockefeller amendment, we will vote \nnext on the Domenici amendment which will give us this 1-year study to \nmake sure that we are doing the right thing.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time, and I move, at the appropriate \ntime, to table the amendment. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to the Brownback amendment No. 2177. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I don't know why we proceeded to the \nvote. We did not intend to go to a vote. We are going to stack the \nvotes and have a series of votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The rollcall was on the first series of votes. \nThe Brownback amendment----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are not finished with our pool of amendments. We \nstill have Senator Kyl to offer his, and then we will have the entire \npackage voted on one after the other.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from New Mexico want to ask \nunanimous consent----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is the consent. There is consent that these six \namendments be debated and that they then be voted on in order. Of that \ngroup, Senator Kyl's has not yet been debated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Arizona \nto call up an amendment.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2221\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2221.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is amendment No. 2221.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Santorum \nbe added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. I note, Mr. President, that this amendment was supposed to \nhave been discussed earlier. That undoubtedly accounts for the \nconfusion, because it should have occurred already. However, I was not \nhere at the time and, therefore, it will be the last amendment \ndiscussed prior to the time the votes start, for the benefit of my \ncolleagues.\n  This is a very straightforward amendment. It expresses the sense of \nthe Senate in favor of a supermajority vote for raising taxes.\n  Mr. President, the tax burden imposed on the American people has \ngrown so large that it is beginning to act as a drag on the Nation's \neconomy. As a share of the gross domestic product, revenues to the \nTreasury will rise from 19.9 percent this year to 20.1 percent next \nyear. That would be higher than any year since 1945, and it would be \nonly the third year in our entire history during which revenues have \nexceeded 20 percent of the national income. Notably, the first two \ntimes that revenues broke the 20 percent mark, the economy tipped into \nrecession.\n  Mr. President, we are talking about something very serious, and that \nis the possibility that this great economic engine that has been \ncreating budget surpluses for the Federal Government and a great \nstandard of living for the American people could come to a screeching \nhalt if we do not begin to do something about the tax burden imposed \nupon the American people.\n  Many of us believe it would have been prudent to consider more tax \nrelief in the budget this year. But it seems to me that if the Congress \nand the President cannot agree on more tax\n\n[[Page S3073]]\n\nrelief, we at least ought to be able to agree that taxes should go no \nhigher. The House of Representatives, I inform my colleagues, is \nscheduled to vote in April on an initiative to make it much harder for \nCongress to raise taxes. It would require a two-thirds majority vote in \neach House in order to add to the tax burden.\n  The sense-of-the-Senate amendment that I have offered now will begin \nthe debate in the Senate as well. I do not specify a particular \npercentage that would constitute a supermajority for purposes of \nraising taxes, but simply request that we go on record as expressing \nsupport for the principle that a supermajority should be required. I \nwill briefly explain why.\n  A third of the Nation's population imposes tax limitations on their \nState governments. Voters have approved tax limits by wide margins, so \nthis is not something new or risky. In my home state of Arizona, for \nexample, a tax limitation passed with 72 percent of the vote, and we \nare one of the fastest growing States in the Nation. We have one of the \nlowest tax burdens, one of the highest rates of growth. In Florida, \nanother high-growth State, a tax limitation amendment was adopted with \n69.2 percent of the vote; in Nevada, with 70 percent. I daresay, Mr. \nPresident, these are probably three of the fastest growing States in \nthe country.\n\n  A tax limitation ensures growth, reduces taxes, provides more jobs \nand, I believe, would be a good thing for the Federal Government to \nadopt for the entire country with respect to Federal taxes.\n  The proposed Constitutional amendment, which is referred to in the \npending sense of the Senate amendment, now has 23 cosponsors in the \nSenate. It is something that was recommended by the National Commission \non Economic Growth and Tax Reform. In fact, that commission, which you \nwill recall was chaired by former HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, advocated \nthe supermajority requirement in its report on how to achieve a simpler \nsingle-rate tax to replace the existing maze of tax rates, deductions, \nexemptions and credits that makes the Federal Tax Code so complicated \nas we know it today.\n  Here are the words of the commission:\n\n       The roller-coaster ride of tax policy in the past few \n     decades has fed citizens' cynicism about the possibility of \n     real, long-term reform, while fueling frustration with \n     Washington. The initial optimism inspired by the low rates of \n     the 1986 Tax Reform Act soured into disillusionment and anger \n     when taxes subsequently were hiked two times in less than \n     seven years. The commission believes that a two-thirds \n     supermajority vote of Congress will earn American's \n     confidence in the longevity, predictability, and stability of \n     the new tax system.\n\n  Mr. President, there is no small irony in the fact that it would have \ntaken a two-thirds majority vote of the House and Senate to overcome \nPresident Clinton's veto and enact the 1995 Balanced Budget Act with \nits tax relief provisions. Yet, by contrast, the President's record-\nsetting tax increase in 1993 was enacted with only a simple majority \nand, in fact, not even a majority of elected Senators at that. Vice \nPresident Gore broke a tie vote of 50-50 to secure passage of the tax \nincrease in the Senate.\n  A tax limitation is based on a simple premise: that it ought to be at \nleast as hard to raise people's taxes as it is to cut them.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nseveral documents.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      [From Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation, Apr. 8, 1997]\n\n Making a Taxing Decision: Why Congress Should Pass The Tax Limitation \n                               Amendment\n\n                            (By Scott Moody)\n\n       On April 15, Congress will have an historic opportunity to \n     make a sincere commitment to the principles of a balanced \n     budget and a smaller government by voting for the Tax \n     Limitation Amendment (TLA) to the Constitution. If the \n     Congress and the president mean it when they say the era of \n     big government is over, then the deficit must be eliminated \n     by reigning in government spending, reforming entitlements, \n     and cutting wasteful and unnecessary programs. Passage of the \n     TLA--which would require a two-thirds vote of Congress to \n     raise taxes--will help take tax increases off the table. The \n     message from taxpayers to members on both sides of the aisle \n     is clear--pass the Tax Limitation Amendment.\n       A bipartisan message. According to voters all across \n     America, creating a more accountable tax policy is a \n     bipartisan responsibility. In fact, the congressional \n     delegations from the twelve states that have adopted a \n     supermajority tax provision are almost evenly split between \n     Republicans and Democrats.\\1\\ In the House of Representatives \n     there are 68 Republicans and 50 Democrats who represent these \n     states with a supermajority provision. In the Senate, \n     representation is evenly split with 12 Republicans and 12 \n     Democrats. This even split reveals that states with \n     supermajority provisions do not strictly lean toward one \n     political party or another. It also shows, and politicians on \n     both sides of the aisle should take notice, that there is \n     growing consensus among all taxpayers for tax limitation.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       A two-thirds majority provision is gaining in popularity. \n     Within the last five years, the trend toward tax limitation \n     has accelerated. Of the twelve states with supermajority \n     requirements, seven of them have been enacted or expanded \n     since 1992. Although the requirement varies from state to \n     state, the most popular provision requires a two-thirds (66 \n     percent) majority vote to raise taxes. As shown below, voters \n     are strongly supportive of tax limitation. Politicians can \n     only ignore this tidal wave of support at their own peril.\n     1992\n       1. Arizona--Requires \\2/3\\ elected majority, passed by 72 \n     percent of voters.\n       2. Colorado--Requires \\3/4\\ elected majority, passed by 54 \n     percent of voters.\n       3. Oklahoma--Requires \\3/4\\ elected majority, passed by 56 \n     percent of voters.\n     1996\n       4. Florida--Requires \\2/3\\ voter majority, passed by 70 \n     percent of voters.\n       5. Nevada--Requires \\2/3\\ elected majority, passed by 70 \n     percent of voters.\n       6. Oregon--Requires \\3/5\\ elected majority, passed by 52 \n     percent of voters.\n       7. South Dakota--Requires \\2/3\\ elected majority, passed by \n     74 percent of voters.\n       A TLA would boost economic growth and created new jobs. \n     States that have adopted a tax supermajority provision have \n     grown faster and created more jobs than states that do not \n     have any tax limitation. A look at these states reveals that \n     the existence of supermajority provisions help to limit tax \n     and spending increases by state governments. As a result, \n     more money is available for productive investment by \n     businesses and individuals which boosts economic growth and \n     creates new jobs. Other studies have found the same results:\n       A study by Jim Miller, former budget director under \n     President Reagan, and Mark Crain, an economist at George \n     Mason University, which is based on data from all 50 states \n     found that a supermajority provision for raising results in a \n     lower per-capita growth in state spending.\\2\\\n       Economist Dan Mitchell has also made a number of important \n     discoveries on economic growth in his study of ten states \n     that require a supermajority to raise taxes. He found that \n     between 1980 and 1992, states with supermajority grew by 43 \n     percent (35 percent without) and employment increased by 26 \n     percent (21 percent without).\\3\\\n       Increased accountability. Passed by simple majorities, four \n     of the last five major tax bills would not have met a two-\n     thirds approval requirement. In fact, the last tax bill \n     passed by one vote in the House of Representatives and the \n     Vice-President broke a tied vote in the Senate. As a \n     consequence, American taxpayers are not fully convinced that \n     Congress has carefully weighed the pros and cons of \n     increasing taxes that have since raised a staggering total of \n     $666 billion.\\4\\\n       Judging by the large support of a two-thirds majority \n     requirement by voters, most Americans realize the economic \n     benefits of creating a more accountable tax policy in \n     addition to a smaller tax burden. Many taxpayer from both \n     sides of the political spectrum have, in most cases, \n     overwhelmingly approved supermajority provisions for their \n     own state. Now they expect Congress to do the same and pass \n     the Tax Limitation Amendment.\n\n\n                               FOOTNOTES\n\n     \\1\\These states are: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, \n     Delaware, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, Oklahoma, \n     Oregon and South Dakota.\n     \\2\\Mark Crain and James Miller, ``Budget Process and Spending \n     Growth,'' William and Mary Law Review, Spring 1990.\n     \\3\\Dan Mitchell, ``The Case for a Tax Supermajority \n     Requirement: A Look at the States,'' Citizens for a Sound \n     Economy Foundation, Issue Analysis, No. 25, April 12, 1996.\n     \\4\\James Perry, ``Growth, Prosperity, and Honest Government. \n     The Case for Constitutional Tax Limitation,'' Americans for \n     Tax Reform, Policy Brief, 1997.\n\n\n          OFFICIAL SUPPORTERS OF THE TAX LIMITATION AMENDMENT\n\n     American Conservative Union\n     Americans for Tax Reform\n     Associated Builders and Contractors\n     Association of Concerned Taxpayers\n     Chamber of Commerce of the United States\n     Christian Coalition\n     Citizens for a Sound Economy\n     Coalition for America\n     Competitive Enterprise Institute\n     Council for Citizens Against Government Waste\n     Family Research Council\n     National-American Wholesale Grocers Association/International \n         Foodservice Distributors Association\n\n[[Page S3074]]\n\n     National Association of Manufacturers\n     National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors\n     National Federation of Independent Businesses\n     National Tax Limitation Committee\n     National Taxpayers Union\n     National Taxpayers United of Illinois\n     Seniors Coalition\n     Small Business Survival Committee\n     60 Plus Association\n     United Seniors Association\n\n\n                                     National Taxpayers Union,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, March 31, 1998.\n     Hon. Jon Kyl,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kyl: National Taxpayers Union, America's \n     largest grassroots taxpayer organization, strongly supports \n     your ``Sense of the Senate'' Tax Limitation Amendment to S. \n     Con. Res. 86, the FY '99 Budget Resolution.\n       Your amendment would put the Senate on record as favoring a \n     super majority vote for the enactment of legislation that \n     would raise tax rates, impose new taxes, or otherwise \n     increase the amount of taxpayers' income that is subject to \n     tax. As perhaps the most important tax limitation vote of \n     this Session of Congress, National Taxpayers Union will \n     likely score a ``YES'' vote on your amendment as one of the \n     heaviest-weighted pro-taxpayer votes in our annual Rating of \n     Congress.\n       In addition to supporting tax limitation, your amendment \n     establishes the basic premise of any genuine tax reform. We \n     urge your colleagues to join you in voting for the Kyl \n     amendment on the floor of the Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 John E. Berthoud,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n     [From Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation, Apr. 12, 1996]\n\n   The Case for a Tax Supermajority Requirement: A Look at the States\n\n                        (By Daniel J. Mitchell)\n\n       A number of states require at least a three-fifths majority \n     vote to raise taxes. These states have seen lower tax and \n     spending increases, faster economic and job growth, and an \n     accumulation of less debt. This evidence supports the case \n     for a supermajority requirement to raise taxes at the federal \n     level, which the House of Representatives is scheduled to \n     vote on this Monday.\n       On April 15th, the House of Representatives will vote on \n     whether the Constitution should be amended to require a two-\n     thirds vote to raise taxes. A supermajority requirement \n     eliminates the existing bias in favor of enacting higher \n     taxes. Such a provision is particularly important during \n     times when lawmakers are under pressure to control deficits \n     and balance the budget. Simply stated, if higher spending \n     cannot be achieved by increasing borrowing, the only other \n     way of financing new spending is by raising taxes. Requiring \n     a supermajority to raise taxes ensures that a simple majority \n     of politicians cannot continue to spend other people's money \n     and evade fiscal responsibility.\n       Critics charge that the supermajority requirement would be \n     a risky, untested idea. This accusation is false. Ten states \n     require at least a three-fifths vote of lawmakers to raise \n     some or all taxes. Supermajorities, needless to say, are just \n     one of many factors that influence these states' performance. \n     It stands to reason, however, that making it harder to raise \n     taxes would be at least partially responsible for these good \n     numbers. Three of the states instituted the tax limit in \n     1992, but seven states have lived under this requirement for \n     some time. In these states--Arkansas, California, Delaware, \n     Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Dakota--the \n     evidence shows that, on average, supermajority states have \n     smaller tax and spending increases, grow faster, create more \n     jobs, and accumulate less debt.\n\n\n                supermajority states control tax burden\n\n       On average, states with supermajorities saw their per \n     capita tax collections jump by 102 percent between 1980 and \n     1992. This is too high, but it is much better than the \n     average 121 percent increase in per capita tax collections \n     that occurred in states without these supermajority \n     protections. In other words, the tax burden rose nearly 20 \n     percent faster in states that did not limit the ability of \n     politicians to raise taxes.\n\n\n            lower spending increases in supermajority states\n\n       In the supermajority states, per capita state spending on \n     average increased by 132 percent between 1980 and 1992. While \n     this is hardly a record to be proud of, states without \n     supermajority tax requirements experienced average total per \n     capita spending increases of 141 percent. This difference may \n     not be very large, but taxpayers are grateful for even modest \n     improvements in their state's fiscal performance.\n\n\n                    Supermajority States Grow Faster\n\n       Lower taxes and lower spending are desirable, but the real \n     reason for controlling the size of government is to promote \n     prosperity. Not surprisingly, a supermajority is associated \n     with faster economic growth. States with restrictions on the \n     ability to raise taxes grew by an average of 43 percent in \n     real terms from 1980 until 1992. States that made it easier \n     for politicians to raise taxes, by contrast, only grew on an \n     average of 35 percent during the same period.\n\n\n                 Supermajority States Create More Jobs\n\n       The combination of smaller government and faster growth in \n     supermajority states means that there is more money available \n     for the productive sector of the economy. This means more \n     jobs. In states with supermajorities, total employment \n     increased by an average of 26 percent between 1980 and 1992. \n     In states that allow taxes to be raised by a simple majority, \n     on the other hand, the number of jobs increased by an average \n     of only 21 percent.\n\n\n                  Supermajority States Incur Less Debt\n\n       One of the criticisms of supermajority requirements is that \n     politicians would not have the power to raise taxes in times \n     of fiscal crisis, thus subjecting state residents to higher \n     levels of debt. Evidence from the states, however, appears to \n     dispel this fear. In the seven states with supermajorities, \n     state debt increased by an average of 271 percent between \n     1980 and 1992. This is not a good track record, but states \n     without limits on higher taxes saw average debt increases of \n     312 percent in the same period.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       Empirical data from the states suggests that tax \n     supermajority requirements serve their intended purpose--\n     helping to limit the growth of government and enabling a more \n     rapid pace of economic growth and job creation. To be sure, a \n     supermajority requirement does not guarantee sound economic \n     policy. The record tax increase in California, for instance, \n     was enacted in spite of a two-thirds majority requirement. \n     And many states without supermajority requirements, such as \n     Tennessee and Nevada, scored well in most categories (not \n     surprisingly, the lack of a state income tax seems to be \n     associated with more growth and less government). \n     Nevertheless, examining the performances of states with and \n     without supermajorities seems to confirm the well established \n     relationships between sound fiscal policy and good economic \n     performance. If federal lawmakers approve similar legislation \n     on the federal level, there is every reason to expect \n     positive results.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time against the amendment?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Kyl \namendment. I assume we have 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I rise in opposition to an amendment presented by \nSenator Kyl that would call for a constitutional amendment and require \na supermajority to vote to increase Federal revenues. This amendment \neffectively would grant special protection for tax loopholes. In this \nbody, we only require a supermajority vote for things that deserve \nspecial protection--Social Security, for example. It would be wrong to \ngive breaks for corporations and the well-off and permit them to have \nthe same protection as the Social Security trust funds, and it would be \noutrageous to give those loopholes constitutional protection.\n  The Founding Fathers had it right the first time. A simple majority \nvote is all that should be required for this body to act. That is a \ndemocracy.\n  I oppose this amendment and urge my colleagues to vote against it. It \ncalls for a sense of the Senate looking for a constitutional amendment \nto be offered here.\n  I am not going to take any more time. I hope that the Members will \nsee that we are giving special protection to tax loopholes when \ncertainly the status doesn't warrant it, but worse than that, we are \ntalking about a constitutional amendment. Thank goodness it is a sense-\nof-the-Senate amendment. It has about as much force as so many of the \nother sense-of-the Senate amendments that we have already had here. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Has all time been yielded back?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from New Jersey yield back \nhis time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If the rest of the time has been yielded back, then I \nyield back the time I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 2177\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We now proceed under the previous order to \nBrownback amendment No. 2177.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and I \nmove to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay the amendment on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment before the Senate is Specter \namendment numbered 2254. Under the previous order, there is 1 minute \nper side to debate the amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that we temporarily lay aside \nthe Specter amendment and go to the amendment of Senator Lautenberg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2244\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this amendment represents a modified \nversion of the budget that President Clinton submitted to the Congress \nlast month. The amendment incorporates all of the important priorities \nin the President's budget, maintains strict fiscal discipline, and \nadopts the President's commitment to save Social Security first. The \namendment reserves all surpluses until we solve Social Security's long-\nterm problem. That will help ensure when the baby boomers retire, \nSocial Security will be there for them.\n  Secondly, like the President's budget, this makes education a top \nnational priority, calling for an initiative to reduce class sizes by \nhiring 1,000 new teachers, promotes higher standards and greater \naccountability, and provides more after-school opportunities for young \npeople.\n  In short, what this does is remind us all what the commitment is that \nthe President made and what we would like to see in place. I will just \nsay that this presents the President's budget in a modified form. I \nhope our colleagues will support it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, without this counting as part of my 1 \nminute, if I could remind the Senators of where we are now. We have \nseven amendments stacked with reference to the previous order. Then we \nwill start the 1-minute amendments, and on our side we have about 10. I \nam not sure how many are on the Democrat side, but we will work with \nthose 10 and see if we can put those down. They are mostly sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendments. For now, we are in a position to take up about \nsix more. The time is supposed to be 10 minutes on the votes. I know \nthat is difficult. For all additional time we take, we will be here \nlater and later tonight in order to get it finished. This is a 10-\nminute vote on the Lautenberg amendment.\n  Now, let me say this is the Democrat amendment offered in committee. \nIn the committee, it did not even receive all of the Democratic \nSenators' support. If you want to spend more money, like $88 billion \nmore, vote for this. If you want to vote to put the moneys that we get \nfrom the tobacco settlement on Medicare instead of six new programs, \nvote for theirs. If you want to spend new money on at least eight more \ndomestic programs, vote for theirs.\n  We have provided increases in NIH, education, the environment, and \nthe criminal justice. We think that is a good priority.\n  Have I raised a point of order on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I make the point of order it is not germane.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask to waive the point of order, and I request the \nyeas and nays on my motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We are still working to \ntry to get the list agreed on of what we are actually going to need to \nvote on. We still have probably 24 or 25 amendments that we still have \nto vote on--maybe more. But we are working to get that down. In order \nto get this completed, we need to really start to get rolling on these \nvotes. We have been having them every 10 minutes. The Senator from \nAlaska is in the Chair. He knows how to do it. I urge Members to stay \nin the Chamber. We can move these along a lot faster. From here on they \nwill be gaveled to a close after 10 minutes.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2254\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is on agreeing to the \nSpecter amendment No. 2254. There are 2 minutes equally divided.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment would provide for $2 \nbillion extra for NIH to offset by four-tenths\n\n[[Page S3076]]\n\nof 1 percent a cut in all programs. This body has expressed a sense of \nthe Senate that we should double NIH over 5 years, which will call for \n$2.5 billion a year. This is a lesser amount. We have expectations \nbuilt up by the sense-of-the-Senate expression of our druthers. Now is \nthe time to put our dollars behind it. Although there is paperwork to \nthe contrary, Mr. President, although the budget does not determine how \nit is going to go, which is through the appropriations process, we will \nhave only $350 million in additional outlays for an $80 billion budget \nby the subcommittee. We need this $2 billion if we are to move ahead on \nthe important NIH functions.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, fellow Senators, we have $1.5 billion \nnext year for NIH. We have added $1.5 billion to NIH in this budget; \n$15.5 billion over 5 years. The amendment would add another $2 billion. \nThat would cut defense $1.1 million, environment $88 million, \nagriculture $17 million, veterans $76 million, justice $86 million, and \nso on.\n  I believe we have done enough with the $1.5 billion increase and $15 \nbillion over five years. We should not now add $2 billion more and \npropose that we restrain every department of Government, including the \nDefense Department, for half the cuts.\n  I yield any time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The pending amendment is now the Kyl amendment \nNo. 2221. There are 2 minutes equally divided.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, colleagues, this is a very straightforward \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution. It would simply express the sense of \nthe Senate that we support a supermajority to raise taxes. Many of the \nStates in this country now have supermajorities. In some of the fastest \ngrowing States like Arizona and Florida and Nevada, our State \nlegislatures pass supermajorities to raise taxes with 69, 70, 71 \npercent of the vote. It has not hurt the economy. In fact, it has \nhelped the economy of those States.\n  The House of Representatives will be considering a constitutional \namendment to do this. The Senate will probably not be considering that. \nBut I do think it is important, before tax day, April 15, for the \nSenate to at least express its view that it ought to be as hard to \nraise taxes as it is to cut taxes. That means we should have some kind \nof a supermajority to raise taxes here in the U.S. Congress.\n  It is a sense of the Senate. It expresses a very simple proposition \nthat Americans are taxed enough and that to tax them any more should \nrequire more than a bare majority of the House and the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time? One minute in opposition. Who \nseeks time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we oppose the use of the supermajority \nthat the Senator proposes in this amendment, for a tax increase. We \nthink it is inappropriate. We think it ought not be offered at this \ntime. We hope everybody will stand against it, as opposed to putting \ninto concrete the proposition that it should take a supermajority vote \nto close a wasteful corporate tax loophole, or other special interest \ntax break.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. All time \nhas been yielded back. Are the yeas and nays required?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank Senator Frist and Senator Collins \nfor speaking on behalf of this amendment. I now recognize Senator \nJeffords, who\n\n[[Page S3077]]\n\nis the principal cosponsor of this amendment, for our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of \nthis amendment. It originally was a second-degree amendment to the \nKennedy amendment. I understand that the Senator from Massachusetts \nagrees with our amendment. I appreciate that. But I point out that what \nwe are doing now is trying to make sure that our health care system \ndoes what we want it to do, trying to make sure that it is fair to \npatients and trying to make sure that we provide what is necessary for \nus to improve the system that is now having some problems. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote in favor of this amendment.\n  An important and necessary role for the Federal Government is to \nfoster a competitive marketplace by ensuring that efficient and similar \ninformation about the product is available to consumers. Consumers can \nmake their choices according to their own personal beliefs.\n  Another role is to ensure fairness, and this amendment provides that. \nI urge Members to vote for it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I hope that our colleagues will vote in \nsupport of this sense-of-the-Senate amendment. It says that we should \nnot pass legislation that makes health insurance unaffordable for \nworking families; we should not divert limited health resources from \nserving patients; we should not impose political considerations on \nclinical decisions. I am all for that. Let's all support that.\n  But this does not address the issues raised when we talk about \nprotecting basic rights of patients. The amendment I have offered gives \nthe Senate the chance to go on record as saying it is time for Congress \nto decide that profits should not take priority over patients. My \namendment and this amendment are not in conflict.\n  The broad principles in my amendment are supported by the American \nMedical Association, the disability groups, the advocates for mental \nhealth, consumer groups, the women groups, and the labor movement.\n  Let us all vote in favor of the Nickles amendment and then vote \nequally, and return the favor, for my amendment as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Let the Chair call the amendment up. The \namendment is No. 2183. The Senator is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the time has come for action to protect \nfamilies and curb the insurance company abuses. This amendment gives \nthe Senate a chance to go on record as saying it is time for Congress \nto decide that profits should not take priority over patients.\n  I just ask our colleagues to read page 3 of this sense of the Senate. \nIt ensures coverage of emergency services, and allows women direct \naccess for obstetrical and gynecological care. It ensures women will \nnot be subject to drive-through mastectomies. It meets the special \nneeds of children and the special needs of individuals with \ndisabilities. It provides for the protection of the relationship \nbetween the doctor and the patient, and the elimination of the gag \nclauses. And it provides greater information about health care plans to \nthe patients.\n  Our opponents will argue that these rights will raise premiums. But \nit will not cost an additional cent for any of the good plans. It may \ncost more for those plans who do not currently do these things. We all \nknow that the easiest way to save money is to deny care.\n  Let us stand for the patients and the medical profession. They have \nbasically endorsed these rights, as has the President's commission. \nThis amendment says that we are going to pass legislation which will \nprotect them. That is what this sense of the Senate guarantees.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against--Mr. \nPresident, may we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senators please take their \nconversations to the cloakroom.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against \nSenator Kennedy's amendment. I tell you, if you voted for the Nickles-\nJeffords amendment, you should not vote for Senator Kennedy's \namendment, because the amendment we just adopted, I guess unanimously, \nsaid that we do not want to increase costs. The Kennedy amendment says, \nlet us pass the so-called patients' bill of rights. That was introduced \n2 days ago. It is 68 pages long. It has lots and lots of mandates, \nmandates that will increase costs. And as costs go up, the number of \nuninsured will go up.\n  This bill has hundreds of regulations in it. So if you want more \nregulations instead of patient care, that would be what you would be \nvoting for in Senator Kennedy's amendment. I mention that this is \nopposed by individuals from the Mayo Clinic to the Cleveland Clinic to \nsome of the best health care providers in the world. They are saying: \nYou are going to make us provide and spend our time litigating and \nregulating instead of providing quality health care.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Kennedy amendment. And if they \nvoted in favor of the last amendment, they certainly should vote no on \nthe next one. You cannot tell me this thing does not have significant \ncosts to the consumers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired. All those in favor of the \namendment----\n  Mr. NICKLES. I move to table the Kennedy amendment, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The next amendment is the Hutchison amendment \nnumbered 2208, with 2 minutes equally divided.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. This is a budget that will set our spending \npriorities. What my amendment says is there are only two responsible \nways to spend any future surpluses: to pay down the debt, to save \nSocial Security; or to give tax relief to the hard-working American \nfamily. If Congress decides to put all the money into debt relief and \nSocial Security, that is consistent with this amendment.\n  The only reason you would vote against this amendment is if you want \nCongress in the future to be able to go on spending binges and give the \nbill to our children. This allows us to put all the money on pay-down \ndebt or to give tax relief.\n  It is important that we recognize that we have labored mightily. We \nshould not snatch defeat from the jaws of victory on the balanced \nbudget. This is our chance to take a stand. We are going to spend any \nfuture surpluses in only two ways--to pay down debt or to give tax \nrelief to the hard-working American family.\n  I urge Members to support this.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the Hutchison \namendment. It would reject President Clinton's call to save Social \nSecurity first. Yet, I hear conversations constantly about how \neverybody is saluting the sanctity of Social Security--preserve it, \nmake sure we shore it up, make sure that we take care of it for future \ngenerations. But here we open the gate to use this money that would \notherwise be reserved for Social Security for tax cuts. I think that \nthe American people, if asked the question, would say no, we want to \npay down the debt, shore up Social Security, and let's not use this for \ntax cuts, the benefit of which goes principally to those people in the \nhigher income level.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment in the interest of \nsaving Social Security first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In the interest of moving things along, the Chair is \ngoing to recognize each side for 1 minute, so we will know what we are \nvoting on.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the budget resolution would take \n$10.5 billion of ``savings,'' which is in the baseline of the Veterans \nAdministration budget, and remove it, excise it, and put it into more \nhighway funds. There are $217 billion of highway funds over 5 years. \nWhat this would effectively also do is bar any veteran's claim for \ndisability from a tobacco-related illness at a time when the test for \ngetting a tobacco-related illness in the VA is incredibly difficult. \nOnly 278 Americans, to this point, have achieved that. The whole issue \non tobacco and the military has changed in the last 3 or 4 years. We \nwant to restore the money, keep the money in the VA budget and not have \nit taken out and given to highways, which could find a different \noffset.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have moved to table.\n  I would like to withdraw my motion to table so the vote can be an up-\nor-down vote. I ask unanimous consent to be able to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask everyone on our side to vote in \nfavor of this amendment. Then I want everybody to know that the subject \nmatter will be the Domenici amendment. I will have a minute then, but I \nwill use the remaining 30 seconds to tell you what I think we ought to \ndo. This is potentially a $40 billion program. Congress never voted on \nit. The President has denied it twice and taken it out of his budget. \nWe believe the best thing to do is to have one more solid look at it by \nthe GAO, OMB, and the VA. They ought to report to us and the President \nbefore we engage in a $10 billion-a-year program which is built around \nthe notion that if you ever smoked in the military and then you got out \nand smoked for 40 more years, you are to collect benefits from the \nmilitary because you started smoking in the military.

The question now is on an amendment in the \nnature of a substitute numbered 2283.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for 1 minute.\n  This is the amendment to the pending Rockefeller amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, essentially the Domenici amendment says \nthis program, which has never been voted on by Congress, which has been \nput into regulation by order of the counsel for the Veterans \nAdministration, which will cost ultimately $40 billion, we are saying \nlet us wait 1 year and have the GAO, the Veterans Administration, and \nthe OMB study it and report to us and to the President. The President \nhas denied this program's efficacy, because of concern about the kinds \nof benefits and whether they are relevant to service in the military, 2 \nyears in a row. We ought to take a little bit of time before we get \ninvolved in a $10-billion-a year program.\n  I will give you one example. A veteran who smoked 3 years before he \nwent into the service, 4 years in the service, and 40 years thereafter \nhis surviving spouse might very well collect a widow's benefit and \nother benefits under this particular program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I hope all of my colleagues \nunderstand that by voting for the Domenici amendment--which I hope they \nwill not--they will simply completely reverse the vote which they have \njust made and wipe it all out. That will seem strange, I think, to \nveterans. This is an up-or-down vote on veterans and their disability \nbenefits. A 1-year study, in the humble opinion of the junior Senator \nfrom West Virginia, is a farce, because it is going to be made by \nexactly the same three groups that came up with the $10.5 billion cut \nout of the veterans account to put the money into highways. I doubt \nthat they are going to be any different next year, because they will \nneed the money. They will have to go get the money in the next year.\n  This cuts veterans. A ``no'' vote is what I would ask of my \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by \nSenator Domenici to the amendment offered by Senator Rockefeller on \ndisability compensation for veterans with smoking-related disabilities.\n  It seems to me reasonable to ask for more deliberate review of this \nissue. After all, President Clinton has twice proposed not to allow \npost-service smoking related illnesses to be eligible for VA disability \ncompensation. Once the question has been thoroughly reviewed, we can \nthen reconsider the matter.\n  This Domenici amendment would ask the General Accounting Office, the \nOffice of Management and Budget, and the VA to review this matter over \nthe next year. This will allow the main analytical resources of the \nFederal Government to come to bear on this question. And, when the \nassessment is finished, we will have greater confidence that we are \ndoing the right thing.\n  With respect to the main Rockefeller amendment, we have to keep \nseveral things in mind. This would be an expensive program. According \nto the Congressional Budget Office, we are talking about around $10 \nbillion over five years. It is also not clear that it is fair to all \nthe other veterans who have service-connected disabilities which are \nclearly service-connected or low income veterans who have problems \nclearly related to military service that have led, or would lead, to \nreceipt of disability compensation.\n  Furthermore, it is certainly possible that major inequities could \nresult were the underlying amendment enacted. By this I mean that \nveterans who started smoking after military service could conceivably \nbe eligible for disability compensation under terms of this amendment. \nKeep in mind also, that veterans who suffer from tobacco-related health \nproblems can still qualify for health care services from the VA if they \nmet the regular qualifying criteria.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield the remainder of his \ntime?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I do.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for the yeas and nays on the Domenici amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, for the benefit of the Senators, and \nthis has been agreed to by the ranking member, we will now start the 1-\nminute ``vote-arama.'' From the list we will call up an amendment and \nit will be taken up. When it is finished, we will call up another one. \nWe will alternate back and forth.\n  We are getting it down to a reasonable number on our side. We are \nhoping the other side will get rid of three or four more there, but we \nare going to start this way.\n  The first amendment on our side is the amendment of Senator Grams, \nNo. 2222, and that will be followed by Senator Kennedy, amendment No. \n2184. For each one, they will tell you the title and then the Senator \nwill have 1 minute to explain it.\n  Amendment No. 2222 by Senator Grams is called up.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2222\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 2222 is before the Senate. One \nminute on each side. Senator Grams is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce an amendment expressing \nthe sense of the Senate that projected budget surpluses should be \ndedicated to preserving and strengthening Social Security. This is a \nvery simple and straightforward amendment. It asks Congress and the \nPresident to commit any budget surplus to reducing the Social Security \npayroll tax and use the tax reduction to set up personal retirement \naccounts for America's working men and women.\n  Mr. President, the latest report from the Treasury Department shows \nthat we may have a budget surplus as large as $60 to $80 billion this \nyear, if revenues continue to grow at the current rate. As I have \nargued repeatedly, this surplus comes directly from taxes paid by hard-\nworking Americans, and it is only fair to return it to them in the form \nof tax relief, national debt reduction, or Social Security reform.\n  We all agree it is vitally important to save and strengthen Social \nSecurity. Many of my colleagues believe we should use the entire budget \nsurplus to save the system, but the real question is how to do it.\n  Finally, this amendment is complementary to Senator Roth's amendment. \nI believe the Roth amendment is an excellent one. I support it. The \nonly difference is mine has the payroll tax reduction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Grams amendment. \nAs he clearly says, the budget surplus should be used to, perhaps, \nestablish personal savings accounts. At the same time I heard the \nSenator say we all want to save Social Security.\n  If we want to save it, then we ought to pay down the debt, shore up \nSocial Security, and not turn over to the private sector the \nopportunity now to engage in individual savings accounts. This is not \nthe place to do it. Perhaps it ought to be considered 1 day, but this \nwould completely upset the principle of saving Social Security first. \nIf we are going to talk about it, then we ought to really mean it and \nput all surpluses into saving Social Security and reducing the debt. I \nthink that is the proper way to go, and I hope all my colleagues vote \nagainst this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nAre the yeas and nays ordered?\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is the last item of President \nClinton's education proposal. It basically provides help and assistance \nto communities for these educational opportunity grants for those \ncommunities in this country, both in rural and urban areas, that are \nshowing a special kind of designation in reforming and rehabilitating \ntheir total educational package.\n  This is one of the areas that has been recommended by most of the \neducational groups. It has been tried and tested in the past year and a \nhalf with very small, modest programs, with very substantial \nimprovement in academic achievement and accomplishment.\n  It does provide $1.5 billion over 5 years, and it is paid for with an \nacross-the-board cut in nondefense by less than two-tenths of 1 percent \nof the budget program. I hope the Senate will adopt the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we have kept our word, and we have \nincreased education spending by exactly what the President and the \nCongress decided to do last year in the Balanced Budget Act.\n\n[[Page S3081]]\n\n  We provide an additional $8 billion in additional discretionary \neducation funding over the next 5 years. In total, we will provide \nclose to $20 billion in K-12 education funding this year. That is a 98 \npercent increase over the last 10 years.\n  We agree with the President on the funding. However, we disagree with \nthe President on how to spend the money, because the President and his \nparty want to make Washington, DC, education central.

Mr. President, I am somewhat surprised by this because I \nunderstood I had an agreement with the Senator from Georgia. I \nunderstand now he does not want to follow through with that agreement. \nI have already told our side that we would not request a rollcall. I \nwill stick to my agreement. We will not request one.\n  But I simply say there was a better way that would not have taken the \nmoney away from Bolivia fighting drugs. But we will just take this \nmatter up when we get to conference. I will keep to my commitment to \nthe leaders not to ask for a rollcall.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to the \namendment No. 2262.\n  The amendment (No. 2262) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I report to the Senate, on the \nRepublican side we have one amendment left, Senator Nickles; on the \nDemocratic side eight. I hope you can reduce that number some so we can \nget out of here earlier than any of us expected.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 2185, withdrawn\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The next amendment to come up is Kennedy amendment No. \n2185 regarding the EEOC.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 1 minute.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2185\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the equal employment amendment calls for \na 15% increase in the budget for the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission for the coming year. Under this amendment the EEOC's budget \nwill increase from $242 million to $279 million next year.\n  One of the most basic civil rights protected by current law is the \nright to equal opportunity in employment, your right to be free from \njob discrimination because of your race, your sex, your age, your \nethnic background, your religion, or any disability you may have. This \ncountry has made significant progress against job discrimination, but \nwe still have a long way to go to guarantee that you are hired or paid \nor promoted on the basis of your abilities. Too often, the right that \nyou have on paper is not a right in reality, because your remedy is \ninadequate or non-existent.\n  The EEOC has the principal responsibility to combat discrimination in \nthe workplace and that responsibility has grown significantly in recent \nyears. The passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the growing \nawareness of the problem of sexual harassment in the workplace, and the \neffect of downsizing on older workers have all added greatly to the \nresponsibilities of the EEOC, but there has not been a commensurate \nincrease in the agency's resources. The Commission's workload is \ngrowing and its budget must keep up, or vast numbers of Americans will \nhave a meaningless right--a right without a remedy.\n  In fact, EEOC funding has increased only by 5.2% over the last four \nyears. That is not enough to keep up with inflation--let alone keep up \nwith the agency's increased responsibilities. Without substantial new \nfunding, the\n\n[[Page S3082]]\n\nEEOC will fall farther and farther behind in its vital work. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  The numbers tell the story. In 1990, 62,000 charges of discrimination \nwere filed by employees in the private sector. That number increased to \n81,000 in 1997, an increase of almost 30%. Ninety percent of the \nCommission's budget is allocated for fixed costs, with the vast \nmajority--75%--going to salary and benefits. When its budget doesn't \nkeep pace with inflation, the Commission must get along with fewer \ninvestigators and attorneys. As a result, although the workload has \nincreased, the size of the staff has fallen. The number of employees \ndeclined from 2800 employees in 1993 to 2600 employees in 1997. Since \n1980, the number of employees has dropped by 23%. Think about that--\nmushrooming responsibilities, declining resources. That's an invitation \nto employers to think they can get away with discrimination in the \nworkplace.\n  The agency has tried to hold the line, but there is a limit to doing \nmore with less. The Commission urgently needs this budget increase, and \nI want the Senate to approve it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who rises in opposition?\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. This sense-of-the-Senate amendment requests that the \nfunctional total in this budget that we assume in the EEOC should \nreceive $279 million in budget authority. This is the level requested \nby the President. The amendment would raise a freeze baseline we assume \nby $37 million.\n  From my standpoint, ultimately the Appropriations Committee will \ndetermine between a freeze and a $37 million reduction, but if the \nSenator insists on this, then I have to move to table and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  I think you are just as apt to get the money without the amendment as \nyou are with it, because it will be up to, incidentally, the man \nsitting in the chair, coupled with a couple of other Senators, which of \nthe two levels will be funded. There is plenty of money for them to go \neither way.\n  Having said that, I urge you to withdraw your amendment. We stated \nthe case here, but if you would like to vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If we could have 2 minutes and maybe save ourselves \ntime.\n  I ask unanimous consent to inquire of the manager, would we have the \nassurance of the chairman that he would bite for the higher amount? Is \nthat what I understand the Senator is saying?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let's make sure we understand, I am not chairman at \nthat point. In my capacity as a Senator, I agree that I will do \neverything I can in that regard.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. To get the amount.\n  That makes a good deal of sense to me.\n  Mr. President, I withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2185) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2188\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is Senator Wellstone ready?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, colleagues.\n  The veterans' health care--some background--is funded by two sources: \nappropriations and a supplemental fund called the MCCR. The President's \nbudget cut veterans' health care appropriations by $29 million, and the \nestimate is that the MCCR fund will generate $10 million less--a \nconservative estimate; CBO says much more than that.\n  This sense-of-the-Senate amendment simply puts that $40 million back. \nIt makes the budget whole, takes it to last year's level. I hope there \nwill be a strong vote for this. This is a vote to restore the funding \nand to make the veterans' health care system whole, at least as good as \nit was last year. We ought not to be cutting veterans' health care \nbenefits. I hope I get an overwhelmingly positive vote on this.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Senator Wellstone, if you will look at \nthe budget, what we recommended is precisely what you are saying in \nyour sense of the Senate. We reinstated $153 million in veterans' \nprograms that the President had cut. Your amendment would be totally \nredundant.\n  I think what we could agree to here is that the amendment provides \nfor an assumption that increases the level to the exact level you have \nrecommended in your sense of the Senate. Thus, I don't think we need a \nsense of the Senate.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague my reading of it is different; \notherwise, I would not have done the amendment. If you are right, there \nis no harm in a strong vote on this.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Can we voice vote it?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would like to have a recorded vote on it, but I \nassume, based upon the reaction, that there is overwhelming support for \nthis amendment; is that correct?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There is overwhelming support for the budget \nresolution, which does the same thing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Let's have a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2188) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We really roll when everybody is sitting in their \nchair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2206\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Next is Senator Reid on amendment No. 2206.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the amendment that has been offered by \nSenator Reid and Senator Bryan is supported by all environmental groups \nin the country. It is supported by the Counsel for Environmental \nQuality and the Secretary of the Interior. The Endangered Species Act \nis an important act. We have worked very hard to come up with a \ncompromise. We must have a source of funding that is realistic. This is \nnot. This is a quick fix that will fail just as quickly. It is \nunrealistic to sell public lands basically from the State of Nevada for \na national project.\n  The amendment we have offered says that the landowner, instead of \nprograms included in the Endangered Species Recovery Act, should be \nfinanced from a dedicated source of funding, and the public lands \nshould not be sold to fund the Landowner Incentive Program of the \nEndangered Species Recovery Act.\n  This amendment should be passed. It is the fair thing to do.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I rise today in support of the Reid/Bryan amendment which \nexpresses the sense of the Senate that Federal public lands should not \nbe sold to fund the landowner incentive program of the Endangered \nSpecies Recovery Act.\n  As some of my colleagues are aware, the budget resolution before us \ntoday assumes the landowner incentive program of the Endangered Species \nRecovery Act will be enacted. The landowner incentive program includes \nhabitat reserve agreements, safe harbor agreements, habitat \nconservation plans, and recovery plan implementation agreements within \nthe Act. The report accompanying the budget resolution calls for \nfunding for these programs to be made available ``from the gross \nreceipts realized in the sales of excess BLM land, provided that BLM \nhas sufficient administrative funds to conduct such sales.''\n  Mr. President, this proposal is a short-sighted attempt to find a \nsolution to a very legitimate issue. I support efforts to find a \nsustainable funding mechanism to provide incentives to landowners to \nundertake conservation measures that are necessary for the protection \nand recovery of threatened and endangered species. The problem with the \nproposal before us today is that it fails to establish a reliable \nsource of funding. The one-time sales of BLM lands cannot be expected \nto provide a revenue source for habitat conservation plans and other \nlandowner incentive programs that are designed to last for 50 years or \nlonger. This proposal is a classic example of selling a capital asset \nto pay for operation and maintenance costs. In my opinion, it \nrepresents the utmost in fiscal irresponsibility.\n  In addition, this proposal would set a dangerous precedent regarding \nthe management of our public lands by threatening the public land base \navailable to future generations of Americans. Currently, the land \ndisposal\n\n[[Page S3083]]\n\nmethod favored the BLM involves land exchanges. This process allows the \nBLM to dispose of land it no longer needs in exchange for land that is \nworthy of public ownership. The land exchange process allows the BLM to \ntrade an asset it no longer deems desirable for one that it does. \nIronically, the BLM often uses land exchanges as a means of acquiring \ncritical habitat for threatened and endangered species. By disrupting \nthe land exchange process, the land sale proposal in this resolution \ncould actually weaken the federal government's ability to acquire \nprivate, environmentally sensitive land that rightfully belongs in \npublic ownership.\n  Mr. President, I am also concerned with this proposal because it \nwould effectively eviscerate another piece of legislation that I have \nsponsored concerning the BLM land disposal process in Southern Nevada. \nIt is no secret that the public lands that this budget resolution \ncontemplates being sold are those BLM lands in the Las Vegas valley. I \nhave worked closely with Senator Reid and our House delegation for the \nlast three years to develop the Southern Nevada Public Land Management \nAct, which provides local governments in southern Nevada with more \ninput into the BLM land exchange and land sale process. Over the last \nseveral years, BLM land exchanges have contributed significantly to \ngrowth and development in the Las Vegas valley. My legislation would \nallow local governments and the BLM to work more closely together in \nmanaging growth in the valley. The land sale proposal in this budget \nresolution would destroy the ability of the Las Vegas community to have \na voice in the BLM land sale process as envisioned under my \nlegislation.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support the Reid/Bryan amendment and \nto reject the irresponsible sell off of our public lands as contained \nin this budget resolution.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the minute we have to Senator Chafee.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I will take 30 seconds, and the Senator from Idaho will \ntake 30 seconds.\n  More than half of all the endangered species in the United States are \nin private lands. In the Endangered Species Reauthorization Act, we put \nin moneys, we provide for assistance to private landowners, most of \nthem small landowners. We do that.\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee provided that if any BLM lands \nare sold--if they are sold, those moneys, instead of going into the \ngeneral treasury, will be used for the Endangered Species Act to help \nlandowners, mostly small landowners.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2285 to Amendment No. 2206\n\n   (Purpose: To recognize potential alternative funding sources for \n    landowner incentives under the Endangered Species Recovery Act)\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I send to the desk a second-degree amendment and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Kempthorne] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2285 to amendment No. 2206.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  Mr. FORD. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       An amendment in the Second Degree to the Reid Amendment.\n       At the end of subsection (b)(2), strike ``Act.'' and insert \n     the following:\n       ``Act through their proceeds alone, if subsequent \n     legislation provides an alternative or mixed, dedicated \n     source of mandatory funding.''\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I want to acknowledge the great work that the Senator \nfrom Nevada has done on the Endangered Species Act, along with the \nSenator from Montana and the chairman from Rhode Island.\n  This is not a question of whether we should sell excess BLM lands; it \nis taking place; it is a question of where the revenues should be \nutilized.\n  The Budget Committee--and I thank the chairman--came up with a \nrevenue source that finally we could compensate landowners who \nvoluntarily stepped forward so we could have an incentive to help \nspecies and to help property owners.\n  Now the effect of the second-degree is to say that rather than \nforeclose the use of that excess land revenue, we will continue to look \nat all different sources of revenue so that we can come up with ways \nthat we can make good on our pledge, and that is, property owners \nshould be compensated when they come forward and help us save species.\n  This is good for species, good for people, and it keeps all options \nopen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I acknowledge the good work of the Senator \nfrom Idaho, the Senator from Rhode Island, and certainly the ranking \nmember of the full committee in coming up with a compromise. However, \nthe amendment that I have, the underlying amendment, does everything \nthey say it should do, except their amendment will still allow Western \nlands to be sold at a fire sale to provide a quick fix for the \nEndangered Species Act. We do not need a quick fix; we need a dedicated \nsource of funding.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2285. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) is necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 55, nays 43, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 79 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--55\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--43\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Helms\n     Inouye\n       \n  The amendment (No. 2285) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 2206\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the underlying amendment \nNo. 2206.\n  The amendment (No. 2206) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2257\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the next amendment will be one from our \nside. It is our last amendment, which Senator Nickles has. It is No. \n2257.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n[[Page S3084]]\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, this is an amendment offered by myself \nand Senator Murkowski. The net effect of it would be that if we are \ndealing with the budget process and the so-called wish list amendments, \nthe sense of the Senate and sense of Congress would basically be ruled \nout of order. My amendment would instruct the Chair to make precatory \namendments not germane to the budget resolution. That means you would \nneed 60 votes to pass it. At one point, we had 100 amendments, and over \ntwo-thirds of them were precatory amendments; they were wishes. The \nword precatory means to wish. That doesn't change the budget \nresolution, and it wastes a lot of time. It means that, yes, we have \nsome kind of sparring back and forth. I don't know how many votes we \nhave had in the last couple of days, two-thirds of them have been sense \nof the Senate or sense of the Congress. And, really, they will have \nvery little impact on the budget process. I think they have made the \nSenate look bad in the process.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I am not going to \nrequest the yeas and nays unless it is necessary. I think this would \nhelp us do our business in a much more orderly and efficient manner.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I recognize the fact that the \ndistinguished Senator from Oklahoma has sent up a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution to prohibit sense-of-the-Senate resolutions. This amendment \nwould prohibit those sense-of-the-Senate resolutions----\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator will yield, this is a concurrent \nresolution.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Then I owe the Senator an apology. I will start all \nover. I don't call attention to the fact that he has sent a sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution to the desk.\n  This amendment, however, Mr. President, would prohibit any Member of \nthe Senate from offering a sense of the Senate or sense of the Congress \namendment to a budget resolution. The budget resolution already places \nserious restrictions on minority participation. This is how we get \nthere. When you are on this side next year, you will know how it feels \nto be in the minority and you will have an opportunity to amend things \nthat you don't see.\n  I, frankly, don't see a lot of harm in it. It takes time, yes, but it \ngives a chance for an exchange of ideas that I think is important.\n  I make a point of order that the amendment is not germane.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I move to waive the point of order, and I \ntell my colleague that you can still pass sense-of-the-Congress \nresolutions with 60 votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the motion to waive the \npoint of order.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES: I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) is necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. FORD: I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any Senators wishing to vote or to \nchange their vote?\n  The clerk will report.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, how am I recorded?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is reported as a \nnegative. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, how am I recorded?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is reported as \nnegative.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Regular order.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas are 60----\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President. You can't do that there, come on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas are 60 and the nays are 38.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how am I recorded?\n  Mr. SARBANES. No, no, no, no, no.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Not when someone is seeking recognition here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is ruling the reporting of the vote \ncan occur and the yeas are 60----\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. And the nays are 38.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I object.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will renew my request. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nDurbin be recognized to switch his vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                              Vote Change\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, no.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \nmotion was rejected.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank Senator Nickles for the magnanimous \ngesture he just made. However, I want to emphasize we are trying to \nmove these votes, and the Chair was absolutely right, because it is up \nto the discretion of the Chair to respond when Members ask how they are \nrecorded, but also when regular order is called for, especially when we \nare trying to move through all these votes, the Chair is under an \nobligation to bring this to a conclusion.\n  I think we had the right resolution here, but I want to make sure \neverybody understands, we are trying to move these votes through. We \nare trying to get to a conclusion, and that brings me to my next point.\n  It is 5 after 9. We still have, it looks like, as many as five \namendments that\n\n[[Page S3085]]\n\nwe may have to vote on. I urge Senators, if they are planning on \ncalling up those amendments, to see if we can't work out something \nwhere maybe some of them can be accepted or not offered and that we not \ngo through the process of having second-degree amendments offered at \nthis point.\n  If we can do that, we can finish this within this hour, by 10 \no'clock. I thank Senator Reid and others for the work they have been \ndoing in trying to help pare down the list. We are very close now, and \nI think it important we not lose the decorum we have exercised through \na long day. I thank my colleagues for that.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I also want to acknowledge the efforts \nmade by the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles, in \nresolving this minor problem. I appreciate very much his efforts to do \nwhat he did. I will say, however, that we have been working in good \nfaith on both sides to try to move this along. Regular order is called, \nbut also Senators deserve the right to be recognized when they seek \nrecognition for purposes of clarification of their vote, so there is a \nneed to be sensitive on both sides in a request of the Chair. I know \nthat the Chair was accommodating or attempting to accommodate Senators.\n  I also join with the majority leader in asking the five remaining \nauthors to work with us to see if we might reduce the number of \nrollcalls necessary. We are very close now, and I thank my colleagues \non this side for cooperating thus far. Let's see if we can get it down \nto a couple, fewer than what we have right now. We can finish this \nwithin the hour, and I hope we can receive just a little more \ncooperation to make that happen. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained. The amendment \nfalls.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2216\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2216.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 2216 is the pending amendment. \nThe Senator from Washington is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, my amendment increases Function 500 budget authority \nand outlays to include the President's education initiatives, and adds \nthe Resolution level for IDEA. The offset is a Function 920 across-the-\nboard reduction of less than one percent, taken from non-defense \ndiscretionary funds.\n  The President's budget request only included a level of $35 million \nfor the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (I.D.E.A). To \nget the Federal Government back on track toward its responsibility to \ncover 40 percent of the cost of educating special education students at \nthe local level, significant increases are necessary.\n  The Resolution level in fiscal year 99 for Function 500 is $500 \nmillion below a freeze. It does not provide enough funding for the \nimportant education initiatives requested by the President and \nsupported by the American public: Continuing investments in education \ntechnology, including teacher training reflecting my Teacher Technology \nTraining Act; creation of education empowerment zones; appropriations \nfor Minority Teacher Recruitment; funding for the 21st Century Learning \nCenters; appropriations for Children's Literacy and Work Study; \nincreases for Title I funding; an increase in the maximum Pell Grant; \nand increased funding for Safe and Drug-Free Schools.\n  My amendment makes education a higher priority within the construct \nof a balanced budget. I must point out that even with my amendment, the \nPresident and the Budget Committee have left other critical educational \nservices unfunded. But by passing this amendment, we will take steps to \nstop the cuts to education, and get on the road toward results for \nAmerican students.\n  Mr. President, the American people believe education should be a \nhigher priority than its current 1.8 percent of total Federal outlays. \nThey see the need to improve the quality of every Federal education \nprogram, minimize red tape, improve efficiency, and create \ncollaboration. But, they also see our Nation facing increased \nenrollments, a teacher corps nearing retirement, and other factors \nwhich increase the overall need for education funding at this critical \npoint in our history. The American people see that education must \nbecome a higher priority in our national budget.\n  Unfortunately, this budget fails to meet the education needs of \nAmerica. It does not invest in the future. It cuts from services that \nare helping students in schools today. This budget resolution places \nAmerica at a crossroads--and it takes us down the wrong road. A vote \nfor the Murray amendment is a vote that honors our commitment to fund \n40 percent of the cost of special education funding, but doesn't try to \npit students against one another over limited federal dollars. We need \nto invest in the future, and we need a budget that reflects America's \npriorities.\n  Mr. President, when looking at the budget resolution as it came from \nthe Committee, I think we need to ask ``what do the assumptions in the \nRepublican budget resolution leave out?'' The answers are disturbing.\n  Within Function 500, for sub-function 501 (Elementary and Secondary \nEducation), Chairman Domenici's Committee resolution starts with a \nfreeze.\n  The resolution then adds $2.5 billion for funding for the Individuals \nwith Disabilities in Education Act (IDEA), and $6.3 billion for Title \nVI School Reform efforts, for a total of $8.8 billion over 5 years.\n  From this amount, the majority then assumes that $2.2 billion will be \nsaved through consolidation of current educational services, leaving \ntheir overall add to a freeze at $6.6 billion.\n  Mr. President, another important question now arises: Which important \npriorities of the American people were left out when the majority \nignored the President's new initiatives?\n  The only education programs explicitly left unfunded by the \ndiscretionary Republican budget resolution are the President's new \ninitiatives (such as educational empowerment zones; teacher technology \ntraining; the new transition to school program; community-based \ntechnology centers; and Safe and Drug-Free Schools coordinators). These \nprograms total $2.4 billion.\n  When added to the $7.3 billion in mandatory spending for class size \nreduction, the total President's request level for new sub-function 501 \nfunds is $9.7 billion over a freeze.\n  Because the Republicans assume $2.2 billion in consolidation, we need \nto ask another question: Which current programs will be cut under their \n$2.2 billion consolidation proposal?\n  This list could include any discretionary elementary and secondary \neducation program, such as:\n  Title I Education for the Disadvantaged (including reading and math \nassistance for needy students; Even Start; Migrant Education; services \nfor neglected and delinquent students; and others.)\n  America Reads Children's Literacy\n  Eisenhower Professional Development\n  Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities\n  Magnet Schools\n  Education for Homeless Children and Youth\n  Inexpensive Book Distribution\n  Bilingual Education\n  Goals 2000\n  Arts in Education\n  Women's Educational Equity\n  School-to-Work\n  Vocational Education\n  The American people will remember that last year, during debates on \nconsolidation and block granting, proponents of block-granting federal \neducation funds proclaimed that by eliminating bureaucracy under block-\ngranting, school districts would actually have more money to spend, not \nless. Hold-harmless provisions were discussed, which would purportedly \nassure that school districts would not see funding cuts.\n  But we had all heard this kind of talk before, from those who start \nby ``consolidating,'' and then take the next step to ``downsizing.'' \nToo often a block-grant equals a cut, and our school communities know \nit.\n  We were told that the fundamental philosophical question was whether \nor not we believed that individual school districts and parents and \nteachers know best how to handle education in their own communities, or \nwhether we\n\n[[Page S3086]]\n\nbelieved those fundamental decisions are best left to bureaucrats in \nWashington, D.C.\n  I think the fundamental question is rather when certain people in \npositions of authority in Washington D.C. are going to listen to their \nstate and local governments and the people. This is a time of \nincredible renewal in education. Republicans, Democrats and \nIndependents in my state of Washington and other states are on a \nserious, measurable road to school improvement.\n  From school report cards, to higher standards, to increased family \nand community involvement--improvement is happening, accountability is \npresent, and students and their parents are seeing results. At a \nminimum, there is a fundamental discussion about educational \nimprovement going on in every community in my state. When federal \nconsolidation is tied to questions of ``who knows best,'' I think those \nwho do know best, the parents, teachers, students, and community \nleaders like those in my state have reason to feel betrayed.\n  Because money does matter. Yes, we need to consolidate services where \nit has an educational goal. Yes, the federal government works best when \nit creates red tape least--but Americans interested in improving \neducation already have venues to make these changes. And these \ndiscussions--such as the one that will occur during the 1999 rewrite of \nfederal elementary and secondary education programs--respect the \nknowledge and experience of those who actually learn with or work with \nfederal education services.\n  But when the Congress ignores needed investments to improve school \nfacilities and improve the quality of school personnel--then uses \nblock-grants as cover for education cuts--local communities have reason \nto feel betrayed.\n  So, my hope is that those who want to improve the federal \ngovernment's efforts to help students learn, and who see consolidation \nas a vehicle toward this end, will work with local school communities. \nMy hope is that they will work with those of us who have experience in \neducation. My hope is that we can work together to find results for \nstudents.\n  Because when the Congressional majority begins to pay attention to \nthe appropriate federal role in school improvement, that is a positive \nstep. Now that the discussion is joined, however, it must be \nproductive, bipartisan, and aimed at efforts that will work.\n  When we look at this budget resolution, we also need to ask ``what do \nthe assumptions in the President's budget request leave out?''\n  The President's budget request assumes less than sufficient funding \n(less than current-services funding, or complete terminations) for, \namong others:\n  Impact Aid (Construction and payments for Federal Property)\n  State Student Incentive Grant\n  Innovative Education Program Strategies\n  Ellender Fellowships\n  Literacy Programs for Prisoners\n  Urban Community Service\n  National Early Intervention Scholarships and Partnerships\n  State Grants for Incarcerated Youth Offenders\n  In addition, the President's budget includes only $35 million for \nfunding for the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act over a \nfreeze annually. My amendment would meet the $500 million increase per \nyear in Sen. Domenici's Committee reported resolution ($465 million \nover the President's level). For too long, the Congress has not met its \nobligation to pay 40 percent of the costs of educating each special \neducation student.\n  Education, especially public education, is near and dear to the \nAmerican people. Although the challenges are great, there are \nproductive discussions happening in public schools across the country. \nLocal people are making decisions that are producing results for \nstudents. We know we need to expect more from our schools than folks \ndid in the past. We know we have an economy and a society full of new \ndemands. Regardless of political persuasion, ethnicity, income, age, or \nany other dividing line one might find--all Americans want students to \nsucceed. And there is broad recognition that we should do more, not \nless. More to improve the quality of our schools. And more to make \neducation a higher priority in the federal budget. I urge adoption of \nthe Murray amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that several letters regarding \neducation funding be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                               American Federation of Teachers\n\n                                                    April 1, 1998.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of over 950,000 members of the \n     American Federation of Teachers (AFT), I urge you to oppose \n     the FY 1999 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget, S. Con. Res. \n     86, unless changes are incorporated to rectify the following \n     shortfalls.\n       Although the budget resolution assumes a $2.5 billion \n     increase for IDEA over five years, a $500 million increase in \n     FY 1999, total discretionary spending in Function 500 \n     reflects only a $600 million increase over FY 1998. This \n     level is $1.6 billion below the President's budget and $1 \n     billion below the amount needed to maintain current program \n     levels in education, job training, and social services.\n       This budget resolution should include funding for the \n     President's initiatives in class size reduction and for \n     school construction. The President requested $1.1 billion to \n     recruit and train 100,000 new teachers over the next seven \n     years in order to reduce class size to an average of 18 in \n     grades 1-3, when children need the most help in learning to \n     read proficiently and mastering the basics. The AFT also \n     supports he President's proposal for more than $20 billion in \n     interest-free bonds for school construction. An estimated \n     one-third of all schools need extensive repairs and new \n     academic facilities are needed to serve the booming \n     enrollments in elementary and secondary schools. Instead, the \n     budget resolution assumes a $6.3 billion increase, $522 \n     million in FY 1999, for Title VI Innovative Program \n     Strategies, an education block grant program, while assuming \n     an estimated $2.2 billion in savings from unspecified \n     consolidation of elementary and secondary education programs.\n       In addition, the AFT opposes savings assumed in \n     discretionary spending resulting from repealing Davis-Bacon \n     and the Service Contract Act beginning in the year 2000. The \n     AFT also opposes the citing of S. 1133, The ``Parent and \n     Student Savings Account Plus,'' as an illustration of tax \n     relief, which would expand the use of Education IRAs to \n     include private and religious school tuition for elementary \n     and secondary students.\n       For these reasons, I urge you to oppose S. Con. Res. 86 \n     unless amendments are adopted to address these concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Gerald D. Morris,\n     Director of Legislation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                        NAPSEC\n\n                                                   March 25, 1998.\n     Hon. Patty Murray,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murray: On behalf of the National Association \n     of Private Schools for Exceptional Children (NAPSEC), an \n     association that represents over 900 private special \n     education schools for children with disabilities across the \n     nation both nationally and through its Council of Affiliated \n     State Associations, I urge you to oppose the FY 99 Budget \n     Resolution when it is considered by the Senate.\n       Although the resolution adds a billion dollars for special \n     education programs and Title VI innovative education \n     strategies programs, the resolution provides only $600 \n     million more for all education and related programs. The \n     resolution would fund education programs at $1.1 billion \n     below current service levels. Programs like Head Start, Title \n     I, Pell Grants, and other education programs would have to be \n     cut or frozen to make up the difference.\n       This action appears totally inappropriate considering the \n     new challenges facing America's education system--rising \n     enrollments at all levels, more students with special needs, \n     growing teacher shortages, unsafe, overcrowding, and decaying \n     schools, just to name a few.\n       Recent polls ranked increasing federal funding for \n     education ahead of health care, reducing national debt, tax \n     cuts, crime, and defense. I urge you to represent this \n     priority by supporting a bipartisan budget resolution that \n     makes increased investments in education. I also ask you to \n     support the amendments that are offered that would increase \n     funding for education.\n       Thank you for considering our request.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Sherry L. Kolbe,\n     Executive Director & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                         NSBA,\n\n                                                   March 25, 1998.\n     Hon. Patty Murray,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murray: The National School Boards \n     Association, representing 95,000 school board members through \n     its federation of 53 states and territories, urges you to \n     make education your first priority and to oppose the FY 1999 \n     Budget Resolution reported from the Senate Budget Committee \n     last week because of its inadequate levels of funding for \n     education.\n       The Senate Budget Committee's resolution is more than $1 \n     billion below current services for discretionary spending in \n     Function 500,\n\n[[Page S3087]]\n\n     which includes education and related programs and is $1.6 \n     billion below the President's request. While recommending a \n     billion dollars more for special education and the Title VI \n     innovative education strategies programs, the FY 1999 Budget \n     Resolution provides only $600 million more for all education \n     and training programs. Programs like Title I, Impact Aid, and \n     charter schools would have to be cut or frozen to make up the \n     difference.\n       In contrast, the FY 1999 Budget Resolution allocates \n     increases for health and transportation over the next five \n     years that are $20 billion and $30 billion higher, \n     respectively, than the levels approved in last year's budget \n     agreement. This increase will put further pressure on funding \n     levels for education and other domestic programs.\n       Finally, the FY 1999 Budget Resolution also rejects \n     creating new revenue streams for education such as tax \n     incentives to encourage school construction and mandatory \n     spending for new initiatives proposed by President Clinton.\n       When looked at as a totality, the FY 1999 Budget Resolution \n     will result in cuts below the current level of services for \n     education at a time when America's educational system is \n     facing new challenges at the start of the 21st century.\n       Education is America's best investment. Education will \n     continue to fuel a growing economy that is able to compete in \n     world markets; provide the job-ready labor force that will \n     contribute to the stability of the Social Security system; \n     give all Americans the opportunity to achieve a higher \n     standard of living for themselves and their families; and \n     allow the United States to maintain its strong leadership \n     role in the world. Last year, Congress and the Administration \n     worked together to provides a substantial increase in the \n     investment in higher education. This year, several important \n     investments for elementary and secondary education have been \n     targeted, and it is vitally important for our nation's \n     schoolchildren that we make a commitment to fund them. Our \n     nation's schools face unprecedented challenges: exploding \n     enrollments; dramatic increases in students with special \n     needs; overcrowded, inadequate, and unsafe school buildings; \n     high demands for costly, new technology; and the commitment \n     to reach high standards for all students. To meet the current \n     challenges for elementary and secondary education, the \n     federal government needs to expand its financial commitment \n     to education funding, state and local funding cannot meet the \n     expanded demands and expectations for our schools.\n       We hope to work with you to ensure a significant federal \n     funding of the American public's top priority--education. We \n     hope the year will not begin with a debate about cutting the \n     federal investment in elementary and secondary education.\n       If you have any further questions about this issue, please \n     call Laurie A. Westley, assistant executive director, at 703-\n     838-6703.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                William B. Ingram,\n                                                        President.\n                                                   Anne L.

While \n     recommending a billion dollars more for special education and \n     the Title VI innovative education strategies programs, the \n     resolution provides only $600 million more for all education \n     and related programs. Programs like Head Start, Title I, Pell \n     grants, or other education and related programs would have to \n     be cut or frozen to make up the difference.\n       In contrast, the resolution allocates increases for health \n     and transportation over the next five years that are $20 \n     billion and $30 billion higher, respectively, than the levels \n     approved in last year's budget agreement. These increases, \n     while much needed, will put further pressure on funding \n     levels for other domestic programs like education.\n       The budget resolution also rejects creating critical new \n     revenue streams for education such as mandatory spending to \n     reduce class size and tax incentives to encourage school \n     construction as proposed in the President's budget.\n       Taken all together, this budget resolution is likely to \n     result in cuts below current service levels for education at \n     a time when America's educational system is facing new \n     challenges at the start of the 21st century. These include \n     rising enrollments at all levels; more students with special \n     needs; growing teacher shortages and professional development \n     needs; unsafe, overcrowded and outdated school facilities; \n     access to rapidly advancing educational technology; and \n     continuing access to postsecondary education for low income \n     students.\n       Recent polls ranked increased federal funding for education \n     ahead of health care, reducing national debt, tax cuts, crime \n     and defense (Greenberg-Guinlan and the Tarrance Group, \n     January 1998). We urge you to support a bipartisan budget \n     resolution that makes increased investment in education the \n     top budget priority to meet the growing needs of America's \n     students and secure America's future. We also urge you to \n     support amendments to the budget resolution that would \n     increase funding for education.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Kenneth G. McInerney,\n                                                        President.\n                                                  Edward R.

Patty Murray,\n     Committee on the Budget,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murray: The National PTA urges you to include \n     education as a top funding priority in the FY 1999 budget \n     resolution you are about to consider. There are thousands of \n     excellent public schools in this country, but too many others \n     lack the resources they need to provide a quality education \n     for all children. These schools face formidable challenges, \n     which include record-high student enrollments, an increase in \n     the number of children with disabilities, a growing need for \n     new and qualified teachers, extensive and expensive \n     technology needs, and school facilities in desperate need of \n     expansion and renovation. An increased federal financial \n     investment is needed to address these national concerns.\n       For the past two years, Congress has increased federal \n     funding for education, and National PTA supports this \n     leadership. National PTA now urges lawmakers to continue this \n     positive trend to assure that the benefits of this investment \n     are long-lasting. Even with the recent spending growth, none \n     of the major elementary and secondary education programs \n     designed to expand educational opportunity or improve \n     achievement is funded near the level needed to serve all who \n     are eligible.\n       As you develop the FY 1999 Senate Budget Resolution, \n     National PTA asks that you include an increase for \n     discretionary education and children's programs sufficient to \n     allow funding for new initiatives and increases in vital \n     existing programs like Title I, IDEA, and Impact Aid. We also \n     urge you to include in the budget an accommodation for new \n     sources of funding for education, such as an infrastructure \n     tax credit or mandatory education programs to reform schools \n     and increase student learning.\n       Now is an excellent time to strengthen the federal \n     investment in successful and cost-effective education \n     programs. The nation's economic health is robust. The \n     president's budget request is balanced and projects growing \n     surpluses for at least the next ten years. Many vital \n     interests will compete for discretionary funds this year, but \n     investing in education is one of the best ways to assure that \n     the national economy continues to prosper, and the stability \n     of the Social Security system is strengthened.\n       We look forward to working with Congress to secure much-\n     needed resources to improve the quality of public schools and \n     to invest now for America's future.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Shirley Igo,\n     Vice President for Legislation.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. President, I request the yeas and the nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I didn't want to interrupt, but some of \nus are having a little difficulty hearing even when there is quiet. \nMaybe Senators could make sure they are talking into the mike.\n  I didn't hear much of what Senator Murray said. But, Mr. President, \nlet me say what I understand this amendment does. It asks for a $2.5 \nbillion increase in education for special ed. It doesn't say where the \nmoney comes from, but it comes from somewhere in the budget.\n  The Republican budget before us asks $2.5 billion more for special ed \nthan the President of the United States asked for. As a matter of fact, \nthe President, after committing to dramatically increase special ed, \nincreased it $38 million while we increase it $2.5 billion. We said \nwhere we took the money so that it is doable. This one does not even \nindicate what programs in the Government would be cut to pay for this. \nI don't believe this is the way we ought to do business here, and if \nthe time has been yielded back, I yield mine. I move to table the \nMurray amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table the amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2220\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, recognizing reality and the hour, I am \ngoing to tell you what my amendment was going to be, and then I will \nwithdraw it. This amendment was to see to it that the moneys from the \ntobacco settlement, if any, could have been used for VA health care, as \nwell as Medicare. But looking at that lineup, I understand the outcome, \nand so I withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 2220) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The next amendment is the Feingold amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2224\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I offer this amendment to establish a \nnarrowly focused, deficit-neutral reserve fund to help people with \ndisabilities become employed and remain independent. While it does not \nspecify a specific proposal, I want it to be clear that we have crafted \nthis reserve fund with a very specific measure in mind, and that is the \nbipartisan Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1998, S. 1858, which was \ndeveloped under the leadership of the Senator from Vermont, Mr. \nJeffords.\n  We truly offer people with disabilities a chance to leave the \ndisability rolls and become self-sufficient taxpayers. If just 1 \npercent of the 7.5 million Americans with disabilities become \nsuccessfully employed, it is estimated it will save, in cash assistance \nalone, over $3.5 billion. So I urge the body to support this narrowly \ntargeted, capped, deficit-neutral reserve fund.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise today to support Senator Feingold \nin his amendment to create a disability reserve fund to allow people \nwith disabilities to become employed and remain independent. The \namendment would ensure that the budget resolution incorporates the \nflexibility to allow offsets for the bipartisan Work Incentive \nImprovement Act of 1998. This bill allows people with disabilities to \nbecome employed and remain independent, by providing more affordable \nand accessible health care.\n  Despite the extraordinary growth and prosperity the country is \nenjoying today, persons with disabilities continue to struggle to live \nindependently and become fully contributing members of their \ncommunities. Of the 54 million disabled people in this country, many \nhave the capacity to work and want to become productive citizens, but \nthey are unable to do so because they are afraid of losing their health \ncare.\n  Today, 7.5 million disabled Americans depend on public assistance. \nThe cost to the taxpayer is $73 billion annually and will continue to \nincrease at 6% a year. If we can support just one percent of the these \n7.5 million individuals to become successfully employed, savings in \ncash assistance would total $3.5 billion over the work lives of these \nindividuals.\n  Senator Feingold's amendment creates a narrowly targeted reserve \nfund, which allows savings or revenues from various sources to be used \nto offset the costs associated with this proposal. The reserve fund is \nlimited in the total spending it permits for this specific purpose, and \nis permissive--it allows the Senate leadership to use savings from \nunrelated areas to be dedicated to support disabled people to become \nemployed. Work is a central part of the American dream, and it is time \nfor this Congress to support our disabled citizens in achieving that \ndream.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first of all, the amendment violates the \nBudget Act. This sets up a new reserve fund to create a new entitlement \nfor disabled people. It permits the raising of taxes in order to pay \nfor it, and in every respect it violates the Budget Act. I do not think \nI have to say much more.\n  We have denied any new reserve fund where specific revenues or \nresources have not been allocated. That is the case here. We think we \nhave adequately taken care of the disabled under our budget. In many \ncases, we have done more than what the President has done. So with \nthat, I make a point of order that the amendment is not in order under \nthe Budget Act.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I move to waive the Budget Act as to the \npending amendment, and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? Is there a \nsufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to waive the \nBudget Act as to the amendment No. 2224. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES: I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms), is necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Helms), would vote ``no.''\n  Mr. FORD: I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye), is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 47, nays 51, as follows:\n\n                      (Rollcall Vote No. 82 Leg.)\n\n                                YEAS--47\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--51\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n\n[[Page S3089]]\n\n\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Helms\n     Inouye\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote the yeas are 47, and the nays are \n51. Three-fifths of the Senators present and voting not having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion to waive the Budget Act is not agreed to. \nThe point of order is sustained. The amendment falls.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2234\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we have just two amendments that require \nvotes, but we have finally agreed on the Boxer amendment and there will \nnot be a second-degree amendment. I ask that amendment No. 2234 be \ncalled up. This will be voice voted. It is already understood if the \nRepublicans say ``no'' loud enough, you will win.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my chairman for his many \ncourtesies throughout the evening. I would have appreciated one more \ncourtesy, which would have been accepting the amendment. I want to say \nto my colleagues that I urge a strong voice vote on this side. There \nisn't one penny of tobacco money in the budget resolution going for NIH \nresearch, and nothing for cancer research. So I hope you will give me a \nstrong aye voice vote, even though I think the result is predetermined \nbecause I think with all the people getting cancer caused from \ncigarettes, it makes sense to use the reserve fund from the tobacco \nsettlement for NIH funding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2234) was rejected.\n\n\n                           amendment No. 2230\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the next amendment is Senator John \nKerry's amendment No. 2230.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, my amendment is subject to a budget point \nof order. Since that is the same 60 votes that it will require to \naccomplish this later, I am not going to ask my colleagues to make that \nvote tonight. What I would ask is that my colleagues, during the break, \nthink about the appropriateness or inappropriateness of where we are \ncurrently allocating tobacco funds.\n  The entire purpose of the tobacco legislation is directed at stopping \nkids from smoking. Yet, that is going to require funding for various \nthings, such as research and compliance. We need to assist the tobacco \nfarmers. There are clearly a set of priorities for where tobacco money \nshould go. I hope when we come back and take up the Commerce Committee \nbill, we will find it in ourselves to adopt those appropriate \npriorities.\n  I withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we thank the Senator for doing that.\n  Senator Robb is the last amendment that I think we have to have a \nvote on.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, will the Senator mind me asking to put \na couple things in the Record.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Of course.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2232\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 2232.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 2232 is now the pending \nbusiness.\n  The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I regret very much that I am not in a \nposition to do as my two previous colleagues have done because we have \na bit of a dilemma for tobacco farmers. Everyone who has proposed \nlegislation to include the legislation reported out of the Commerce \nCommittee yesterday by a vote of 19-1 makes provisions for tobacco \nfarmers in terms of transition.\n  The tobacco reserve fund, however, has been wisely fenced off by the \nchairman of the Budget Committee so that it might not be raided by \nthose of us who might have other spending plans. But the only source of \npayment for any of the plans that have been proposed or considered is \ngoing to be the money that comes into that particular fund.\n  This amendment would simply make available that particular funding, \nalong with Medicare, to fund any of the tobacco provisions that might \notherwise bring down tobacco legislation for the tobacco farmers.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Everybody should recall that the Republican budget says \nunless and until the Congress of the United States produces legislation \nwith 60 votes that does otherwise, we allocate whatever Federal moneys \nwe receive from any cigarette settlement to the Medicare fund, which is \nthe fund most entitled to it because it's the fund that is most abused \nby smoking--$25 billion a year.\n  So what we have now is an attempt to say, no, let's change it just a \nlittle bit, let's add another use to that fund. I don't believe we \nshould do that.\n  I make a point of order that this amendment violates the Budget Act \nbecause it is not germane.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I move to waive the point of order, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the motion to waive the \nBudget Act.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) is necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting, the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. FORD.

The question occurs on agreeing to amendments \n2271, 2238, 2180, 2243, 2265, 2272, and 2252.\n  The amendments (Nos. 2271, 2238, 2180, 2243, 2265, 2272, and 2252) \nwere agreed to.\n\n  The text of the amendments is printed in a previous edition of the \nRecord.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2238\n\n                             Tax Complexity\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I am so pleased that the Senate has \nagreed to accept my amendment on tax complexity. Mr. President, two \nweeks from now is April 15, a day known as Tax Day. On that day, \napproximately 120 million Americans will file some type of tax return \nto the Internal Revenue Service. Of these taxpayers, more than 40 \npercent will file the short tax forms known as the 1040EZ, or the 1040 \nlong form.\n  These two forms--only one page long--are designed to be simple and \neasy to complete, but Americans will pay millions of dollars to tax \npreparers to fill out these forms in their stead in order to avoid \nmaking a mistake and facing the wrath of the Internal Revenue Service.\n  The perception is that the tax code is too complicated, and frankly, \nthese Americans have good reasons to be concerned. The Balanced Budget \nAct of 1997, passed by Congress last year and hailed as providing \nsignificant tax relief to every American, added over 1 million words \nand 315 pages to the Internal Revenue Code. The capital gains \ncomputation form alone grew from 19 lines to 54. Consequently the \naverage taxpayer will spend 9 hours and 54 minutes preparing Form 1040 \nfor the 1997 tax year. The total burden on all taxpayers of maintaining \nrecords, and preparing and filing tax returns is estimated to be in \nexcess of 1,600,000 hours this year.\n  Tax relief is not just about financial relief, it is also about \npaperwork relief. This amendment states that it is the Sense of the \nSenate that this chamber give priority to tax proposals that simplify \nthe tax code and reject proposals that add greater complexity to the \ncode and increased compliance costs to the taxpayer. I think we have \nsent a sound message to the American people that we are committed to \nreducing complexity in this already onerous tax system.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2243\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this amendment expresses the Sense of \nthe Senate that Congress should fulfill the intent of the Amtrak Reform \nand Accountability Act of 1997 and appropriate sufficient funds in each \nof the next five years to enable Amtrak to implement its Strategic \nBusiness Plan.\n  In the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997, Congress \ndeclared that ``intercity rail passenger service is an essential \ncomponent of a national intermodal passenger transportation system.'' \nWith the passage of this Act, Congress and the President effectively \nagreed to provide adequate appropriations over the next five years for \nAmtrak to implement its Strategic Business Plan so that it may achieve \nthe goal of operating self-sufficiency.\n  I would like to take a moment to thank Senator Lott for his \ncooperation on this amendment and for his commitment to providing the \nfunding necessary for Amtrak to implement its Strategic Business Plan.\n  I would also like to thank Senator McCain for his cooperation and \nassistance in working out the language of this amendment.\n  Finally, I would like to thank Senators Roth, Biden and all of the \ncosponsors of this amendment for their continuing support of Amtrak.\n  I believe that for the first time in memory, we have a general \ncommitment among members of Congress to provide Amtrak with the funding \nnecessary for it to turn its financial situation around. We will \naccomplish this by providing Amtrak with the capital funds necessary to \nmodernize its equipment and facilities. For too long, Congress \nunderfunded Amtrak, leaving it with an aging and inefficient capital \nstock. By providing sufficient capital funding, we will allow Amtrak to \nincrease the efficiency of its operations and attract new passengers by \nproviding better, more reliable service.\n  Last year's $2.2 billion capital fund and the passage of the Amtrak \nReform legislation brought the dawn of a new day for our national \npassenger railroad.\n  We need Amtrak to reduce congestion on our highways and in our skies. \nCongress and the President have demonstrated clear support for Amtrak \nas a national system and for continued federal appropriations. Too \noften in the past, we under-funded this important system. Today, Amtrak \nis operating under substantial challenges to meet strict business \ngoals.\n  I believe Amtrak is up to the task and I hope and expect that we will \nprovide them the funds we have promised and give Amtrak a fighting \nchance to succeed.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my good friend, \nthe distinguished Ranking Member of the Budget Committee, Frank \nLautenberg, in introducing this amendment. We are in excellent company, \njoined by the distinguished Chairman of the Finance Committee, Bill \nRoth, the distinguished Majority Leader, and other supporters of \nAmtrak.\n  As I testified just last week before Senator Shelby's Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Transportation, Amtrak is currently under the gun--both \nthe Amtrak Reform Act we passed last year, and our current budget plans \nassume that Amtrak will be without operating subsidies beginning in \n2002.\n  Personally, I am not convinced that this is a wise course of action. \nVirtually all passenger rail systems in the world are supported by \npublic funds, because their benefits--reduced congestion on highways \nand at airports, less air pollution--are enjoyed by those who may never \nride a train. Public support does not automatically signify \ninefficiency, Mr. President; in the case of passenger rail, it is a \nrecognition that the public benefits are not fully paid for by \nindividual ticket purchases.\n  But it is even clearer, Mr. President, that passenger rail deserves \nsupport for its major capital needs. Just as the federal government \nprovides funds for highways, airports, ship channels, and ports, it has \na proper role--justified by the strictest notions of economic \nefficiency--in providing support for the basic infrastructure of our \nnational transportation system.\n  Despite the heavy burdens placed on Amtrak by years of under funding, \nAmtrak has responded with increased efficiency--and has undertaken a \nbusiness plan that aims at operating self-sufficiency by the year 2002.\n  This amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that we should live \nup to our end of the deal we entered into when we passed the Amtrak \nReform Act last year--we should, at an absolute minimum, provide Amtrak \nwith the funds necessary for them to reach 2002 with the equipment, \nroutes, and ridership that will make that self-sufficiency possible. \nThat means providing Amtrak with the funds--both long-term high-return \ncapital from its capital funds, as well as operating support--that they \nanticipate in that business plan.\n  And I must add, Mr. President, that following the recommendation of \nlast year's Presidential Emergency Board, Amtrak has agreed to provide \npay raises for its long-suffering workers. To make good on that \ncommitment, and to provide similarly for all of the workers that have \ngone for years without a pay raise--or even a contact--Amtrak will \nrequire the funding level we commit to with his amendment.\n  I am gratified that we have the support of so many of my colleagues \nfor this amendment. Today, we will put the Senate on record in support \nof funds for Amtrak that will allow them to achieve the goals that we \nhave set for them. That, Mr. President, is the least we can do.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, there has been a good deal of concern over \nwhether the budget resolution actually provides adequate funding to \nallow the Labor-HHS subcommittee to provide increased funding for the \nNational Institutes of Health as assumed in the budget.\n  After extensive conversations with the Chairman of the Budget \nCommittee\n\n[[Page S3091]]\n\n Chairman and his staff, I am confident that the recommendations \ncontained in the budget resolution would in fact allow for increased \nfunding of the National Institutes of Health.\n  In fact, the Chairman of the Budget Committee has agreed to enter \ninto a colloquy with me which explicitly states that the budget assumes \na substantial increase over the Labor-HHS subcommittee's 1998 \nappropriated levels. The chairman has assured me that this funding \nlevel assumes increases to cover shortfall created by forward funding \nin last years Labor-HHS appropriations bill. Additionally, the budget \nassumes further increases to fund a number of Congressional priorities, \nincluding increased funding for the National Institutes of Health.\n  The full content of the colloquy is contained in a written statement \nwhich I will now send to the desk and ask that it be entered into the \nRecord in its entirety.\n  Mr. President, as my colleagues will recall, during consideration of \nthe 1998 Budget Resolution, I offered an amendment to express the sense \nof the Senate that funding for the National Institutes of Health should \nbe increased by 100 percent over the next five years. It passed by a \nvote of 98-0.\n  The amendment I am offering today will help to ensure that the Senate \ncontinues to move forward toward achieving this goal. The 1999 Senate \nBudget Resolution assumes an increase of $1.5 billion for the National \nInstitutes of Health for FY 1999, an 11% increase over the FY 1998 \nfunding level.\n  I know the Chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, has \nworked very hard in a tight budget year to include this increase in the \nBudget Resolution. I want to express my sincere thanks to Chairman \nDomenici and commend him for his leadership on this initiative. He, \ntoo, has been a true friend to NIH and I know he shares our commitment \nto increased funding for biomedical research.\n  I am aware of concerns raised by patient organizations and public \nhealth advocacy organizations with respect to future increases for NIH.\n  Based upon discussions I have had with both Chairman Domenici and \nwith Chairman Stevens today, I am convinced the budget resolution will, \nin fact, lead to the increases necessary to achieve the goal of \ndoubling funding for NIH.\n  I have submitted into the Record a colloquy with Senator Domenici \nwhich addresses these concerns, and I encourage all interested parties \nto review this colloquy.\n  It is also important to remember that the Congress is at the \nbeginning of the budget process. The House of Representatives has not \nacted on the Budget Resolution. There still must be a conference with \nthe House.\n  At this time, I am convinced the Budget Committee has done its' best \nto provide the framework to increase funding for NIH by at least $1.5 \nbillion in FY 1999. And, I am hopeful that the Appropriations Committee \nwill do its best to support these recommendations.\n  For purposes of this Budget Resolution, I do believe it is important \nfor the Senate to be on record with respect to our bipartisan \ncommitment to NIH.\n  To that end, the amendment I offer today will express the Sense of \nthe Senate in three areas.\n  First, it would reaffirm our commitment to double funding for NIH \nover the next five years.\n  Second, it would express the Sense of the Senate that appropriations \nfor NIH should be increased by $2 billion in FY 1999.\n  Finally, it would express the Sense of the Senate that, at a minimum, \nappropriations for NIH should match the levels specified in the Budget \nResolution.\n  Funding for NIH has always enjoyed strong bipartisan support in the \nSenate. Today should be no exception. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment.\n\n\n               Addition of Cosponsors--Amendment No. 2243\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing Senators be added to the Amtrak sense-of-the-Senate amendment \nNo. 2243: Senators Moynihan, Jeffords, Chafee, Kerry, Moseley-Braun, \nLieberman, Durbin, Sarbanes, Mikulski, Dodd, Baucus, Leahy and \nHutchison.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2219\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we have one last thing, amendment No. \n2219, by Senator Dorgan. Would you call that up? Here we are going to \nvoice vote it. Let me make sure everybody understands, this amendment \nis supposed to fail. And there has been concurrence on that point as we \ndeliberated on this subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 2219 is before the Senate. If \nthere be no further debate, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2219) was rejected.\n\n\n                          Amendments Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all other \npending amendments be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Amendment Nos. 2186, 2194, 2215, 2223, 2227, 2231, 2241, 2242, 2245, \n2247, 2179, 2181, 2249, 2255, 2256, 2259, 2260, 2261, 2267, 2268, 2273, \nand 2274 were withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2204\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, my amendment to the Budget Resolution I hope \nwill be only the first step this Congress will take to prevent abuse \nand mistreatment of elderly and disabled patients in long-term care.\n  Mr. President, it is estimated that more than 43% of Americans over \nthe age of 65 will likely spend time in a nursing home. The number of \npeople needing long-term care service, both in nursing homes and home \nhealth care, is sharply increasing, and it will continue to do so as \nthe Baby Boom generation ages. The vast majority of long-term care \nfacilities do an excellent job in caring for their patients, but it \nonly takes a few abusive staff to cast a dark shadow over what should \nbe a healing environment.\n  A disturbing number of cases have been reported where long-term care \nworkers with criminal backgrounds have been cleared to work in direct \npatient care, and have subsequently abused patients in their care. Most \nrecently, The Wall Street Journal published a troubling article \ndescribing the extent of this problem and the difficulties we face in \ntracking known abusers. I ask that this article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See \nexhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KOHL. This article is only the tip of the iceberg. A recent \nreport from the Nation's long-term care Ombudsmen indicates that in 29 \nstates surveyed, 7,043 cases of abuse, gross neglect, or exploitation \noccurred in nursing homes and board and care facilities. Similar \nstories have appeared nationwide and abuse is not limited to nursing \nhomes. It is far too easy for a health care worker with a criminal or \nabusive background to gain employment and prey on the most vulnerable \npatients.\n  Why is this the case? Because current state and national safeguards \nare inadequate to screen out abusive workers. All States are required \nto maintain nurse aide registries which include information about \nabusive workers. But these registries are not comprehensive or \ncomplete. First, many facilities do not report abuse complaints and \ninstead, simply fire the worker. Second, these registries usually do \nnot include abuse information about home health or hospice aides. \nFinally, and most important, there is no national system in place to \ntrack abusers, little information sharing between States, and no \nFederal requirement that a criminal background check be done on \npotential employees. A known abuser or someone with a violent criminal \nbackground in Iowa would have little trouble moving to Wisconsin and \ncontinuing to work with patients there.\n  I have introduced and continue to work on legislation that would \ncreate a national registry of abusive long-term care workers and \nrequire criminal background checks for prospective employees who \nparticipate in Medicare and Medicaid. Although this will not prevent \nall cases of abuse, I believe it will go a long way toward making sure \nthat those who have a history of preying on the vulnerable are not paid \nto do so by Medicare and Medicaid.\n  This Budget Resolution includes a lot of different priorities and \nfunding recommendations--some of which I agree with, and others that I \nbelieve deserve\n\n[[Page S3092]]\n\nmore attention. But as we consider this Budget Resolution, we must not \nforget to protect our nation's most vulnerable citizens--the elderly \nand the disabled.\n  This amendment expresses our desire to establish a viable, efficient, \nand cost-effective national system that will screen out abusive workers \nand prevent them from working with patients. We should adopt this \namendment to devote resources toward developing such a system. We \nshould adopt this amendment to send a clear signal to potential abusers \nthat we will not tolerate the mistreatment of our patients. And we \nshould adopt this amendment to demonstrate our commitment to protecting \nthe elderly and the disabled from known abusers and criminals. When a \npatient checks into a nursing home facility or receives home health \nservices, they should not have to give up their right to be free of \nabuse, neglect, or mistreatment.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                     [From the Wall Street Journal]\n\n              Many Elders Receive Care at Criminals' Hands\n\n                           (By Michael Moss)\n\n       When Carletos Bell applied to work at the San Antonio \n     Convalescent Center, he didn't try to hide his violent \n     criminal past. He disclosed his record of aggravated assault \n     right on his application for nurse-assistant.\n       He got the job anyway, in June 1996. Six months later, Mr. \n     Bell was charged with sexually assaulting a 71-year-old \n     resident of the nursing home. He pleaded not-guilty and is \n     now in jail awaiting trial.\n       The case illustrates a growing problem for nursing-home \n     patients and owners alike: People with serious rap sheets are \n     landing jobs as care givers for the elderly.\n       On Monday, a local trial judge in Denver gave a green light \n     to the first-ever class-action lawsuit alleging nursing-home \n     negligence. A pivotal claim is that many nurse-assistants had \n     arrest records. A local attorney for the facility's former \n     owner, GranCare Inc., denies the allegation of negligence.\n       Even before that ruling, crime against residents of nursing \n     homes has been a growing concern among patient advocates. \n     Efforts to draw attention to the problem have been stymied \n     partly by the lack of good data. Advocates say there is \n     severe underreporting of crimes--especially of rapes--because \n     residents often fear retribution for leveling complaints.\n       Still, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' \n     Office of Inspector General took disciplinary actions mostly \n     related to nursing-home abuse in 382 cases in 1997, more than \n     double a year earlier. The office received 1,613 reports of \n     abuse allegations in that year, up 14% over a three-year \n     period.\n       Lesser crimes abound as well. Four percent of nursing-home \n     workers acknowledged they stole money, jewelry and other \n     items from residents, in questionnaires completed as part of \n     a soon-to-be-published study by Diana Harris, a sociologist \n     at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Ten percent of \n     workers said they saw other staff steal.\n       Nursing-home owners, in turn, are finding themselves at \n     greater risk in lawsuits brought by injured residents. In \n     some facilities, plaintiffs' attorneys are discovering that a \n     large portion of the staff has a criminal past. At another \n     San Antonio nursing home, the Crestway Care Center, where in \n     1995 two female residents said they were raped, half of the \n     69 male workers had arrest records and nearly one-quarter had \n     felony convictions, according to pretrial fact-finding in a \n     negligence lawsuit the women brought against the nursing \n     home. The facility's owner at the time couldn't be reached. \n     His attorney declined to comment. The suit was settled last \n     year.\n       The plaintiffs' criminologist, Patricia Harris, noted in \n     court papers, ``A setting which contains infirmed females who \n     are unable to defend themselves creates an enhanced \n     opportunity for sexual assaults.''\n       When trouble strikes, the involvement of a single employee \n     with a felony record can send jury awards soaring. Last year, \n     the owner of the nursing home where Mr. Bell worked, Living \n     Centers of America, quickly settled a lawsuit brought by the \n     resident whom Mr. Bell allegedly assaulted. Since then, \n     investor group Apollo Management LP, headed by financier Leon \n     Black, has acquired control of Living Centers and merged it \n     with GranCare to form Paragon Health Networks Inc., of \n     Atlanta.\n       ``Until there is some public awareness, the problem of \n     nursing homes employing criminal and sexual deviants is going \n     to escalate,'' says the resident's attorney, Marynell \n     Maloney, who also brought the other San Antonio case.\n       Living Centers' local attorney, Charles Deacon, says the \n     job interviewer at the facility made a mistake in hiring Mr. \n     Bell. Given Mr. Bell's record, says Mr. Deacon, ``there is no \n     way the company would ever have wanted him.''\n       Employees with criminal records pose an industry-wide \n     problem, says Mr. Deacon, who represents other nursing-home \n     owners. ``They end up costing these companies a lot of \n     money.''\n       A Boston jury last month sent a message to a home health-\n     care provider by awarding $26.5 million to the estate of John \n     Ward, who was beaten and stabbed to death in 1991, along with \n     his grandmother. The perpetrator was a six-time convicted \n     felon who was hired by an agency to care for Mr. Ward, age \n     32, at their home.\n       Rachel Schneider, acting co-president of the Visiting Nurse \n     Association of Greater Boston, which settled the lawsuit \n     after the jury's verdict, says the killings were ``one of \n     those very unfortunate lessons.'' The agency began checking \n     its workers for criminal records starting in 1994, she said.\n       Nursing-home owners, patient advocates and labor unions \n     agree that an important step in combating nursing-home crime \n     is to keep criminals from getting the jobs. Bills introduced \n     in both houses of Congress would require Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation background checks of would-be nurses' aides and \n     other care givers.\n       A group of nursing-home owners, the American Health Care \n     Association, says it supports the concept and favors imposing \n     background-checks on care givers at hospitals and other \n     providers, too. Patient advocates say there's no reason to \n     limit the checks to nurses' aides. ``We think everybody--\n     doctors, nurses, everyone--should be checked,'' says Elma \n     Holder, founding director of the National Citizens' Coalition \n     for Nursing Home Reform.\n       A growing number of states already have legislation \n     mandating background checks, with mixed results. Illinois's \n     two-year-old program for screening nurses' aides has turned \n     up disqualifying criminal backgrounds on about 5% of the \n     people who were checked. Their crimes ranged from theft to \n     homicide. But nearly 90% of those who asked that the law be \n     waived were permitted to take or keep jobs anyway.\n       ``The law is a farce,'' says Violette King of Nursing Home \n     Monitors, a local patient-advocacy group based in Godfrey, \n     Ill. The state Department of Public Health responds by saying \n     it weighs each waiver request carefully.\n       Spokesman Thomas Schafer cites the case of a man who \n     murdered his girlfriend 24 years ago. He had been working in \n     a nursing home without problems for 15 years when the new \n     background-check program turned up his record. The state \n     decided he wouldn't be a risk to the residents.\n       One thorny question is whether mere arrests should carry as \n     much weight as convictions. In Colorado, it has become a \n     point of contention in the Denver class-action suit. Of the \n     176 aides hired by Cedars Health Care Center in 1995 and \n     1996, 74 of them, or 42%, had arrest records, the plaintiffs' \n     attorney has alleged.\n       ``Most of these records reflect serious, and sometimes \n     habitual, criminal behavior,'' alleges the complaint filed by \n     Denver attorney Lynn Feiger, an employment-law specialist, on \n     behalf of five current and former Cedars residents. More than \n     200 can join the suit, thanks to this week's ruling.\n       The nursing-home owner's attorney, Jerome Reinan, who is \n     weighing an appeal of the class-action decision, argues that \n     the threshold should be convictions. ``We're not aware at \n     this point of any convictions that would made an employee \n     ineligible for hiring,'' says Mr. Reinan.\n       State officials in Colorado say they are considering a \n     number of ways to strengthen rules for screening nursing-home \n     employees, including extending checks to probation reports \n     and arrest records.\n       ``An arrest record is certainly indicative of a pattern,'' \n     says state Department of Public Health spokeswoman Jackie \n     Starr-Bocian. ``We have had a concern here in Colorado for \n     many years about issues of employment in nursing homes. Now \n     it's a very grave concern because our unemployment rates are \n     so low it's hard to find qualified applicants.''\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2240\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I believe that the Senate has taken a step in the \nright direction today by accepting my amendment that ensures that the \nSenate will not reduce the value of Social Security. Mr. President, \nSocial Security is perhaps the most successful and important government \nprogram ever enacted in the United States. It has allowed millions of \nAmericans to retire with dignity and has played a key role in bringing \npoverty among the elderly to the lowest level since the government \nbegan keeping poverty statistics.\n  But if you ask young adults--the twenty-something and thirty-\nsomething Americans--whether they believe Social Security will be there \nfor them, they will tell you that they are more likely to see a UFO \nthan receive Social Security benefits when they are old.\n  That's regrettable, Mr. President, not just because these young \nAmericans are financing the benefits that my generation will receive \nfrom Social Security, but also because they have every right to benefit \nfrom Social Security when they reach their twilight years. Social \nSecurity was created not just for the current generation, or for our \ngeneration, but for all the generations that will follow.\n  The Senate, I think, has a responsibility to restore the faith of \nyoung Americans in their Social Security. In a recent poll, fewer than \none-third of Americans age 55 and older expressed a\n\n[[Page S3093]]\n\nlack of confidence in the ability of the Social Security system to meet \nits long-term commitments. For those under age 55, however, nearly two-\nthirds expressed that view.\n  Frankly, young Americans have good reason to be worried. Americans \nare living longer and retiring earlier. As a result, retirees will \ncollect Social Security benefits for a far longer time than was \nanticipated when the system was developed. That means that younger \nAmericans may be paying into a system that will no longer provide \nbenefits when it is time for them to retire.\n  The impact of these trends will be greatly magnified when the Baby \nBoom generation retires. Once the Boomers have retired, there will only \nbe about tow working Americans contributing to Social Security for \nevery retiree receiving benefits, down from over five just a generation \nago.\n  Social Security is too important to the retirement security of too \nmany people for us to retreat from that accomplishment. More than one-\nhalf of the elderly do not receive private pensions and more than one-\nthird have no income from assets. For 60 percent of all senior \ncitizens, Social Security benefits provide almost 80 percent of their \nretirement income. For 80 percent of all senior citizens, Social \nSecurity benefits provide over 50 percent of their retirement income.\n  It is our responsibility to act to ensure that the Social Security \nsystem provides the same value to new generations of Americans as it \ndid to past recipients. It is my hope that in having passed this \namendment, we will have demonstrated to younger Americans that we are \ncommitted to safeguarding the integrity of the Social Security system \nno only for their generation, but for all the ones that will follow.\n  I also want to say how pleased I am that the amendment I proposed \nthat would express the Senate's sentiment that the Administration \nshould include in its yearly budget a generational impact study will \nalso be included in the budget resolution. I believe that this type of \ninformation will be useful in our decision making process and will lead \nus in a direction that is proactive, rather than reactive.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for their support.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2263\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I would like to begin by acknowledging \nSenator Santorum's efforts on this amendment. I look forward to working \nwith him in the future to preserve our nation's most vulnerable \nfarmland.\n  We have heard a lot during the last decade about the dissolution and \ndestruction of the American Family Farm. Indeed, the family farm is \nunder serious threat of extinction. Today, there are 1,925,300 farms in \nthe United States, the lowest number of farms in our nation since \nbefore the Civil War. The U.S. is losing two acres of our best farmland \nto development every minute of every day. In my state, New Jersey, we \nhave lost 6,000 farms, or 40% of our total, since 1959. This reduction \nhas serious implications for the environment, the economy and our food \nsupply.\n  The threat comes partially from an anachronistic and unfair \ninheritance tax that threatens the generational continuity of the \nfamily farm, and partially from the fact that much of America's \nfarmland is near major cities. As our cities sprawl into neighboring \nrural areas, our farms are in danger of becoming subdivisions or \nshopping malls.\n  Last year I strongly supported a significant reduction in the estate \ntax to keep farms in the family, preserve open space and ensure \nfairness in our tax code. This was an important victory for farmers \nacross the nation. However, we also need programs like the Farmland \nProtection Program to reinforce this effort. That is why I am \nsupporting Senator Santorum's amendment which will express the Sense of \nthe Senate that Congress should reauthorize funds for the Farmland \nProtection Program. This critical program is designed to protect soil \nby encouraging landowners to limit conversion of their farmland to \nnonagricultural uses.\n  The Farmland Protection Program was authorized by the 1996 Farm Bill \nand provided $35 million over a six year period. However, the last of \nthe funding was dispersed in FY1998 and there is no money in the budget \nfor the program this year. This amendment will send a strong message \nthat we remain committed to protecting our family farms and preserving \nour open spaces. I am proud to support Senator Santorum's amendment, \nand look forward to its acceptance by my colleagues.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2266\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, of all the priorities included in the \nBudget Resolution now before the Senate, I believe that none is more \nimportant than continuing our fight against violent crime and violence \nagainst women.\n  To a great extent, this Budget Resolution meets this test--but, in at \nleast one area of this crime front, I believe the Budget Resolution \nmust be clarified.\n  The amendment does exactly that--by clarifying that it is the sense \nof the Senate that the Violent Crime Control Trust Fund will continue \nthrough fiscal year 2002.\n  First, let me point out that it is Senator Byrd who, more than \nanyone, deserves credit for the crime law trust fund. Senator Byrd \nworked to develop an idea that was simple as it was profound--as he \ncalled on us to use the savings from the reductions in the federal \nworkforce of 272,000 employees to fund one of the nation's most urgent \npriorities: fighting the scourge of violent crime.\n  Senator Gramm was also one of the very first to call on the Senate to \n``put our money where our mouth was.'' Too often, this Senate has voted \nto send significant aid to state and local law enforcement--but, when \nit came time to ``write the check,'' we did not fund nearly the dollars \nwe promised.\n  Working together in 1993, Senator Byrd, myself, Senator Gramm, \nSenator Domenici and other Senators passed the Violent Crime Control \nTrust Fund in the Senate. And, in 1994, it became law in the Biden \nCrime Law.\n  Since then, the dollars from the Crime Law Trust Fund have: Helped \nadd nearly 70,000 community police officers to our streets; helped \nshelter more than 80,000 battered women and their children; focussed \nlaw enforcement, prosecutors and victims service providers on providing \nimmediate help to women victimized by someone who pretends to ``love'' \nthem; forced tens of thousands of drug offenders into drug testing and \ntreatment programs, instead of continuing to allow them to remain free \non probation with no supervision and no accountability; constructed \nthousands of prison cells for violent criminals; and brought \nunprecedented resources to defending our southwest border--putting us \non the path to literally double the number of federal border agents \nover just a 5 year period.\n  The results of this effort are already taking hold--according to the \nFBI's national crime statistics, violent crime is down and down \nsignificantly--leaving our nation with its lowest murder rate since \n1971. And the lowest murder rate for wives, ex-wives and girlfriends at \nthe hands of their ``intimates'' to an 18-year low.\n  In short, we have proven able to do what few thought possible--by \nbeing smart, keeping our focus, and putting our ``money where our \nmouths'' are--we have actually cut violent crime.\n  Today, our challenge is to keep our focus and to stay vigilant \nagainst violent crime. Today, the Biden-Gramm amendment before the \nSenate offers one modest step towards meeting that challenge--By \nconfirming the Senate's commitment to fighting crime and violence \nagainst women will continue to at least 2002. By confirming the \nSenate's commitment that the Violent Crime Control Trust Fund will \ncontinue--in its current form which provides additional federal \nassistance without adding 1 cent to the deficit--to at least 2002.\n  The Biden-Gramm amendment offers a few very simple choices: Stand up \nfor cops--or don't; stand up for the fight against violence against \nwomen --or don't; stand up for fighting the scourge of youth violence--\nor don't; stand up for building new prisons--or don't; stand up for \nincreased border enforcement--or don't.\n  Every member of this Senate is against violent crime. Now, I urge all \nmy colleagues to back up with words with the only thing that we can \nactually do for the cop walking the beat, the battered woman, the \nvictim of crime--provide the dollars that help give them the tools to \nfight violent criminals and help restore at least some small piece of \nthe dignity taken from them by a violent criminal.\n\n[[Page S3094]]\n\n  Let us be very clear of the stakes here--frankly, if we do not \ncontinue the Trust Fund, we will not be able to continue such proven, \nvaluable efforts as the Violence Against Women law. Nothing we can do \ntoday can guarantee that we, in fact, will continue the Violence \nAgainst Women Act when the law expires in the year 2000.\n  But, mark my words, if the Trust Fund ends, the efforts to provide \nshelter, help victims and get tough on the abusers and batterers will \nwither on the vine. Passing the amendment I offer today will send a \nclear, unambiguous message that the trust fund should continue and with \nit, the historic effort undertaken by the violence against women act \nthat says by word, deed and dollar that the Federal Government stands \nwith women and against the misguided notion that ``domestic'' violence \nis a man's ``right'' and ``not really a crime.''\n\n\n                 statement on the market access program\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Market \nAccess Program. This program continues to be a vital and important part \nof U.S. trade policy aimed at maintaining and expanding U.S. \nagricultural exports, countering subsidized foreign competition, \nstrengthening farm income and protecting American jobs.\n  The Market Access Program has been a tremendous success by any \nmeasure. Since the program was established, U.S. agricultural exports \nhave doubled. In Fiscal Year 1997, U.S. agricultural exports amounted \nto $57.3 billion, resulting in a positive agricultural trade surplus of \napproximately $22 billion and contributing billions of dollars more in \nincreased economic activity and additional tax revenues.\n  For example, the Idaho State Department of Agriculture received \n$125,000 of Market Access Program funds during the past year. These \nfunds were used to promote Idaho and Western United States agricultural \nproducts in the international markets of China, Taiwan, Brazil, Mexico, \nGuatemala, and Costa Rica. One particular activity, the promotion of \nwestern U.S. onions in Central America, required $15,000 of MAP funds \nand generated inquiries for onions valued at $150,000.\n  Demand for U.S. agricultural products is growing 4 times greater in \ninternational markets than domestic markets. MAP has been an enormously \nsuccessful program by any measure in supporting this growth. Since the \nprogram began in 1985, U.S. agricultural exports have more than \ndoubled--reaching a record of nearly $60 billion in 1996; contributing \nto a record agricultural trade surplus of $30 million; and providing \njobs to over 1 million Americans.\n  MAP is a key element in the 1996 Farm Bill, which gradually reduces \ndirect income support over 7 years. Accordingly, farm income is now \nmore dependent than ever on exports and maintaining access to foreign \nmarkets.\n  Two years ago, European Union (EU) export subsidies amounted to \napproximately $10 billion in US dollars. The EU and other foreign \ncompetitors also spent nearly $500 million on market promotion. The EU \nspends more on wine promotion than the US spends for all its \ncommodities combined.\n  Mr. President, the Market Access Program should be fully maintained \nas authorized and aggressively utilized by the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture to encourage U.S. agricultural exports, strengthen farm \nincome, counter subsidized foreign competition and protect American \njobs.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of amendment No. 2268 to \nS. Con. Res. 86 introduced by Senator kempthorne, expressing the Sense \nof the Senate that funding for the Market Access Program (MAP) should \nbe fully maintained as authorized and aggressively utilized by the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture to encourage U.S. agricultural exports, \nstrengthen farm income, counter subsidized foreign competition, and \nprotect American jobs.\n  The MAP is an important trade promoting program that truly benefits \nthe diverse agriculture of Washington state and the nation. The MAP is \na partnership with private agriculture to promote U.S. agricultural \ngoods around the world. It helps to level the playing field for our \ngrowers in a global marketplace made increasingly competitive by \nsubsidies foreign governments provide to their growers.\n  This Sense of the Senate resolution corrects the misguided direction \nof the Budget Committee to cut the MAP. This proposed cut was one among \nmany reasons that I voted against this Budget Resolution when it was \npassed out of the Budget Committee.\n  Since moving towards market-based agricultural programs under the \n1996 FAIR Act, research and trade have become the new safety net for \nour growers. Without continuous and vigorous trade promotion, our \ngrowers will see market share decline and farmgate prices drop. Our \ngrowers are already suffering under depressed prices, they need us to \nmaintain the MAP and other agricultural trade initiatives to remain \ncompetitive. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I strongly support the Market Access \nProgram. I urge my colleagues to support the sense of the Senate \namendment, offered by my colleague Senator Kempthorne, to assure \nfunding for this very important and effective agricultural export \nprogram. I would like to point out to the Senate why this Market Access \nProgram (MAP) is so important for agriculture in my State of \nCalifornia, and many other states as well.\n  Using the MAPs $90 million annual funding level as a fractional \noffset for the now $214 billion transportation package, has an enormous \nnegative impact on American agricultural export efforts at the very \ntime when our farmers are contending with constricted markets in Asia \nand increased EU help for competing agricultural exporters seeking to \ndisplace American products in the marketplace.\n  My objection is not against transportation needs but the termination \nof an important agricultural export tool.\n  The purpose of the MAP is to increase U.S. agricultural project \nexports. This increase in such exports helps to create and protect U.S. \njobs, combat unfair trade practices, improve the U.S. trade balance, \nand improve farm income.\n  The MAP is an important tool in expanding markets for U.S. \nagricultural products. Continued funding for this program is an \nimportant step in redirecting farm spending away from price supports \nand toward expanding markets.\n  The MAP program has been significantly reformed over the last several \nyears to meet congressional expectations--now only small business, \nfarmer cooperatives and associations and state departments of \nagriculture can participate in the program. The funding level has been \nsubstantially reduced to a third of its former cost. It is a cost share \nprogram, requiring participants to provide matching funds to qualify \nfor federal funding help.\n  And MAP works. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that each \ndollar of MAP money results in an increase in agricultural product \nexports of between $2 and $7. The program has provided much needed \nassistance to commodity groups comprised of small farmers who would be \nunable to break into these markets on their own.\n  Mr. President, the Market Access Program has been an unqualified \nsuccess for California farmers. For many California crops, the MAP has \nprovided the crucial boost to help them overcome unfair foreign \nsubsidies. I would like to share two of the successes of this program \nin California.\n  California produces about 85% of the U.S. avocado crop on over 6,000 \nfarms that average less than 8 acres per farm. Between 1985 and 1993, \nCalifornia avocado growers utilized $2.5 million of their own money, \ncombined with $3.4 million of MAP funds to achieve over $58 million in \navocado sales in Europe and the Pacific Rim. This is better than a 17 \nto 1 return on our MAP investment that means jobs for Californians.\n  The growth of California walnuts exports also illustrates the success \nof this program. Since 1985, the year before the MAP began helping \nwalnuts, 90% of the growth in California walnut sales has come from \nexports. And 90% of this export growth has been to markets where \nCalifornia walnuts have had MAP support. The total value of these \nexports in 1985 totaled $36 million. The total export value has now \ngrown to $119 million.\n  We should not unilaterally disarm our export promotion program for \nagriculture when we are only months away from the commencement of WTO \nagricultural trade negotiations scheduled to commence in 1999.\n\n[[Page S3095]]\n\n  Mr. President, the MAP is a wise investment in American agriculture \nand I urge my colleagues to support Senator Kempthorne's amendment to \nsupport needed funding to USDA's Market Access Program in the Budget \nResolution.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I support the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Idaho, Mr. Kempthorne, expressing the Sense of the Senate that \nfunding for the Market Access Program should be fully maintained.\n  The Senate has on several occasions debated funding for the Market \nAccess Program. Most recently, on July 23, 1997, the Senate voted 59-40 \nin favor of tabling an amendment to reduce the Market Access Program \nfrom $90 million to $70 million. The Senate, recognizing the importance \nof this program, firmly rejected the suggestion to reduce it by even \n$20 million. I hope the Senate will, by an even greater margin, express \nits support that the budget should not assume the reduction of this \nprogram.\n  The Market Access Program is one of the few tools that the Department \nof Agriculture has to combat the unfair trading practices of other \ncountries. Since its inception in 1985, the Market Access Program and \nits predecessors, the Targeted Export Assistance Program and the Market \nPromotion Program, have assisted nearly 800 U.S. cooperatives, trade \nassociations and corporations in promoting their products overseas.\n  Our agricultural exports have more than doubled--from $26.3 billion \nin 1985 to a forecast level of $58.5 billion in 1998. In large measure \nthis moderate increase, even in the face of the Asian currency crisis, \nsignifies the results of efforts we have made since the mid-1980's to \nenhance our export competitiveness and develop new markets overseas.\n  In fact, it is remarkable that the value of U.S. exports will \nincrease slightly over last year and are only slightly below record \n1996 levels even with the dire situation in Asian markets. U.S. farmers \nare particularly vulnerable to the instability of key Asian markets \nwhich account for 40 percent of our exports. The Market Access Program \nand other export programs are crucial to our farmer's ability to \ncompete in a global marketplace.\n\n\n         National Parks and Environmental Improvement Act Fund\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to reaffirm a commitment made \nby the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, to \nestablish a National Parks and Environmental Improvement Fund in the \nFY'99 Budget Resolution. My colleague, Senator Stevens, and I reached \nan agreement last year with the Budget Committee Chairman to designate \nthis fund from the interest derived from an $800 million land \nsettlement for the protection and enhancement of our national parks.\n  The fund will become a reality upon enactment of this year's budget \nresolution. I believe the reasons for creation of this fund could not \nbe more compelling when directed toward the protection of our most \ncoveted natural areas. The General Accounting Office found that while \nthe park system and park visitation are growing, the financial \nresources available to protect and maintain our parks continue to fall \nshort of the need. The estimated unmet capital needs has reached nearly \n$8 billion. In times of budgetary constraint, the interest from the \nfund, which could reach $50 million annually, will allow the Federal \ngovernment to pay for much needed capital improvements within our \nNational Parks and begin to address the multi-billion dollar backlog in \nrepairs and maintenance. Beginning in FY'99, the interest targeted to \nthe fund will allocate 40 percent to national parks, 40 percent for \nstate grants and 20 percent for marine research.\n  Mr. President, our National Park System is our natural and historical \nheritage, set aside for the benefit of present and future generations. \nThe National Parks and Environmental Improvement Fund will help us to \nfulfill our stewardship responsibilities and protect the integrity of \nour natural environment.\n  I applaud the leadership of my distinguished colleague, Senator \nDomenici, for including the fund as part of this year's budget \nresolution.\n  Mr. MACK. Senator Domenici, I understand that an assumption in this \nBudget Resolution considers that receipts from the sale of the surplus \npublic lands could be used to fund recovery efforts on private land for \nendangered species. I would like to clarify that this would in no way \nalter the current arrangement with the Everglades Recovery Program \nwhich is also funded by land sales.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct, the surplus public land sales assumed \nin the resolution are restricted to excess Bureau of Land Management \nlands, and would not in any way slow progress with recovery of the \nEverglades. The lands proposed in the resolution would be lands that \nhave not been designated for another purpose.\n  Mr. MACK. I thank the Senator for that clarification.\n\n\n       federal expenditures to increase u.s. energy independence\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the committee report accompanying the \nbudget resolution includes a brief discussion of the Administration's \nso-called Climate Change Technology Initiative (CCTI) request for \nfiscal year 1999 and subsequent fiscal years. Specifically, the \ncommittee report states on page 22 that, ``[s]ince the President has \nnot submitted a treaty or plan to implement the reductions called for \nin the agreement [Kyoto Protocol], providing additional funding for \nthese technology programs in the 1999 budget is premature.'' The \ncommittee report goes on to state that, ``[a]s a result, the resolution \nassumes last year's levels of $730 million for these technology \nprograms and does not provide the increases requested by the \nPresident.''\n  I am trying to understand the implication here. Setting aside the \nmerit of the Administration's CCTI request, voluntary domestic \nactivities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including tax incentives \nand research funding for energy efficient technology and renewables, \nare consistent with the existing 1992 Rio Climate Treaty that the \nUnited States has already ratified. While some use economic arguments \nto oppose any form of government subsidy, prudent investment along \nthese lines does not constitute regulation and is in no way a form of \nKyoto Protocol implementation.\n  Therefore, I ask my friend and colleague from New Mexico, Senator \nDomenici, if he and other members of the Budget Committee are arguing \nin the committee report that we cannot take steps to try to increase \nenergy efficiency and advance renewables unless and until the Senate \nprovides its consent to the Kyoto Protocol?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am not making such an argument. If I \nand other members of the Budget Committee believed that, we would have \neliminated all current funding for energy efficiency and renewables \ntechnology programs in this budget resolution. I do have some concerns \nabout the efficacy of the Kyoto Protocol, but the report language that \nyou cited is intended to convey that additional funding for these \nprograms is very difficult under existing budget limitations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I welcome the Chairman's remarks. Promotion of energy \nefficiency and renewable energy programs can increase our energy \nsecurity, address a variety of air pollution problems and lead to a \nstronger economy. I am pleased to learn that the Budget Resolution \naccommodates federal initiatives to enhance energy security and \nrenewable energy provided that these initiatives can be funded within \noverall budget constraints.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee for clarifying the report language. I yield the floor.\n\n\n          funding for the national institutes of health (NIH).\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President one of my top priorities since coming to \nCongress has been support of programs to eradicate the effects of \ncancer and other diseases that affect the people of the United States. \nI know many here in the Senate share my concerns who have joined me in \nseeking to increase funding substantially for the National Institutes \nof Health (NIH). Indeed, the goal of this group as stated last year is \nto double funding for NIH over 5 years.\n  I am pleased that the Budget Resolution takes a substantial step \ntoward meeting this goal and thank the Chairman of the Committee, \nSenator Domenici, for recommending a funding increase of $1.5 billion \nin FY1999 and $15.5 billion through 2003.\n\n[[Page S3096]]\n\n  However, I would mention to the Chair that there has been much \nconcern expressed by many public health advocacy groups that the Budget \nResolution levels for the Appropriations' Subcommittee on Labor, Health \nand Human Services, and Education will not support this increase. \nAccordingly, I would ask the floor manager to alleviate these concerns \nby answering a few simple questions for me.\n  Has the Budget Committee assumed sufficient funds in their budget \nrecommendation to allow the Labor-HHS subcommittee to match its 302(b) \nallocation from last year?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. First, I would like to state for the record that 302(b) \nallocations for the Committee on Appropriations are solely within the \npurview of that committee. The Budget Resolution is an expression of \nthe Senate's priorities, and as such, makes recommendations to \ncommittees. However, the Budget Resolution assumptions do not bind the \nAppropriations Committee to any particular course of action, other than \nmeeting the discretionary caps.\n  That being understood, the Budget Resolution assumes a substantial \nincrease over the Freeze Baseline for the Labor-HHS subcommittee. The \nFreeze Baseline levels are based on FY 1998 appropriations action.\n  Mr. MACK. Does this assumed funding level also provide additional \nincreases for shortfalls created due to forward funding in last year's \nLabor-HHS bill?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Freeze Baseline already includes spending \npreviously approved by the subcommittee, including forward funding and \nadvance appropriations.\n  Mr. MACK. Finally, does the assumed level also provide increases to \nmatch the Budget Committee's recommendation for increased NIH funding?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The assumed increase exceeds the $1.5 billion increase \nfor NIH in FY 1999 and is intended to fund other initiatives as well, \nsuch as IDEA.\n  Mr. MACK. I thank the Chairman of the Budget Committee. I believe he \nhas been more than generous to the Labor, HHS Subcommittee and I hope \nthat the Appropriations Committee will treat the subcommittee equally \nwell.\n  To help that process, I sent to the desk a Sense of the Senate \namendment, which provides that the Senate should provide such funds to \nmatch the recommendations for increased NIH funding as set forth in the \nBudget Resolution.\n\n\n                         market access program\n\n  Mr. GORTON. I am concerned about one program which has been slated as \nan offset for transportation increases--the Market Access Program. The \nMarket Access Program is a USDA cost-share program which provides \nassistance to U.S. agriculture when competing against subsidized \nnations overseas.\n  In the State of Washington we have seen a dramatic increase in apple \nexports from 4.5 million boxes to over 25.1 million--an increase of \nover 500 percent. Export sales now total well over $300 million. This \nsuccess is due, in part, to the Market Access Program. MAP is \nabsolutely essential if U.S. agriculture is to remain viable and \ncompetitive in the international marketplace.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I fully understand your concern, and the agriculture \ncommunity's concern, about the current position of MAP in the Budget \nResolution. During the Conference on the Budget Resolution we will have \nan opportunity to take another look at this issue. In that event, I \nwill commit to working with you to find alternatives. I want to assure \nyou, the Committee went to great lengths to identify offsets for \nhighway spending. As you know, we included MAP because it is one of \nseveral export programs through USDA.\n  Mr. GORTON. Thank you for your commitment to this effort. I look \nforward to working with you during the Conference Committee to see that \nthis issue is resolved in a favorable manner.\n\n\n                                sec fees\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I rise today to discuss efforts that were made to insert \nassumptions into the Budget Resolution that would hurt the Commerce, \nJustice, State, and Judiciary (CJS) Subcommittee. Those assumptions \nsought to amend the securities legislation that we negotiated with the \nSenate Banking Committee and House Commerce Committee in 1996. \nSpecifically, they assume reductions in NASDAQ transaction fees. The \nresult being that the Appropriations Committee pick up the cost of $73 \nmillion.\n  Prior to 1996, the 6(b) fees were paid by corporations to register \nsecurities. Some interests felt that the 6(b) fees had grown too large. \nDuring negotiations with the White House and the authorizing committees \nit was agreed that over the next ten years 6(b) fees would be reduced. \nThe creation of the NASDAQ transaction fees was a concession made to \nthe CJS subcommittee as part of a larger compromise that led to a \nphasing out of the Section 6(b) registration fees. The intent was to \nminimize the impact on the Appropriations process.\n  Since 1934, Section 31 transaction fees had been imposed on exchange \nlisted securities but not on those sold in the Over the Counter (OTC) \nmarket. As part of the agreement in 1996, extending the section 31 fee \nto the OTC market allowed the 6(b) registration fees to be reduced \nwhile retaining adequate fee collections to support and offset the \nSEC's appropriation.\n  In arriving at the compromise that resulted in the ten year funding \nmechanism, it was acknowledged that surpluses over the SEC's funding \nwould likely exist until the end of the ten year schedule. After that \ntime the SEC was to be fully funded by direct appropriations.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator from New Hampshire should know that we do \nnot have any assumptions in the Budget Resolution, before the Senate, \nthat in any way changes or reduces the fees collected by the SEC.\n  Mr. GREGG. I want to thank the Senator from New Mexico for his effort \non this important issue. We must preserve our ability to fund the SEC \nin the future, when we may not be so fortunate to have such a good \neconomy.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, earlier today I supported an amendment \noffered by my distinguished colleague from West Virginia, Senator \nRockefeller. Senator Rockefeller's amendment to the Budget Resolution \nwould have restored $10.5 billion to the Veterans' Affairs Subommittee, \noffsetting that restoration by reducing funds allocated to the \nTransportation Subcommittee.\n  As we all know, the Senate ISTEA bill, now awaiting conference \ndeliberations with the House, authorized approximately $217 billion for \ntransportation over 6 years--about $171 billion for highways, about $41 \nbillion for transit and about $2 billion for safety. These levels \nrepresent a 38 percent increase for transportation over the previous \nISTEA bill. Under the Budget Resolution considered today, a significant \nportion of this increase is financed by a $10.5 billion reduction in \nfunds set aside to pay for smoking related illnesses among veterans.\n  Mr. President, I believe we need to do more for infrastructure \ndevelopment--our investment in roads, bridges and transit must increase \nif we hope to maintain our quality of life while keeping up with the \ndemands of the economy and the changing nature of our cities and towns. \nThat said, veterans should not have to pay for that investment. It's \nnot right, and perhaps more importantly, it's not necessary.\n  The ISTEA bill vastly increased transportation funds and took some \nbig steps to improve the longstanding equity problem between those \nstates that contribute more in gas tax revenues than they receive and \nthose states that receive more than they contribute. However, while \nimproving the donor state problem to some extent, the bill also \nprovided generous increases in funding to many donee states. I would \nargue that we were too generous to those states. It was unacceptable to \nme that despite a 38 percent increase in the amount of funds made \navailable for transportation, the ISTEA bill continued to have donor \nstates give significantly more than they get back, and donee states get \nsignificantly more than they give. We could've done better. And if we \nhad provided less of an increase to donee states, we could have avoided \nthe need for controversial offsets, such as the reduction in veterans \nbenefits that Senator Rockefeller sought to restore. We all know that \nsometimes fairness is painful to swallow, and it seemed to me that in \nthe highway bill, we simply gave everyone more in order not to inflict \npain on some. Today we voted on whether veterans should feel that pain. \nBut why\n\n[[Page S3097]]\n\nshould we limit programs for our veterans in order to be even more \ngenerous to those who are already in an advantageous position under \ntransportation formulas? Simply put, we should not. A more responsible \ncourse of action would have been to distribute highway dollars more \nfairly, limiting the increase overall by limiting the increase to \nstates that were already getting more than their fair share.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am proud to be on the floor today as we \ndiscuss a budget that is balanced and does have a planned surplus for \nas far as the eye can see. It was only a few short years ago when we \nwere here on the floor debating budgets that anticipated deficits well \ninto the future. While I support the fiscal responsibility assumed in \nthis budget, I have to rise in opposition. This budget does little to \nprepare for the next century and it allows the federal government to \nturn its back on our children. This budget is a failure for our \nchildren and our economic future.\n  During Committee consideration and floor debate, I attempted to amend \nthis Resolution in an effort to ensure that children remain a top \npriority of the federal budget. Unfortunately, the Republicans chose to \nignore the education and early development needs of our children. The \nRepublican budget strategy is to spend for today and do little to plan \nfor tomorrow.\n  As a new Member of the Senate Budget Committee in 1993, I was \ncommitted to reducing the deficits and restoring fiscal order to \nfederal spending. I knew that it would be a tough challenge and a \ndifficult task, but I also knew we owed our children this much. We had \nto end deficit spending and stop borrowing from their future.\n  I stood on this floor during the summer of 1993 when we debated the \nDeficit Reduction plan, which many of my Colleagues on the other side \npredicted would drive our economy into recession and do little to \nreduce the deficit. As we debate the fiscal year 1999 Budget \nResolution, I am pleased to report that the discussion has gone from \nhow to reduce the deficit to how to invest the surplus. The economy is \nstrong and all indications show that economic growth will continue. \nUnemployment is at an all time low and interest rates are not raging \nout of control.\n  I am proud to have worked to get our fiscal house in order without \njeopardizing our economic prosperity. I also welcome the new challenges \nof how to invest the surplus and maintain our investments in our \nfuture.\n  I am pleased that the Republican budget does do the right thing on \nSocial Security. As called for by the President, the Resolution \ncurrently before us today does dedicate any budget surplus to saving \nSocial Security. This is the kind of bipartisan work that I am pleased \nto be part of. Saving Social Security is important for current workers \nand future retirees.\n  Social Security is the most important anti-poverty program ever \nimplemented by the federal government. As a result of the enactment of \nSocial Security, far fewer seniors live in poverty when they retire. \nFor many, having Social Security gave them the ability to \nretire. Without Social Security, old age would mean economic insecurity \nand instability. The program has been an unqualified success and we \nmust continue this proud legacy.\n\n  We have made a commitment to today's workers that must be honored. \nWhen they retire or become disabled, Social Security will protect them \nand their families from economic disaster. We must do everything \npossible to maintain the success of Social Security.\n  But I am concerned that there are some who want to use the surplus to \nprovide tax shelters to the most affluent. Make no mistake about it, \nsimply allowing tax cuts to encourage workers to set up individual \nretirement accounts will not have Social Security. It will give those \nwith more income a greater ability to shelter this income, but it does \nlittle to help Social Security. Keep in mind, Social Security is a \nsocial insurance plan, not a retirement plan. Insurance works best when \nthe risk is spread across the population. Allowing the rich to shelter \nmore of their income to save for retirement will not save Social \nSecurity.\n  Please do not hide behind saving Social Security to provide tax cuts \nto the most affluent. The American worker deserves a more honest and \nresponsible approach. We can reform Social Security without dismantling \nthe program. We need to work in a bipartisan manner to enact real \nreforms, not tax cuts in disguise.\n  I also urge my Colleagues on the other side not to fool themselves \ninto thinking that dedicated all federal tobacco revenues to Medicare \nwill save the program. Medicare's problems go well beyond just a cash \nreserve. Unlike Social Security, Medicare has always been a pay-as-you-\ngo program. Simply throwing money at the program will do little to \nimprove the long term condition of the Medicare program. We all know \nthat structural changes are the real answer. We have to improve the \nhealth of senior citizens before we can hope to improve the financial \nhealth of Medicare.\n  I am pleased that my amendment regarding prevention benefits for \nMedicare beneficiaries was adopted by the Senate. If my Colleagues on \nthe other side are serious about saving Medicare, we must increase the \nprevention focus within Medicare. It is simply beyond understanding why \nMedicare will not reimburse for prescription drugs to reduce \ncholesterol, but will pay for inpatient, acute care for by-pass \nsurgery.\n  A greater focus on prevention will prove that we are serious about \nsaving Medicare. Prevention benefits are the kind of reforms needed to \nreally save Medicare. It seems almost insincere to target new federal \ntobacco revenues to Medicare and not put these benefits to use in \nimproving the health status of senior citizens.\n  I think the greatest failure of this budget is the complete disregard \nfor enacting real tobacco control legislation. The debate is not just \nabout how to spend tobacco revenues, but enacting a national anti-\nsmoking bill that could potentially wipe out smoking in less than one \ngeneration. We have an historic opportunity to end the plague of \ntobacco. We cannot afford to let this opportunity pass.\n  The Republican budget resolution creates huge roadblocks for enacting \ntobacco control legislation. I am concerned that the Resolution will \nblock any new revenues for the Food and Drug Administration to regulate \nnicotine as a drug. Without new revenues, FDA cannot enforce youth \naccess laws that prevent children from buying cigarettes. Without \ntobacco revenues, FDA cannot regulate an industry known for hiding the \nfacts and lying to Congress. How can FDA challenge an industry that has \ncreatively targeted our children?\n  There can be no anti-smoking national policy without a strong and \nwell-financed FDA. Any attempt to pass anti tobacco legislation without \na strong FDA will only fail. We will never end the tobacco companies \nattack on our children.\n  This Budget Resolution fails our children in many ways. Not just \nabout tobacco, but in preparing them for the challenges they will face \ntomorrow. We have all seen study after study that proves we need to \nplace education as a top priority at both the federal and state level. \nOur children do not have the resources and are not being given the \nopportunity to meet their potential.\n  I am disappointed in the lack of any effort in the Republican Budget \nResolution to deal with overcrowded classrooms and decaying schools. \nHow can we hope for high test scores when children have no heat in the \nclassroom or windows covered with cardboard? How can we hope to prepare \nour children when there are 45 children in each classroom? How does a \nchild receive the individual attention so important to cultivating \ntheir skills and their self esteem when there are 45 students for every \nteacher? Our classrooms boarder on chaos every day because of these \ndeplorable conditions. Yet the Republican response was to simply ignore \nthese problems.\n  These are not local problems as some may argue. A well educated and \nskilled work force is a national security issue. We cannot remain a \nglobal economic power without a well educated and skilled work force. \nIf we do not dedicate the resources necessary to ensure that every \nchild can learn and can learn in an environment that is geared toward \nmore than just survival, we jeopardize our own economic stability. \nEducation is not just a local concern or a concern of parents. Ask any \nbusiness\n\n[[Page S3098]]\n\nowner about the need to have an adequate supply of skilled labor. I can \nassure you that this is not a local issue, but is becoming a national \ndisgrace.\n  Ignoring investments in education is simply irresponsible and \nselfish. I urge my colleagues to do the right thing and address the \npressing needs of today's classrooms. We can do better.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to commend my colleague Senator \nDomenici, the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, for bringing a \ntruly remarkable budget resolution to the Floor of the Senate. I truly \nnever thought that I would be standing here during my lifetime \npreparing to vote on a resolution that will bring our federal budget \ninto balance, even producing a surplus. This is going to be one of \nthose rare occasions when the Congress will actually be following its \nown advice. We will advance beyond the rhetoric of talking about \nbalancing the budget and actually balance the budget. And we are doing \nit 4 years ahead of time. This is a truly remarkable achievement.\n  If we continue on this course, something even more remarkable may \nbegin to happen. The public may start to lose some of the skepticism \nabout the Congress which has built up over the years.\n  Last year we were faced with many hard choices as we worked on the \nbi-partisan Balanced Budget Act of 1997. It was a difficult time. The \ndecisions which we made then were as tough as any decisions which we as \nlegislators have ever had to make. But we joined hands, and for the \ngood of the country we made them. Those difficult, sometimes bitter \ndecisions are now bearing the sweet fruit of a balanced budget along \nwith a possible surplus.\n  We should be hearing the blue bird of happiness here in the Senate \nChamber, and continue to be careful with the taxpayers money. But that \ndoesn't seem to be the case. Instead we are hearing the gremlin of \nspend, spend, spend. It seems that the lessons we have learned about \ntightening our belts and living within our means was fleeting at best. \nTo make matters worse, we are talking about spending money that we do \nnot have yet.\n  Another way that we are talking about spending money that we don't \nhave in the various votes about spending the tobacco settlement money. \nThis is not the appropriate time for this debate.\n  In addition, we are putting the cart before the horse. We are \ndebating how to spend the money from a tobacco settlement before we \nhave made the hard choices required to enact this settlement. What \nabout liability limitations, advertising restrictions, billion dollar \nattorneys fees, tax deductibility questions, new federal regulations, \nand antitrust limits? These are just a few issues that must be \ncarefully considered before Congress passes any tobacco legislation.\n  When we pass tobacco legislation, our goal--our priority--must be to \neliminate youth smoking. When I can, I discourage people, both old and \nyoung, from smoking. I recently took my grandson Patrick to a town \nmeeting, where Al Gore was speaking, that was organized to alert young \npeople to the dangers of smoking. Let's make that clear, there is no \none in this room who favors youth smoking. Any efforts to characterize \nanyone otherwise are disingenuous and frankly, unhelpful to this \ndebate.\n  I believe that we must pass tobacco legislation this session. And we \nneed to keep our priorities straight when we do this. Our priority must \nbe to stop youth smoking, not to coddle the tobacco industry. This \nBudget Resolution protects the chances of passing solid tobacco \nsettlement legislation this year. It takes the proceeds from this \ntheoretical legislation and puts them in a reserve fund for Medicare--\nwhich pays the health-related costs that the state lawsuits were \ndesigned to address. It funds the issues won in the settlement--smoking \ncessation programs, health research, and such--from existing funds. We \nbelieve that these are important enough to fund them without waiting \nfor new legislation. This allows us to stop arguing over how to spend \nthe money long enough to consider the issues that must be solved for us \nto get this money. This gives us the strongest hand to enact \nlegislation that creates a real, effective and lasting regime for \nreducing youth smoking.\n  Now is also not the time to talk about new entitlement programs. Now \nis the time to keep entitlements and spending in line with last year's \nbipartisan budget agreement. It is time to make sure the entitlements \nwe have already can meet their commitments to the millions of Americans \nwho depend on them.\n  Again, this is a good budget. This budget paves the way for real \nincreases in spending for health research, child care, and other \nimportant programs. And we do it within the agreed upon budget caps.\n  I greatly admire the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee and the \nskill and expertise which he has shown in crafting this budget \nresolution. This is a good resolution. This resolution keeps the faith \nwith the American people as we continue to work to get a balanced \nbudget and to keep it.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Majority Leader \nLott, Chairman Domenici and the members of the Budget Committee for \nputting together a balanced fiscal blueprint for the Federal \nGovernment. The federal budget consists of more than 1,060 spending \naccounts that fund an estimated 113,000 programs, projects, and \nactivities. The federal budget and a Congressional budget collapse \nthese accounts into twenty budget functions. It was not too long ago \nthat we talked about the ever-increasing deficit and the need to for \nfiscal restraint of these functions. Under this resolution, the budget \nwould be balanced three years earlier than the Fiscal Year 2002 \ndeadline set out in the Balanced Budget Agreement of 1997.\n  The budget we will be voting on provides for the first surplus in a \ngeneration. After reaching a peak of $290 billion in 1992, the unified \nbudget deficit has declined to where the Congressional Budget Office \nprojects a surplus in the current fiscal year of nearly $8 billion. \nCurrent laws and policies left unchanged, and real economic growth \naveraging 2.2 percent annually, the unified budget surplus is projected \nto grow to $67 billion by 2002. The budget achieves this surplus while \nalso increasing spending by 3.6 percent over last year.\n  Even though the budget calls for increased spending, it maintains the \nprinciples of the Balanced Budget Agreement of 1997. This budget we \nhave before us today embraces a bipartisan approach of protecting \nfederal programs while preserving the principles of fiscal discipline.\n  Mr. President, Chairman Domenici has increased funding in some of the \nprograms that are important to me as Chairman of the Labor and Human \nResources Committee. The budget provides an additional $15 billion for \nthe National Institute of Health, $5 billion for the IDEA educational \nprograms, and $5 billion for Child Care Block Grants.\n  The budget provides funding for the $214 billion Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act that the Senate passed on March 12, 1998. \nThe State of Vermont would average $118 million a year in highway money \nand $2.5 million for mass transit projects through 2003. Vermont will \nbe able to use funds to reconstruct aging rail lines, repair bridges, \nand improve major roads throughout the state. Mass transit funding will \ngo to small-town bus systems and minibuses for disabled and handicapped \npeople in rural areas.\n  Mr. President, even though this budget provides additional funding on \nprograms that are very important to me, we still have many challenges \nahead. The Federal Government still has a $5.5 trillion debt. In Fiscal \nYear 1998, the Federal Government will spend about $250 billion on \ninterest on the national debt. One out of every seven dollars in taxes \ngoes simply to pay off the bondholders. This money gets diverted from \nimportant programs that the Federal Government provides. The Clinton \nAdministration said that without enactment of any budget agreement, \ndebt would have approached $7 trillion by 2002.\n  Mr. President, there is $14 trillion in unfunded obligations for the \nretirement and health care benefits of the Baby-boomer generation. That \ngeneration is now just ten years away from starting to impose its \nunprecedented burdens on its children and grandchildren. We as a nation \nneed to begin to agree on a way to ensure the health care and \nretirement security of the Baby-boomer generation retirees.\n\n[[Page S3099]]\n\n  The economy of the United States is booming and inflation has all but \nvanished. Unemployment is low and federal budget will be balanced for \nthe first time in 30 years. This budget provides the building blocks to \nmeet the challenges that lie ahead. I call upon my colleagues to build \nupon the work over the last decade at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue \nand support this budget resolution.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in firm opposition to S. Con. \nRes. 86, the Budget Resolution for fiscal year 1999. I do so with great \ndisappointment.\n  Mr. President, last year the Congress produced an historic budget \nagreement. We produced a plan to finish the job we started in 1993 of \neliminating the budget deficit. We worked together--across party \nlines--to balance the budget, to protect our seniors by ensuring the \nsolvency of Medicare, and to provide for key investments in education \nand health care. We also provided real tax relief for working families.\n  I had hoped we would be able to continue to build off the framework \nof the 1997 Balanced Budget Act and Taxpayer Relief Act. Unfortunately, \nthis budget resolution ignores the priorities that were at the core of \nthose agreements.\n  I will oppose this resolution because it does not reflect the \nprinciples and priorities that I believe must be part of the budget. I \nwant a budget that preserves the safety net for seniors, gets behind \nour kids, provides for safe streets and a safer world, and provides for \ninvestments in science and technology. I believe this budget is \ndefective in each of these areas.\n  The Democratic budget alternative that was offered during our debate \nwas strong where this resolution is deficient. It would have allowed \nfor enactment of a comprehensive child care initiative to improve and \nexpand the availability of quality, affordable child care and after \nschool programs for school age children. No working parent should have \nto worry about finding suitable care for their child--a safe place with \nwell-trained staff. The lack of adequate safe and affordable child care \nis a major concern of America's families. Our alternative would have \ngone a long way to meet that critical need.\n  The Democratic alternative was strong on education. It would have \nenabled us to improve the education of our children through initiatives \nto reduce classroom size, hire 100,000 more teachers, and to ensure \nthat children attend school in safe and well-maintained facilities.\n  Our Democratic alternative was strong on Social Security. It made \nclear that before we spend one penny of any projected budget surplus, \nwe should save Social Security first. Social Security is a sacred \ncompact with America's seniors. We owe it to every senior citizen to \nensure that Social Security is there for them, and that it will be \nthere for today's workers when they retire.\n  Our Democratic alternative was strong on health care. It would have \nprovided for vital new investments in health care research. It would \nhave ensured that the funds generated by a comprehensive tobacco bill--\na priority for the American people--could be used to fight teen \nsmoking, to conduct tobacco-related health research, to provide \nprograms for people who want to quit smoking, and to help tobacco \nfarmers move to new crops.\n  I believe we produced a budget that should have had the support of a \nbipartisan majority. It was a common sense budget--that kept our \ncommitment to a balanced budget, while providing for the sorts of \ninvestments in key priorities that are critical for getting our country \nready for the next century.\n  I am deeply disappointed that our alternative was rejected. The \nBudget Resolution before us now does not meet America's needs. I cannot \nsupport it.\n\n\n                        focus on teacher quality\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of my \nSense of the Senate Resolution which I have introduced.\n  In believe there is a crisis in teacher education in the United \nStates. To me, that means we have to look to new ideas. If we are \nserious about restoring America as an academic power, I believe that we \nhave to act immediately to find solutions. In the past, education \nreform has not been bold enough--and our children are suffering very \nserious consequences.\n  Some alarming statistics really brought this home for me:\n  36% of those now teaching core subjects--like English, math, science, \nsocial studies, and foreign languages--neither majored nor minored in \nthose subjects.\n  A study conducted by the National Commission on Teaching and \nAmerica's Future revealed that\n\n       More than one-quarter of newly hired public school teachers \n     in 1991 lacked the qualifications for their jobs, and nearly \n     one-fourth of all secondary teachers did not even have a \n     minor in their main teaching field.\n\n  The Commission also found that\n\n       56% percent of high school students taking physical science \n     were being taught by out-of-field teachers, as were 27% of \n     those taking mathematics and 21% of those taking English.\n\n  This is bad enough--but there's also evidence that the least \nqualified teachers were most likely to be found in high-poverty and \npredominantly minority schools, and in lower-track classes. In fact, in \nschools with the highest minority enrollments, students had less than a \n50% chance of getting a science or mathematics teacher who held a \nlicense and a degree in the field he or she taught.\n  This is a prescription for disaster on a truly national scale. With \nthis failure of investment in properly trained teachers, we should not \nbe surprised that students are doing so poorly on standardized tests. \nAfter all, if the teacher does not understand the subject he or she is \nteaching, then certainly the students will not learn what they need to \nknow.\n  It is inexcusable that a country that leads the world in so many ways \ndoes not give its children the best academic resources available. The \ntruth is, the United States will not remain a world leader unless we \nmake a commitment to invest more in teacher quality--and soon.\n  I am encouraged that we have bipartisan interest in reforming the \neducation system. However, we must address the problem of quality \nteachers before we merely reduce class size and hire 100,000 new \nteachers.\n  The answer, in my view, is to only certify quality teachers--and \nfurthermore, to get the quality teachers to teach our neediest kids. \nAll children, from K to 12th grade, deserve the chance to have well-\neducated, qualified teachers who will help them reach the limits of \ntheir academic potential.\n  I have introduced legislation that would provide assistance for the \ncreation of teacher training facilities across the United States that \nwill help train teachers who are either already in the classroom, or \nabout to enter the teaching profession. While it is important to stem \nthe tide of unqualified teachers reaching the classroom, we must also \nfocus on helping teachers that are already in the classroom and need \nassistance in becoming the best teachers that they can be.\n  The Teacher Quality Act is common-sense legislation that will assist \nschool districts in their struggle to maintain the highest possible \nacademic standards for their children. The idea for this legislation \ndeveloped out of my admiration for the Mayerson Academy in Cincinnati, \nOhio. The Mayerson Academy was established in 1992 as a partnership \nbetween the Cincinnati business community and its schools. Its mission \nis to provide the highest quality training and professional development \nopportunities to the men and women responsible for educating the \nchildren of Cincinnati.\n  We also need to tap into the expertise of people who have a lot to \noffer our children, but who haven't trained specifically to be \nteachers. I have introduced legislation that will expand and improve \nthe supply of well-qualified elementary and secondary school teachers, \nby helping States develop and implement programs for alternative \ncertification or licensure of teachers.\n  The Alternative Certification and Licensure of Teachers Act will give \npeople who would like to teach a chance to do so. These are people who \ncan serve as mentors and role models--real-life examples of how a good \neducation can make a huge positive difference in a student's future.\n  We need to bring the best possible people into America's classrooms--\npeople who can inspire kids with their knowledge and experience. That's \nwhat this bill would accomplish.\n  When it comes to education, our national task is clear: We have to \ndevelop\n\n[[Page S3100]]\n\nan education system that will draw the best and brightest students into \nthe teaching profession. The States need to be encouraged to provide \nincentives for people to become teachers, and restore a sense of pride \nto this profession.\n  Without strong teachers, our children will continue to struggle. But \nif we start attracting the best possible people into the classroom, \nthere's really no limit to what our young people can achieve.\n  Please join me in voting for this Resolution so that we can begin a \nconcerted focus on teacher quality in this country.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, today our economy is remarkably \nstrong, and this year our budget will balance for the first time since \n1969. In 1993, many of my colleagues and I passed a historic budget \nplan that set the stage for this strong economy. Today, I am proud to \nreport that the Congressional Budget Office estimates a surplus of $8 \nbillion this year.\n  In these past 4 years, we've achieved the lowest tax burden for \nworking families in 20 years. Unemployment was 7.5 percent in 1992. \nLast month it fell to 4.7 percent, its lowest in 24 years. And since \nPresident Clinton took office, more than 13 million new jobs have been \ncreated. We have strengthened the economy while at the same time \nreducing the size of government.\n  For the past several days, we have been considering the Budget \nresolution for 1999. This resolution could have provided us the \nopportunity to take the next vital step in creating even a stronger \neconomy and addressing some of our nation's most urgent needs. While \nthis resolution has several provisions which I do believe will lead us \nin that direction, I also believe that it fails to seize the \nopportunity to address some of our nation's most immediate needs, and \nfor that reason, I will not support this budget resolution.\n  First, let me say that I am pleased that the drafters of this \nresolution have made provisions for the Senate increases and offsets \nfor reauthorization of ISTEA, assuming an additional $2.7 billion over \nfive years for mass transit programs, $25.9 billion above last year's \nagreed to levels. In addition, I am pleased to see that an additional \n$5 billion in discretionary budget authority has been provided for the \nChild Care Block Grant, and I am additionally pleased to see provisions \nfor the extension of the R tax credit, IRS reform, technical \ncorrections to 1997 tax bill, and child care tax relief.\n  Over the course of this week, however, several good amendments have \nbeen offered that could have strengthened this budget resolution and \nmade it an even clearer expression of our values. Unfortunately, most \nof those efforts failed here on the Senate floor. The majority--who did \nnothing to help erase the red ink our Administration inherited from \nthem--continues to cling to failed economic policies.\n  For instance, this budget resolution fails to do anything in the way \nof addressing the $112 billion that the GAO reports is needed to bring \nAmerica's crumbling schools up to code, or to address the need to \nstrengthen our public school system. There is no greater challenge or \nthreat to our nation's future prospects in this technological age and \nglobal economy than quality education for every American child. Failure \nto respond to that challenge is not only irresponsible, but \ndestructive.\n  Equally distressing is that fact that this resolution does not do \nenough to address the current status of our Medicare and Social \nSecurity systems. This opportunity should have been used, I believe, to \nprovide retirement security for our seniors. Social Security and \nMedicare have worked well together, bringing poverty among the elderly \nto its lowest level since we have been keeping statistics. Furthermore, \nthese programs have helped to increase life expectancy among men and \nwomen. Millions of senior citizens deserve to have a decent retirement, \nand this budget fails to address their needs.\n  Do we need to operate these programs the same way? Of course not--but \nwe do need to secure the guarantees they provide for Americans. The \ntime for reform of both of these vital programs is now, and we do \nourselves a disservice by not seizing this opportunity.\n  As with education, the issue is whether we are preparing our nation \nfor the challenges of the next century.\n  We can fix these institutions and remain fiscally responsible. We \nhave proven, in passing last year's budget agreement, that it is \npossible to address the needs of our nation and promote economic growth \nand a fair tax system at the same time.\n  It is unfortunate that politics prevented us from fashioning a budget \nresolution that could have served the needs of all the American people, \nand not just a few. I cannot in good conscience support this budget \nresolution, and I urge my colleagues to vote against it.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, the FY 1999 budget resolution is the first \nresolution that has been crafted since the historic balanced budget \nagreement was reached and enacted just 10 short months ago.\n  I would first like to congratulate the Chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, Pete Domenici, for bringing us to the point where a balanced \nbudget is no longer just a projection at end of some indeterminate \nperiod of time--but may actually be a reality by the end of the current \nfiscal year. His years of dedication to balanced budgets and his \nongoing commitment to being a responsible steward of the taxpayer's \ndollar may soon be rewarded--and I am pleased to have had the \nopportunity to serve with him on the Budget Committee during this \nhistoric time.\n  Furthermore, I believe that the resolution that Chairman has crafted \ndeserves the support of no less than each of the 76 members who voted \nfor last year's bipartisan agreement. This resolution is not only \nconsistent with that agreement, but also adds critical funding for a \nmultitude of programs that are priorities for many in the Senate: child \ncare, health research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), \nsmoking cessation programs, and federal funding for the Individuals \nwith Disability Education Act (IDEA), to name just a few. Any member \nwho heralded last year's budget agreement--or who voted in favor the \nprovisions and spending targets it contained--would be hard-pressed to \nexplain why this resolution does not deserve their support this year.\n  Mr. President, as I stated during the recent markup of this \nresolution in the Budget Committee, I believe it is important that we \nestablish several guiding principles in crafting the FY 1999 budget \nresolution. I am proud to say that the resolution we crafted--and which \nis now being considered by the full Senate--achieves all of these \ngoals.\n  First, based on the 29-year losing streak we have had in balancing \nthe federal budget, we have an obligation to craft a resolution that \nputs us on a credible and prudent path that will keep the budget \nbalanced for many years to come.\n  Second, we must craft a budget resolution that is based on the \nbalanced budget agreement that was enacted 10 short months ago.\n  Third, with an eye to the future, we must preserve the Social \nSecurity program before utilizing any portion of forthcoming surpluses \nfor spending increases or tax cuts.\n  And, fourth, we must ensure that any monies generated by tobacco \nrevenues in the months ahead be utilized to preserve and protect \nMedicare.\n  Although it would seem that these principles will be easy to attain, \nCongress' unproven track record of keeping the budget in balance, the \ntenuous nature of our economic assumptions, and the overwhelming desire \nof some individuals to ``spend'' money we don't even have, will make \nthis difficult.\n  As I said, Congress has been on a 29-year losing streak when it comes \nto balancing the budget--we have no track record of getting the budget \nin balance or keeping it in balance. Therefore, much as I am pleased \nthat CBO now projects an $8 billion surplus this year and total \nsurpluses of $151 billion over the next five years, I believe we have \nan obligation to prove to the American people that we will ensure these \nprojections become a reality not only for the next five years, but \nyear-after-year in the future.\n  Achieving this goal will be harder than it looks. The simple fact is \nthat the current outlook and surplus estimates are based on extremely \ntenuous projections. Therefore, to modify a well known saying, ``we \nshouldn't count our surpluses before they're hatched.''\n  First, our estimated surpluses are based on the assumption that we \nwill\n\n[[Page S3101]]\n\nhave no recessions or economic downturns in the coming 10 years. Based \non the fact that we are now in the midst of one of the longest \nstretches of sustained economic growth in our nation's history, this \nseems to be a fragile estimate at best.\n  Specifically, as the chart behind me indicates, the current period of \nsustained economic growth first started in March 1991. If it continues \nuntil December 1998, it will match the duration of the longest \npeacetime expansion in U.S. history--the ``Reagan expansion''--which \nlasted 92 straight months (i.e. November 1982 to July \n1990). Furthermore, if this expansion continues until early 2000, it \nwill be longest period of expansion ever--peacetime or wartime--which \nwas set in the 1960's (106 straight months, from February 1961--\nDecember 1969).\n\n  Therefore, If CBO's projection come true and growth is sustained \nthrough 2008, we will double the all-time record of 106 straight months \nset in 1969. Needless to say, with 61% of the economists surveyed by \nBlue Chip believing a recession is likely to occur before March 2000, \nthese estimates of prolonged economic growth leading to substantial \nsurpluses should be viewed with a health dose of skepticism.\n  Furthermore, our estimates for growth in even the current year are \npredicated on shaky estimates. Specifically, although the impact of the \nAsian economic crisis has seemed only slight up until now, we still do \nnot know how severe the overall impact will be--and we certainly won't \nknow until later in the year when it's too late to alter the budget.\n  Already, just two weeks ago, we learned that the U.S. trade deficit \nfor the month of January soared to a new all-time record of $12 \nbillion, as exports to Asia dropped precipitously. According to a \nrecent Washington Post article, many economists expect that because of \nproblems in Asia, the trade deficit will widen substantially this year \nfrom the $114 billion deficit posted in 1997--which was already the \nlargest trade deficit our nation had posted in nine years. Needless to \nsay, if this situation persists and worsens, there will be a drag on \nthe U.S. economy.\n  In light of these risks, we would be wise to heed the caution of CBO \nwhen it comes to touting the budget outlook. As CBO outlined in their \nown January report, the economy is ``highly unlikely to develop \nprecisely as the forecast predicts''--and even a moderate recession, \nsuch as the one experienced in the early 1990's, could lead to the \nbudget outlook deteriorating by ``more than $100 billion'' for a year \nor more. In fact, if projected growth is even 0.5% lower than CBO \nprojects over the next 10 years, the budget outcome will be $150 \nbillion worse than projected in 2008.\n  It is because of CBO's own cautions that I am especially concerned \nwith the economic and budget estimates of OMB. Although the CBO and OMB \nestimates are very close together, the simple fact is that OMB still \nprovides a more favorable economic outlook in coming years. \nSpecifically, as a result of more favorable growth estimates and lower \ninflation estimates, OMB's estimated surpluses are $66 billion--or 30 \npercent--higher than CBO. Therefore, prudence dictates that OMB's \nestimates be viewed with even greater skepticism than the already \noptimistic projections of CBO.\n\n  Clearly, if we are to establish a track record of balanced budgets, \nwe must chart a prudent course in the budget resolution. And for this \nreason, we must adopt a resolution that not only follows CBO's more \nmodest economic estimates, but that also adheres strictly to last \nyear's balanced budget agreement. This body should do nothing to \njeopardize that agreement, which put in place strict spending limits \nthat will improve the chances of projected surpluses becoming actual \nsurpluses.\n  Regrettably, the President does not seem to share this view. Rather, \nhe views the recent favorable estimates as an opportunity to spend \nmoney, create new programs, and violate the terms and spirit of the \nbudget agreement we reached just 10 short months ago!\n  By proposing to increase taxes by $105 billion and to increase \nspending by $118 billion, the President's budget would revert to the \ntax-and-spend policies that the American people believed we abandoned \nthree years ago.\n  Furthermore, although President Clinton has urged that Congress not \nspend the surplus until Social Security is fixed, CBO now tells us that \nthe President's own budget would not only spend the surplus, but also \ncause a deficit in three years! Specifically, as CBO stated in their \nMarch 4 preliminary analysis of the President's budget: ``CBO estimates \nthat the President's policies will reduce projected baseline surpluses \nby $43 billion between 1999 and 2003--and will temporarily dip the \nbudget back into red ink by a small amount in 2000.''\n  Needless to say, these aren't the kind of policies that Congress \nagreed to when we crafted the bipartisan balanced budget agreement last \nyear--and that's not what the American people were led to believe would \nhappen when President Clinton unveiled his budget proposal in February.\n  While some may argue that the President is not bound by last year's \nbudget agreement because the budget may be balanced sooner than \nexpected, I have only one thing to say: I don't remember any clause in \nthe agreement that read: ``If a balanced budget is achieved prior to \n2002, the terms and spending limits of this agreement are automatically \nwaived.''\n  Fortunately, the Chairman of the Budget Committee, Pete Domenici, \nunderstands the need for prudence, and crafted this resolution \naccordingly.\n  As the budget before us demonstrates, the Chairman believes that we \nhave an obligation to treat this favorable budget news as a chance to \nprepare for the future and address the long-term demands that retiring \nBaby Boomers will place on our budget in 10 short years.\n  Specifically, this resolution adheres to the budget agreement we \nstruck 10 months ago. Also, he leaves every dime of every future \nsurplus to the Social Security Trust Fund--which is just as the \nPresident urged us to do, though his own budget does not. And, finally, \nhe ensures that Congress does not forget or ignore the plight of \nMedicare--a critical program that will be insolvent in 2008, which is \nlong before Social Security will be insolvent, and sooner than many \nwould like to remember.\n  To achieve this final goal, the Chairman has wisely walled-off any \nmonies we receive from tobacco legislation and dedicated it to \nMedicare. In comparison, the President would like to target these \nmonies to a host of new programs that he believes will have popular \nappeal. Perhaps targeting windfall revenues to a program that our \nelderly rely on for their medical needs isn't as appealing as handing \nout new ``goodies'' in an election year, but I certainly believe it \nwould be more responsible and prudent.\n  In addition, when considering the cost of smoking-related illnesses \non the Medicare program each and every year, linking any forthcoming \ntobacco revenue to the Medicare program is imminently appropriate. As \nthe chart behind me indicates, Columbia University found that smoking-\nrelated illnesses cost the Medicare program $25.5 billion in 1995 \nalone. In fact, of the various forms of substance abuse that affect the \nMedicare program, tobacco-related illnesses accounted for 80% of the \napproximately $32 billion total costs in 1995.\n  Therefore, even assuming that these costs have not risen since 1995--\nwhich is doubtful--then the President's budget, which assumes tobacco \nrevenues of approximately $13 billion in each of the coming five years, \nwill not even come close to covering the costs of tobacco on the \nMedicare program. In fact, the President's assumption would cover only \nslightly more than half of these annual costs. Needless to say, the \nbudget resolution's assumption that these monies be used to shore-up \nthe Medicare program is more than justified when considering these \nfacts.\n  Now, some members have expressed concern that walling-off tobacco \nrevenues in this manner will harm our efforts to pass comprehensive \ntobacco legislation later this year. As a member of the Senate Commerce \nCommittee--the Committee that will soon be marking-up this \nlegislation--I cannot emphasize enough that this concern is unfounded.\n  The tobacco reserve fund does not imperil comprehensive tobacco \nlegislation, as some members on the other side of the aisle will \ncontend. Rather, just the opposite is true: It will protect future \ntobacco legislation.\n\n[[Page S3102]]\n\n  The simple fact, Mr. President, is that the more uses we identify for \npossible tobacco revenues in the budget resolution, the more the urge \nto spend money will become the driving force for tobacco legislation. \nIf that happens, the only winners will be the tobacco companies, \nbecause Congress will have lost sight of the true goal of that \nlegislation: reducing--if not eliminating--teen smoking.\n\n  Tobacco companies would like nothing more than for those of us who \nare committed to passing comprehensive tobacco legislation to argue \nabout how money will be spent. The simple fact is that if we divvy-up \nthe pot of potential tobacco money in this resolution, we will face \nenormous pressure to simply pass a tobacco bill at all costs, \nregardless of its merits. Such a bill could well-contain many weak \nprovisions that favor tobacco companies--but the pressure to ``spend \nthe money'' will drive members to overlook the inherent flaws of such a \nbill.\n  As the Washington Post stated in a February 3 editorial: ``Mr. \nClinton would pay for a fair amount of his program with a tobacco bill \nthat he has thus far not submitted. He is relying on Congress to write \nit. He says that as a deterrent to smoking, it should raise the price \nof smoking $1.50 a pack in real terms over 10 years, and he proposes a \ndivision of the revenue. The problem with that will be if the money \nbecomes more important than the rest of the bill, and the tobacco \ncompanies are able, as is their intent, to buy weaker legislation than \nmight otherwise be passed.''\n  That's not an outcome that I want for tobacco legislation--and that's \nnot the outcome that I believe the American people want either.\n  Unfortunately, those who would attempt to push for an advance-\ndivvying of the tobacco ``piggy-bank'' drive us toward that outcome.\n  The fact of the matter is that the Chairman's mark will ensure that \ntobacco legislation to reduce teen smoking is able to move forward \nbased on sound policy--not politics. Limiting the use of the federal \nshare of future tobacco monies to Medicare is not an impediment to \ntobacco legislation--it is an enabler.\n  Mr. President, if I understand the argument of the minority \naccurately, they believe that limiting the use of the federal share of \ntobacco monies to Medicare will impose an additional hurdle to tobacco \nlegislation. They are saying that it will prevent tobacco monies from \nbeing used for important tobacco-related purposes, such as smoking \ncessation programs and health research.\n  As the Chairman has outlined, his budget resolution does more for \nthese programs today than any theoretical tobacco bill is able to do. \nThis resolution provides $800 million for tobacco cessation and \nprevention programs, and $15 billion for research at the NIH. That's \nreal money--not the illusory money that we simply hope tobacco \nlegislation will generate in the future.\n  Now, some may argue that this budget simply does not provide enough \nfor these or other smoking-related programs, and that any forthcoming \ntobacco legislation should provide additional monies for these \npurposes. That's a legitimate argument.\n  But the simple fact is that this budget will not prevent additional \nmonies from being provided for such purposes if a tobacco bill is \npassed. In fact, the budget resolution will not even prevent tobacco \nmonies from being diverted to programs that have nothing to do with \ntobacco.\n  The bottom line is that if tobacco legislation is brought up on the \nfloor of the Senate and members wish to divert monies for any number of \npurposes--either related to smoking or not related to smoking--they can \ndo that. It will simply take 60 votes to waive the point of order that \nthis resolution would create against such spending--which is the same \nmargin of votes that will be required to end debate on that same \ntobacco bill (achieve cloture).\n  Therefore, in light of the fact that it will take at least 60 votes \nto end debate on a tobacco bill and--ultimately--to pass a tobacco \nbill, this point of order is not onerous. It simply ensures that we \nkeep our priorities straight from the start (Medicare), and ensures \nthat the various ways we spend tobacco monies will have the same level \nof support as the tobacco bill itself.\n  The bottom line is that if Congress believes that more money is \nneeded from the tobacco bill to pay for smoking cessation and other \ntobacco-related programs, garnering 60 votes to waive the point of \norder will not even be an issue. Therefore, arguing that this \nrequirement--which is no more onerous than the 60-vote margin that will \nbe required to end debate and pass the tobacco bill--endangers tobacco \nlegislation, is completely inaccurate.\n  The bottom line is that this resolution seeks to protect tobacco \nlegislation from being weakened or undermined by a ``rush for the \nmoney.'' So I hope that those who are concerned about tobacco \nlegislation will join us in this effort to keep the focus of tobacco \nlegislation on reducing teen smoking--not on spending money.\n  I want a strong, effective tobacco bill--I don't want it undermined \nand weakened because the ``politics of spending'' got in the way of \ngood policy.\n  Mr. President, these and other principled decisions that are embodied \nin this resolution will undoubtedly be challenged by those who would \nlike to open the fiscal floodgates and start spending at will or pass \nanother round of tax cuts. However, I believe that as we move from a \nperiod of deficit politics to surplus politics, we should exercise \ndiscipline and prudence to ensure expectations are met--not re-open the \nfederal credit card account that got us into so much trouble in the \nfirst place.\n\n  At the same time, maintaining fiscal discipline and adhering to last \nyear's balanced budget agreement does not mean that we must ignore \nimportant issues confronting our nation today. Specifically, within \nexisting budget constraints, we can and should address the educational \nneeds of our children and tackle the child care crisis that is \naffecting countless families nationwide.\n  But funding these and other priorities doesn't require that we \nviolate last year's spending caps--rather, they require that we \nprioritize our spending and have the will to target our spending \naccordingly.\n  In particular, I would like to highlight the manner in which the \nChairman properly accommodated one such priority--child care--in this \nresolution. As the leaders of both parties an the Administration have \ndemonstrated through a variety of proposals, improving child care \nshould be a priority during the current Congress. And in light of the \never-expanding need for child care assistance, such a decision is not \nsurprising.\n  In 1995, 62 percent of women with children younger than 6 years of \nage--which means 12 million children--were cared for by someone other \nthan a parent during working hours, and the numbers have not improved. \nYet the supply of child care does not meet demand, and existing child \ncare is often unaffordable. In fact, on average, child care costs range \nfrom $3,000 to $8,000 per year, and can be even higher for infant care.\n  Safety is also a factor that looms heavily on parents' minds--in \nfact, a U.S. News and World Report article last August found that 76 \nchildren died in day care in 1996. This is tragic and should not be the \ncase. Placing children in child care should be an act of confidence, \nnot a leap of faith.\n  Finally, many families who wish to care for a young child at home--\neven for a short period of time--cannot afford to forgo the second \nincome, while other families undertake great scarifies to do so. But \nwhat many American families share is that terrible feeling that they \nhave no option. And it should not be this way.\n  That is why the assumptions of this budget resolution are so \ncritical. Not only would this budget double funding for the Child Care \nDevelopment Block Grant (CCDBG)--going from $5 billion to $10 billion--\nover the coming five years, but it would also ensure that any tax \npackage subsequently passed by the Finance Committee provide tax relief \nto families struggling with child care. I believe that these are \npolicies that both Democrats and Republicans alike can and should \nembrace.\n  In January, I introduced a comprehensive bill--the Caring for \nChildren Act--with Senators Chafee, Hatch, Roberts, and Specter, that \nis designed to increase the availability of a safe and affordable child \ncare. That legislation would expand the Dependent Care Tax Credit, and \nfor the first\n\n[[Page S3103]]\n\ntime make this credit available to families where a parent stays at \nhome to care for a child. It also encourages public-private \npartnerships, provides increased funding for quality, and doubles \nfunding for the Child Care Development Block Grant.\n  Although the budget resolution does not advocate any particular child \ncare bill, I am pleased that the assumptions included in this budget \nwould comport with our bill, and I hope that policies along these lines \nwill be enacted in the coming months.\n  I know that other child care bills have been introduced in the \nSenate--including a bill introduced by Senator Dodd, along with \nSenators Murray and Conrad. I truly believe that we are not that far \napart in terms of policy, and I look forward to a time when we can work \ntogether to bridge these differences.\n  At the same time, I also know that there are those who will be \nadamant that the increased funding provided in the budget resolution \nfor the Child Care Development Block Grant be mandatory in nature. \nHowever, I believe that the large increase in discretionary funding \nprovided in the resolution is the most fiscally responsible approach to \nthis nation's child care needs--and is quite an accomplishment when \nconsidering the fiscal constraints imposed in last year's bipartisan \nbalanced budget agreement.\n  To those who will say that the Appropriations Committee will not be \nable to locate additional funds within the discretionary caps for child \ncare, say, If child care is truly a priority, then it is simply a \nmatter of having the will--and casting the votes--to ensure that an \nadditional $1 billion per year is identified during the appropriations \nprocess for child care as we weigh our spending priorities. And \nconsidering that the President has proposed more than $47 billion in \nnon-defense discretionary cuts over the coming five years, this is \nhardly a practical impossibility--it is only a matter of will.\n  Mr. President, this decision to dramatically increase funding for \nchild care is but one of many decisions contained in this resolution \nthat will address shared priorities. While some may argue that the \nrecent favorable budget outlook gives us leeway to fund these \npriorities out of surplus monies or hoped-for tobacco revenues, the \nbottom line is that Republicans and Democrats alike fought hard for, \nand agreed to, this bipartisan agreement only ten months ago.\n  We should not take steps now to violate not only that agreement, but \nour trust with the American people. We have a responsibility to abide \nby this agreement, and the Chairman provided very generous funding \nwithin these constraints to ensure that child care and other priorities \nare properly addressed.\n  The bottom line is that this resolution abides by last year's \nbalanced budget agreement; provides increased funding for critically \nneeded priorities; preserves every penny of every surplus over the \ncoming five years to protect Social Security; and ensures that any \nwindfall revenues from tobacco legislation will be used to buttress the \nMedicare program.\n  The fact that this budget resolution abides by last year's agreement \nshould be reason enough for each of the 76 members who voted for last \nyear's agreement--including 36 Democrats--to vote for this budget plan. \nAnd the fact that it contains these other strong provisions should lead \nto even stronger bipartisan support. Therefore, I urge that my \ncolleagues support this soundly-crafted resolution.\n  Mr. President, there is a saying: ``Money's only something you need \nif you're around tomorrow.'' While this may be true for an individual, \nit doesn't make for good federal policy. Therefore, I congratulate the \nChairman of the Budget Committee for recognizing that being a good \nsteward of the federal budget requires that we ensure there is money \naround tomorrow--even if we are not.\n  Our children and grandchildren are counting on us to make decisions \ntoday that will ensure they are not left with a mountain of unpaid \nbills and a host of unresolved problems on the horizon. The budget that \nyou have crafted--and that is now before this body--would protect them \nfrom both of these dangers, and I congratulate you for your continued \nforesight. Thank you, Mr. President, and I look forward to voting in \nfavor of this resolution.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today, the Senate will approve a budget \nwhich will go beyond a balanced budget and create a surplus for the \nfirst time in more than a generation. This has been a key objective for \nme since I came to the Senate in 1985. So there is reason for some \nsatisfaction and relief tonight. However, as we balance the budget, the \npicture is not entirely appealing. Unfortunately, we have failed to \nprovide adequate support for the critical needs of our nation's \nchildren.\n  The Federal government has run a deficit continuously for more than \n30 years. It soared to dangerous levels in the 1980s during the Reagan \nand Bush Administrations. As a result of these deficits, our national \ndebt has multiplied several times, exacting a toll on our economy, \nincreasing interest rates, squeezing federal spending and making debt \nservice one of the largest expenditures in the Federal budget.\n  In 1993, following President Clinton's election, we began the long \njourney back from crushing deficits and toward fiscal responsibility by \npassing an enormously successful economic plan. The power of our \neconomy was unleashed and our nation has benefitted greatly: \nunemployment is at record low; interest rates are subdued; the stock \nmarket is surpassing all expectations; and economic growth continues to \nbe robust. This path culminated in last year's agreement to balance the \nbudget and provide substantial broad-based tax relief for working \nAmerican families and small businesses. The 1999 Budget Resolution is \nanother step on the path to fiscal responsibility. I commend the \nleaders with key roles in bringing us to this point: President Clinton \nand his advisers, The Senate Republican and Democratic leadership, and \nthe Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee.\n  I strongly support the fact that the budget resolution produces a \nsurplus which we can use to begin to restore the financial credibility \nof the Social Security system or pay off our federal debt. But that is \nfar from the only measure that should be applied to a budget. Deficit \nelimination is a vital objective, but it is neither an economic policy \nnor a statement of priorities for our nation or its government.\n  How we balance the budget is just as important as whether we do so.\n  This budget unfortunately will leave some critical American needs \nunmet. It misses a unique opportunity in America's history to assist \nchildren and families and resolve many of our most pressing problems in \neducation, child care, health care and environment.\n  Our children face real problems, and although there are a number of \nareas where we could improve this resolution, I want to focus my \nremarks on its effect on our nation's children. The out-of-wedlock \nbirth rate is too high. While the Gross National Product has doubled \nover the last two decades, the child poverty rate has increased 50 \npercent. An American child drops out of school every eight seconds, is \nreported neglected or abused every 10 seconds; and is killed by guns \nevery hour and a half. As a society, we are creating these problems for \nour children. Yet we know that scientific evidence conclusively \ndemonstrates that enhancing children's physical, social, emotional, and \nintellectual development will result in tremendous benefits for \nchildren, families and our nation.\n  America's children especially need support during the formative, \npreschool years in order to thrive and grow to become contributing \nadults. However, adequate child care is not affordable or even \navailable for too many families. That is why I believe we must provide \nmore help to working families to pay for critically needed, quality \nchild care, an early learning fund to assist local communities in \ndeveloping better child care programs, and sufficient funding to double \nthe number of infants and toddlers in Early Head Start. President \nClinton shares this view and included in his 1999 budget proposal my \nrecommendations on this issue. However, the Republican leadership \nrejected this approach and included no additional mandatory funding for \neither child care subsidies or early childhood education. Further, the \nresolution goes out of its way to exclude child care from the tobacco \nreserve fund. Instead, the budget tentatively promises a $5 billion \nincrease\n\n[[Page S3104]]\n\nonly if Congress is willing to cut other worthy programs to do so. That \nis unacceptable to the working families in this country. I joined \nSenator Dodd in offering an important amendment to rectify this \nsituation and increase funding for these crucial programs. While this \namendment secured a majority vote, under Senate rules that was \ninsufficient so the amendment did not become part of the resolution.\n  Mr. President, we must develop an educational system which prepares \nour children and young people for adulthood. Today, we are failing too \nmany of our children. Crumbling schools. Overcrowded classrooms. \nInadequately prepared teachers. The federal government provides a small \namount of the total funding for public elementary and secondary \neducation--less than seven percent of total public spending on K-12 \neducation comes from the federal government, down from just under 10 \npercent in 1980. We must back up our grand rhetoric with appropriate \nfunding for these worthy programs.\n  With my enthusiastic support, Democrats offered a number of \namendments to this resolution to increase the effectiveness of our \neducational system. Among them were amendments to reduce class size \nfrom a nationwide average of 22 in grades 1-3 to an average of 18, to \nprovide funds to help local school districts hire an additional 100,000 \nteachers, and to develop federal tax credits to pay interest on nearly \n$22 billion in bonds to build and renovate our public schools, many of \nwhich are in disrepair with emphasis on the 100 to 120 school districts \nwith the largest number of low-income children. Finally, Democrats \nproposed a $2.2 billion increase for after school programs, education \nopportunity zones, and the High Hopes Initiative.\n  I am deeply disappointed that the Republican budget resolution does \nnot include any of these proposals and that Republicans again and again \nrejected these initiatives. The consequences of the Republican budget \nare clear. Half a million disadvantaged children will not receive the \nextra help they need to succeed in school. Approximately 450,000 \nstudents will be denied safe after-school care in 1999. Some 30,000 new \nchildren will be denied access to the Head Start program. Some 6,500 \npublic schools will not have drug and violence prevention coordinators. \n3.9 million attending or wanting to attend college will be denied an \nincrease in their Pell Grants. If we are going to talk about education \nbeing a national priority, then we ought to match our grand rhetoric \nwith real money. The budget resolution we are considering today does \nnot meet this challenge.\n  Access to health care in our nation is also inadequate. President \nClinton proposed three initiatives to provide Americans aged 55 to 65 \nnew ways to gain access to health insurance by allowing those aged 62 \nto 65 to buy into Medicare, paying a fair premium for the coverage. It \nalso would allow displaced workers over 55 access to similar Medicare \ncoverage. The third initiative would allow Americans over 55 who have \nlost their retiree benefits access to their former employers' health \ninsurance until age 65. These proposals would give many Americans who \nare too old for conventional health insurance yet not old enough to be \neligible for Medicare access to basic health insurance coverage. \nHowever, the Republican budget proposal rejects all those proposals \neven though they pay for themselves with changes to the existing \nMedicare program.\n  Over the next five years, this Republican budget will spend $4 \nbillion over five years less than President Clinton proposed for the \nRyan White AIDS CARE program, drug abuse prevention and treatment, and \nCenter for Disease Control prevention activities.\n  Last year, I traveled to Kyoto, Japan to attend the Climate Change \nConference. The vast majority of the scientific community and policy \nmakers the world over who have carefully examined the issue of global \nwarming have concluded the science is compelling and that it is time to \ntake additional steps to address this issue in a more systematic way. \nThe Republican budget proposal, however, refuses to fund President \nClinton's initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions early in the \nnext century. This is a shortsighted approach which could pose a \nserious threat to our environment--indeed, to the survival of our \nplanet--in future years. We cannot afford to continue avoiding the \nconsequences of our own actions, or condemning future generations to a \ndespoiled planet.\n  I am a strong supporter of President Clinton's Clean Water \nInitiative, an action plan to focus on remaining challenges to restore \nand protect our nation's waterways, protect public health, prevent \npolluted runoff and ensure community-based watershed management. But \nthe Republican budget plan ignores this proposal.\n  I am pleased and relieved the budget is balanced, but the Senate \nnonetheless has failed to address glaring, fundamental needs of our \nnation and its people. The budget could have been and should have been \nmuch, much better. For these reasons, with disappointment and regret, I \nwill vote no on this resolution, and join others in committing to try \nto alter the misplaced priorities to better reflect and meet our \nnation's real needs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my views on the \nbudget resolution. I commend the Budget Committee on the job it has \ndone. Chairman Domenici and Senator Lautenberg should be praised for \ntheir efforts to bring a bill to the floor that balances the budget for \nthe first time in 30 years. And yet, this resolution fails to \nadequately address some of our nation's most pressing priorities, \nincluding child care, education, and health care.\n  First, however, I would like to take a moment to discuss how we \nreached this historic moment when, for the first time since 1969, we \npresent the American people with a budget that is in balance. The \nbalanced budget we have today is a result of the hard work and progress \nwe have made over the past few years to reduce the deficit. The effort \ndates back to 1990 when President Bush--despite strong opposition from \nhis own party--boldly endorsed a plan that lowered the deficit by $500 \nbillion and started us down the road to fiscal responsibility.\n  This effort was then continued by President Clinton in 1993 when he \nproposed a far-reaching economic plan, which is more appropriately \ncalled the Balanced Budget Plan of 1993. This balanced budget plan, \nwhich I supported, was enacted into law without a single Republican \nvote and has helped to reduce the deficit from $290 billion at the \nbeginning of 1993 to an anticipated surplus this year. Despite the \nclaims by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that President \nClinton's plan would doom our economy, this economic plan has put us on \na road to solid recovery. It has reduced deficits by more than $1 \ntrillion, led us to the lowest unemployment rate in 24 years, created \n15 million new jobs, and resulted in the greatest number of Americans \nowning homes ever.\n  Most recently, Mr. President, we finished the job of balancing the \nbudget when we enacted the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997, which I supported, not only reduced spending, but \nalso cut taxes for the first time in 16 years, providing much-needed \ntax relief for working families. I was very pleased to support the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997 because it protected our priorities such as \nfiscal discipline, child care, education, health care, and the \nenvironment.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, the resolution before us today fails to \nprotect these priorities and turns its back on America's families and \nchildren. It fails to recognize many initiatives important to our \nchildren and families including quality child care, reducing class \nsizes, renovating and modernizing our children's schools, and promoting \nafter-school learning.\n  The resolution provides no mandatory funding for either child care or \nearly childhood education. Moreover, it explicitly excludes President \nClinton's proposals to use any revenues from comprehensive tobacco \nlegislation to pay for initiatives for children, including child care, \nanti-smoking education, children's health care, and improvements in \neducation.\n  Clearly, the resolution before us shortchanges children, and that is \nwhy I offered an amendment to establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund.\n  The resolution also reduces funding for the Administration's \neducation priorities by $2 billion, and as a result, about 450,000 \nstudents could be denied safe after-school care in 1999, some 30,000 \nnew children could be denied access to the Head Start program, and\n\n[[Page S3105]]\n\n6,500 middle schools would not have drug and violence prevention \ncoordinators. And yet, while Republican budget increases funding above \nthe President's request for Impact Aid, Special Education, and the \ntitle VI block grant, these increases come at the expense of many other \npriorities that also strengthen our commitment to children and \neducation.\n  Mr. President, this budget as a whole ill-serves children and \nfamilies, and that is why I was pleased to support the Democratic \nalternative budget offered by Senator Lautenberg. The Democratic \nalternative would strengthen our commitment to our priorities by \nproviding funding for key initiatives such as hiring an additional \n100,000 teachers, creating more after-school programs, and doubling the \nnumber of children who receive child care assistance. Further, the \nDemocratic alternative moves us toward our goal of one million children \nin Head Start by 2002, doubles the number of children in early Head \nStart, and places up to 500,000 children in after school learning \ncenters.\n  In addition, Mr. President, the Democratic alternative maintains our \ncommitment to other Democratic priorities such as cleaning up the \nenvironment and investing in our transportation infrastructure. \nMoreover, it would expand Medicare coverage to Americans ages 55-65. \nAnd not least, Mr. President, the Democratic alternative strengthens \nSocial Security by reserving the entire unified budget surplus, while \nmaintaining strict fiscal discipline by meeting the discretionary caps \nin all years.\n  I regret, Mr. President, that the Democratic alternative was \ndefeated. And I regret that the resolution before us today is not one \nthat I, in good conscience, can support. In my view, the Republican \nbudget shortchanges America's working families. I am, however, hopeful \nthat as we move forward in the budget process, we will craft \nlegislation that focuses on priorities like child care, education, \nhealth care, and the environment. Finally, Mr. President, in our \nefforts to craft a budget that targets the needs of working families, \nit is imperative that we remain vigilant in our efforts to maintain \nfiscal responsibility.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Budget \nResolution. And while I will not vote for the final product, I want to \ncompliment both sides of the aisle this year's unique debate over our \nbudget blueprint.\n  For the first time since I arrived in the Senate, the issue of \nbalancing the budget was not an issue. The President started the debate \nthis year by proposing a budget that balances this fiscal year--a full \ntwo years before the proposed Constitutional Balanced Budget Amendment \nwould have demanded it. The Republican members of the Budget Committee \ncountered with the balanced budget before us today, and Democrats \noffered up their substitute, also in balance.\n  This year, partisan attempts to play ``pin the blame for the \ndeficit'' were replaced by a serious discussion of the government's \npriorities. Hot air gave way to an honest airing of our policy \ndifferences. We debated the questions that must be answered in the \nbudget that will guide our legislative actions for the rest of the \nyear--questions about how government should spend its time and energy \nin the coming fiscal year.\n  And it is because of the budget answers those questions that I must \noppose this budget. Though the numbers add up, the policies do not.\n  In short, on too many issues of importance to the families of \nAmerica, this budget is more than silent--it stifles discussion.\n  For example, the budget forbids consideration of a comprehensive \nchild care program for the United States--a plan like that proposed by \nthe President, by Senator Dodd, or by Senator Chafee. Senator Dodd \noffered an amendment to fix this, and it was defeated.\n  How can we support a budget that does not at least allow Congress to \nconsider the child care needs of our youngest children and our hardest \nworking families?\n  At a time when 60 percent of our preschool age children are regularly \ncared for by someone other than their parents, can we accept a budget \nthat will not allow us to debate any proposals to increase the \naccessibility of decent child care?\n  At a time when we are learning more each day about the importance of \nbrain development in the earliest years of life, can we accept a budget \nthat will not allow us to discuss creating more quality early education \nopportunities?\n  At a time when the business world is waking up to the link between \ngood child care and employee productivity, can we accept a budget that \nwill not let Congress also explore how to help working parents work \nwell?\n  This budget also precludes consideration of any of the various \nproposals to implement the tobacco settlement. Under the budget, the \nHatch plan, the emerging McCain bill, the Chafee-Harkin bipartisan \nplan, the Conrad bill, or even the initial tobacco settlement between \nthe State Attorneys General and the tobacco companies would be out of \norder on the Senate floor.\n  This budget silences Congress on two of the most pressing issues that \nface our nation today: How can we give our youngest children the best \nstart to their educations and their lives? And how can we free our \nchildren from the deadly pressure to start smoking?\n  Despite these serious objections, I would like to thank the managers \nof the bill, and the whole Senate, for unanimously accepting my \namendment to the Resolution expressing the Senate's intention to \nprotect our nation's elderly and disabled patients from abuse, neglect \nand mistreatment in long-term care facilities.\n  And I would like to compliment the drafters of this budget for one \nsection. The $30 billion tax cut envisioned in this budget does include \n$9 billion for child care tax credits.\n  As many of you know, I have worked hard to establish a tax credit to \nprovide an incentive to private sector businesses willing to take \nactions that increase the supply of quality child care.\n  My credit will give incentives to large companies--like Wisconsin's \nJohnson Wax or Quad Graphics--that set up state of the art child care \ncenters on-site. And it will provide an incentive for smaller \ncompanies--like the 80 companies in the New Berlin, Wisconsin \nIndustrial Park that joined together to build a child care center open \nto the children of all of their employees.\n  In addition, my credit is not just for the costs of construction--but \nalso for the other substantial costs of providing suitable quality \nchild care: the costs of accrediting a center, of setting up a merit-\nbased pay system for the woefully underpaid child care workers, for \nreserving slots in an existing child care facility, or for hiring a \nresource and referral firm to design the best child care option for a \ngiven company.\n  This proposal has the support of the President, child care advocates, \nthe business community, and the 72 Senators who voted for it as part of \nlast year's tax package. I am glad to see that the budget before us \nalso would support it.\n  However, as much as I would like to see us move forward on my child \ncare tax credit this year, it is only one part of the solution to the \nshortage of quality, educational child care in this country.\n  For years, the Federal budget stole from the future to fund programs \nand pork in the present. The enormous deficits of those years were a \nnational shame.\n  Today, the budget is in balance and moving toward surplus. We have \nreason to be relieved, but not reason yet to be proud. We have stopped \nstealing from our grandchildren, true. But this budget does not let us \neven consider in a comprehensive way their earliest, and most \nimportant, educational needs.\n  We have an obligation to at least discuss how best to nurture our \nyoungest children--and I cannot support a budget that will not allow \nthat.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote down this budget.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senate will soon voice its opinion on \nthe FY1999 Budget Resolution. The debate on this year's resolution \noffered the American people an excellent opportunity to observe each \nparty's fiscal priorities. A budget resolution is essentially a fiscal \nroadmap to the future. Within the confines of scarce resources, a \nbudget resolution forces real choices upon the Democratic and \nRepublican parties.\n  Earlier in the debate, Senate Democrats offered their vision for \nAmerica's\n\n[[Page S3106]]\n\nfuture. Our plan put Social Security first, lived within the spending \nceilings established in last year's budget agreement, and contained key \ndomestic investments and targeted tax cuts for working families. Our \nbudget did all of these things plus one more. According to the non-\npartisan Congressional Budget Office, it maintained balance in 1999 and \nproduced a unified budget surplus for as long as CBO is willing to \nproject.\n  Before taking a look forward and describing our budget priorities for \nthe future, I would like to take a brief look back. Just over 5 years \nago when President Clinton took office, the budget deficit stood at a \nwhopping $290 billion--the highest level in this nation's history. \nWhat's worse, the deficit was projected to grow to over $500 billion by \nthe end of the decade if nothing was done to attack this insidious \nproblem. Fortunately, the President and the Democratic Congress, \nwithout the assistance of a single Republican vote, took action. \nTogether we passed legislation in 1993 that began to both stem the flow \nof red ink and target investments and tax cuts toward working Americans \nand their families.\n  Our political opponents harshly criticized our approach. Although I \nwill not name the names of those who went on record predicting failure \nfor our economic policies, it is not an exaggeration to say that many \nwere predicting a disaster of near biblical proportions. It can also be \nsaid that many who publicly predicted economic ruin in 1993 are still \nhere today, and many who bravely cast their vote for this package in \nthe face of this cascade of criticism are not.\n  And today the results are clear to all. The economic plan Democrats \npassed 5 years ago produced the largest amount of deficit reduction in \nour history. The 1993 plan put us in position for what we accomplished \nthis year--the first unified balanced budget in 30 years. Our plan also \nprovided the foundation for what most economists are calling the \nstrongest economy in a generation. About 15 million new jobs have been \ncreated since its enactment. The unemployment rate is 4.6 percent--a \n25-year low. The core inflation rate is 2.2 percent--the lowest level \nsince 1965. And real average hourly earnings have increased by 2.3 \npercent in 1997 alone--the fastest annual growth rate since 1976. These \npositive indicators moved Goldman Sachs, a distinguished Wall Street \ninvestment firm, to conclude in their March 1998 report on the U.S. \neconomy: ``the current U.S. economic environment is the best ever--\nsteady growth without inflation. As the expansion turns seven years old \nthis month, there is still no recession in sight . . . On the policy \nside, trade, fiscal, and monetary policies have been excellent, working \nin ways that have facilitated growth without inflation.''\n  The Democratic record on deficit reduction and economic growth is \nclear. Our prescriptions for both have produced unprecedented success. \nAnd today we come before the Senate with our plan for the future. This \nplan builds on our past success and is based on four key principles. \nFirst, we will keep the unified budget in balance in 1999 and as far \ninto the future as the Congressional Budget Office is willing to \nproject. Second, our plan generates unified budget surpluses of $143 \nbillion over the period 1999 to 2003 and sets the full amount aside to \nshore up Social Security. Third, the Democratic plan gets the CBO seal \nof approval. According to CBO, it complies fully with the spending caps \nestablished in last year's budget agreement. Fourth, in stark contrast \nto the Republican budget we have been considering on the Senate floor \nthis week, our plan provides funding for key domestic investments and \ntargeted tax relief for working families and businesses.\n  Unfortunately, Senate Republicans defeated this proposal earlier this \nevening. I would like to take a moment now to discuss briefly the \nRepublican fiscal prescription and how it differs from the plan we \noffered earlier. These differences are most visible and most important \nin the area of education. The Democratic budget proposes providing \nfunds to help local school districts hire an additional 100,000 well-\nprepared teachers. This initiative would reduce class size in grades 1 \nthrough 3 from an average of 22 to 18. The Republican budget rejects \nthis proposal.\n  The Democratic budget proposes federal tax credits for local school \ndistricts that build and renovate public schools. The Republican budget \ndoes not even mention school construction.\n  The Democratic budget proposes increasing discretionary funding for \nkey education and training programs, including a $2.2 billion increase \nin 1999 alone. This funding increase supports the High Hopes \ninitiative, after-school learning programs, and educational opportunity \nzones. The Republican budget freezes spending on most important \neducation programs. As a result, about 450,000 kids will be denied \naccess to safe after-school learning centers. About 30,000 kids will be \ndenied access to Head Start. And about 6,500 middle schools will not \nhave drug and violence prevention coordinators.\n  The story is similar on child care and basic research. Within the \noverall context of a balanced budget, Democrats are proposing important \ninitiatives in each of these areas. And the Republicans? Well, they \njust say no. No to education. No to child care. And no to basic \nresearch.\n  The final, but important, difference between the Democratic and \nRepublican budgets is each side's approach to ending tobacco's hideous \nhold on young people in this country. The Democratic budget contains a \ncomprehensive proposal to end Joe Camel's reign over America's \nteenagers. Our budget fully funds anti-youth smoking initiatives, \ntobacco-related medical research, smoking cessation programs, and \npublic service advertising to counter the tobacco's targeting of our \nkids. The Republican budget does none of these.\n  It would be bad enough if the Republican budget stopped there. \nUnfortunately for this generation of teenagers and those that follow, \nit does not. The Republican budget goes even farther. It establishes a \nsupermajority requirement for any future legislation that attempts to \ntackle teen smoking in a comprehensive manner. If this Republican \nbudget as currently constructed is adopted, a minority of this body \nwill be able to dictate whether and how the Congress should reduce the \npower of tobacco companies and weaken the industry's hold on our kids. \nIn other words, the Republican budget stacks the deck against \nmeaningful tobacco reform.\n  In closing, Mr. President, the Democratic approach to tackling this \nnation's fiscal and economic problems has delivered results unmatched \nin recent history. Record deficit reduction and economic growth. Our \nbudget plan for the future would continue this progress. It would \nmaintain fiscal discipline while investing in key domestic initiatives \nsuch as education, child care and basic research. And the Democratic \nbudget is the only plan that allows Congress to construct a \ncomprehensive approach to reducing teen smoking and provides the \nresources to do so. At the same time, the Republican budget before us \nrejects many of these principles.\n  Therefore Mr. President, it is for all of these reasons that I ask my \ncolleagues to just say no to this Republican budget.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank everyone for their patience and in particular \nstaff on the Republican side and the Democrat side for the marvelous \nwork they have done. Let me say we are going to vote on this shortly. I \nfeel rather proud. What we are going to do is move in a strong \ndirection toward saving Medicare, saving Social Security, a significant \ntax cut, increases in education, and increases in criminal justice, the \nNational Institutes of Health and programs of that sort. Yet we have \nnot broken the caps and we will have balanced budgets for quite some \ntime if we follow this format as we implement it during the year.\n  Once again I thank everyone in that regard.\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator yield for a moment? I am informed by \nstaff that, assuming the passage of this resolution, it will be the \nearliest the Senate has ever passed a budget resolution and probably \nthe first time that the manager has not lost a single amendment in \nwhich he was interested.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wanted to make the Members aware of that \nalso,\n\n[[Page S3107]]\n\nand also congratulate Senators Domenici and Lautenberg for the way they \nhave worked together and the way they moved us through this very long \nprocess. It has been completed in record time, and I think we all owe \nthem a debt of gratitude and appreciation.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LOTT. Before I yield the floor, so Members will know this before \nwe go to the vote, we will be in session tomorrow, but only for wrapup. \nWe do have some Executive Calendar nominations I think we can clear. We \nhave gotten agreement on the Shipping Act, so we will have debate on \nthe bill and on one amendment, but the vote will not occur on that bill \nuntil we return. We will return on April 20, but the first recorded \nvote will be the morning of Tuesday, April 21. So after this recorded \nvote, that is the final vote for the night and for the week and the \nnext will be April 21. Thank you all for your cooperation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Will there be opportunity tomorrow to speak as in \nmorning business?\n  Mr. LOTT. Absolutely.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to also congratulate the \ndistinguished chair and ranking member for the great job they did and \ncommend everyone for their cooperation. We were able to finish tonight \nalmost on time, in large measure because of the cooperation. I \nappreciate that. We come to a different conclusion about the final \nresult, but there is no doubt about the cooperation and effort and \nleadership demonstrated by the chair and the ranking member.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, if I might add a word also, to say \nthat working with our colleagues on the Republican side, particularly \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee with whom I work closely and I \nconsider a friend, we try to handle disagreements in a positive \nfashion. Sometimes it gets a little edgy, but rarely.\n  I also want to say I thought, and I was discussing it with a couple \nof Senators here, that there was a degree of comity in this \ndeliberation that is an improvement, I think, over what we have seen in \npast years. It is a much better way to work. I thank our leader for his \nsupport and also to say to the majority leader that his steady hand \nhelped move things along. It has been an excellent experience. I wish \nwe had won more than we did, but we go away knowing that we had a fair \nchance at the deliberation. That is what counts.\n  I particularly want to say to Phil Gramm and to Senator Nickles, I \nthank them for their gesture--with the encouragement of the majority \nleader--in kind of righting what we took to be a wrong. I want to \nacknowledge it publicly.\n  With that, I thank my friend from New Mexico and hope we will have \nlots of occasions to do these budget resolutions--with me in the \nmajority seat. I hope we will be able to do this many times.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Democratic staff of the Budget Committee \nfor a job well done. They are Amy Abraham, Phil Karsting, Dan Katz, Jim \nKlumpner, Lisa Konwinski, Diana Meredith, Marty Morris, Sue Nelson, Jon \nRosenwasser, Paul Seltman, Scott Slesinger, Mitch Warren, and, with \nparticular thanks, Bruce King.\n  Also, I extend my thanks to the Democratic floor staff and the \nSecretary for the Minority for a job exceptionally well done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on agreeing to S. Con. \nRes. 86, as amended.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to update my \nSenate colleagues on an important piece of legislation enacted in the \nlast Congress. The bill, now a law, was about regulatory reform of a \nsegment of the energy community, namely natural gas pipelines. As DOT \nbegins the rulemaking process required by law, they do so with improved \nregulatory reform guidelines.\n  Although this law only affects one statute and one agency it is real \nregulatory reform. It is the government and industry working together \nto make each more efficient and effective. It is government being held \naccountable for its rulemaking and regulatory decisions.\n  This law, the Accountable Pipeline Safety and Partnership Act of \n1996, passed the 104th Congress, bringing with it provisions that \nstrengthen risk assessment, cost/benefit analysis and peer review. Last \nweek the Department of Transportation announced its first participant \nin a demonstration program where the rules will be flexibly applied and \npipeline safety will be improved.\n  The Accountable Pipeline Safety and Partnership Act has two important \nelements which make it unique. First, all new pipeline safety \nregulations must undergo a risk assessment and cost/benefit analysis. \nThis is crucial, because it ensures that new regulations and limited \npublic resources are focused to maximize public benefit. This is real \nregulatory reform.\n  The second notable element of the Accountable Pipeline Safety and \nPartnership Act is the risk management demonstration project. Intended \nto move the agency beyond the old ``command-and-control'' style of \nregulating, this project allows individual pipelines to propose their \nown safety procedures to DOT for review and approval. This type of risk \nmanagement takes us to a higher and more sophisticated level of safety \nregulation. Once again, the agency is encouraged to direct limited \nresources towards activities that provide maximum safety to the public. \nThis, too, is real regulatory reform.\n  The Office of Pipeline Safety, has received a number of applications \nfrom pipeline companies that want to participate in the risk management \ndemonstration project. One company has been approved and five other \napplicants are close to approval. These proposals have bolstered \ninnovation in safety policy, and have encouraged pipeline companies to \nthink beyond simple compliance with existing standards. The government \nis learning to think ``outside of the box'' and to consider creative \nindustry solutions. This genuine reengineering partnership illustrates \nthe fruits of real regulatory reform.\n  The demonstration project illustrates a commitment by a number of DOT \ncivil servants to the principles of this law. Three key staff deserve \nrecognition for rapidly implementing the law: Kelley Coyner, Rich \nFelder, and Stacey Gerad. These civil servants ensured that the \nAmerican public gets greater safety and environmental protection when \nindustry is given flexibility. This law is a bargain for America.\n  The Accountable Pipeline Safety and Partnership Act has restored \ntrust between regulators and the regulated community. This new found \ntrust will permit the sharing of research information that can be \ntranslated into improved pipeline safety technology. This trust has \nmaximized both government and private dollars.\n  Enacting this legislation is a formal recognition that there is a \nvalid role for risk assessment and cost/benefit analysis in federal \nrulemaking. These steps must be taken when regulating, not simply as a \ncheck off or to satisfy requirements of transparency, but to genuinely \nincorporate the results into how the rules are made. Cost is an \nessential factor and cannot be dismissed by rulemakers.\n  This regulatory reform is the law of the land for a small sector of \nour federal system.\n  This incremental effort changed a public policy by establishing a new \nlevel of confidence among stakeholders. It did not create a cloud of \nlegislative doubt and confusion. To the contrary, it received \noverwhelming support from both chambers of Congress. This initiative is \nindeed a genuine bipartisan regulatory reform approach.\n  Regulatory reform should be incremental and fully bipartisan. If this \nCongress considers just one element of the regulatory process this year \nI believe it should be risk. There is a clear consensus among our \ncolleagues that changes must be made to the rulemaking process. Risk is \nthe basis for every rule, and should be the center of our next \nlegislative correction.\n  I frequently draw a comparison between risk and a dog's ear. As you \nwash a dog, it has a tendency to want to shake the water and shampoo \noff. Because a dog starts shaking at the head and will not stop until \nthe final flick of the tail, holding the ear will stop the shaking. \nJust as the dog's ear is the starting point of a shake, risk is the \nstarting point of the rulemaking process. Without a risk, there can be \nno rule. Without a free ear, a dog cannot spray water everywhere. The \nwater and shampoo will be effectively applied to the desired subject, \nand not wasted by going everywhere. Get risk right and the regulated \nindustry will have respect for the rulemaking process. Ignoring risk \nand working on anything else is like holding the dog's tail --you will \nget soaked as the dog shakes from the head down to its tail. \nUnnecessary rules and regulations will abound.\n  I want to thank my colleagues for their attention. Regulatory reform \nis a passion in which I have invested six years. It is an area I will \nremain engaged in because more legislative changes are needed. It may \ntake years of incremental efforts, but only this step-by-step approach \nwill generate the confidence and comfort necessary to reform the \nrulemaking process. Current regulations were enacted during the years \nwhen the philosophical approach was one-size-fits-all. This is no \nlonger operative. These rules and procedures should be updated in a \ndeliberate but incremental manner to reflect today's modern approach--\nan approach that permits innovative technology and offers flexibility.\n  Mr. President, the approval of this demonstration program is a \nvalidation of today's modern approach. Safety will not be jeopardized \nand environmental protection will not be compromised. It is a \nrecognition that regulatory reform, when done incrementally and with \nthe goal of producing effective regulations, can have a real impact on \ngovernment's rulemaking.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/02/senate-section/article/S3108-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3108-S3109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                LEADERSHIP TRAINING INSTITUTE FOR YOUTH\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to announce that \nstudents from the great state of Mississippi, and from a number of \nother states, are participating in the Leadership Training Institute \nfor Youth. This year the program will be held in Missouri.\n  This invaluable program reaches out to our nation's most important \nresource, our children. As you know, ensuring safety and effectiveness \nin schools is an important priority for this Congress. This privately \nfunded initiative helps Congress fulfill its fundamental goal of \nproviding our nation's students with the best education in the world.\n  The Institute, headquartered in Arkansas, brings together students \nfrom communities throughout the nation and from families in all walks \nof life. It is important to recognize that the young people selected \nfor the program might not have this kind of leadership opportunity \navailable to them in their local communities or even in their home \nstates.\n  The Leadership Training Institute instills in our youth a sense of \npurpose, belonging, spirituality, patriotism, and strong moral and \nethical character. The Institute's teaching philosophy centers on \nbiblical principles and the tenets espoused by America's founding \nfathers. Students learn that real leaders are people of faith, \nintegrity, conviction, and moral fiber.\n  These high school and college age students are given hands-on \nexperience in dealing with compelling political, social, and ethical \nissues. These students work with experts from a wide\n\n[[Page S3109]]\n\nrange of disciplines to examine leadership competencies, civic \nresponsibility, community and family values, as well as a number of \nother topics important to America's youth.\n  During the program, these future leaders will explore such issues as \nhow to: achieve a smaller, more effective government; reduce the burden \nof taxes on America's working families; reform the IRS; improve \neducation and expand learning opportunities; and, combat violence and \ndrugs in schools.\n  Mr. President, this sounds like our Senate's agenda.\n  These students will also meet with local, state, and national leaders \nto reflect on issues that truly matter--such as family, faith and \nfreedom. As you know, family, faith and freedom must be the cornerstone \nof our public policy.\n  Mr. President, I think this is an outstanding initiative and commend \nthe efforts of the Leadership Training Institute for offering this \nmodel program to Mississippi's youth.\n  These young achievers are our nation's future business executives and \npublic officials. It gives me great hope for America's future to know \nthat these young minds are being exposed to the challenging programs \nbeing offered by the Leadership Training Institute. I firmly believe \nthat each student who graduates from the Institute will posses the \nstrong, solid moral and value driven foundation needed to guide our \nnation into the next century.\n  Again, I want to express my deep appreciation to the Leadership \nTraining Institute for Youth for conducting this exemplary program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/02/senate-section/article/S3108-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3109-S3111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ELOQUENT TRIBUTES TO SENATOR ABE RIBICOFF\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, earlier this year, the Senate lost one of \nour ablest, most respected, and most beloved former colleagues, Senator \nAbraham A. Ribicoff of Connecticut.\n  Senator Ribicoff served his constituents and his country with \nextraordinary distinction over a career that spanned more than four \ndecades. His interests ranged far and wide, and his achievements were \nlegion in both domestic and foreign policy. He led the effort to \nestablish the Departments of Education and Energy. He was a consistent \nand eloquent advocate for civil rights, and an opponent of bigotry in \nall its forms. He was a brilliant leader in advancing the cause of \npeace in the Middle East. In these and many other ways, he was a giant \nfor the people of Connecticut and the nation.\n  For my family, Senator Ribicoff was far more than the distinguished \nleader of a neighboring state. He was a loyal friend and trusted \nadviser, and one of President Kennedy's closest and most loyal friends.\n  My brother had immense respect for him. They had served together in \nthe House of Representatives in the 1940's and early 1950's. After \nCongressman Ribicoff went on to become Governor of Connecticut, and my \nbrother was elected to the Senate, they continued their close ties.\n  At the Democratic Convention in 1956, Abe encouraged Jack to run for \nVice President. Four years later, Abe was one of my brother's strongest \nsupporters in his 1960 campaign for the White House.\n  When Jack became President in 1961, he chose Governor Ribicoff to \njoin his Cabinet as Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, and he \ndid an outstanding job. But in many ways, he was a legislator at heart. \nHe was elected to the Senate in 1962, the same year I was elected, and \nwe served together for 18 beautiful years until he retired in 1980. In \na sense, I inherited Abe from Jack, and our friendship was all the \nstronger because of that.\n  At Senator Ribicoff's funeral, our colleague Senator Dodd and U.S. \nCircuit Judge Jon O. Newman delivered eloquent eulogies that captured \nthe essence of Abe's remarkable public life. I ask unanimous consent \nthat these moving tributes be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the tributes were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Eulogy for Senator Abraham A. Ribicoff\n\n                    (By Senator Christopher J. Dodd)\n\n  The sadness of losing our friend Abraham Ribicoff is reflected in the \nfaces gathered here today. Whether you called him Governor, Senator, or \nsimply Abe, as the people of Connecticut did for more than four \ndecades, he was truly in a class by himself. We are thus gathered to \nhonor the memory of an outstanding American.\n  Abe Ribicoff believed fervently that the highest calling one can have \nin American life is public service.\n  He is the only person in our Nation's history to have served as a \nstate legislator, a municipal judge, a United States Representative, a \nGovernor, a Cabinet Secretary, and a United States Senator.\n  As many of you recall--Abe had a gift of giving speeches short and to \nthe point. He had to. It took so long to introduce him properly.\n  But to appreciate Abraham Ribicoff, it is important to understand \nthat he did more than occupy an impressive collection of public \noffices. What distinguished Abe Ribicoff from his peers, both past and \npresent, is not the number of offices he held, but the manner in which \nhe held them.\n  In Abe Ribicoff's politics, there was no place for meanness, no place \nfor personal attacks. Abe understood the importance of public opinion. \nBut he never relied on polls to shape his political decisions.\n  Abe was guided in his life's work by integrity, candor, high \nprinciple, and a deeply-held belief in the goodness and decency of \nAmericans.\n  I remember his 80th birthday celebration. It was a wonderful evening, \nCasey. He spent a good deal of his remarks reminiscing. Not about his \nwork on the great issues of his day, nor the times he spent with Prime \nMinisters and Presidents. Abe Ribicoff spoke at length that evening \nabout John Moran Bailey, the legendary Democratic party chairman from \nConnecticut. In John Bailey, Abe recognized a master of the political \ncraft.\n  Now, why do I mention this? Because to have a true understanding of \nthe man, Abe Ribicoff, you must begin with this fact: Abe loved \npolitics. At his core, Abe Ribicoff was a first class politician: a \nquality shared by all great political leaders.\n  And Abe had uncanny political instincts. Abe could size up a \nsituation, or spot a shift in opinion, on just the slightest whiff of \ninformation.\n  Yet his gift was not to just understand swings in public mood, but to \nanticipate them, and then shape those swings for the public good.\n  He was always several steps ahead of the average politician, but \nnever out of step with the American people.\n  Allow me to illustrate what I mean.\n  In 1954, Abe won his first race for Governor by less than one \npercentage point. Then he went out and told the Connecticut State \nPolice to arrest people who exceeded the speed limit. There are \nprobably people here who can attest to the vigor and extent of that \neffort. His allies said the public would never support him.\n  Abe thought differently. As one historian said, Abe had ``an unerring \ninstinct for the right move at the right time in the complicated game \nof politics.''\n  His get-tough policy saved lives, and it was extremely popular with \nthe people of Connecticut.\n  One of the defining moments in Abe's public life took place in 1968 \nat the Democratic National Convention.\n  Here was a man--a first-term Senator, not unaware that he was \nconfronting the National leadership of his party--willing to stand and \nmake a public plea for civility.\n  In doing so, he appealed to what is best about our Nation and \nourselves--our capacity for tolerance and understanding, our belief \nthat, in a truly civilized society, we live by the rule of law, not the \nrule of force.\n  In that moment, America learned what his family, his friends, and the \npeople of Connecticut had long known--Abe Ribicoff was a National gift.\n  On another occasion during Abe's tenure in the Senate, Mississippi \nSenator John Stennis introduced a resolution calling for northern and \nsouthern schools to be integrated at the same speed. The resolution was \nseen as pure symbolism designed to embarrass northern liberals.\n  Abe Ribicoff confounded everyone. He supported Stennis. ``The \nNorth'', Abe said, ``is guilty of monumental hypocrisy.'' Thanks \nlargely to him, the resolution passed. And thanks to Abe Ribicoff, the \nSenate went back to work debating civil rights, not symbols.\n\n[[Page S3110]]\n\n  Time and time again during his Senate years, Abe demonstrated his \nconsiderable political skills and his remarkable sense of timing. His \nSenate colleagues--regardless of political party--and Presidents--\nirrespective of political persuasion--looked to Abe Ribicoff for \nleadership.\n  He created the Departments of Energy and Education. He took the Tokyo \nRound trade legislation through the Senate, advancing the global trade \nthat today strengthens prosperity in our country and so many others.\n  Abe Ribicoff met with Anwar Sadat and saw in him a man seriously \ninterested in peace--and Abe had the strength to say so, controversial \nas that was.\n  Abe urged the newly elected President, Jimmy Carter, to make peace in \nthe Middle East a priority, and he stood with him in that battle.\n  Abe Ribicoff also believed deeply that America is a land of \nopportunity and equal justice. He abhorred discrimination in all its \nforms. He knew it in his own life.\n  During his campaign for Governor in 1954, an ugly whispering campaign \nquestioned whether Connecticut was ready for a Jewish Governor. Abe \nRibicoff threw aside his notes and answered from the heart:\n\n       In this great country of ours, anybody, even a poor kid \n     from immigrant parents in New Britain, [can] achieve any \n     office . . ., or any position in private or public life, \n     irrespective of race, color, creed, or religion.\n\n  The voters of Connecticut answered by electing Abe Ribicoff their \nGovernor.\n  In 1956, a young Senator from Massachusetts was mentioned as a \npossible vice-presidential candidate. Ironically, many Catholics \nquestioned whether America was ready for an Irish Catholic after what \nhad happened to Al Smith less than three decades earlier.\n  Abe Ribicoff, speaking to the Irish Catholic leadership of the \nDemocratic party, took exception:\n  ``I never thought'', he said, ``I'd see the day when a man of the \nJewish faith had to plead before a group of Irish Catholics about \nallowing another Irish Catholic to be nominated for the position'' of \nVice-President.\n  In 1976, similar questions were raised about whether a born-again \nBaptist could serve as President of the United States. Without a \nmoment's hesitation, this Connecticut yankee answered: judge the man, \njudge his ideas. But do not judge his personal faith.\n  Abraham Ribicoff, this son of Polish Jewish immigrants, lived most of \nhis professional life at the highest, most auspicious levels. He knew \nhis share of Governors, Senators, Presidents, Prime Ministers and \nKings.\n  But he also knew the hardship of growing up poor among the factories \nand mills of New Britain, Connecticut.\n  Perhaps those experiences help explain why even as he rose to the \nhighest levels of American public life, he never forgot about those \nwhom he served. He understood that the power of government, the laws of \nthe land, mean nothing if not harnessed to help ordinary citizens \nsurmount everyday obstacles as well as attain their noblest \naspirations.\n  It's hard to step away from politics. Most politicians don't do it \nvery well. Abe surprised everyone in 1979 when he said he would not run \nfor another term. As he said so often: ``there is a time to come, and a \ntime to go.''\n  Abe Ribicoff's impeccable sense of timing was at work again. I \nremember how proud I was that day in 1980 when he placed my name in \nnomination for his seat in the United States Senate. Even though he was \nleaving politics, he offered his assistance.\n  I suggested we spend an early morning shaking hands with commuters \nheaded for New York. I'll never forget what he said: ``Chris, if I were \nwilling to stand in the cold dawn shaking hands on a train platform in \nStamford, I'd run again myself.''\n  I consider myself very fortunate to have succeeded Abe in the United \nStates Senate, and to have been able to call on him many times for \nadvice and guidance. No one of my generation could have had a better \npolitical mentor or friend.\n  I have spoken of Abraham Ribicoff as a public servant. He was also a \nhusband, a father, and a very proud grandfather. To you, Casey, and the \nfamily I convey--on behalf of Abe's colleagues in the United States \nSenate and the people of Connecticut--our deepest sorrow.\n  Allow me to close with an appropriate reading from Hebrew text.\n\n     Even a long life ends too soon,\n     But a good name endures forever.\n     Blessed is he whose noble deeds remain his memorial\n     After his life on earth is ended.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 Eulogy for Senator Abraham A. Ribicoff\n\n                 (By U.S. Circuit Judge Jon O. Newman)\n\n       Casey, Jane and Steve, Peter and Mercedes, Peter and Robin, \n     and all the family; Governor Roland, Governor O'Neill, \n     Senators and Members of Congress; and the many friends of Abe \n     Ribicoff.\n       We are mourning the death yet celebrating the life of one \n     of the most remarkable public figures of our time. The \n     specifics of his career are well known to all of you. Who \n     else in American public life has served as state legislator, \n     state court judge, U.S. Congressman, Governor, cabinet \n     secretary, and three-term U.S. Senator?\n       But the offices held do not convey the substance of the \n     man. Time does not permit a full chronicling of his \n     achievements nor would such a litany adequately reveal what \n     was most important about the public service of Abe Ribicoff--\n     it was the way he went about the task of translating \n     representative government into action. He did not measure \n     public opinion to see what course was safe. He relied on his \n     instincts, his mind, his heart, and ultimately his conscience \n     to guide him toward leadership roles on the vital issues that \n     confronted his state, his nation, and the world.\n       He was in the forefront of those issues, often identifying \n     them long before they became politically attractive. In \n     Connecticut, his issues were fiscal responsibility, court \n     reform, education, and highway safety. On the national scene, \n     he was a leader in the battles for federal aid to education \n     before that concept became a fact of American life; for \n     Medicare, when that program was just a distant proposal; for \n     welfare reform long before it was understood that welfare \n     needed reforming; and for a host of programs to aid children, \n     medical research, and environmental protection.\n       Abe Ribicoff believed in civil rights and played a key role \n     in crafting the historic Civil Rights Act of 1964, skillfully \n     bridging the political chasm that separated legislators in \n     the North and the South.\n       Years later, he led the efforts to create the Department of \n     Education and the Department of Energy.\n       He was a major figure on the international scene. His \n     issues ranged from free trade to nuclear non-proliferation to \n     strategic arms control. Perhaps his major foreign policy role \n     concerned the Middle East peace effort that culminated in the \n     Camp David Accord. At a time when skeptics doubted the \n     possibility of any progress on that front and politicians \n     feared the risks of trying, he broached the matter \n     forcefully, yet tactfully, to the leadership of Israel and \n     Egypt and to then-President-elect Carter. It was Abe Ribicoff \n     who privately suggested to Anwar Sadat that he make his \n     historic visit to Jerusalem.\n       Abe Ribicoff was that essential figure in the life of a \n     vibrant democracy--a link between the citizens who gave him \n     their votes and their trust, and the seats of governmental \n     power where he made the system work for the public interest. \n     He won votes but he did not pander. He exercised governmental \n     power but he did not abuse it. He respected people and \n     institutions, and he brought out the best in both.\n       And always he conducted himself with dignity, and a keen \n     sense of who he was and where he came from. He was at east \n     with presidents and kings, with corporate leaders in Hartford \n     and shipyard workers in New London.\n       He was a complex man--at times serious and reserved, at \n     times relaxed and full of cheer; tough when necessary, then \n     warm, sensitive and caring; a man admitted from afar who won \n     devotion from those who knew him well.\n       It seemed to me that there was a wonderful blend of \n     characteristics in this uncommon man--always the urbane \n     sophistication yet on occasion just a trace of innocence that \n     never left the son of immigrant parents whose climb to the \n     top began in a tenement on Star Street in New Britain.\n       Connecticut was always in his heart. He loved the State, \n     its cities and towns, its villages and countryside, and \n     especially his beloved Cornwall.\n       Throughout his career, he enjoyed the loyalty and \n     dedication of his staff members, and he always encouraged \n     their advancement to careers on their own. I can assure you \n     that when Abe Ribicoff was in your corner, your changes to \n     success were immeasurably improved. He sponsored my entire \n     public and judicial career, and he was my closest friend in \n     public life.\n       In an era of widespread cynicism about the political and \n     governmental systems of our Nation, Abe Ribicoff lived the \n     sort of public life that represented the best in the American \n     democracy. He did so because he believed in that democracy.\n       On the night he needed his campaign for governor in 1954, \n     this is what he said to the people of Connecticut:\n       ``When I was a boy growing up in New Britain, Connecticut, \n     as a young boy I would walk to the outskirts of the town \n     through the fields, heavy with the smell of summer\n\n[[Page S3111]]\n\n     growth, and I would lie under a tree and I would dream. Yes, \n     I dreamed the American Dream. And what was the American \n     Dream?\n       ``Frankly, at that time, I never dreamed that some day I \n     would be a nominee for governor. I knew this great country \n     because I had studied its history, and loved it. I knew that \n     in this great country, any boy or girl could dream the dreams \n     that could send them vaulting to the sky, no matter high. I \n     knew that in America generations after generations, no matter \n     how humble, could rise to any position in the United States \n     of America, whether it be in private industry, in business, \n     in the professions, or in government.\n       ``Now, it is not important whether I win or lose--that is \n     not important tonight at all. The important thing, ladies and \n     gentleman, is that Abe Ribicoff is not here to repudiate the \n     American Dream. Abe Ribicoff believes in that American dream \n     and I know that the American dream can come true. I believe \n     it from the bottom of my heart, and your sons and daughters, \n     too, can have the American dream come true.''\n       Abe Ribicoff helped make democracy work, and he served \n     throughout his extraordinary career as he lived and as he \n     died--with decent instincts, with integrity, and with \n     dignity. He loved his family, his God, his state, and his \n     country, and all of us who knew him have lasting memories of \n     a remarkable human being.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/02/senate-section/article/S3109-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3111-S3113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ELOQUENT TRIBUTES TO ``GOOSE'' McADAMS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, earlier this year, Michael E. McAdams, a \nrespected consultant and friend to many of us here in Washington, D.C., \npassed away.\n  Mr. McAdams--affectionately known as ``Goose'' by his many friends \nand associates--was a passionate, intelligent, effective advisor and \nconsultant. During his extraordinary career, he worked closely with me, \nwith our colleagues Senator Dodd, Senator Biden, and Senator Pell as \nwell as with Speaker Tip O'Neill and many others, and we admired and \nrespected him very much.\n  In addition, Goose worked abroad with the National Democratic \nInstitute. To citizens of South Africa, Botswana, Czechoslovakia, and \nmany other countries, he brought his vast knowledge of the institutions \nof democracy, and his fervent belief that democracy is the best hope \nfor freedom and political stability.\n  At his funeral, the eulogies by Senator Dodd and by Goose's friend \nJoseph Hassett recalled Goose's extraordinary life in very moving \nterms. I ask unanimous consent that these eloquent tributes be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the tributes were ordered printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                          Michael Egan McAdams\n\n                  September 5, 1944--February 25, 1998\n\n                     ``Final Words For My Friend''\n\n                        (By Christopher J. Dodd)\n\n       Hope, Steve and Simon, Wootie and Peter--this is for you.\n       Walt Whitman said ``Logic and sermons never convince.'' The \n     same could be said of eulogies.\n       There's no way to say good-bye to your best friend.\n       A friend made at any time of life is a treasure. But a \n     friend made in youth and kept for life is the rarest, most \n     wonderful gift. Michael and I shared that gift for nearly our \n     entire lives.\n       So, little did I suspect that cold January morning, waiting \n     for the Georgetown Prep School bus at the corner of Wisconsin \n     and Q Streets, that the goofy looking, gangly, string bean of \n     a 14 year old--with arms and legs flailing like a windmill, \n     loping down the street, would become my closest pal over the \n     next 40 years.\n       I was about to meet my new classmate, Michael Egan McAdams, \n     ever after to be known as Goose--the Goose, Gooser, the Goo, \n     and many other variations of the name.\n       People often asked how Goose obtained his nickname. Like \n     any good story, there are competing versions. Jay Hickey has \n     his. I have mine. And since I'm the one up here speaking, \n     I'll give you what will from now on be considered the \n     official version.\n       I gave him the name.\n       As a schoolboy, he had long legs and a long neck. He also \n     loved basketball, and had a special fondness for a Harlem \n     Globetrotter named Goose Tatum.\n       Anyway, the name stuck with him for life and he never \n     complained.\n       And when you think about it, why should he have complained?\n       The goose is a noble creature. The goose is loyal for life.\n       The goose flies in a flock to protect his fellow travelers.\n       And when not in flight, the goose rests in gaggles, where \n     he builds large comfortable nests with his companions.\n       The goose is neither a duck, nor a swan. It is something \n     separate, with its own classification. That was our Goose, \n     too. He was special. And we felt special when he stretched \n     his long arms to welcome us into his company.\n       There's an old saying from around the time of the Civil \n     War: ``The goose hangs high.'' It means that all is \n     wonderful, and it refers to the fact that geese fly higher in \n     good weather.\n       With our Goose, we, too, flew high. His enthusiasm for life \n     was infectious. He shared with us his love of politics, \n     language and friends. He loved the bright uncluttered light \n     of the Eastern Shore. With him, life always offered a fresh \n     idea, a good story, a laugh to share.\n       Over the next four decades of our friendship, much of \n     Goose's physical appearance changed for the better, thank \n     God.\n       The clothes he wore that January day years ago, however, \n     remained virtually unchanged over the years. Shirt tail \n     hanging out--shoes that defied description and pants whose \n     cuffs were not only never introduced to his socks, but did \n     not even come close to meeting them.\n       But the ``piece de resistance'', the trademark, the symbol, \n     by which we could all spot Goose in a crowd for the rest of \n     our lives, was the sport jacket.\n       The mangiest piece of apparel I had ever seen. Yellowish/\n     brown in color--with holes and fuzz balls all over--lapels an \n     \\1/8\\ of an inch wide and a hem that hung just above his \n     skinny butt.\n       While I am confident Goose must have bought several of \n     these sport coats over the years, I'm not absolutely certain \n     that the one he was wearing the day we met is different than \n     the one he insisted on being buried in today.\n       Now, to the unacquainted, Goose must have appeared just a \n     sloppy guy. But to those gathered here today to say good-bye \n     to our friend, it says far less about Goose's wardrobe than \n     it does about the wonderful person wearing that coat.\n       On his list of priorities, Goose has always placed himself \n     last. Throughout the years that I knew him, Goose was always \n     doing for others--helping plan events, talking to friends' \n     children, or just listening to our streams of woe.\n       I cannot recall a single instance when Goose was not \n     available to his friends. I can't recall a single major event \n     in my own life over these past 40 years when my pal Goose was \n     not at my side.\n       And while we had a very special relationship, I know that \n     many of you gathered here today had a similar connection with \n     Goose.\n       During those intense four days earlier this week at the \n     Arlington Hospital, I found myself getting angry with Goose's \n     selfishness, for not taking better care of himself. I got \n     angry at myself and others for selfishly asking too much of \n     Goose over the years.\n       And then, despite my very deep and unconsolable grief at \n     the loss of my friend, I realized that Goose--the 14 year old \n     boy I met so long ago, and the man I said I loved and good-\n     bye to 5 minutes before he died--loved people, loved his \n     friends, loved being involved in the lives of the people he \n     cared so much about. So rather than spend time analyzing \n     Goose's life, let us just accept the fact that more or less, \n     Goose lived life the way he wanted to, and we, whom he called \n     friends for however long or short a time--were given a \n     glorious gift from God.\n       Now I am not going to take you on a maudlin 40 year journey \n     of our friendship. Some of the best times Goose and I had \n     together, I am going to enjoy remembering all by myself.\n       Goose's interests were not restricted. In fact, one of the \n     most appealing qualities was his curiosity, but throughout \n     the years of our friendship, three things have remained \n     constant: His love of politics, his love of words and his \n     devotion and loyalty to his friends.\n       Bear with me while I share a few memories. Throughout his \n     life, Goose was a Yellow-dog Democrat.\n       From the time he entered the hospital, Goose would drift in \n     and out of sleep.\n       On the occasions when he was awake, politics was on his \n     mind. ``Why did you vote for that Ronald Reagan Airport?'' he \n     asked. ``I heard your latest polls were up, have you checked \n     the cross-tabs?'' And when I suggested that I should bow out \n     of giving the eulogy at Senator Abe Ribicoff's funeral in New \n     York, he waved at me with something less than all five \n     fingers and gave me the sign to get up to New York and do my \n     job. Always the campaign manager!\n       Goose's family were Adlai Stevenson Democrats and he loved \n     being around politics. In January 1961, we hiked to President \n     Kennedy's Gala in the snow and watched the Inaugural Parade \n     together all the next day.\n       It was at Georgetown Prep that I painfully learned how not \n     only interested Goose was in politics, but also, how adept he \n     was at the game. My good friends Jay Hickey, Paul Bergson and \n     I ran against each other for the office of Vice President of \n     the Yard.\n       For whatever reason, probably because I characteristically \n     got into the race late, Goose had signed on as Jay's campaign \n     manager.\n       And even though Goose designed posters for me which read, \n     ``In Dodd We Trust,'' ``Holy Dodd We Praise Thy Name,'' and \n     ``All Glory to Dodd''--which for obvious reasons the good \n     Jesuits would not allow up--Jay won the race.\n       I did not know what the future would hold for me in those \n     days, but I made a promise to myself that I would never enter \n     another political contest without Goose at my side. And that \n     is where he has been for a quarter of a century.\n\n[[Page S3112]]\n\n       Today, my friend Jay Hickey works for the Horse Council and \n     I'm entering my 24th year in Congress. I rest my case.\n       Over the years, Goose has also worked for Senator Kennedy, \n     Senator Pell, Senator Biden, Speaker O'Neill, and numerous \n     other candidates, both at home and abroad.\n       He was particularly proud of the work he did abroad with \n     the National Democratic Institute teaching the fundamentals \n     of democracy to people in such far flung places as South \n     Africa, Botswana and Czechoslovakia.\n       One of my favorite Goose campaign stories was how, \n     unbeknownst to Goose, his candidate for president in a \n     foreign country had been found guilty of assassination in his \n     younger years.\n       Goose designed the campaign and then convinced the \n     electorate that while the charge was true, it had merely been \n     a college prank!\n       For a person who was so enamored of language, Goose had the \n     most atrocious penmanship of anyone I know.\n       Like his attire, Goose's handwriting is the same today as \n     it was when I was copying his homework in the bus on the way \n     to Prep. Goose was extremely bright and handled his \n     schoolwork with apparent ease. Not surprisingly, his \n     strengths were languages--Latin, Greek, and English.\n       Goose could roar through a crossword puzzle.\n       His love of words and language was also clear in his almost \n     unquenchable appetite for books.\n       I have never known a better-read person or a person who was \n     more able to retain what he had just devoured. And his taste \n     in literature was completely eclectic--history, biography, \n     novels, science fiction, poetry. Goose adored books.\n       How prophetic that his last book was a re-reading of Moby \n     Dick, which he couldn't stop talking about.\n       But to really understand Goose's love affair with words, \n     you only had to bring up the subject of music. From my \n     earliest recollection of Goose, he took such pleasure from \n     songs.\n       Now, I love Goose, but despite my deep affection for him \n     and despite what he thought, any song he sang came out \n     sounding the same--``Greenback dollar''.\n       I can still see him standing on the hall landing on Manning \n     Place--guitar in hand, convinced he was one audition away \n     from joining the Kingston Trio. Then it was the Everley \n     Brothers, Simon and Garfunkel, and countless other groups \n     whose names I never understood, let alone their music.\n       I don't have the slightest idea who wrote or sang the song, \n     ``The House of the Rising Sun.'' But for a period of several \n     years, it seems, the only memory I have of Goose is him \n     singing that damn song.\n       Music was the only interest we did not share in common. But \n     it made little or no difference to my pal Goose. Only a few \n     weeks ago, he put on some music videos and insisted I watch \n     them.\n       It always impressed me that Goose was open to new sounds. A \n     few years ago, he wanted me to hear ``The Cure''. I thought \n     he was involved in some kind of holistic healing!\n       For Goose, the most significant voice was Bob Dylan's. He \n     deeply believed that Dylan was one of the most important \n     poets of this century.\n       Goose loved Bob Dylan. Maybe because Dylan was the only \n     singer whose voice was worse than his.\n       Goose must have told me a thousand times how meaningful it \n     was for him to have been in Newport during the 1965 Folk \n     Festival, when Dylan went electric. For Goose, it was a \n     moment of historic importance, like the moon landing or the \n     end of World War II.\n       How incredibly ironic that on the day we lose Goose, Bob \n     Dylan finally receives the long overdue recognition at the \n     Grammy's.\n       Two thoughts passed through my head:\n       (1) How sorry I was Goose wasn't with us to hear this news; \n     and\n       (2) That old fox, Goose, didn't waste any time up there \n     pulling a few strings for people he cared about. I bet Bob \n     Dylan would be surprised to know he had an angel named Goose.\n       In Goose, Dylan would have found a person who truly was \n     ``Forever Young''--who fulfilled that song's hope of a \n     ``heart always . . . joyful'' and a ``song always . . . \n     sung.'' Goose possessed a freshness, an honesty, a sense of \n     mirth and wonder that grow rare with age.\n       It was Goose's devotion and loyalty to his friends that I \n     will miss the most. Once he was on your side, he was \n     immovable, and what pride and pleasure he took in his \n     friends' success, and how incredibly comforting his silent \n     presence could be when the news was not good.\n       Over the past days, as we have reminisced about our \n     memories of Goose, one point was repeated over and over and \n     over again:\n       Goose had the ability to forge strong bonds of friendship \n     with not only a wide range of people intellectually and \n     professionally, but also with people from completely \n     different generations, oftentimes within the same family.\n       Understand what I am saying. I do not just mean being \n     friendly to someone's children or their parents. I mean \n     forming long, serious friendships with these people, separate \n     and distinct from each other.\n       A mere glance around this church reflects what I am saying.\n       The reason Goose did this so easily was because he treated \n     everyone alike.\n       He didn't talk down to children, or try to ingratiate \n     himself with someone's parents. He answered questions \n     honestly--and most importantly, he listened. Goose had an \n     easy and natural way with his male friends--and he had long \n     lasting and trusting relationships with women.\n       A friend of mine who did not know Goose that well told me a \n     story that explains why. One summer afternoon, she and a \n     group of women friends were sitting by his pool on the \n     Eastern Shore. This woman said to him: ``You must be in \n     heaven surrounded by beautiful women.'' ``No,''\n       Goose said, ``surrounded by smart women.'' Goose's fondness \n     for kids is well known. There are many young people here \n     today who have come long distances because they wanted to say \n     goodbye themselves.\n       I always loved the story of one young lady who is here \n     today. When she was about 10 years old she decided the \n     godfather she had been given at birth was not performing very \n     well. On her own, she went to Goose and asked him if he would \n     take on the job.\n       The night Goose arrived at the hospital, a dear friend to \n     Goose suggested a book be kept of all the calls and visitors. \n     When asked why, she said so Goose will know that he has \n     friends.\n       Well Goose, we never kept the book and we lost you too \n     quickly. But we know that you know this church is filled with \n     your friends. Therefore, in the words of another great \n     Irishman, you can say:\n\n     Think when man's glory\n     Most begins and ends\n     And say, my glory is\n     I had such friends.\n\n       The last thing I want to tell you is how strong Goose was \n     at the end. When given the news that there was no hope, he \n     was furious. Then anger became resolve and very quickly he \n     set his house in order. Goose's friends Tom Bryant and Jackie \n     were at his side early Wednesday morning.\n       Goose left us with great strength and dignity.\n\n     So dear friends--\n     Do not let your grief be equal to his worth\n     For then your sorrow\n     Hath no end.\n\n                     ``Goose'' by Joseph M. Hassett\n\n       The essence of Goose was the total intensity with which he \n     lived every minute of his life. So much of that intensity was \n     invested--not in some selfish pursuit of his own--but in the \n     sheer delight of talking with his friends--amusing them, \n     supporting them, and glorying in their triumphs.\n       Goose was unnatural in our success-besotted age because he \n     was a true believer in the ancient Roman religion summed up \n     by Horace when he said ``Carpe diem quam minimum credula \n     postero'' (Seize the day, trusting as little as possible to \n     tomorrow). Trusting as little as possible to tomorrow was \n     another part of the essence of Goose. He seized the day with \n     such intensity that his life burned like a firecracker's \n     fuse. And in the spark and crackle of that shimmering fuse \n     lies the awful logic of Goose's early death: the fuse burned \n     too intensely to burn too long.\n       William Butler Yeats revealed this logic in terms of the \n     difference between lives that burn slowly like damp faggots \n     and those that consume themselves in the flash of intensity. \n     Yeats could have been writing about Goose when he wrote these \n     lines about Robert Gregory:\n\n     Some burn damp faggots, others may consume\n     The entire combustible world in one small room\n     As though dried straw, and if we turn about\n     The bare chimney is gone black out\n     Because the work has finished in that flare.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n     What made us dream that he could comb grey hair?\n\n       What made us dream that our beloved Goose could comb grey \n     hair? His life burned too brightly for that, consuming itself \n     in the lavish gifts of his genius for friendship, his \n     prodigal profusion of empathy for his friends, his delight in \n     the simple fact of their being there.\n       Goose had a unique and precious ability to experience and \n     communicate the sublimity of a moment of being alive. I \n     think, for example, of the beautiful glow of pure joy \n     radiating from Goose on a Sunday afternoon's sail on Rehoboth \n     Bay: Coach at the tiller, the wind behind us, the late \n     afternoon sun angling off the water in silver glitter, and \n     Goose's exultation in this splendor of it all.\n       That exultant glow was Goose's special brand of magic. It \n     was an ability to recreate the rapture the Romantics thought \n     had vanished from the world--what Shelley called the ``clear, \n     keen joyance'' of the skylark; what Wordsworth called ``the \n     hour of splendour in the grass''; what Keats heard in the \n     nightingale singing ``of summer in full-throated ease.''\n       Every one of you, I know, experienced just such a moment \n     with Goose--a moment in which he made this tarnished world \n     shine; and made it shine for you--because of you, because of \n     something you did. And so, when Goose died, a spot of joy in \n     each of us died with him.\n       That is why it is such a bitter pill we swallow here this \n     morning. We do have, at least, the consolation of our \n     beautiful memories of our dear, dead Goose. His kindred \n     spirits, the Romans, thought that such moments were a form of \n     immortality, that memorable characters like Goose live on in \n     the memories of their friends.\n\n[[Page S3113]]\n\n       No doubt many of your memories will feature Goose's voice, \n     talking the midnight through in full-throated ease. None of \n     us will forget those nocturnal plumbings of the depths of \n     life, the universe and everything. They may have taken place \n     at Channing's mistake, at your house, at your parents' house, \n     at Dolan's at Bethany, at John Sis's parents', at John and \n     Mary Sis's at Wintergreen, at Bobby Sis's in Annapolis, at \n     Julio and Jean's, at Baba Groom's on the Eastern Shore, at \n     104 West Street, at 77 Holly Road, at the Roma, Poor Roberts, \n     the Raw Bar . . . Wherever those conversations took place, \n     they are the stuff of beautiful memories. And better still, \n     is the memory of waking up the next morning and gradually \n     becoming aware that, somewhere in the depths of the house, \n     Goose was already sounding the themes of the new day. We \n     still have our memories of that happy voice.\n       The Greek poet Callimachus wrote a beautiful poem about the \n     way in which the voices of conversations like those we had \n     with Goose can live on in our memory. Callimachus's poem grew \n     out of the death of his friend Heraclitus while on a journey \n     to Caria in Asia Minor. When the bitter news reached \n     Callimachus, he was filled with grief. But there was room \n     amongst the tears for the comforting memory of how the two \n     friends had talked long into the night, had, as Callimachus \n     said in his poem, ``tired the sun with talking and sent him \n     down the sky.''

Mr. President, last week, the conferees on the \nAgricultural Research bill made a down payment toward restoring food \nstamps for the needy legal immigrants. The conference report on the \nbill includes $818 million for this program. It is far less than the $2 \nbillion proposed in the President's budget, and it covers a much \nsmaller group of immigrants.\n  The conferees' proposal is a bipartisan effort. Both Republicans and \nDemocrats urged them to take this step as soon as possible.\n  Yet, the Republican leadership in the Senate is ignoring the urgent \nneed. The Republican budget does not include a single penny to restore \nfood stamps to immigrant children, refugees, Hmong veterans, or elderly \nand disabled legal immigrants, and the Republican leadership has \ndeclined to allow the Senate to pass the Agricultural Research bill.\n  The food stamp cut-off has hurt immigrant families, and it has also \nhurt state and local governments, who must fill the gap. As a result, \ngovernors and state legislatures have joined Congress to restore these \nfood stamp benefits. As Governor Bush of Texas said, ``Food stamps are \na federal program and the federal responsibility, but the federal \ngovernment is shirking its responsibility. The rules have changed \nunfairly and retroactively for those least able to help themselves.''\n  Today, the Massachusetts House of Representatives passed a resolution \nurging Congress to restore adequate federal funding to the food stamp \nprogram so needy immigrants in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts can \nreceive desperately needed food aid. I ask unanimous consent that this \nresolution be placed in the Record following my remarks.\n  It is time for the Senate to act on the Agricultural Research bill. \nIt is unconscionable that these benefits can continue to be denied.\n  There being no objection, the resolution was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             The Commonwealth of Massachusetts--Resolution\n\n       Whereas, in August of nineteen hundred and ninety-six, the \n     United States Congress enacted the Personal Responsibility \n     and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, so-called; \n     and\n       Whereas, Congress in said act forbade use of Federal funds \n     to provide SSI benefits and food stamp benefits for \n     financially needy immigrants lawfully residing in the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas, legal immigrants pay taxes and contribute in many \n     ways to the productivity and vitality of our communities; and\n       Whereas, the United States was founded and built by \n     immigrants; and,\n       Whereas, Congress should be applauded for the restoration \n     of SSI benefits for legal immigrants through passage of the \n     Balanced Budget Act of 1997; and\n       Whereas, Congress must continue in this effort by resolving \n     to restore its financial responsibility in the Food Stamp \n     Benefits Program as the present situation imposes a financial \n     burden on the States and needy residents of the States: Now \n     therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Massachusetts House of Representatives \n     requests that the President and the Congress of the United \n     States restore to the States the authority to provide \n     Federally funded food stamp benefits to needy, lawful \n     residents of the United States; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Massachusetts House of Representatives \n     respectfully requests that the President and the Congress of \n     the United States restore to the Commonwealth adequate \n     Federal funding to allow for the provision of food stamp \n     benefits for financially needy immigrants lawfully residing \n     in this Commonwealth; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be transmitted \n     forthwith by the clerk of the House of Representatives to the \n     President of the United States of America, the presiding \n     officer of each branch of the United States Congress and each \n     member of the Massachusetts Congressional Delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/02/senate-section/article/S3113-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3113-S3114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             RUNNING' UTES\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I spent part of last weekend in San Antonio \nat the Alamodome watching some of the most exciting basketball I have \nseen in a long time.\n  I was there as one of the ``Runnin' Utes'' biggest fans. In a state \nthat has a strong basketball tradition, the University of Utah men's \nbasketball team has given us an extraordinary season. Our entire state \nis proud of this team and proud of its coach, Rick Majerus.\n  It is a tribute to the exceptional skills of any college team to make \nit to the ``Final Four.'' The two games on Saturday evening were a \nsports fan's dream. Stanford and North Carolina put their best into the \ngames, and they were exciting to watch.\n  Of course, I am disappointed in the outcome of Monday's final \nchampionship game in which Utah lost to another fine team from the \nUniversity of Kentucky--a team which has become known as the ``Comeback \nCats.''\n  Nevertheless, Monday night's championship game caps a brilliant \nseason for the Utes that started with the longest undefeated streak in \nthe country and ended in a fantastic tournament run to the finals. The \nchampionship battle showcased two teams that were not favored to be \nthere. Despite Kentucky's tremendous history and great success in the \n1990s, the Wildcats were overshadowed by other teams who filled the top \nspots in the polls all year. Similarly, Utah was overlooked by many \nsportswriters for much of the year, even though it began the season \nwith the best record in the country.\n  Mr. President, the University of Utah's season was a great \naccomplishment not only for the team, but also for the entire \nuniversity community, the Western Athletic Conference, and the great \nState of Utah.\n  Since taking over the reins at the ``U'' in 1989, Coach Rick Majerus \nhas made Utah one of the best teams in the country during the 1990s. He \nhas done so by encouraging tremendous discipline and work ethic, \nstressing both basketball fundamentals and positive attitude. Rick \nMajerus is also a coach who cares about his players beyond their \nability to play ball; he understands the importance of other aspects of \nthe university mission, including academics and community citizenship. \nIt is important to note that Ute players have excelled in other \npursuits as well. Seniors Michael Doleac and Drew Hansen, for example, \nare headed for medical school and law school respectively.\n  Mr. President, I am extremely proud of the University of Utah for a \ntremendous year. It is said that everyone loves a winner. Well, this \nteam has been truly outstanding both on and off the court. They have \nwon with grace and lost with dignity. These same attributes are \nreflected in the loyal Utah fans. Some 4000 die-hard supporters viewed \nthe game on a giant screen in the university's Huntsman Center. And, \ndespite the heartbreaking loss, Ute fans have continued to be proud of \ntheir team. After the players and\n\n[[Page S3114]]\n\ncoaches returned to campus late Tuesday, they joined students and fans \nin an exuberant pep rally to celebrate their achievements. On \nWednesday, a parade was held in their honor, culminating on the steps \nof City Hall. Mayor Deedee Corradini and the city council presented the \nteam with the key to the city.\n  I want to congratulate the entire Ute team: The coaching staff, \nincluding Coach Majerus and his great assistant coaches Donny Daniels, \nJeff Judkins, and Brock Brundhorst. And, my hat is off to the players: \nMichael Doleac, Drew Hansen, Andre Miller, Hanno Mottola, Alex Jensen, \nJordie McTavish, David Jackson, Nate Althoff, Greg Barratt, Jon \nCarlisle, Trace Caton, Britton Johnsen, and Adam Sharp. Thanks for \ngiving us so much to cheer about.\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  MR. HELMS.

Mr. President, it is time the Administration woke up to \nthe critical need for a common sense encryption policy in this country. \nI have been sounding the alarm bells about this issue for several years \nnow, and have introduced encryption legislation, with Senator Burns and \nothers, in the last Congress and again in this one, to balance the \nimportant privacy, economic, national security and law enforcement \ninterests at stake. The volume of those alarm bells should be raised to \nemergency sirens.\n  Because of the sorry state of our current encryption policies and, \nspecifically, our export controls on encryption, we are seeing \nincreasing numbers of high-tech jobs and expertise driven overseas. \nRecently, a large computer security company, Network Associates, \nannounced that it will make strong encryption software developed in the \nUnited States available through a Swiss company. Encryption technology \ninvented with American ingenuity, will now be manufactured and \ndistributed in Europe, and imported back into this country. All those \ngood, high-tech jobs associated with Network Associates' encryption \nproduct are now in Europe, not in Silicon Valley, not in Vermont, not \nin any American town, because of our outdated export controls on \nencryption.\n  Network Associates is not the first American company to face the \ndilemma of how to supply its customers, both domestic and foreign, with \nthe strong encryption they are demanding and also comply with current \nexport restrictions on encryption. Other companies, including Sun \nMicrosystems, are cooperating with foreign companies to manufacture and \ndistribute overseas strong encryption software originally developed \nhere at home.\n  I have said before, and repeat here again, that driving encryption \nexpertise overseas is a threat to our national security, driving high-\ntech jobs overseas is a threat to our economic security, and stifling \nthe widespread, integrated use of strong encryption is a threat to our \npublic safety. That is why I have called in legislation for relaxation \nof our export controls on encryption.\n  Over the past month, we have learned of two serious breaches of \ncomputer security that threaten our critical infrastructures. Both \nincidents were apparently caused by teenagers using their home \ncomputers to trespass into the computer systems of the Department of \nDefense, the telephone network, the computer system for an airport \ncontrol tower, and into the computer database of a pharmacy containing \nprivate medical records. One of these adolescent explorations in \ncyberspace disrupted telephone service in Rutland, Massachusetts and \nshut down the control tower at a small airport.\n  The conduct of these teenagers is now the subject of criminal \ninvestigation, due in large part to the great strides we have made in \nupdating our criminal laws to protect critical computer networks and \nthe information on those networks. I am proud to have sponsored these \ncomputer crime laws in the last two Congresses. But targeting \ncybercrime with criminal laws and tough enforcement is only part of the \nsolution. While criminal penalties may deter some computer criminals, \nthese laws usually come into play too late, after the crime has been \ncommitted and the injury inflicted.\n  We should keep in mind the adage that ``the best defense is a good \noffense.'' Americans and American firms must be encouraged to take \npreventive measures to protect their computer information and systems. \nA recent report by the FBI and Computer Security Institute released \nshows that the number of computer crimes and information security \nbreaches continues to rise, resulting in over $136 million in losses in \nthe last year alone.\n  The lesson of the recent computer breaches by the teenagers is that \nall the physical barriers we might put in place can be circumvented \nusing the wires that run into every building to support the computers \nand computer networks that are the mainstay of how we do business. A \nwell-focused cyber-attack on the computer networks that support \ntelecommunications, transportation, water supply, banking, electrical \npower and other critical infrastructure systems could wreak havoc on \nour national economy or even jeopardize our national defense or public \nsafety.\n  We have been aware of the vulnerabilities of our computer networks \nfor almost a decade. In 1988, I chaired hearings of the Subcommittee on \nTechnology and the Law on the risks of high-tech terrorism. It became \nclear to me that merely ``hardening'' our physical space from potential \nattack is not enough. We must also ``harden'' our critical \ninfrastructures to ensure our security and our safety.\n  That is where encryption technology comes in. Encryption is one \nimportant tool in our arsenal to protect the security of our computer \ninformation and networks. Both former Senator Sam Nunn and former \nDeputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick, who serve as co-chairs of the \nAdvisory Committee to the President's Commission on Critical \nInfrastructure Protection, testified at a hearing last month that \n``encryption is essential for infrastructure protection.''\n  Yet, even computer security experts agree that U.S. encryption policy \nhas ``acted as a deterrent to better security.'' As long ago as 1988, \nat my High-Tech Terrorism hearing, Jim Woolsey, who later became the \ndirector of the Central Intelligence Agency, testified about the need \nto do a better job of using encryption to protect our computer \nnetworks.\n  I have long advocated the use of strong encryption by individuals, \ngovernment agencies and private companies to protect their valuable \ncomputer information. Indeed, a major thrust of the encryption \nlegislation I have introduced is to encourage--and not stand in the way \nof--the widespread use of encryption. This would be a plus for both our \nlaw enforcement and national security agencies.\n  Unfortunately, we still have a long way to go to update our country's \nencryption policy to reflect that this technology is a significant \ncrime and terrorism prevention tool. I am particularly concerned by the \ntestimony of former Senator Sam Nunn last month that the ``continuing \nfederal government-private sector deadlock over encryption and export \npolicies''\n\n[[Page S3115]]\n\nmay pose an obstacle to the cooperation needed to protect our country's \ncritical infrastructures.\n  At the heart of the encryption debate is the power this technology \ngives computer users to choose who may access their communications and \nstored records, to the exclusion of all others. For the same reason \nthat encryption is a powerful privacy enhancing tool, it also poses \nchallenges for law enforcement. Law enforcement agencies want access \neven when we do not choose to give it.\n  The FBI has made clear that law enforcement wants immediate access to \nthe plaintext of encrypted communications and stored data, and, absent \nindustry capitulation, will seek legislation to this effect. Indeed, \nwhile much of this debate has focused on relaxation of export controls, \nthe FBI has upped the ante. Recognizing that the encryption genie is \nout of the bottle, the FBI has indicated it may seek import \nrestrictions and domestic controls on encryption.\n  The FBI has told me in response to written questions that: ``[I]f the \ncurrent voluntary efforts are not successful,. . . it is the \nresponsibility of the FBI. . . to seek alternative approaches to \nalleviate the problems caused by encryption. This would include \nlegislative remedies which effectively address law enforcement concerns \nregarding the import of robust encryption products, as well as \nencryption products manufactured for use in the U.S.''\n  The Administration has not disavowed this position. In a recent \nletter to the Minority Leader, the Administration expressed a \npreference for a ``good faith dialogue'' and ``cooperative solutions'' \nover ``seeking to legislate domestic controls,'' but has clearly not \nruled out the latter approach.\n  Even as our law enforcement and intelligence agencies try to slow \ndown the widespread use of strong encryption, technology continues to \nmove forward. Ironically, foot-dragging by the Administration on export \ncontrols and threats by the FBI to call for domestic encryption \ncontrols, have only motivated computer scientists to find alternative \nmeans to protect the privacy of online communications that may, in \nfact, pose more of a challenge to law enforcement.\n  Indeed, the terms of the current encryption debate may soon become \nmoot. The New York Times reported a few weeks ago that Ronald Rivest of \nMIT has developed a new method for protecting the confidentiality of \nelectronic messages that does not use encryption. Instead, this method \nbreaks a message into separate packets, each marked with a special \nauthentication header, and then ``hides'' those packets in a stream of \nother packets. Eavesdroppers would not know which packets were the \n``wheat'' part of the message and which packets were the irrelevant \n``chafe''. As Mr. Rivest noted in his article announcing this \ntechnique, ``attempts by law enforcement to regulate confidentiality by \nregulating encryption must fail, as confidentiality can be obtained \neffectively without encryption and even sometimes without the desire \nfor confidentiality by the two communicants.''\n  I know that others of my colleagues, including Senators Burns, \nDaschle, Ashcroft, Kerrey, and McCain, share my appreciation of \nimportance of this encryption issue for our economy, our national \nsecurity and our privacy. This is not a partisan issue. This is not a \nblack-and-white issue of being either for law enforcement and national \nsecurity or for Internet freedom. Characterizing the debate in these \nsimplistic terms is neither productive nor accurate.\n  Delays in resolving the encryption debate hurt most the very public \nsafety and national security interests that are posed as obstacles to \nresolving this issue. I look forward to working with these colleagues \non sensible solutions in legislation, which will not be subject to \nchange at the whim of agency beauracrats.\n  Every American, not just those in the software and high-tech \nindustries and not just those in law enforcement agencies, has a stake \nin the outcome of this debate. We have a legislative stalemate right \nnow that needs to be resolved, and I plan to work closely with my \ncolleagues on a solution in this congressional session.\n  I commend Senator Ashcroft for holding an encryption hearing last \nmonth and providing a forum to discuss the important privacy and \nconstitutional interests at stake in the encryption debate. How we \nresolve this debate today will have important repercussions for the \nexercise of our constitutional rights tomorrow. Do you agree with me \nthat every American, not just those in the high-tech industries and not \njust those in law enforcement agencies, has a stake in the outcome of \nthis debate?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes, I do. The testimony presented at the hearing made \nclear that how we resolve the law enforcement issues at the heart of \nthe encryption debate may affect the exercise and protections of \nimportant First, Fourth and Fifth amendment rights. While we must \nensure law enforcement the appropriate amount of access we cannot do so \nat the expense of important constitutional liberties. As I mentioned at \nthe hearing, the FBI has argued that a system of mandatory access to \nprivate communications--or a system in which the federal government \nstrongly ``persuades'' individuals to hand over their rights to the \nFBI--would make it easier for law enforcement to do its job. Of course \nit would, but it would also make things easier on law enforcement if we \nsimply repealed the Fourth Amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. These constitutional issues are vital ones for Congress to \nconsider. I understand that efforts are underway for industry \nstakeholders to reach some accommodation with the Administration. I \nencourage constructive dialogue between the Administration and industry \nand, in fact, have been urging a dialogue between law enforcement and \nindustry for over a year. But Congress will continue to exercise \nnecessary oversight to ensure that the privacy and other constitutional \nrights of Americans are protected.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. As the Chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on the \nConstitution, Federalism and Property Rights, you can be assured that \nthe subcommittee will stand ready to provide oversight to ensure that \nno constitutional right of any American is compromised. Several very \nimportant rights were addressed by the witnesses during the hearing, \nand the constitutional concerns of law-abiding citizens must be \nrespected. Importantly, in the ongoing dialogue between industry and \nfederal law enforcement we must make sure that the interests of the \ncitizens of the U.S. are represented and their constitutional rights \nrespected. We must ensure that everyone in the negotiations--including \nthe administration--views the constitutional rights of law abiding \ncitizens as non-negotiable absolutes, not as bargaining chits.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have been concerned about companies, such as Sun \nMicrosystems and Network Associates, using foreign companies to \nmanufacture and distribute strong encryption, which was developed in \nthe United States but may not be exported under U.S. regulations. These \ninstances are just the latest examples that delays in resolving the \nencryption debate is driving overseas cryptographic expertise and high-\ntech jobs, to the detriment of our economy and our national security. \nDo you share these concerns?\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes, I certainly share those concerns. The impact to \nour national security is clear and under the current Administration \npolicy the United States is sending some of our greatest talent and \nproducts to foreign shores, enabling foreign competitors, both to \nindustry and to our national security, to gain a strong foothold. In \njust the past few weeks, Network Associates, our largest independent \nmaker of computer security software, decided to allow its Dutch \nsubsidiary to begin selling strong encryption that does not provide a \nback door for law enforcement surveillance. This move by Network \nAssociates was necessitated by our current wrong-headed export \nprovisions. We have to re-examine these policies. Simply put, strong \nencryption means a strong economy. Mandatory access, by contrast, means \nweaker encryption and a less secure, and therefore less valuable, \nnetwork. This recent example of the export of a manufacturing \nenterprise and the accompanying intellectual capital is only one \nexample of a bad policy weakening our economy.\n  Mr. LEAHY. In my view, encryption legislation should promote the \nfollowing goals:\n\n[[Page S3116]]\n\n  First, legislation should ensure the right of Americans to choose how \nto protect the privacy and security of their communications and \ninformation;\n  Second, legislation should bar a government-mandated key escrow \nencryption system;\n  Third, legislation should establish both procedures and standards for \naccess by law enforcement to decryption keys or decryption assistance \nfor both encrypted communications and stored electronic information and \nonly permit such access upon court order authorization, with \nappropriate notice and other procedural safeguards;\n  Fourth, legislation should establish both procedures and standards \nfor access by foreign governments and foreign law enforcement agencies \nto the plaintext of encrypted communications and stored electronic \ninformation of United States persons;\n  Fifth, legislation should modify the current export regime for \nencryption to promote the global competitiveness of American companies;\n  Sixth, legislation should not link the use of certificate authorities \nwith key recovery agents or, in other words, link the use of encryption \nfor confidentiality purposes with use of encryption for authenticity \nand integrity purposes;\n  Seventh, legislation should, consistent with these goals of promoting \nprivacy and the global competitiveness of our high-tech industries, \nhelp our law enforcement agencies and national security agencies deal \nwith the challenges posed by the use of encryption; and\n  Eighth, legislation should protect the security and privacy of \ninformation provided by Americans to the government by ensuring that \nencryption products used by the government interoperate with commercial \nencryption products.\n  Do you agree with these goals?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes, I agree with these goals and will look to these \nsame items as a reference point for the drafting, introducing and \npassage of encryption reform legislation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Would the Senator agree to work with me on encryption \nlegislation that achieves these goals and that we could bring to the \nfloor this Congress?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes. I believe it is critical for us to address this \nissue and soon. I also believe that we should work together to produce \na piece of legislation that demonstrates our position on encryption \npolicy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/02/senate-section/article/S3114-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             EQUAL PAY DAY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, tomorrow, April 3, 1998, is Equal Pay Day. \nThis is the day by which women will have had to work all of 1997 and \nthe first three months of 1998 to make what a man made in 1997 alone. \nWe are not talking about jobs requiring different skills or abilities. \nWe are talking about equal pay for equal work. This is not a glass \nceiling, this is a glass wall. Women cannot break the glass ceiling \nuntil the wall comes down and they are given the equal pay that they \ndeserve.\n  Early in the next century, women--for the first time ever--will \noutnumber men in the United States workplace. In 1965, women held 35 \npercent of all jobs. That has grown to more than 45 percent today. And \nin a few years, women will make up a majority of the workforce.\n  Fortunately, there are more business and career opportunities for \nwomen today than there were thirty years ago. Unlike 1965, federal, \nstate, and private sector programs now offer women many opportunities \nto choose their own futures. Working women also have opportunities to \ngain the knowledge and skills to achieve their own economic security.\n  But despite these gains, working women still face a unique \nchallenge--achieving pay equity. The average woman earns 74 cents for \nevery dollar that the average man earns. According to a study by the \nNational Academy of Sciences, one-half of the pay gap is due to \ndiscrimination. This is unacceptable.\n  This discrimination is evident even in traditionally female \nprofessions such as nursing. For example, Marcelle, my wife, is a \nregistered nurse. Female registered nurses make on average $7,600 a \nyear less than men. It is unacceptable when female nurses make only 80 \npercent of the wages of their male counterparts for the same work.\n  My home state of Vermont is a leader in providing pay equity. \nAccording to the Institute for Women's Policy Research, Vermont ranks \nthird in providing equal pay. Even with this ranking, the average woman \nin Vermont still is making less than 76 cents for every dollar that the \naverage man makes in Vermont. We must work in the Senate and in the \nworkplace to close this gap.\n  I am pleased to join Senator Daschle in reintroducing the Paycheck \nFairness Act. This legislation will help to address the problem of pay \ninequality by redressing past discrimination and increasing enforcement \nagainst future abuses.\n  Senator Harkin is also a true leader on pay equity. I am an original \ncosponsor of his bill, the Fair Pay Act, which prohibits pay \ndiscrimination based on sex, race or national origin. These two pieces \nof legislation will help to provide women with what they deserve: equal \npay for equal work.\n  I understand that these bills will not solve all of the problems of \npay inequity, but they will close legal loopholes that allow employers \nto routinely underpay women. By closing these loopholes, we will help \nwomen achieve better economic security and provide them with more \nopportunities.\n  Women are being advanced in the workplace and the glass ceiling is \nslowly cracking. Last year, President Clinton appointed Madeline \nAlbright as the first female Secretary of State, and I am proud that \nVermont is also a leader in advancing women in the workplace. The \nUniversity of Vermont has a female president, Dr. Judith Ramaley, and \nMartha Rainville was recently elected Adjutant General of the Vermont \nNational Guard--the first woman in the nation to hold this position. \nWhile women are advancing in the workplace, we need to ensure that they \nare receiving fair pay for their work.\n  I want to commend Senator Daschle and Senator Harkin on their \ninitiative in introducing the Paycheck Fairness Act and the Fair Pay \nAct. I also want to recognize and commend the hundreds of organizations \naround the country that will recognize tomorrow as Equal Pay Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/02/senate-section/article/S3116-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3116-S3117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            POSITIVE SYSTEMS\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I stand today to recognize one of Montana's \nnext generation jewels--Positive Systems in Whitefish, Montana. As a \nresult of the dedication and commitment to their industry, Positive \nSystems has been recognized by the 1998 Governor's Excellence in \nExporting Award Certificate of Appreciation.\n  Incorporated in 1991, Positive Systems provides a technical service \nin a rather unique and young industry. Dale Johnson, Cody Benkelman and \nRon Behrendt designed a digital aerial photography service that will \nbenefit many sectors of our economy. Positive Systems is the only \nbusiness using such methods in the rapidly growing aerial mapping \nindustry. These three men from different backgrounds combined their \nskills to launch this new enterprise.\n  Positive Systems has mapped landscapes throughout the world working \nfor everyone from farmers to NASA. The four cameras mounted in a small \naircraft take pictures in the visible spectrum as well as in the near \ninfrared. Although the human eye is capable of sensing just a portion \nof the entire light spectrum, the cameras can see much more. The camera \nlenses pick up the nearest infrared which has several remarkable \nattributes including the fact that it interacts with chlorophyll, \nreflecting very well off of healthy plants.\n  By designating a color to the near infrared the cameras can detect \nthe amount of light bouncing off of a given plant--the more reflective \nthe plant, the healthier it is. In an age of high-tech, precision \nagriculture, every advantage helps. An acre of farmland, for instance, \ncan support upward of 11,000 heads of lettuce; so to lose even a few \nacres on a corporate farm can mean a huge financial impact.\n  Understanding the whole system is a primary focus at NASA, where the \nEarth sciences program is providing government funds for private sector \nresearch into global change over time. In addition, Positive System \nteams with\n\n[[Page S3117]]\n\nNASA for standard education and land use projects. They have recently \nbeen awarded a contract with NASA's John C. Stennis Space Center to map \n1,000 square miles of Mississippi's coastal region.\n  The system engineered by the Whitefish company, in fact, is so far \nout on the cutting edge that Positive Systems has had to wait for the \nrest of the world to catch up.\n  I would like to congratulate Positive Systems on the Certificate of \nAppreciation. This kind of growth and opportunity for a small Montana \nbusiness is impressive. As a member of the U.S. Senate Small Business \nCommittee, it is becoming increasingly clear that business owners can \neffectively reach a global market regardless of where they live. \nPositive Systems has demonstrated they can compete and succeed.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/02/senate-section/article/S3116-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3117-S3118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CONGRESS SHOULD PASS IRS REFORM BY APRIL 15\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks about \nlegislation to reform the Internal Revenue Service.\n  Mr. President, April 15 is just around the corner, and I would guess \nthat sometime between now and then, many a taxpayer will curse the IRS, \nand quite probably the Congress, too, for the tax bill they face. The \nAmerican people are taxed too much, and they are due for some tax \nrelief this year.\n  Even figuring out how much tax to pay has become a nightmare. At \n17,000 pages, the tax code and regulations are so complicated that no \none but a few tax attorneys and accountants who make their living off \nthat tangle of laws can ever hope to understand it, let alone the \naverage working family.\n  Mr. President, it looks increasingly like the Senate will fail to \npass legislation to reform the IRS before adjourning at the end of this \nweek for Easter recess. I am deeply disappointed that we appear \nunlikely to pass such legislation before April 15. Last week, I asked \nthe Senate leadership to pass IRS reform legislation before April 15. \nIn just a moment, I will describe some of the features I think should \nbe included in such a bill.\n  The American people deserve an IRS Reform bill as soon as possible. \nLast December, I held a hearing in Raleigh, North Carolina on IRS abuse \nof taxpayers. I was shocked at some of the stories I heard. In \nresponse, I introduced legislation to create an all private citizen \noversight board for the IRS. My bill would give the oversight panel the \nauthority to delve into the auditing and collections practices of the \nIRS which have lead to well documented abuse of taxpayers. The board \nwould also have oversight of IRS procurement practices. That should \nhelp ensure that we never see the IRS waste another $4 billion, as it \ndid trying to develop a failed computer system.\n  Why is the Senate about to recess without having passed an IRS reform \nbill? In the crazy world of Washington, D.C., it seems that when the \nCongress tries to stop the IRS from improperly collecting taxes, budget \nrules require that the ``loss'' of revenue be offset with more taxes, \nmaking it almost impossible to clean house at the IRS. And so the \nSenate has now been diverted over the question of how to ``pay'' for an \nIRS reform bill, and which tax increases are least objectionable to use \nfor that purpose.\n  The referee in such matters is the Joint Committee on Taxation. The \naccountants and tax experts at this committee review all tax proposals, \nand make a determination as to which measures result in a loss of \nrevenue, and which are revenue neutral.\n  No matter what the green eye shade experts say, it just seems wrong \nto ask the American people to pay for IRS reform. IRS reform \nlegislation should not impose new taxes. Fortunately, there are a great \nmany good ideas for reforming the IRS which even the Joint Committee on \nTaxation staff have said can be enacted without the need for new taxes.\n  First among these is the creation of an IRS oversight board, such as \nthe one I have proposed in my own IRS reform legislation, S. 1555. \nThere are a number such reforms which can be implemented without any \nneed for offsetting revenues, including: a requirement that IRS agents \nexplain taxpayers' right to them in interviews; low-income taxpayer \nclinics; archiving IRS records so that Congress can delve into the \ninner workings of the agency; cataloging complaints of IRS employee \nmisconduct; prohibiting the IRS from seizing taxpayers' homes in small \ndeficiency cases, among others. One idea that would impose no \nadditional cost, but which I am sure would make a big difference for \nfrustrated taxpayers who struggle to find a person to talk to in within \nthe massive IRS bureaucracy: require that all IRS notices must contain \nthe name and telephone number of an IRS employee to contact.\n  In fact, of the 75 separate reforms currently being considered by the \nSenate Committee on Finance, over 50 are revenue neutral, according to \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation. At a minimum, these reforms should be \nconsidered as soon as possible. If any revenues are needed to pay for \nadditional reform, I suggest that Congress look first to the IRS's own \nbudget before turning to the American people.\n  For those who worry that the IRS will not have enough resources to \ncollect taxes, it is worth noting that the IRS budget has grown by a \nwhopping 71 percent in real terms since 1981. Many working families \nhaven't been so fortunate. Simply freezing the IRS budget at 1998 \nlevels would generate an additional $500 million in savings, which \ncould be applied to offset more costly IRS reforms. That would also \nhelp make it clear that Congress considers taxpayers to be at least as \nimportant as the IRS bureaucracy.\n  Mr. President, I recently wrote an editorial for the Wall Street \nJournal on the subject of IRS reform, which appeared on March 31, 1998. \nI ask unanimous consent that this article appear in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. In conclusion, Mr. President, I believe that the \nSenate can and should pass IRS reform legislation before April 15. I \nhope my colleagues will join me in pushing for such a reform bill as \nsoon as possible.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 31, 1998]\n\n           Will IRS Reform Get ``Scored'' Into Tax Increase?\n\n                          (By Lauch Faircloth)\n\n       In the crazy world of Washington, D.C., legislation to \n     reform the Internal Revenue Service is beginning to look more \n     and more like a bill to increase taxes by several billion \n     dollars. This outrage must be stopped, and soon.\n       Last fall, the House of Representatives passed legislation \n     based on the recommendations of the National Commission on \n     Restructuring the IRS, the so-called Kerrey-Portman \n     Commission. Most of the provisions of that bill are good, \n     commonsense measures that will make the IRS more accountable \n     to the public and reform the way the IRS conducts its \n     business. Some of the ``taxpayer bill of rights'' provisions, \n     however, have been ``scored'' by the Joint Committee on \n     Taxation as costing the government revenue. In Washington-\n     speak, this means that these provisions require an \n     ``offset''--better known to most Americans as a tax increase.\n       House bill drafters were creative in finding a ``loophole \n     closer'' for their IRS reform bill's offset. Their idea is to \n     clarify the deduction for accrued vacation pay, which would \n     net an additional $2.85 billion over five years. In this \n     case, the loophole closer probably is just that; it's \n     arguable that federal tax court decisions have strayed from \n     the intent of Congress in 1987 legislation concerning the \n     proper treatment of the taxation of vacation pay as deferred \n     compensation. But there are precious few other true loophole \n     closers where that one came from. Virtually every other \n     potential ``revenue offset'' on the table would come from one \n     of two sources--a laundry list of 43 tax increases proposed \n     by the president, or unspecified tobacco tax settlement \n     money. Either way, they are tax increases.\n       And there's another problem: The Senate version of IRS \n     reform is shaping up as two to three times more expensive \n     than the bill passed by the House last fall, according to \n     staffers of the Senate Finance Committee. That means that \n     congressional staffers drafting the revised bill must dip \n     into their bag of ``loophole closers'' (translation--tax \n     increases) suggested by the president to pay for the \n     additional lost revenue to the government.\n       I find it patently offensive that any reform of the \n     Internal Revenue Service should impose a cost on the American \n     people. After all, the IRS employs more than 100,000 people, \n     46,000 of whom work in enforcement, with a total budget of \n     over $8 billion. The entire Drug Enforcement Administration--\n     our frontline defense in the war on drugs--has a staff of \n     only 8,500. The IRS can audit any American at any time, but \n     drug traffickers\n\n[[Page S3118]]\n\n     would have nothing to fear under the present administration's \n     priorities.\n       What is the solution? For one thing, the omnibus approach \n     to IRS reform--cobbling together many reforms into one large \n     bill--should be reconsidered, Many worthwhile tax reforms \n     have been ``scored'' as resulting in no lost revenue to the \n     government. In other words, they don't cost a thing. They \n     should go forward on their own.\n       Chief among these provisions is an oversight board for the \n     IRS. The House IRS reform bill included such a board, Recall \n     that Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin originally opposed that \n     idea, until the president gave it his surprise endorsement. \n     What followed was a series of negotiations between Congress \n     and the administrations over the makeup of such a board. The \n     board is still too weak, and I have offered my own \n     legislation to create a board of nine members, all private \n     citizens. I do not think the Secretary of the Treasury, the \n     Commissioner of the IRS or the IRS employees' union \n     representative should be on such a board, as they would be \n     under the House version. That's just too much like the fox \n     guarding the hen-house.\n       Other provisions that do not result in lost revenue to the \n     federal government include strengthening the office of the \n     taxpayer advocate; prohibiting executive branch influence \n     over taxpayer audits; changing the way IRS records are \n     archived to provide greater oversight; establishing low-\n     income taxpayer clinics; and reforming certain sections of \n     the tax code that were intended to provide taxpayer privacy \n     protections, but that IRS attorneys have instead used to \n     shield the IRS's inner workings from congressional oversight.\n       If offsets are needed, let's look first at the massive $8 \n     billion budget of the IRS itself before turning to the \n     taxpayers. That budget has increased 71% in real terms since \n     1981. Merely keeping the IRS budget at last year's levels \n     would yield half a billion dollars. Also, don't forget that \n     the president's own budget plan has a list of more than $30 \n     billion in suggested spending cuts. That would more than pay \n     for even the most ambitious tax reform, as long as Congress \n     holds the line on new federal spending. And before we dismiss \n     waste and fraud as a source of savings, recall that the \n     Social Security Administration has just uncovered a very \n     expensive scam--prison inmates have been receiving as much as \n     $3.46 billion in improper Social Security checks each year. \n     That money could help save Social Security and clean up the \n     IRS.\n       The bottom line is this: The American people should not be \n     asked to pay for IRS reforms. Congress should focus on \n     trimming the IRS budget, or using the savings from federal \n     spending cuts suggested by the president to clean house at \n     the IRS. That way, Congress can offer the American people \n     some much-needed relief, without a dose of castor oil.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/02/senate-section/article/S3117-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PRODUCT LIABILITY AND BIOMATERIALS ACCESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, each year, American companies are forced to \nlay off workers or shut down entirely, but it's not because of hard \neconomic times. Instead, the costs of product liability insurance and \noutrageous damage awards are driving them out of business. We now live \nin the most litigious society on earth. Our courts are packed with \nfrivolous lawsuits filed by people seeking multi-million dollar \npayments for modest damages. As a result, we are all paying a huge \nprice--from the job market to the supermarket. Let us take the first \nstep by reforming the product liability system.\n  Congress did just that, when it sent President Clinton the Product \nLiability Legal Reform Act. This legislation was a carefully crafted \nbipartisan bill that, among other things, would have limited most \npunitive damage awards to twice the plaintiff's compensatory damages, \nor $25,000--whichever is greater. The bill would have simply injected \npredictability and sanity into our out-of-control legal system and \nprotected American companies from unfair and outrageous damage awards.\n  The American people and America's employers, however, were dealt a \nbig blow when President Clinton vetoed this bipartisan, common-sense \nreform effort. Almost 90 percent of the American people supported the \nbill. Consumers already pay 30 percent more on the price of a step \nladder and 95 percent more for the price of childhood vaccine due to \noutrageous product liability costs, and we simply can't afford to pay \nany more. American workers and businesses needed this bill to help stem \nto tide of job loss and help create new jobs.\n  So, why would Mr. Clinton veto this legislation? Possibly because the \nmost vocal opponents of this bill the plaintiff's trial lawyers--were \nalso the target supporters of his re-election effort. The President had \na choice to make. He had to choose between the plaintiff's trial bar \nwho provide him millions in dollars in campaign funds, and American \nworkers particularly those in manufacturing jobs. He choose the trial \nlawyers. Unfortunately, his decision is not only bad politics, is \nterrible policy for the American People. That's way even many prominent \nmembers of this own party in Congress were shocked his veto.\n  Negotiations continue with the White House on product liability \nreform, but to date I have seen no significant movement that would \nconstitute real progress. Thus far, only watered-down proposals that \nattempt to deceive the American people into believing that real reform \nwill take place have been offered.\n\n  My purpose in coming to the floor today is to challenge my colleagues \nto act on real product liability reform. Or, send the one part of this \nlegislative effort that there is some consensus on to the President. I \nam speaking of Senators McCain and Lieberman's Bio-materials Access \nAssurance Act.\n  Every year 7.5 million patients are threatened when medical suppliers \nchoose to discontinue a product because the liability concerns outweigh \nany potential gains. In my experience as a cardio-thoracic surgeon, you \ncan't overstate the vital nature of bringing the best and newest \ntechnology to the operating table. The list of life-saving devices \naffected is too long to mention. Everything from annuloplasty rings and \ntissue valves used in valve implantation to the blood filters and \ncardiotomy reservoirs needed for heart surgery are all at risk of \nserious shortage if the Congress does not act.\n  Many implantable devices are already in short supply. At least 14 \nbiomaterials suppliers have limited or stopped selling the raw \nmaterials used in the manufacture of devices. Many major suppliers have \nstopped selling materials to the U.S. market because of liability \nconcerns. Dow Chemical no longer manufactures medical grade resin for \nthe implant market. Dupont has discontinued the supply of Teflon, \nDacron, and Delron used in the permanent medical implant industry.\n  A 1997 study indicated where this problem is going within the next \none to three years: U.S. manufacturers will divert resources from \nresearch and development to the search for replacement materials; and \nfinancial resources for investment will begin to dry up and innovation \nwithin our boarders will suffer.\n  Further, within three to 10 years: A biomaterials ``crisis'' will \noccur; major segments of the biomaterials industry will move overseas, \nkilling smaller manufacturers where we see so much innovation today; \npatients will not have access to life-saving and life-enhancing \nimplants.\n  Let me be clear: These devices save millions of lives every year. \nI've used these implants and devices in my own surgical practice to \nsave the lives of hundreds. My hands as a surgeon and my patients are \nwitnesses to the importance of this issue. The time to act is now.\n  We have another opportunity this year to bring both of these \nimportant legislative initiatives to the President's desk. I sincerely \nhope that both ends of Pennsylvania are up to the challenge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/02/senate-section/article/S3118-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the President Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a treaty \nand sundry nominations which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/02/senate-section/article/S3118-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3118-S3119]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:39 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolution, without amendment:\n\n       S.

A bill to provide for equitable compensation for the \nCheyenne River Sioux Tribe, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nIndian Affairs.\n\n\n       the cheyenne river sioux tribe equitable compensation act\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \ncompensate the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe for losses the tribe suffered \nwhen the Oahe dam was constructed in central South Dakota and over \n100,000 acres of tribal land was flooded. Its passage will help the \ntribe rebuild their infrastructure and their economy, which was \nseriously crippled by the Oahe project during the 1950s. It is \nextraordinary that it has taken four decades to reach this point. The \nimportance of passing this long-overdue legislation as soon as possible \ncannot be stated too strongly.\n  This legislation was developed with the assistance of Chairman Gregg \nBourland and Council Member Louis Dubray of the Cheyenne River Sioux \nTribe. Both men have worked tirelessly to bring us to this point and I \nam grateful for their assistance. This legislation represents one \nelement of their progressive vision for providing the members of the \nCheyenne River Sioux Tribe with greater opportunities for economic \ndevelopment and to fulfill the debts owed to the tribe by the federal \ngovernment.\n  The Cheyenne River Sioux Infrastructure Development Trust Fund Act is \nthe companion bill to the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe Infrastructure \nDevelopment Trust Fund Act, which passed by unanimous consent in \nNovember of 1997, and the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe Infrastructure \nDevelopment Trust Fund Act of 1996, which passed the Congress \nunanimously in 1996.\n  The bill is based on an extensive analysis of the impact of the Pick-\nSloan Dam Projects on the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, which was \nperformed by the Robert McLaughlin Company. The McLaughlin report was \nreviewed by the General Accounting Office, which found that the losses \nsuffered by the tribe justify the establishment of a $290 million trust \nfund,\n\n[[Page S3121]]\n\nwhich is the amount called for in this legislation.\n  It represents an important step in our continuing effort to fairly \ncompensate the tribes of South Dakota for the sacrifices they made \ndecades ago for the construction of the dams along the Missouri River \nand will further the goal of improving the lives of Native Americans \nliving on those reservations.\n  To fully appreciate the need for this legislation, it is important \nfor the committee to understand the historic events that are prologue \nto its development. The Oahe dam was constructed in South Dakota \npursuant to the Flood Control Act (58 Stat. 887) of 1944. That \nlegislation authorized implementation of the Missouri River Basin Pick-\nSloan Plan for water development and flood control for downstream \nstates.\n  The Oahe dam flooded 104,000 acres of tribal land, forcing the \nrelocation of roughly 30 percent of the tribe's population, including \nfour entire communities. Equally as important, the tribe lost 80 \npercent of its fertile river bottom lands--lands that represented the \nbasis for the tribal economy. Prior to the flooding, the tribe relied \non these lands for firewood and building material, game, wild fruits \nand berries, as well as cover from the severe storms that characterize \nwinters in South Dakota and shelter from the heat of the prairie \nsummer. Indian ranchers no longer had places to shelter their cattle in \nthe wintertime, causing a significant loss in the value of their \noperations.\n  The loss of these important river bottom lands can be felt today. \nLast year, during the extreme winter of 1996-1997, the tribe lost \nroughly 30,000 head of livestock, including 25,000 head of cattle. \nWithout adequate natural shelter, the remaining Indian ranchers along \nthis stretch of river can expect to continue to have difficulty \nscratching out a living in future years when the winter turns \nparticularly hard.\n  Mr. President, the damage caused by the Pick-Sloan projects touched \nevery aspect of life on the Cheyenne River reservation. Ninety percent \nof the timber on the reservation was wiped out, causing shortages of \nbuilding material and firewood. Wildlife, once abundant in the river \nbottom, became more scarce. The entire lifestyle of the tribe changed \nas it was forced to relocate much of its people from the lush river \nbottom lands to the windswept prairie.\n  Most Americans, if not all, are familiar with the many broken \npromises of the United States Government to Native Americans during the \n1800's. For Indian tribes located along the Missouri River in the State \nof South Dakota, the United States Government still has not met its \nresponsibilities for compensation for losses suffered as a result of \nthe construction of the Pick-Sloan dams. This proposed legislation is \nintended to correct that situation as it applies to the Cheyenne River \nSioux Tribe.\n  We cannot, of course, remake the lost lands and return the tribe to \nits former existence. We can, however, help provide the resources \nnecessary to the tribe to improve the infrastructure on the Cheyenne \nRiver reservation. This, in turn, will enhance opportunities for \neconomic development which will benefit all members of the tribe. \nPerhaps most importantly, it will fulfill part of our commitment to \nimprove the lives of Native Americans--in this case the Cheyenne River \nSioux.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to approve this legislation this year. \nProviding compensation to the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe for past harm \ninflicted by the federal government is long-overdue and any further \ndelay only compounds that harm.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) Congress approved the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin \n     program by passing the Act of December 22, 1944, commonly \n     known as the ``Flood Control Act of 1944'' (58 Stat. 887, \n     chapter 665; 33 U.S.C. 701-1 et seq.)--\n       (A) to promote the general economic development of the \n     United States;\n       (B) to provide for irrigation above Sioux City, Iowa;\n       (C) to protect urban and rural areas from devastating \n     floods of the Missouri River; and\n       (D) for other purposes;\n       (2) the Oahe Dam and Reservoir project is a major component \n     of the Pick-Sloan program, and contributes to the economy of \n     the United States by generating a substantial amount of \n     hydropower and impounding a substantial quantity of water;\n       (3) notwithstanding the contributions referred to in \n     paragraph (1), the Oahe Dam and Reservoir project has \n     contributed little to the economy of the Tribe;\n       (4) the Oahe Dam and Reservoir project overlies the eastern \n     boundary of the Crow Creek Indian Reservation;\n       (5) the Oahe Dam and Reservoir project has--\n       (A) inundated the fertile, wooded bottom lands of the Tribe \n     along the Missouri River that constituted the most productive \n     agricultural and pastoral lands of the Tribe and the homeland \n     of the members of the Tribe; and\n       (B) as a result of that inundation, severely damaged the \n     economy of the Tribe and the members of the Tribe;\n       (6) the Secretary appointed a Joint Tribal Advisory \n     Committee that examined the Oahe Dam and Reservoir project \n     and that advisory committee correctly concluded that--\n       (A) the Federal Government did not justify, or fairly \n     compensate the Tribe for, the Oahe Dam and Reservoir project \n     when the Federal Government acquired 104,492 acres of land of \n     the Tribe for that project; and\n       (B) the Tribe should be adequately compensated for the \n     taking described in subparagraph (A); and\n       (7) after applying the same method of analysis used for the \n     compensation of similarly situated Indian tribes, the \n     Comptroller General of the United States determined the \n     amount of compensation for the taking described in paragraph \n     (6) and determined that the appropriate amount of \n     compensation to pay the Tribe for the taking would be \n     $290,722,958;\n       (8) the Tribe is entitled to receiving additional financial \n     compensation for the taking described in paragraph (6)(A) in \n     a manner consistent with the determination of the Comptroller \n     General under paragraph (7); and\n       (9) the establishment of a dual cash account with the \n     amounts made available to the Tribe under this Act is \n     consistent with the principles of self-governance and self-\n     determination.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To provide for additional financial compensation to the \n     Tribe for the taking of 104,402 acres of land of the Tribe \n     for the Oahe Dam and Reservoir project in a manner consistent \n     with the determination of the Comptroller General of the \n     United States described in subsection (a)(7).\n       (2) To provide for the establishment of the Cheyenne River \n     Sioux Recovery Account, a dual cash account to be managed by \n     the Office in order to make payments to the Tribe to carry \n     out projects under a plan prepared by the Tribe.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to require the Senate to remain in session to act on \njudicial nominations in certain circumstances; to the Committee on \nRules and Administration.\n\n\n           the judicial emergency responsibility act of 1998\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week, faced with five continuing \nvacancies on a 13-member Court, Chief Judge Winter of the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit certified the judicial \nemergency caused by these continuing vacancies, began canceling \nhearings and took the unprecedented step in the Second Circuit of \nauthorizing 3-judge panels to be composed of two visiting judges and \nonly one Second Circuit Judge.\n\n  The Judiciary Committee has reported to the Senate the nomination of \nJudge Sotomayor to the Second Circuit, but her nomination continues to \nsit on the Senate calendar. Her nomination was received back in June \n1997. She was favorably reported by a Committee vote of 16 to 2, once \nthe Committee finally considered her nomination. She is strongly \nsupported by both New York Senators, yet the nomination continues to \nlanguish without consideration.\n  Three additional outstanding Second Circuit nominees are pending \nbefore the Judiciary Committee and await their confirmation hearings. \nJudge Rosemary Pooler was nominated back on November 6, 1997, as was \nRobert Sack, a partner in the law firm of Gibson Dunn & Crutcher. The \nfinal pending nomination to the Second Circuit was received two months \nago, back on February 11, when the President nominated Chester J. \nStraub, a partner in the law firm of Wilkie Farr & Gallagher.\n  I have been urging action on the nominees to the Second Circuit for \nmany months. The Senate is failing in its obligations to the people of \nthe Second Circuit, to the people of New York, Connecticut and Vermont. \nWe should call an end to this stall and take action.\n  Last Friday I urged consideration of the nomination of Judge \nSotomayor without further delay and requested that the Judiciary \nCommittee proceed to hold the necessary hearings on the three other \nSecond Circuit nominees this week so that they, too, might be confirmed \nbefore the upcoming recess.\n  I do not believe that the Senate should be leaving for two weeks' \nrecess and leaving the Second Circuit with vacancies for which it has \nqualified nominations pending. This is too reminiscent of the \ngovernment shutdown only a couple of years ago and the numerous times \nof late when the Republican congressional leadership has recessed \nwithout completing work on emergency supplemental and disaster relief \nlegislation.\n  In his most recent Report on the Judiciary the Chief Justice of the \nUnited States Supreme Court warned that persisting vacancies would harm \nthe administration of justice. The Chief Justice of the United States \nSupreme Court pointedly declared: ``Vacancies cannot remain at such \nhigh levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice that \ntraditionally has been associated with the federal judiciary.''\n  The people and businesses in the Second Circuit need additional \nfederal judges confirmed by the Senate. Indeed, the Judicial Conference \nof the United States recommends that in addition to the 5 vacancies, \nthe Second\n\n[[Page S3123]]\n\nCircuit be allocated an additional 2 judgeships to handle its workload. \nThe Second Circuit is suffering harm from Senate inaction. That is why \nthe Chief Judge of the Second Circuit had to declare the Circuit in a \nstate of emergency.\n  Must we wait for the administration of justice to disintegrate \nfurther before the Senate will take this crisis seriously and act on \nthe nominees pending before it? I hope not.\n  As part of my efforts to encourage the Senate to do its job, I am \ntoday introducing the Judicial Emergency Responsibility Act. The \npurpose of this bill is to supplement the law by which Chief Justice \nWinter certified the emergency and to require the Senate to do its duty \nand to act on judicial nominations before it recesses for significant \nstretches of time when a Circuit Court is suffering from a vacancy \nemergency.\n  I urge prompt action on the bill and immediate action on the \nnomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Second Circuit.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE:\n  S. 1907. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \nrefundable tax credit for wetland restoration and conservation \nexpenses; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           wetlands restoration and conservation legislation\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nprovide a refundable tax credit to farmers for the restoration and \nconservation of wetlands.\n  We have learned over the years the extraordinary value that wetlands \ncan provide as habitat for plants and waterfowl, as a filter for water \nand as a buffer against flooding. At the same time, anyone who has ever \nowned a farm in South Dakota with what we call prairie potholes can \nappreciate the frustration wetlands can generate, making it \nlogistically difficult to till the field efficiently and, of course, \nimpossible to grow crops on lands that are flooded.\n  To add insult to injury, farmers often need to pay property taxes on \nthese wetlands, even though they provide no financial return.\n  As a nation, we have recognized the dilemma this presents and have \ntaken steps in the past to provide farmers with a means of obtaining \nsome value for their efforts to protect wetlands. For years the \nDepartment of Agriculture has allowed farmers to enroll wetlands into \nthe Wetland Reserve Program, while the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \nhas worked with conservation groups to provide farmers with long-term \neasement options. Recently, Congress enacted legislation I sponsored to \nallow farmers to enroll wetlands in the Conservation Reserve Program.\n  Unfortunately, due to the funding caps, many farmers cannot enroll \ntheir wetlands into the CRP while others are reluctant to use the WRP \nor U.S. Fish and Wildlife easements. Consequently, despite these \nefforts, many wetlands throughout this country continue to present \nfarmers with a challenge: ensuring their protection without any \ncompensation.\n  In addition, over the last century, many wetlands have been drained, \nfilled or otherwise degraded. These areas represent a vast reservoir of \npotentially important wetlands that could provide useful environmental \nfunctions if fully restored. The time has come for Congress to \nestablish a more comprehensive set of incentives to both restore \ndegraded wetlands and ensure their long-term protection.\n  Under the legislation I am introducing today, owners of wetlands, \nfarmed wetlands and prior-converted croplands that are surrounded by or \nimmediately adjacent to actively farmed cropland in the same ownership \nare eligible for a tax credit. To take advantage of this credit, \nfarmers must restore to fully functioning condition their farmed \nwetlands or prior converted croplands condition according to a \nrestoration plan approved by the Natural Resources Conservation \nService. A tax credit equal to the restoration costs will be available \nunder this bill. To protect the water quality of wildlife values, a \nmaximum of three associated acres of non-wetland may be eligible for \nthe credit for every acre of wetland. To ensure that the federal \ngovernment does not pay twice to protect the same wetlands, those \nenrolled in CRP or WRP are not eligible for this credit.\n  The bill provides a tax credit equal to 50% to 70% of the soil-\nspecific Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) rental rate for eligible \nwetland and associated non-wetland acres, plus any certification fee. \nThis may be taken in each year of the conservation agreement in which \nthe eligible land is not used for agricultural production or drained, \ndredged, filled, leveled, or otherwise manipulated for that purpose.\n  A farmer who enters into an agreement to conserve the eligible \nwetland and associated non-wetland acres for a period of not less than \n10 years will receive 50% of the annual CRP rental rate; a farmer who \nagrees to conserve the wetland for not less than 20 years will receive \n60% of the annual CRP rental rate; and a farmer who agrees to conserve \nthe wetland for 30 years will receive 70% of the annual CRP rental \nrate. Certification of compliance with the agreement must be made at \nleast every 5 years.\n  As a long-term alternative to the conservation credit, farmers may \nopt for an easement credit, which would be equal to the fair market \nvalue of the land in agricultural use, as determined by a certified \nappraisal. This would be based on the charitable donation by the \nlandowner of a deed restriction, granted in perpetuity on the use which \nmay be made of the eligible land to a qualified conservation \norganization, exclusively for conservation purposes. The full credit \nmay be taken in the year in which the deed restriction is recorded.\n  Mr. President, Americans increasingly are becoming aware of the \ntremendous environmental benefits that wetlands provide. From critical \nwaterfowl habitat to reducing the severity of flooding, wetlands are a \ncritical component of our landscape. What may not be as widely \nappreciated is the nature of the farmer's role in protecting this \nresource.\n  The time has come for us to both acknowledge the contributions made \nby farmers to the conservation of wetlands and provide them with \nappropriate incentive to preserve them. Farmers should not be penalized \nfor doing the right thing. This legislation will take a giant step \ntoward making available fair and reasonable compensation for their \nefforts in this regard.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. It \nrepresents an idea that is popular with conservation organizations as \nwell as producers, and I am hopeful that Congress will enact it in the \nvery near future. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1907\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \ncarve out form payments to Medicare+Choice organizations amounts \nattributable to disproportionate share hospital payments and pay such \namounts directly to those disproportionate share hospitals in which \ntheir enrollees receive care; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               THE MANAGED CARE FAIR PAYMENT ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN, Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with my \ncolleague Senator D'Amato, the ``Managed Care Fair Payment Act of \n1998,'' a companion to H.R. 2701 which was introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives last year by my colleague and friend, Representative \nRangel.\n  In the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA), Congress and the President \nagreed to ``carve out'' the payment made to Medicare HMOs attributed to \nthe cost for graduate medical education (GME), and instead make the \npayment for GME directly to teaching hospitals. The BBA did not \ncontain, however, a provision passed by the Senate to ``carve out'' \npayments to disproportionate share hospitals--often called DSH \npayments.\n  Medicare DSH payments are paid to almost 2000 hospitals that serve a \n``disproportionate share'' of low-income--often uninsured--patients. \nThe DSH adjustment for each hospital is determined by a complex set of \nformulas relating to a hospital's location, size and percentage of low-\nincome patients.\n  Until 1998, Medicare's payments to private health plans were based on \nthe average payments made on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries in the \nfee-for-service program. Under the BBA, Medicare+Choice payment rates \nare no longer directly linked to local fee-for-service spending. \nInstead, they blend average spending locally and nationally. Because \nthe DSH payment was not carved out in the BBA, the DSH payment will \ncontinue to be made with the expectation that HMOs will, when \nnegotiating rates with hospitals, ``pass on'' the DSH payment to \nhospitals that serve a large number of low-income, uninsured \nindividuals. Unfortunately, as was the case before the BBA was enacted, \nDSH payments to managed care plans will likely not be passed on to \nhospitals. This bill seeks to correct this problem by ``carving out'' \nthe DSH payment from the Medicare+Choice payments to managed care plans \nand giving the payments directly to hospitals.\n  This issue is particularly important to New York state. Hospitals in \nNew York currently receive approximately $700 million per year in DSH \npayments. The number of New York Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in \nHMOs and other managed care plans has grown by nearly 86 percent to \nmore than 300,000 since 1995. At this level of penetration, a DSH carve \nout would redirect $150 million each year to New York's 127 DSH \nhospitals.\n  To preserve the viability of hospitals that provide the bulk of the \ncare to low-income--often uninsured--patients, it is imperative, as \nmanaged care enrollment grows, that Medicare DSH payments be carved out \nfrom HMO payments. The bill I am introducing today does just that--it \nwould carve out 100 percent of the DSH funds\n\n[[Page S3125]]\n\nfrom the managed care payment rate, beginning in January 1999 and pay \nthese funds directly to hospitals. These payments must go directly to \nhospitals that serve the poor. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting the Managed Care Fair Payment Act of 1998.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1908\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to repeal the telephone excise tax; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n              the telephone excise tax repeal act of 1998\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to offer a bill to repeal the three \npercent federal excise tax that all Americans pay every time they use a \ntelephone.\n  Under current law, the federal government taxes you three percent of \nyour monthly phone bill for the so-called ``privilege'' of using your \nphone lines. This tax was first imposed one hundred years ago. To help \nfinance the Spanish-American War, the federal government taxed \ntelephone service, which in 1898 was a luxury service enjoyed by \nrelatively few. The tax reappeared as a means of raising revenue for \nWorld War I, and continued as a revenue-raiser during the Great \nDepression, World War II, the Korean and Vietnam Wars, and the chronic \nfederal budget deficits of the last twenty years.\n  Earlier this month, however, we received some long-overdue good news: \nthanks to the Balanced Budget Act enacted by the Congress in 1997, the \nCongressional Budget Office projected an $8 billion federal budget \nsurplus for 1998. Mr. President, that announcement should mean the end \nof the federal phone excise tax.\n  Here's why. First of all, the telephone is a modern-day necessity, \nnot like alcohol, or furs, or jewelry, or other items of the sort that \nthe government taxes this way. The Congress specifically recognized the \nneed for all Americans to have affordable telephone service when it \nenacted the 1996 Telecommunications Act. The universal service \nprovisions of the Act are intended to assure that all Americans, \nregardless of where they live or how much money they make, have access \nto affordable telephone service. The telephone excise tax, which bears \nno relationship to any government service received by the consumer, is \nflatly inconsistent with the goal of universal telephone service.\n  It's also a highly regressive and unfair tax that hurts low-income \nand rural Americans even more than other Americans. Low-income families \nspend a higher percentage of their income than medium- or high-income \nfamilies on telephone service, and that means the telephone tax hits \nlow-income families much harder. For that reason the Congressional \nBudget Office has concluded that increases in the telephone tax would \nhave a greater impact on low-income families than tax increases on \nalcohol or tobacco products. And a study by the American Agriculture \nMovement concluded that excise taxes like the telephone tax impose a \ndisproportionately large tax burden on rural customers, too, who rely \non telephone service in isolated areas.\n  But, in addition to being unfair and unnecessary, there is another \nreason why we should eliminate the telephone excise tax. Implementation \nof the Telecom Act of 1996 requires all telecommunications carriers--\nlocal, long-distance, and wireless--to incur new costs in order to \nproduce a new, more competitive market for telecommunications services \nof all kinds.\n  Unfortunately, the cost increases are arriving far more quickly than \nthe new, more competitive market. The Telecom Act created a new subsidy \nprogram for wiring schools and libraries to the Internet, and the cost \nof funding that subsidy has already increased bills for business users \nof long-distance telephone service and for consumers of wireless \nservices. Because of more universal service subsidy requirements and \nother new Telecom Act mandates, more rate increases for all users will \noccur later this year and next year.\n  Mr. President, the fact that the Telecom Act is imposing new charges \non consumers' bills makes it absolutely incumbent upon us to strip away \nany unnecessary old charges. And that means the telephone excise tax.\n  Mr. President, the telephone excise tax isn't a harmless artifact \nfrom bygone days. It collects money for wars that are already over, and \nfor budget deficits that no longer exist, from people who can least \nafford to spend it now and from people who will have new bills to foot \nas the 1996 Telecom Act gets implemented. That's unfair, that's wrong, \nand that must be stopped.\n  San Juan Hill and Pork Chop Hill have now gone down in history, and \nso should this tax.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nappear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1909\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REPEAL OF TELEPHONE EXCISE TAX.\n\n       (a) In General.--Effective with respect to amounts paid \n     pursuant to bills first rendered on or after January 1, 1999, \n     subchapter B of chapter 33 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 (26 U.S.C. 4251 et seq.) is repealed. For purposes of \n     the preceding sentence, in the case of communications \n     services rendered before December 1, 1998, for which a bill \n     has not been rendered before January 1, 1999, a bill shall be \n     treated as having been first rendered on December 31, 1998.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Effective January 1, 1999, the \n     table of subchapters for\n\n[[Page S3126]]\n\n     such chapter is amended by striking out the item relating to \n     subchapter B.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. D'AMATO:\n  S. 1911. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na $500 nonrefundable credit to individuals for the payment of real \nestate taxes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            THE WORKING MIDDLE-CLASS TAX RELIEF ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, last year, the Congress delivered some \nlong-overdue and much-deserved tax relief to the American people. The \nTaxpayer Relief Act of 1997 provided the first middle-class tax cut in \n16 years.\n\n  The tax cuts we passed last year are making a difference in the \nmonthly budgets of working middle-class families. But we can and we \nmust do more. These families still send too much of their hard-earned \nmoney to Washington. And between federal, state, and local taxes, the \naverage American's tax bill is nearly 35 percent of their total income. \nIn fact, most Americans spend more time working to pay their tax bills \nthan they spend working to provide food, clothing, and shelter \ncombined. We absolutely must continue our efforts to reduce the tax \nburden.\n  One area that escaped our tax-cutting efforts last year was the \nenormous property tax bills paid by homeowners. Last year, hardworking \nAmericans paid about $209 billion in real-estate property taxes. This \nwas more than one-and-one-half times what individuals paid in state \nincome taxes.\n  In addition, property tax rates have increased almost twice as fast \nas inflation. Property taxes are spiraling out of control, and the time \nhas come to give homeowners some real relief.\n  Homeownership is the American dream, but that dream now comes with a \ntax bill that puts a heavy burden on working families. This property \ntax bill also provides a disincentive to any young couple considering \npurchasing a home. We in Washington should change that equation--we \nshould be doing everything we can to encourage and assist \nhomeownership.\n  Today, I am introducing the ``Working Middle-Class Tax Relief Act of \n1998.'' This bill will allow homeowners to take a federal tax credit \nfor the first $500 of property taxes paid on their personal residence. \nThe Working Middle Class Tax Relief Act will provide real help to \nworking families who are struggling to make ends meet, and it will send \na strong message that homeownership can become a reality for all \nAmericans.\n  Here are a few examples of how my bill works. Under current law, \nthere are nearly 36 million taxpayers who do not get any savings on \nproperty taxes because they don't file an itemized federal tax return. \nUnder my bill, every dollar of property tax that they pay, up to $500, \nwill come back to them in the form of federal tax savings.\n  Of course, millions of other Americans do itemize. Take, for example, \na typical family of four with a taxable income of $42,000, and a \nproperty tax bill of $3,000. Under current law they receive a $450 \nfederal tax benefit. By turning the first $500 of property taxes into a \ntax credit, my legislation would give this typical family an additional \n$425 savings, for a total tax benefit of $875.\n  This savings to homeowners could cut their property tax bill by one-\nthird or more, and in some cases wipe it out all together. This \nlegislation will let working families keep more of their money. That's \nthe way it should be. After all, the American people know how to manage \ntheir own money much better than Washington does.\n  The Working Middle-Class Tax Relief Act is real savings for the 66 \nmillion Americans who have realized the dream of owning a home, and it \nwill help millions more achieve that dream.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1911\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to exclude \nadditional reserve component general and flag officers from the \nlimitation on the number of general or flag officers who may serve on \nactive duty; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n                       NATIONAL GUARD LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, today I join Senator Bond, my fellow co-\nchairman of the National Guard Caucus, in introducing legislation to \nallow the Secretary of Defense to increase the number of National Guard \nand reserve generals on active duty.\n  Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre brought it to our attention \nthat under current law, guard and reserve general officers brought on \nactive duty for more than 180 days count against the service's active \nduty ceilings specified in 10 U.S.C. 526. Our proposed legislation \nwould exempt full-time active duty guard and reserve general officers \nfrom the limit in title 10. But we only allow the exemption so it does \nnot exceed 3 percent of the current limit of 877 general officers.\n  This legislation will encourage the military services to assign \nguard/reserve general officers to a wider variety of non-traditional \nassignments allowing these general officers to gain a greater depth of \nexperience. The legislation will greatly enhance the total force idea, \nby providing a more seamless integration of the reserve and active \ncomponent senior leadership. Senator Bond and I also believe this \nlegislation will foster a greater appreciation by the active duty \nservice leadership of the expertise available from the guard and \nreserve community.\n  This legislation would eliminate the disincentive to expand guard and \nreserve general officers assignments by easing the one-for-one reserve \ncomponent versus active component offset. There are currently 22 Guard \nand Reserve general officers on full time active duty. All but three of \nthose officers are serving in assignment directly related to Guard and \nReserve matters. This legislation would exempt up to 25 Guard and \nReserve general officers\n\n[[Page S3127]]\n\nfrom counting against active duty general officer end strength.\n  Senator Bond and I would encourage the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee to include this legislation in the fiscal year 1999 defense \nauthorization bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill and section-by-section be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follow:\n\n                                S. 1912\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Interior to sell \nleaseholds at the Canyon Ferry Reservoir in the State of Montana and to \nestablish a trust and fund for the conservation of fish and wildlife \nand enhancement of public hunting and fishing opportunities in the \nState; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n         the montana fish and wildlife conservation act of 1998\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to announce the introduction \nof ``The Montana Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act of 1998.'' I am \npleased to be joined on this bill by my Colleague from Montana, Senator \nBurns. This bill will help protect important lands in Montana for the \nuse and enjoyment of all Americans. It will protect our hunting and \nfishing heritage and ensure that our children and our grandchildren can \nenjoy our great wild lands, just as we do today.\n\n  Canyon Ferry Reservoir sits just east of Helena, Montana. Along the \nnorth shore of the reservoir, there are 265 cabin sites that have been \nleased by the Bureau of Reclamation for over two decades. On these \nsites, families have built cabins and houses, car ports and garages, \nand planted lawns and gardens. Many families now live in these cabins \nyear-round.\n  These cabin sites have been a constant management problem for the \nBureau of Reclamation. In addition to managing the reservoir, the \nBureau of Reclamation has been forced to play landlord. Like all \nlandlords, the Bureau of Reclamation has often been at odds with the \ncabin owners over rental payments and maintenance of the property. This \nconflict has damaged public good will and created administrative \nexpenses for the government as appeals are filed to respond to the \nconflict of the day.\n  The Montana Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act establishes an \nequitable means of resolving these conflicts and, at the same time, \nprovide substantial benefit to the public. This Act proposes to sell \nall 265 cabin sites through a sealed bid process with the minimum bid \nset at fair market value determined in accordance with federal \nappraisal standards. All existing lease arrangements would have to be \nhonored by the purchaser of the 265 cabin sites, and each cabin owner \nwould have to be given an option to purchase their cabin site from the \nsuccessful bidder. In this way, the Act ensures that the public will \nreceive a maximum return on the investment, while at the same time, \nfully protecting the interests of the current leaseholders.\n  The Montana Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act of 1998 would use the \nproceeds from this sale to establish two funds for the conservation of \nfish and wildlife and would return 10% of the proceeds to the U.S. \nTreasury.\n  The first fund established by this Act, the Canyon Ferry-Missouri \nTrust, would be a perpetual endowment fund with 45% of the proceeds \nfrom the sale of the cabin sites. It would be used for the public \nacquisition of property at Canyon Ferry Reservoir and along the \nMissouri River and its tributaries upstream to the confluence of the \nMadison, Jefferson, and Gallatin Rivers.\n  This trust would be managed by a board consisting of representatives \nof local and statewide sportsmens organizations and local landowners. \nThe Canyon Ferry-Missouri River Endowment would be used to purchase \npublic access to hunting and fishing sites and to acquire property and \nconservation easements to enhance public hunting and fishing \nopportunities at the reservoir and along the Missouri. All property \nacquired by this trust would be purchased from willing sellers.\n  The second fund, Montana Hunter and Fisherman Access Fund would be a \nstate-wide fund established with another 45% of the proceeds from the \nsale of the cabin sites. It would be used to acquire public access to \nfederal lands in Montana and to acquire property and conservation \neasements to enhance public hunting and fishing opportunities across \nthe state. This fund would be managed by the Bureau of Land Management, \nthe Forest Service, and Fish and Wildlife Service. This fund could be \nused to acquire property only from willing sellers.\n  The remaining 10% of the proceeds from the sale of the cabin sites \nwould be returned to the U.S. Treasury.\n  The Montana Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act of 1998 presents an \nexciting opportunity for us to ensure that our children can enjoy \nhunting and fishing just as we do. This bill will improve access to \npublic lands and will protect important fish and wildlife habitat for \nthe benefit of all Americans. It does so by selling cabin sites which \ncurrently are providing very few benefits to the general public while \ncausing significant management conflicts and expenses for the Bureau of \nReclamation.\n  This is a fair bill that is widely supported by cabin owners, local \nland owners, and sportsmen throughout Montana. There are a number of \nissues that still need to be ironed out with this bill. In particular, \nthe Canyon Ferry Recreation Association (the association of cabin \nowners) has expressed concern that they may not financially be able to \nstep into the role of landlord for those leasees who are unable to \npurchase the cabin sites should be Association be the highest bidder. \nWe'll have to work through these and other issues as this bill moves \nforward.\n  Nonetheless, Mr. President, I believe that this bill is a good start. \nI look forward to working with my Colleague from Montana and with all \nthe members of the Senate to finalize and pass\n\n[[Page S3128]]\n\nthis legislation for the benefit of America's fish and wildlife \nheritage.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nimportant bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1913\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Montana Fish and Wildlife \n     Conservation Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) it is in the interest of the United States for the \n     Secretary of the Interior to sell leaseholds at Canyon Ferry \n     Reservoir in the State of Montana for fair market value if \n     the proceeds from the sale are used--\n       (A) to establish a trust to provide a permanent source of \n     funding to acquire access or other property interests from \n     willing sellers to conserve fish and wildlife and to enhance \n     public hunting and fishing opportunities at the Reservoir and \n     along the Missouri River;\n       (B) to establish a fund to be used to acquire access or \n     other property interests from willing sellers to increase \n     public access to Federal land in the State of Montana and to \n     enhance hunting and fishing opportunities; and\n       (C) to reduce the Pick-Sloan project debt for the Canyon \n     Ferry Unit;\n       (2) existing trusts in the State of Montana, including the \n     Rock Creek Trust and the Montana Power Company Missouri-\n     Madison Trust, have provided substantial public benefits by \n     conserving fish and wildlife and by enhancing public hunting \n     and fishing opportunities in the State of Montana;\n       (3) many Federal lands in the State of Montana do not have \n     suitable public access, and establishing a fund to acquire \n     easements to those lands from willing sellers would enhance \n     public hunting and fishing opportunities in the State of \n     Montana;\n       (4) the sale of the leaseholds at the Reservoir will reduce \n     Federal payments in lieu of taxes and associated management \n     expenditures in connection with the ownership by the Federal \n     Government of the leaseholds while increasing local tax \n     revenues from the new owners of the leased lots; and\n       (5) the sale of the leaseholds at the Reservoir will reduce \n     expensive and contentious disputes between the Federal \n     Government and leaseholders, while ensuring that the Federal \n     Government receives full and fair value for the acquisition \n     of the property.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title 11, United States Code, provide for \nbusiness bankruptcy reform, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n               the business bankruptcy reform act of 1998\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing ``The Business \nBankruptcy Reform Act of 1998.'' As Members of this body may remember, \nthe National Bankruptcy Review Commission submitted a list of \nrecommendations to Congress in October of last year. So far, the public \nhas tended to focus on the consumer bankruptcy recommendations, which \nunfortunately would have made it easier to get into bankruptcy and \nwould have given consumers even more of an upper hand. I think that \nthese recommendations were fatally flawed, and that's why I introduced \nthe Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act with Senator Durbin last year to \ntighten up the bankruptcy system and provide new consumer protections \nwhen creditors use abusive tactics.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will make many badly-needed \nreforms to the business provisions of the bankruptcy code. This \nlegislation will provide--for the first time ever--new protections for \npatients of hospitals and HMOs and nursing homes that declare \nbankruptcy. Under current law, the bankruptcy process is oriented \ntoward protecting the interests of creditors and helping the debtor \ncorporation reorganize. And that is all we need most of the time.\n  But hospitals and HMOs and nursing homes are different. Patients are \nuniquely vulnerable and Congress needs to take special care to ensure \nthat patients are protected during the bankruptcy process. For that \nreason, this bill allows a bankruptcy judge to appoint a patient \nombudsman to make sure that the bankruptcy process is fair to patients. \nIf the ombudsman determines that the quality of patient care is \ndeclining, he must notify the bankruptcy court so that corrective \naction can be taken.\n  This legislation also requires that the bankruptcy trustee ensure \npatients are transferred to other hospitals when a health care provider \nis winding down. Under current bankruptcy law, there's no such \nrequirement. Under current law, patients could just be thrown out and \nhave nowhere to go. Congress can't let that happen.\n  Importantly, to the extent that there are some State laws which \nalready require a State agency to place patients when health care \nproviders go under, this legislation will allow those agencies to \nrecoup their expenses from the estate of the bankrupt health care \nprovider. Otherwise, the bankruptcy code forces State taxpayers to pay \nfor something which should be paid for by the defunct health care \nprovider.\n  Following a recommendation of the National Bankruptcy Review \nCommission, this legislation provides an important new protection for \nemployee health care and pensions. Under current law, if money is \nwithheld from wages to pay for health care insurance or pension \ncontributions, but a company declares bankruptcy before the withheld \nmoney is actually transferred, then the bankruptcy code prohibits the \ncompany from transferring this money. In practical terms, this means \nthat workers lose their health insurance and forfeit pension \ncontributions. I think this is wrong. So, my legislation will create a \nspecial carve out so that withheld money can go for its intended \npurpose.\n  The Business Bankruptcy Reform Act also makes several changes to the \nway securities transactions are treated under the bankruptcy code. Many \nof these changes are supported by the administration. I would call my \ncolleagues' attention to one provision in particular. As we all know, \nhome mortgage rates are at an all time low, allowing many Americans to \npurchase homes for the first time or to move into a larger home to \naccommodate a growing family. One factor in keeping mortgage interest \nrates very low is the existence of a robust secondary market where \nmortgage lenders can spread the risk by issuing securities backed up by \nhome mortgages. With the risk spread by a securities market, mortgage \nbankers can make loans at lower interest rates.\n  Unfortunately, a provision of the bankruptcy code threatens to \nundermine the viability of this important secondary market. And if the \nsecondary market dries up, then lenders will have to raise interest \nrates. Under current law, it isn't clear that the income stream going \nto the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities will continue if the \nlender declares bankruptcy. In my bill, we expressly say that the \nincome stream belongs to the securities purchaser and not the bankrupt \nlender. This change will help ensure that the secondary market stays \nstrong by providing much-needed certainty to purchasers of mortgage-\nbacked and other asset-backed securities.\n  On another topic, this legislation enacts the model law on \ninternational bankruptcies. When I held a hearing on international \nbankruptcies before my subcommittee last year, I learned that many \ntimes bankruptcy proceedings in this county are hampered because \nforeign countries won't cooperate with our bankruptcy courts. This \nmodel law would provide for standard procedures for recognizing and \ncooperating with foreign bankruptcy proceedings. If other countries--\nespecially our trading partners--follow our lead in enacting this model \nlaw, then our bankruptcy proceedings will be treated fairly and \nAmerican creditors will be able to get a fair shake for the first time \nwhen trying to collect from a foreign corporation which has declared \nbankruptcy.\n  The development of bankruptcy systems is a critically important \nfactor in ensuring that international trade will continue to expand and \nbenefit the United States economy. Many international insolvency \nspecialists tell me that the lack of a good bankruptcy system in the \nAsian countries is making the Asian financial crisis even worse. When \nwe finally get to consider the IMF funding bill, I intend to offer an \namendment which would require the IMF to push for meaningful bankruptcy \nreforms when they provide loans to countries in economic trouble. I \nhope that my colleagues will support me in this effort.\n  Finally, the legislation I'm introducing today will provide for \nspecial fast-track procedures for businesses that declare bankruptcy \nwhich have less than $5 million in debt. Right now, these cases often \nlanguish for years in bankruptcy without a real hope of reorganizing. I \nbelieve that the bankruptcy code should identify cases which have no \nrealistic chance of reorganizing and get them into chapter 7 as quickly \nas possible. In this way, creditors will get more of what they are \nowed. Most of these special fast-track proceedings were recommended by \nthe Bankruptcy Review Commission, although I've added some changes to \nreduce the chances that clever bankruptcy lawyers will find a way to \nkeep a company in chapter 11 which should be liquidated. The Business \nBankruptcy Reform Act also contains special tax provisions so that \ntaxing authorities will receive effective notice of a bankruptcy.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this bill will do much good for \npatients, for creditors and for all Americans whose lives are \nincreasingly affected by business bankruptcies. I hope that we can pass \nthis bill in this Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 1915. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to establish requirements \nconcerning the operation of fossil fuel-fired\n\n[[Page S3130]]\n\nelectric utility steam generating units, commercial and industrial \nboiler units, solid waste incineration units, medical waste \nincinerators, hazardous waste combustors, chlor-alkali plants, and \nPortland cement plants to reduce emissions of mercury to the \nenvironment, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n\n\n            Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act of 1998\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the ``Omnibus \nMercury Emissions Reduction Act of 1998.'' As United States Senators, \nwe all have a responsibility to build a nation for our children. As a \nrecent grandfather, this commitment has never been more real for me. I \nam introducing this comprehensive piece of legislation to eliminate \nmercury--one of the last remaining poisons without a specific control \nstrategy--from our air, our waters and our forests. By eliminating \nmercury from our natural resources, we will protect our nation's most \nimportant resource--our children and grandchildren.\n  As we learned from the campaign to eliminate lead, our children are \nat the greatest risk from these poisons. I often ask myself how many \nAlbert Einsteins have we lost in the last generation because of the \ntoxics they have been exposed to? Just as with lead, we know that \nmercury has much graver effects on children at very low levels then it \ndoes on adults. The level of lead pollution we and our children breathe \ntoday is one-tenth what it was a decade ago. That figure by itself is a \ntribute to the success of the original Clean Air Act. I want to achieve \nthe same results with mercury.\n  Mercury is toxic in every known form and of utterly no nutritional \nvalue. At high enough levels it poisons its victims in terribly tragic \nways. In Japan, victims of mercury poisoning came to be known as \nsuffering from Minimata Disease, which took its name from the small \nMinimata Bay in which they caught fish for their food.\n  For years, the Chisso Company discharged mercury contaminated \npollution in the Bay, which was taken into the flesh of fish and then \nthe people who ate them. Their disease was frightfully painful, causing \ntremors and paralysis, and sometimes leading to death. Thankfully, \ndischarges of mercury like those in Minimata Bay have been eliminated. \nBut a torrent of air pollution still needlessly pours this heavy metal \ninto the air of North America, poisoning lakes and streams, forests and \nfields and--most importantly--our children. Mercury control needs to be \na priority now because we know, without a doubt, of the neurological \ndamage it causes.\n  This is not to say that men, women and children are doubled over in \nagony as they were three decades ago in Japan. But wildlife are being \nkilled--we know that endangered Florida panthers have been fatally \npoisoned by mercury and that loons are endangered as well. In Lake \nChamplain we now have fish advisories for walleye, trout and bass even \nthough we have relatively no mercury emissions within our own state \nborders.\n  Instead, we Vermonters are exposed to mercury and other pollutants \nthat blow across Lake Champlain and the Green Mountains every day from \nother regions of the country. The waste incinerators and coal-fired \npower plants are not accountable to the people of Vermont and therefore \na federal role is needed to control the pollution.\n  That is part of the reason voters send us here. They expect Members \nof the Congress to determine what is necessary to protect the public \nhealth and the environment nationally, then require it. And in many \ncases, perhaps most, we have done that. But not with respect to \nmercury.\n  Mr. President, what I propose is that we put a stop to this poisoning \nof America. It is unnecessary, and it is wrong. Mercury can be removed \nfrom products, and it has been done. Mercury can be removed from coal-\nfired powerplants, and it should be done. With states deregulating \ntheir utility industries, this is the best opportunity to make sure \npowerplants begin to internalize the cost of their pollution. We cannot \nafford to give them a free ride into the next century at the expense of \nour children's health.\n  So, too, should mercury be purged from chlor alkali plants, medical \nwaste incinerators, municipal combustion facilities, large industrial \nboilers, landfills, lighting fixtures and other known sources.\n  My bill directs EPA to set mercury emission standards for the largest \nsources of mercury emissions. The bill requires reducing emissions by \n95 percent, but it also lets companies choose the best approach to meet \nthe standard at their facility whether through the use of better \ntechnology, cleaner fuels, process changes, or product switching.\n  We will hear a lot of rhetoric about how much implementing this bill \nwill cost. In advance of those complaints I want to make two points. \nFirst, when we were debating controls for acid rain we heard a lot \nabout the enormous cost of eliminating sulphur dioxide. But what we \nlearned from the acid rain program, is that when you give industry a \nfinancial incentive to clean up their act they will find the cheapest \nway. More often than not, assertions about the cost of controlling \npollution grossly overestimate and distort reality. If you look at \nelectricity prices of major utilities since the acid rain program was \nimplemented, their rates have remained below the national average and \nsome have actually decreased--even without adjusting for inflation.\n  Secondly, and most importantly, the bottom line here should not be \nthe cost of controlling mercury emissions, but the cost of NOT \ncontrolling mercury. While we may not be able to calculate how many \nEinstein's we have lost, if we lose one the price has been too high.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 1916. A bill for the relief of Marin Turcinovic, and his fiancee, \nCorina DeChalup; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                       private relief legislation\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a private bill \nfor the relief of Marin Turcinovic of Croatia and his wife Corina \nDeChalup of France. My bill would grant permanent resident status to \nMarin and Corina, affording them the legal security they need to \nrebuild their lives in this country.\n  Marin Turcinovic first arrived in the United States from Croatia in \nJanuary 1990. He was admitted on an H-1 visa as a member of the band \nLibertas. On February 8, 1990, during the period of his authorized \nstay, Marin was hit by a car in Fairview, New Jersey. Both his legs \nwere shattered. His spinal cord was severed, leaving him paralyzed \nbelow the neck. He will probably never walk again. His then-fiancee, \nCorina DeChalup of France, immediately came to the United States. Both \nMarin and Corina have been in the United States since their initial \nentries, and neither now has legal status.\n  Marin requires 24-hour medical care for his survival. An insurance \nsettlement from the car accident litigation provides Marin with \nlifetime medical and rehabilitative care, in a specially modified house \nlocated in the Beverly community of Chicago. According to Marin's \nlawyers, the insurance settlement that provides for Marin's lifetime \nshelter and medical care would not cover him at another location. A \nmedical malpractice suit against the doctors who initially provided \ncare to Marin is pending.\n  Corina and Marin married in February 1996, 6 years after his \naccident. Corina is an essential part of Marin's life. She has been \nwith Marin throughout his ordeal and has been instrumental in \ncoordinating his medical care. She has directly provided care for \nMarin, and he could never have reached the degree of recovery he now \nenjoys without her support.\n  Before arriving in the U.S., Corina, a university graduate, worked as \na tour guide for a Yugoslavian tourist agency. Although her days are \nprimarily devoted to Marin, she has the skills and desire to find part-\ntime employment and would like to obtain authorization to work.\n  According to Marin and Corina's lawyer, Corina has no way to legally \ngain permanent resident status in the U.S. Because she entered the U.S. \nunder the visa waiver pilot program, she was subject to an order of \ndeportation, without the right to an administrative hearing, once she \noverstayed her 90-day authorized admission in February 1990. Since \n1994, she has received a stay of deportation in 1-year increments. She \ncannot currently travel to see her family in\n\n[[Page S3131]]\n\nFrance, and she has no assurance that her stay will be renewed from 1 \nyear to the next.\n  Marin was placed in deportation proceedings in 1997 at his request. \nThis allowed him to seek a suspension of deportation, a legal remedy \nthat in the past has resulted in permanent resident status. Although \nMarin's application was granted, the grant is conditional. If Marin's \ngrant does not fall within the annual quota set by the Illegal \nImmigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act of 1996, it is \nunclear to what status he will revert. There is a possibility that \nMarin would be issued an order of voluntary departure.\n  Corina's status depends on Marin. If granted permanent resident \nstatus, Marin will be able to petition for Corina, but she will face a \n4- to 5-year wait before qualifying for resident status, herself.\n  Mr. President, 8 years ago, fate tragically changed forever the lives \nMarin Turcinovic of Croatia and Corina DeChalup of France. A terrible \naccident in the United States left Marin permanently injured, making \nhis return home impossible. Fortunately for Marin, he had the love and \nsupport of Corina, without whom he may not have made it this far. Given \nthe tremendous adversity that Marin and Corina already face on a day-\nto-day basis, I believe it appropriate for Congress to grant them \npermanent resident status. Such status would clear up much of the \nuncertainly that currently clouds their future, and would allow Marin \nand Corina to rebuild their lives in our country with confidence.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1916\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENCE.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for purposes of \n     the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), \n     Marin Turcinovic and his fiancee, Corina Dechalup, shall be \n     held and considered to have been lawfully admitted to the \n     United States for permanent residence as of the date of the \n     enactment of this Act upon payment of the required visa fees.\n\n     SEC. 2. REDUCTION OF NUMBER OF AVAILABLE VISAS.\n\n       Upon the granting of permanent residence to Marin \n     Turcinovic and his fiancee, Corina Dechalup, as provided in \n     this Act, the Secretary of State shall instruct the proper \n     officer to reduce by the appropriate number during the \n     current fiscal year the total number of immigrant visas \n     available to natives of the country of the aliens' birth \n     under section 203(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Reed, and Mrs. \n        Boxer):\n  S. 1917. A bill to prevent children from injuring themselves and \nothers with firearms; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                the child firearm access prevention act\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Chaffee, Reed \nand Boxer, to introduce the Child Firearm Access Prevention Act.\n  The tragedy which occurred in Jonesboro, AR, last week raises many \nquestions. Two come to mind immediately. Why do children kill? I do not \nknow the answer to that. I have heard a variety of opinions from people \nwho suggest that violent television and violent movies are somehow \ncontributing to this. There are others who say, if the children would \njust pray in school, it would make all the difference in the world. \nSome look to the families more than the schools; others think the \nschools have a greater role to play.\n  We will debate this at length, and I am sure many of us will come up \nwith a lot of different explanations as to why children reach the point \nin their young lives where they would take the life of another.\n  But the tragedy in Jonesboro raised another question which I think we \ncan address because it is a simpler question. How do children at that \nyoung age come to possess lethal weapons? Think about it. An 11-year-\nold and a 13-year-old with 10 firearms--rifles, shotguns, and handguns, \nand 3,000 rounds of ammunition--went into the woods behind that middle \nschool, tricked the students out with a fake fire alarm, opened fire \nand shot off somewhere in the range of 30 to 40 rounds before they were \nfinally stopped.\n  Four little girls were killed. A teacher, who deserves all of our \nrecognition and praise for her courage, stood in the line of fire to \nprotect one of those little girls and lost her own life. This teacher, \nthe mother of a 2-year-old, lost her life defending her students.\n  How do kids come into possession of firearms? They do not buy them. \nIn most States it is unthinkable that they would even approach a \ncounter and try. And yet, day after day in America there is further \nevidence of children, younger and younger, being found with firearms.\n  The day after the Jonesboro, AR, tragedy, in Cleveland, OH, a 4-year-\nold showed up at a day-care center with a loaded handgun.\n  In my home State of Illinois, in Marion, IL, a high school student \nshowed up at school the next day with a handgun.\n  In Daly City, CA, the day after Jonesboro, a 13-year-old was arrested \nfor attempting to murder his principal with a semiautomatic pistol.\n  There is something we can do about this. I am not sure that it will \nsolve the problem completely, but it can help. Fifteen States have \nalready recognized this problem and done something about it. These \nStates have passed a child access prevention law which is known as a \nCAP law, saying to those who purchase and own handguns, it is not \nenough for you to follow the law in purchasing them and to use those \nguns safely; you have another responsibility. If you are going to own a \nfirearm in your home, you have to keep it safely and securely so that \nchildren do not have access to it.\n  And these laws are effective. Florida was the first state to pass a \nCAP law in 1989. The following year, unintentional shooting deaths of \nchildren dropped by 50 percent. Moreover, a study published in the \nJournal of the American Medical Association in October 1997 found that \nthere was a 23% decrease in unintentional firearm related deaths among \nchildren younger than 15 in those states that had implemented CAP laws. \nAccording to the Journal of the American Medical Association, if all 50 \nstates had CAP laws during the period of 1990-1994, 216 children might \nhave lived.\n  Should we consider these state laws as a national model? I think the \nobvious answer is yes, because the tragedy in Jonesboro, which we will \nnot forget for a long, long time, unfortunately, is not unique. Every \nday in America 14 young people, ages 19 and under, are killed in gun \nhomicides, suicides and unintentional shootings, with many more \nwounded.\n  The scourge of gun violence frequently attacks the most helpless \nmembers of our society--our children.\n  Mr. President, what I propose today is Federal legislation that will \napply to every State, not just 15, but every State. And this is what it \nsays. If you want to own a handgun, a rifle or shotgun, and it is legal \nto do so, you can; but if you own it, you have a responsibility to make \ncertain that it is kept securely and safely.\n  You may buy a trigger lock. Senator Herb Kohl of Wisconsin has a \nproposal that all handguns be sold with trigger locks. I support it. I \nam a cosponsor of it. It makes sense.\n  How many times do you read in the paper, how many times do you listen \non TV, to kids with their playmates and the gun goes off and someone is \nkilled? A trigger lock, as Senator Kohl has proposed, is sensible. It \nshould be required. It shouldn't even be debated. I think that \nlegislation will go a long way toward reducing gun violence.\n  But beyond that proposal, the legislation I propose today, says to \nevery gunowner, if it is not a trigger lock, put that gun in a place \nwhere that child cannot get to it.\n  As to these two kids, 11 and 13 years old, God only knows what was \ngoing through their minds when they were setting out to get the guns to \ngo out and start shooting. They first stopped at the parents of one of \nthe kids and wanted to pick up that parents' guns. That parent had the \nguns under lock and key in a vault and they couldn't get to them. So \nthey thought about it and said, wait a minute, my grandfather has some, \ntoo; let's go over to his place. And that is where they came up with \nthe weapons and the ammunition.\n\n[[Page S3132]]\n\n  In one instance, one parent had taken the necessary steps to take the \nguns and keep them away from kids. Sadly, it appears--and I just say \n``appears'' because I do not know all the details--in another case that \ndid not happen.\n  Now a lot of people will say to me, ``There they go again, those \nliberals on Capitol Hill. Another bill, another law to infringe on \nsecond amendment rights.'' Oh, I know I will hear from the folks from \nthe National Rifle Association, all the other gun lobbies, screaming \nbloody murder about the second amendment.\n  But look at the 15 States that have already passed these child access \nprevention laws, to protect kids, to say to gun owners ``you have a \nspecial responsibility.'' You will not find a list of the most liberal \nStates in America. The first State to pass this legislation in 1989 was \nFlorida. The list goes on: Connecticut, Iowa, California, Nevada, New \nJersey, Virginia, Wisconsin, Hawaii, Maryland, Minnesota, North \nCarolina, Delaware, Rhode Island, and in 1995, the last State to pass a \nchild access prevention law, certainly no bleeding heart State by any \npolitical definition, was Texas. The Texas law says it is ``unlawful to \nstore, transport or abandon an unsecured firearm in a place where \nchildren are likely to be and can obtain access to it,'' and it is a \ncriminal misdemeanor if you do it.\n  I am going to ask my colleagues in the Senate to not only return home \nduring this recess and to not only witness those sad events on \ntelevision--the funerals in Jonesboro, the tributes--but to also \nresolve to do something about it. That is what we are here for. That is \nwhy we were elected to the Senate and the House, not just to be sad as \nwe should be, but to do something about it. Not to infringe on people's \nright to own firearms, but to say ``Own them responsibly, put them \nsecurely in your homes, keep them safely, keep them away from \nchildren.''\n  Mark my words, my friends, and you know this from human experience, \nno matter where you hide a gun or a Christmas gift, a kid is going to \nfind it. You can stick it in a drawer and say, ``Oh, they will never \nlook behind my socks, that is the last place in the world,'' or up on \nsome shelf in the closet and believe your child can't reach that, but \nyou know better. You know when you are gone and the house is empty \nthose kids are scurrying around and looking in those hiding places. So \nI hope we can address this issue.\n  First, Senator Kohl's legislation for these child safety devices, \nthese trigger locks, will help. But then take the extra step, follow \nthese 15 States and enact a federal law.\n\n  But please, let this Senate and this House, before we leave this \nyear, do something to make certain that those troubled children cannot \nget their hands on a firearm. I think every parent in America, \nparticularly those of children of school age, paused at least for a \nmoment after they heard about Jonesboro and thought, could it happen to \nmy son, my daughter, my grandson, my granddaughter? The sad reality of \nlife in modern America, is, yes, it could. There are so many weapons \nbeing kept so carelessly that it could happen to any of us or any of \nour children in virtually any school in America.\n  Mr. President, I know that the Senate has a very busy schedule and \nlimited opportunity this year, but I hope as part of our work we will \nlet the lesson of the tragedy of Jonesboro result in legislation that \nwill be designed to protect children and schoolteachers and innocent \npeople in the future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1917\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of Agriculture to make \navailable to producers of the 1998 and subsequent crops of wheat and \nfeed grains nonrecourse loans that provide a fair return to the \nproducers in relation to the cost of production; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n             the cost of production safety net act of 1998\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we now have had two crop years under the \n1996 farm law and soon farmers across this country will be planting \ntheir spring crops for the third year of this seven-year farm law. It \nis time to take a serious look at how this new farm law, often called \nthe Freedom to Farm law, is working. Is it achieving the goals and \npromises that were made? What is happening to our nation's system of \nfamily farm agriculture under this law? Is it creating new hope and new \nopportunities for a new generation of family farms on the land? Or is \nit pushing more and more family farm operators off the land and further \ndepopulating rural America?\n\n  Launched during a period of high grain prices with a flurry of \noptimism and hope, the Freedom to Farm law is taking family farmers \ndown a very rocky path and even more uncertain future. The initially \ngenerous farm payments that fueled its passage are now giving way to \nthe harsher realities of not having a working safety net.\n  When poor crops, low prices, escalating production costs, and \nabnormal weather all arrive at the same time, the current farm law, \nwith its capped commodity loan rates and declining transition payments, \nis poorly suited to respond to the disastrous conditions facing many of \nour farm families. During the debate of the 1996 farm bill, I said that \nthe time would come when\n\n[[Page S3133]]\n\nfarm commodity prices would fall well below the costs of production and \nwe would need a working safety net for our nation's family farmers. In \nfact, the failure to have a working safety net was the primary reason \nthat many of us could not support the 1996 farm bill.\n  The proponents of the Freedom to Farm law promised that a second look \nwould be taken if rural America ran into trouble under their farm bill. \nAs we begin the third crop year under this farm law, there is no \nquestion that large portions of rural America are in serious trouble. \nThe economic crisis in the countryside is being demonstrated every week \nby the hundreds of farm auction notices that appear in rural America's \nnewspapers, particularly our agricultural weeklies. The sheer volume of \nthese farm auctions demands that the farm bill debate be reopened, so \nthat we can make the needed mid-course corrections to this farm law.\n  Behind the escalating exodus of farmers this spring is the underlying \nissue of farm commodity prices. The value of North Dakota's spring \nwheat and barley crops this past year have each dropped by 41 percent \nfrom the previous year. This is a combined total of $659 million less \nthan the year before. That's a tremendous drain of money out of farmers \npockets and North Dakota's farm economy. It is why our farms are not \ncash flowing and our bankers are having more and more difficulty in \nfinancing their borrowers for another year.\n  After talking with North Dakota farmers and the agricultural \ncommunity, I'm convinced the problem is not just the blizzards and \nfloods that we have experienced in the past few years, nor is it just \nconfined to North Dakota.\n  There are a number of underlying problems that must be addressed \nwithin our nation's farm policies. We need increased agricultural \nresearch to combat specific crop disease problems such as fusarium head \nblight, which is also known as scab. This disease has had a devastating \neffect on producers in many parts of North Dakota. We need to recognize \nthat the current Federal Crop Insurance program is not adequately \naddressing disaster conditions, particularly in regions which have \nsuffered a succession of weather-related disasters. We need to address \na multitude of trade issues that are adversely affecting our foreign \nagricultural markets, and unfairly interfering in our domestic markets.\n\n\n                       Bottom line is farm prices\n\n  We can talk for hours about the variety of problems that are facing \nfarmers, but the bottom line is and always has been the commodity \nprices that our farmers receive when they seek to sell their harvests \nin the marketplace. The simple fact is that ever since the passage of \nthe 1996 farm law wheat prices have been on a downward slide, and there \nis nothing in place to stop these prices from falling further.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation which would strengthen the farm \ncommodity loan safety net, by establishing a new targeted commodity \nloan program geared to the actual costs of production. This is an \naddition to the current commodity loan program. My bill would not take \nanything away from producers, nor would it change any of the existing \nprograms in current law. The legislation I am introducing would \nestablish a new tier of marketing loans to provide a working safety net \ntargeted to our nation's family farms for wheat and feed grains.\n  We need to provide farmers, particularly our wheat producers, an \neffective marketing tool so that they can hold off selling their \nharvests until prices improve sufficiently to meet their production \ncosts. They need a functional loan program that allows orderly \nmarketing so that the supply they offer to the market demands a better \nprice.\n  When Congress told family farmers it was going to phase out price \nsupports and farmers would have to get their price from the \nmarketplace, Congress should have established a commodity loan program \nto allow such orderly marketing. Without a decent commodity loan, too \nmany farmers are forced to sell grain when the market offers dirt cheap \nprices.\n  To provide a working safety net, we need to increase the loan rate to \nbring it more in line with the costs of production and give wheat \nproducers greater equity with other commodities. We also need a loan \nthat lasts at least 12 months and can be extended for another 6 months, \nif needed.\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture has determined that the most \nrecent five year average of the economic costs of production for wheat \nis $5.00 per bushel. Under my plan, the loan rate would be pegged at a \nminimum of 75% of those costs. That would mean a minimum wheat loan of \n$3.75 per bushel, compared to the $2.58 maximum under the current farm \nlaw.\n  I am greatly concerned that the current wheat loan lags significantly \nbehind other commodities in relationship to production costs. For \nexample, the current maximum loan rate under the 1996 farm law for corn \nis 72% of its economic costs of production. The maximum loan rate under \ncurrent law for soybeans is set at 89% of its costs of production. Yet, \nthe maximum loan available for wheat under the current farm law is just \n52% of the costs of production.\n  Equity among major farm commodities requires that Congress take a \nclose look at why there is such a great discrepancy among loan rates \nfor our major commodities in relationship to the costs of production of \nthese commodities. Based on the fact that current wheat loans are at \nthe lowest level in relationship to production costs, it is not \nsurprising that wheat country is in greater economic trouble than the \nother sections of our nation's agriculture.\n  This legislation is a companion bill to S. 26, the Agricultural \nSafety Net Act, introduced by Senator Daschle and cosponsored by myself \nand others. Both bills seek to improve the underlying commodity loan \nprogram and provide higher, more meaningful commodity loan rates for \nour producers. S. 26 would remove the commodity loan caps in the \ncurrent farm law. As a result, commodity loan rates could actually be \nset at 85 percent of the simple five-year Olympic average of prices \nreceived by farmers. S. 26 provides an important cushioning effect for \nfarm prices and would help stabilize farm prices and thereby help \nfarmers meet the challenges of price volatility in the marketplace.\n  The bill I am introducing today would add a critically important \nbottom line to ensure that farmers receive cost of production returns \non a basic level of production. It establishes that commodity loan \nrates for wheat and corn must be at a minimum level of 75 percent of \nthe economic costs of production. Other feed grain loan rates would be \nbased on the historic relationship of using their feed equivalency \nvalue to corn.\n\n\n               Targeting farm programs to family farmers\n\n  There is one more essential reform. My plan targets the benefits to \nfamily farmers. My new loan program would be available on the first \n20,000 bushels of wheat, and 30,000 bushels of corn, and similar \namounts for other feed grains for each farm. By setting a limit on the \namount of loans available to any farm, it not only ensures that the \nprimary benefits go to our family farmers, but it also means that \noverproduction will be subject to the disciplines of market forces.\n  We cannot afford to cover every bushel produced in this country, so \nwe need to target them to the family farm. If somebody wants to farm \nthe entire township or even the entire county they can do so, but we do \nnot need to give them a safety net for everything they produce. If they \nwish to take the risks of such endeavor, they should be free to do so. \nBut, they shouldn't have the government as their silent partner.\n  One of the major problems of past farm programs has been that they \nwere not targeted to an initial basic production level to family \nfarmers. The farm programs were basically open-ended programs. The more \nyou produced, the greater benefits you received. Thus the benefits of \nthe farm program tended to accumulate at the top, rather than spreading \nout across the base of family farmers in rural America. Rather than \ncarrying out our nation's historic goal of maintaining a widely-\ndispersed system of family farm agriculture, unfortunately the Freedom \nto Farm law, continued the old farm program's top-loaded pattern in its \ntransition payment scheme.\n  My plan would target the benefits of a working safety net directly \nrelated to the costs of production to the initial production of family \nfarmers in this\n\n[[Page S3134]]\n\ncountry. It is a true safety net designed to fit the typical family \nfarmer. The simple fact is that our family farmers are the ones that \nhave the greatest need for a safety net based on production costs. It \nmakes good sense and good public policy to target our farm program to \nour family farmers. Such a safety net is particularly important to the \nbeginning farmer and other low-equity farmers because it provides an \nassurance that they can more fully recover their costs during periods \nof low prices. It provides the stability they need to build their farm \noperation and it gives rural America the opportunity to reinvigorate \nthe family farm system.\n  My plan continues to let farmers plant whatever they want, based on \nmarket signals. But it would also let them market their grain more \neffectively in response to those same market signals. It provides a new \nworking safety net, and gives family farmers a tool they need as they \ndo business in a market filled with far more powerful interests and \nforces, most of whom want lower, not higher, prices.\n  There are those who are fearful that if Congress reopens the farm \nbill debate that somehow the nation would return to the production \ncontrols and government involvement in planting decisions of past farm \nprograms. This is simply not the case. I don't know of anybody who \nseriously wants to go back to such government involvement in \nagricultural production decisions.\n  In fact, those who believe that is the framework of agricultural \npolicy choices, are not only misreading the current situation, but also \ndid not listen very closely to the debate in the 1996 farm law. The \ndebate was not about government production controls. The debate was \nwhether or not there should be a safety net for family farmers, and how \nshould that safety net be constructed. There were no bills offered in \nthe farm bill debate to return to production controls. The debate was \nabout whether to phase out farm programs in their entirety or to reform \nour nation's farm laws so that family farmers have a working safety \nnet.\n  How do we construct a safety net that provides greater marketing \ncapabilities into the hands of our family farmers? That is the debate \nwe must have in this session of Congress. We cannot afford to wait \nwhile thousands of family farmers are in the process of leaving their \nhomesteads and their chosen profession, and their dreams, and thousands \nof others are at increased risk of being forced out of agriculture.\n  Mr. President. During this past Christmas season, I received a copy \nof a family holiday letter from a fourth generation family farm couple \nthat announced their decision to leave their chosen profession of \nfarming and ranching. George and Karen Saxowsky of Hebron are scheduled \nto have their farm auction this spring. It is a powerful letter that \ncaptures the challenges, frustrations, and dreams of those families who \nhave been struggling to make a livelihood in agriculture. They consider \nthemselves lucky, because they were not forced by the bank to make the \ndecision to leave farming. Yet, they have a host of loans and bills to \npay and are not sure of how they will get all of that done. I ask \nunanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n     Holiday Greetings to our Friends and Families:\n       It is early Sunday morning and while the house is still \n     quiet with everyone sleeping and the trees are so beautifully \n     frost covered, I thought I would dash off a quick line in \n     spite of my resolution not to send a letter this year--when I \n     bought the Christmas cards I really loved the message but \n     thought, that is enough reading for most people!\n       In April we had the worst blizzard ever--the city of Hebron \n     was without electricity for 48 hours, but we did have it most \n     of the time. A ``city'' friend and classmate of George's \n     called during the blizzard to say he just loves a good \n     blizzard--my perspective was different so as a gift to him I \n     started a chronicle of the storm, the events that went with \n     it, and the aftermath in a blow-by-blow account that took 15 \n     typed pages; it was my way of coping and I handled everything \n     fine at the time but now I can't read it without crying. \n     Jason was off the farm during the whole thing but Glendon was \n     here and such wonderful help and such a trooper.\n       March had gone out like a lamb with 60 degree days. The \n     predictions were the storm would miss us; then changed to 3-5 \n     inches of snow with wind and it would end Friday night. We \n     had just bought another large portable (can be moved with two \n     tractors) calf shelter, so now had two, and have lots of \n     corrals, wind breaks, protection, feed and hay on hand--so \n     felt pretty confident we were ready.\n       The storm actually raged all day Friday, Saturday, and on \n     into Sunday afternoon with gusts through the evening. We got \n     some outrageous amounts of snow--after twenty-four inches it \n     didn't matter anymore.\n       The cattle started running with the storm, the guys were \n     able to get them turned around and back to corrals but that \n     was just the beginning of the nightmare! We chased different \n     herds into protected areas (of course they don't want to go), \n     then we worked on getting 70 calves into the calf-shelter and \n     decided to haul those that were freezing from the corrals \n     into the barn (the pick-ups, tractors nor bobcat could get \n     through the snow) fighting 50 mph winds, George bought one \n     calf while I tried to help Glendon bring another--going up \n     hill and fighting the wind in thigh deep snow--I just \n     couldn't do it. We got those two to the barn, decided they \n     were in such bad shape if we were going to save them they \n     would have to go to the house so took them there, then \n     reassessed the situation. Glendon said, ``If we do another \n     trip I'll have to pull Mom and the calf, in the calf sled, up \n     hill, in the blizzard!'' And that was the truth of it.\n       The tractor bucket broke, but they couldn't get the tractor \n     to the shop to weld it so in the raging blizzard they brought \n     the welder, on a calf sled, from the shop to the house, \n     pulled my stove ahead to plug it in, drove the tractor up on \n     the porch and welded it in the kitchen doorway--twice. The \n     stories just go on and on (guess you had to be there)! Those \n     poor guys worked all day in the blizzard, came in exhausted, \n     took a quick nap and went back out. At 7:30 Saturday night \n     they were coming in for supper when they heard loud cracks in \n     the barn--the roof beams were cracking from the weight of the \n     snow! They stayed out and shoved off the roof until \n     11:30 (figured they moved about 3 tons of snow and ice), \n     then got up at five the next morning and worked all day \n     again.\n       As the storm abated Sunday evening I could hear Glendon \n     yelling and ran to see what was going on now, but couldn't \n     find him. Here, they had found a cow lying on its side \n     drowning in muck. Glendon was lying flat on his belly holding \n     the cows head out of the muck while George was trying \n     frantically to get the tractor down to him. I plowed through \n     four foot deep snow to help--the first tractor got wet and \n     quit. (All during the storm we had distributor caps in the \n     oven drying out!) He got the Bobcat--it quit; he got the next \n     tractor and we made it down there, tore a fence down, put \n     chains on the cow and pulled her out. She died; as did a calf \n     that had been buried in the snow someplace in the ten feet \n     where we had pulled the cow and we didn't even see, until the \n     snow melted enough, that it was under her; as did those two \n     calves in the basement; as did a calf that had followed its \n     mother to the water fountain, got stuck in the snow and froze \n     to death standing up--we must have walked by that calf fifty \n     times but with the blizzard didn't see it--they get snow \n     covered really fast; as did the cow in the corral with a roof \n     over her head with water and hay right beside her; as did . . \n     . well, you get the picture. It continued for fourteen days \n     after the storm, every day we lost at least one cow and/or \n     calf. We took them to the vets for autopsies and what-not but \n     it just seemed there was nothing we could do to save them. \n     One day we made it to 5:00 without any dying and thought the \n     curse was broken but by midnight we had lost a cow and a \n     calf. It was terrible, terrible time, but we lived through \n     it--but not alone. Friends were there for us. On the Friday \n     after the storm, one called to tell us to get out of the \n     house and come to town for a Fireman's Dance--we were just \n     too exhausted and depressed--but he was pushy (he did the \n     same thing for us after last year's cow incident on I-94. We \n     went, and visited with other farmer-ranchers who were in the \n     same boat--it really was so helpful and encouraging.\n       We were really dreading the first snow of this winter. Long \n     about October, George started talking about quitting \n     farming--I took it as a mid-life crisis; a one time slide. \n     But, he kept talking . . . and then started making plans. We \n     would put in a crop in '98 and quit in '99. I still thought \n     `this-too-shall-pass'' but he just got more serious. In \n     November I started getting calls asking if I would like a job \n     off the farm? I have to tell you, I was so flattered that \n     they even considered me capable of doing what they needed; I \n     had been self-employed for almost 25 years. I turned them \n     down, but it did start the wheels turning. Then, there was an \n     ad in the paper for a job in Hebron with benefits. We talked \n     about it and I applied; they offered me the job and I took \n     it. This was not easy, now we couldn't put a crop in this \n     spring as the job is 40 hours a week including every other \n     Saturday and George can't farm without me.\n       The bottom line is; a 47 year old, 4th generation farmer in \n     his 27th year of farming is quitting farming.\n       I started working at the Credit Union on December 1st. I \n     thought my world would fall apart--the week before I started \n     work everything just `went-to-hell-in-a-basket' and I almost \n     decided I couldn't do it! We sold a semi load of cattle, \n     checked the night before and the market was strong so loaded \n     them up early in the morning. At 10:00 the auctioneer called \n     and said the bottom had fallen out of\n\n[[Page S3135]]\n\n     the market, a bunch of Canadian cattle had just hit the meat \n     packing plants and their buyers weren't buying. George was \n     gone so I had decided what to do; with paying to have them \n     hauled out, and back, then to sale again I said to let \n     them go, when George got home he agreed with me but at the \n     next sale the price was strong again--George and I said, \n     ``That's why we're getting out of farming--there is no \n     predictability!!''\n       It was like the farm really needed both of us--as much for \n     moral support as the labor itself. The clincher almost came \n     on Sunday night (before my new job on Monday morning) when I \n     had planned a special ``last-supper'' of T-bones and had them \n     thawing on the counter while I was working on the computer--\n     the cats jumped up on the counter and ate them!! Monday \n     morning came and--I went to work. I was so surprised, but I \n     just love my job!! I don't know if it is the people I work \n     with, the people that come in, the feeling of accomplishment, \n     the challenge of balancing the books or what (there is life \n     after farming???) but, I am really happy that I followed \n     through!! In training the hardest part was the balancing out \n     and having everything in the main office by 3:00--one night \n     it was 5:15. Until we actually balance I am always so \n     grateful if I am ``long'' on the money side so at least then \n     they know I didn't take it!! I seem to have the hang of it \n     now, so it is less stressful, easier and even balancing is \n     fun! Everyone is so nice, and I really am trying hard--but \n     keep me in your prayers!\n       It sounds like we are having an auction sale in March on \n     the Saturday before Palm Sunday. We are planning on renting \n     out the land and selling the cattle but still living on the \n     farm. George will continue making hay to sell, doing custom \n     combining and has been working with the local electrician and \n     for elevator doing some carpentry stuff. I thought the deal \n     was if I took a job he would stay home until the cows were \n     gone but . . . I guess not!!\n       I have friend who just lost her 38 year old son-in-law to a \n     24 hour illness. Then, trying to come back home from her \n     daughter and grandchildren she was delayed three days as the \n     planes couldn't land due to fog. She was home three days when \n     her house caught on fire. The good news is we're small town. \n     We care about and support each other. We may have our little \n     squabbles and irritations but we get over it and move on! \n     Pastors sermon today was about helping each other cut the \n     tops off some of the ills we have to climb and walking with \n     them through the valley of grief for their upbuilding, \n     encouragement, and consolation. We thought of you, our \n     friends and family! With that thought in mind, we wish you \n     little knolls rather than mountains to climb, friends to \n     share the valleys with a sincere * * *.\n           Merry Christmas and a very Happy New Year!!\n                   George and Karen Saxowsky, Hebron, North Dakota\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in reading this letter, I am reminded of \nthe reasons why it is so important that our nation provide a national \nagricultural policy framework that not only fosters a family farm \nsystem of agriculture, but purposefully sets out to undergird that \nsystem and provide the tools that are necessary for our family farmers \nand ranchers to have the opportunity to be successful.\n  It is for this reason that I am introducing the Cost of Production \nSafety Net Act. I am pleased to include Senators Daschle, Wellstone, \nJohnson, Conrad, Harkin and Baucus as cosponsors to my bill. I \nencourage others to join in this effort and look forward to having a \nmeaningful debate on our nation's agricultural future in the remaining \nmonths of this session.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself, Mr. Nickles, Mrs. Hutchison, and \n        Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 1919. A bill to provide for the energy security of the Nation \nthrough encouraging the production of domestic oil and gas resources \nfrom stripper wells on federal lands, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself, Mr. Nickles, and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 1920. A bill to improve the administration of oil and gas leases \non Federal lands, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n\n\n        the federal stripper well royalty reductions legislation\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two important \npieces of legislation relating to oil and gas production on federal \nlands. The first is a bill to authorize and direct the Secretary of the \nInterior to provide permanent regulatory authority to reduce the \nroyalty rate for stripper oil and gas wells on federal lands.\n\n  This legislation is necessary, Mr. President, because of the \ndepressed world oil price situation. With oil prices falling below $15 \nper barrel, it is more and more difficult for domestic energy companies \nto produce oil at a reasonable price. While this is good news to U.S. \nconsumers because gasoline is at its lowest price ever when adjusted \nfor inflation, it is not welcome news to small and independent oil and \ngas producers who will be especially hard hit.\n  Under ``normal'' circumstances, stripper wells are on the edge of \nprofitability. Low world oil prices threaten stripper wells and the \njobs associated with those wells. That, in turn, has ripple effects \nelsewhere in the economy through loss of jobs in the industries that \nsupply goods and services to producers, and in the communities where \nthey operate.\n  Mr. President, according to the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact \nCommission, there are approximately 430,000 stripper oil wells and \n170,000 stripper gas wells in the U.S. A sizeable number of these, \nperhaps as many as 30,000, are on federal lands.\n  What is absolutely astounding, Mr. President, is the fact that \nstripper wells individually average a little more than 2 barrels of oil \nand 16 thousand cubic feet of gas production per day, yet in 1996 \ncollectively contributed 352 million barrels of oil (more than 11 \npercent of U.S. production, and 5 percent of U.S. consumption), and \nalmost 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas.\n  There are 38,000 jobs associated with stripper wells, and another \n46,000 outside of the industry related to stripper wells. We cannot \nafford to lose stripper well production and the vital role they play in \nnational energy security. Nor can we afford to lose the jobs associated \nwith them. That is why I am introducing today the Federal Oil and Gas \nStripper Well Preservation Act of 1998. I am pleased to be joined by \nSenator Nickles and Senator Hutchison in sponsoring this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, our bill is very simple: it authorizes and directs the \nSecretary of the Interior to provide permanent regulatory authority to \nreduce the royalty rate for stripper oil and gas wells on federal \nlands. The Secretary already has limited authority to grant stripper \noil well royalty reductions. We want to ensure that there is permanent \nauthority to do so.\n  We also want to make sure that the Secretary has permanent authority \nto grant royalty rate reductions for stripper gas wells, something that \nthe Secretary recently has declined to do.\n  Second, our bill requires the Secretary to suspend any minimum \nroyalty (if applicable) and per acre lease rental on stripper oil and \ngas wells on federal lands during the time of any royalty rate \nreduction. This will ensure that stripper well operators are afforded \nthe greatest leeway during hard times.\n  And finally, our bill requires the applicable lease rental and \nminimum royalty to be reinstated once the Secretary terminates a \nstripper well royalty rate reduction.\n  Mr. President, I believe this legislation will make a significant \ncontribution in stemming the tide of lost production from our Nation's \nstripper oil and gas wells. Once plugged and abandoned, these wells--\nand their vital contribution to national energy security--are more \nlikely than not permanently lost. We should not lose this valuable \nnational asset.\n  I invite my colleagues to join Senator Nickles, Senator Hutchison and \nme in sponsoring the Federal Oil and Gas Stripper Well Preservation Act \nof 1998.\n\n\n   Transfer of Certain Federal Oil and Gas Lease Management Functions\n\n  Mr. President, the second piece of legislation I introduce today \nrelating to federal oil and gas production addresses the performance of \noil and gas lease management activities on federal lands. We have been \nhearing for some time now that States are very much interested in \nassuming certain oil and gas lease management functions that are now \nperformed by the U.S. on federal oil and gas leases. We saw strong \ninterest from States in assuming certain royalty management functions \nwhen we considered and ultimately enacted the Federal Oil and Gas \nRoyalty Simplification and Fairness Act in 1996. Devolution of federal \noil and gas regulatory functions to States is a concept whose time has \ncome.\n\n[[Page S3136]]\n\n  The legislation I introduce today along with Senator Nickles and \nSenator Hutchison would do the following: transfer the Bureau of Land \nManagement's (BLM) authority to perform certain oil and gas regulatory \nduties to States; institute distinct and reasonable time frames for \nleasing decisions and appeals; require responsible actions to increase \nleasing; and reduce federal appeals delays by rejecting stay requests \nfrom parties that have no standing.\n  We believe this legislation will generate savings to the Treasury by \nincreasing administrative efficiencies, eliminating duplication of \neffort, decreasing time frames on leasing and appeals decisions, and \nincreasing certainty in leasing. We also believe the bill will increase \nfederal acreage available for exploration and development, improve the \ndomestic oil and gas resource base, and promote oil and gas production \non federal lands.\n  The key feature of the bill is the transfer from BLM to States \nauthority over such activities as: well drilling and production \noperations; well testing and completion; conversion of a producing well \nto a water well; well abandonment procedures; inspections; enforcement \nactivities; and site security. Many States already perform these \nfunctions on federal leases, and are willing to do so on a permanent \nbasis. By transferring federal responsibility for these activities, \nfederal resources could be used for other purposes.\n  Our bill also requires BLM and the Forest Service to offer \ncompetitive oil and gas leases 90 days after lands are ``nominated'' by \nprospective lessees. The bill requires BLM and the Forest Service to \nrender final decisions on administrative appeals within two years. \nThese provisions will eliminate costly delays and litigation, allow \nrealization of lease revenues (bonuses, rents, royalties) sooner, and \nprovide stability and clarity to planning.\n  Mr. President, we believe the transfer of lease management functions \ncan be achieved with significant savings to States and the Treasury and \nwill not disrupt lease management functions or impair important \nresource production. We urge our colleagues in the Senate to join in \nsupporting this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 1921. A bill to ensure confidentiality with respect to medical \nrecords and health care-related information, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                        the health care pin act\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today, I join with my good friend \nSenator Christopher Dodd, in announcing the introduction of the Health \nCare Personal Information Nondisclosure Act of 1998--The Health Care \nPIN Act. This legislation will establish necessary national standards \nto protect the confidentiality of each American's medical records.\n\n  Information technology presents our nation with the difficult \nchallenge of ensuring that we reap its benefits without sacrificing one \nof our most important values: the right to individual privacy. In order \nto maintain control over our personal medical information, Congress \nmust pass health care confidentiality legislation--as quickly as \npossible.\n  The time is ripe for action. There have been major technological \nadvances in health care's administrative, delivery, and payment \nsystems. These advances have the potential to improve the quality of \npatient care. For example, electronic pharmaceutical records make it \npossible for pharmacists to identify potential drug interactions before \nfilling a prescription. However, we must also have guarantees that our \npersonal health care information is not being used inappropriately.\n  Congress has made repeated attempts to enact a comprehensive federal \nprivacy law but has, to date, been unsuccessful. The loose web of \nprotections at the federal and state levels that has evolved in the \nabsence of a comprehensive law leaves many aspects of health \ninformation unprotected.\n  The Health Care PIN Act represents a synthesis of recommendations \nfrom many sources. It draws heavily from the discussion draft that I \nworked on with Senator Bennett and the ``Medical Information Privacy \nand Security Act,'' introduced by Senator Leahy and Senator Kennedy. \nThe Labor and Human Resources Committee has held three hearings on the \nconfidentiality of health care information, and the testimony and \ncomments provided at each of those hearings has been invaluable--\nespecially, the administration's recommendations presented by Secretary \nShalala in September.\n  Under the terms of the Kassebaum/Kennedy legislation, if Congress \nfails to enact federal privacy legislation by August 1999, the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services is required to promulgate \nregulations establishing electronic privacy standards in the year 2000. \nThis is too important a matter of public policy to be done outside of \nthe legislative process and it is another reason why I intend to make \nthis task one of the highest priorities of the Labor and Human \nResources Committee.\n  Other nations have taken steps to protect patient privacy. In 1995, \nthe European Union enacted the Data Privacy Directive. The EU Directive \nrequires that individuals have rights of consent, access, correction, \nand remedies for failure to protect confidential personal information. \nThis Directive requires that by October 1998, if countries trading with \nany of the 15 European Union member states do not introduce similar \nrules, data cannot be transmitted between these countries. If we do not \nact promptly, this initiative raises the concern that the European \nUnion could limit the flow of health care data between our countries \nfor research and restrict the ability of American companies to compete \noverseas.\n  The Health Care PIN Act would preempt state laws relating to medical \nrecords confidentiality--with the important exception of public health \nissues and those areas having a history of discrimination, such as \nmental health and HIV-AIDS. Since most health plans exchange health \ncare information over the borders of many states, we need one privacy \nstandard in this county--rather than 50 different ones--in order to \nachieve the greatest benefits from information technology and also \nensure that all Americans have a uniform standard of privacy \nprotection.\n  The Act requires that individually identifiable health care \ninformation not be released unless authorized by patient consent. With \nvery few exceptions, individually identifiable health care information \nshould be disclosed for health purposes only, which includes the \nprovision and payment of care and plan operations. Under the \nlegislation, patients would have the right to copy and correct their \nmedical records. In order to achieve accountability, the Health Care \nPIN Act provides that civil and criminal penalties would be imposed on \nindividuals who use information improperly through unauthorized \ndisclosure.\n  Our individual right to privacy at times must be balanced against the \nneed to protect the health of others. The Health Care PIN Act allows \nfor the disclosure of health information without patient consent for \nthe release of information to public health authorities for disease \nreporting. In addition, patient consent would not be required to \ndisclose information needed for legitimate law enforcement purposes, \nincluding purposes required by state law such as the reporting of \ngunshot victims. Quality care requires more than the free flow of \ninformation between providers, payers, and other users of health \ninformation. It requires trust between a patient and a care giver. For \nour health care system to be effective, as well as efficient, patients \nmust feel comfortable sharing sensitive information with health \nprofessionals. Technology has provided the tools to allow the ease of \naccess to health care information. Now, the Health Care PIN Act is \nneeded to ensure the confidentiality of this personal health \ninformation.\n  It is my intent to work closely with the other members of the Labor \nand Human Resources Committee, and Senators Bennett and Leahy, to enact \nlegislation this year that will establish national standards to protect \nmedical information and enhance quality of health care for all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the Chairman of the \nLabor and Human Resources Committee, Senator Jeffords, in introducing \nthe Health Care Personal Information Nondisclosure (PIN) Act of 1998. \nThis legislation is designed to offer Americans the peace of mind that \ncomes with\n\n[[Page S3137]]\n\nknowing that their most personal and private medical information is \nprotected from misuse and exploitation.\n  Medicine has changed dramatically since the time Norman Rockwell \npainted the scene of a doctor examining his young patient's doll. The \nflow of medical information is no longer confined to doctor-patient \nconversations and hospital charts. Recent technological advances have \nintroduced more efficient methods of organizing data that allow \ninformation to be shared instantaneously--helping to contain costs--and \neven save lives. The national database of medical information provides \na prime example of the benefits of these advances. Through the use of a \nsimple computer, emergency room doctors are now equipped with a quick \nand inexpensive means of accessing the medical records needed to \nproperly treat unconscious patients.\n  Unfortunately, as we saw all too clearly just a few months ago, our \nlaws have not kept pace with technology. In February the Washington \nPost exposed the activities of two pharmacies that were sharing \npersonal medical information about prescription drug use with \nunauthorized third parties. And, most disturbingly, these actions were \nperfectly legal. Clearly, the existing patchwork of state laws \nprotecting medical records are proving to be inadequate to address the \npublic's concerns.\n  These concerns are so strong that in some cases they threaten to \nactually negate the benefits of advances in medicine and technology. \nThe fear of discrimination and exploitation has led some ethnic \ncommunities with susceptibility to certain conditions to urge their \nmembers to avoid genetic testing. The fear that sensitive medical \ninformation might be released without authorization has led patients to \navoid full disclosure of mental health concerns to their physicians and \nto unnecessarily forego opportunities for treatment.\n  I believe that the Health Care PIN Act offers the privacy protections \nthat the public demands. This legislation sets clear guidelines for the \nuse and disclosure of medical information by health care providers, \nresearchers, insurers, employers and others. The Health Care PIN Act \nprovides individuals with control over their most personal information, \nyet promotes the efficient exchange of health data for the purposes of \ntreatment, payment, research and oversight. To ensure the \naccountability of entities and individuals with access to personal \nmedical information, the legislation imposes stiff penalties for \nunauthorized disclosures.\n  The Health Care PIN Act provides consumers with a strong, nationally \nuniform set of privacy protections. However, in areas of privacy law in \nwhich states have been the most active--namely in the confidentiality \nof sensitive mental health and public health records--states could \ncontinue to establish additional protections.\n  I would also like to indicate my intent to work with Senator Jeffords \nto incorporate into this legislation protections against genetic \ndiscrimination in both employment and health insurance. Although we \nwere unable to resolve this issue before introduction of this \nlegislation, I am confident that we can reach consensus on this \ncritical and timely issue.\n  This legislation represents common-sense middle ground in the range \nof proposals that have been offered both this and the previous \nCongress. I look forward to working with Senator Jeffords, as well as \nwith Senators Bennett, Leahy, and Kennedy, who have contributed so much \nto this debate, to move forward quickly to enact comprehensive, \nbipartisan legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 1922. A bill to amend chapter 61 of title 5, United States Code, \nto make election day a legal public holiday, with such holiday to be \nknown as ``Freedom and Democracy Day''; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                 freedom and democracy day legislation\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, as our nation approaches the Millennium, \nit is an appropriate time to renew the appreciation and understanding \nof the American people in the democratic heritage and principles which \nmake our country the greatest in the world. That is why I am \nintroducing legislation today to rename Election Day as Freedom and \nDemocracy Day and to renew civic responsibility.\n  The two main objectives of this legislation are first, to broaden and \nincrease voter turnout, and second, to restore appreciation for our \ncountry's most fundamental expression of freedom and its democratic \nunderpinnings--the right to vote. As a nation, we must all be concerned \nthat voter apathy is so high, while voter participation is so low. \nVoting, it seems, has become a neglected, if not cumbersome, privilege \nof Americans. In the past 20 years, voter participation in presidential \nelection years has remained barely above 50 percent, and during midterm \ncongressional election years it has not been more than 50 percent.\n  I am alarmed at the unfortunate fact that voter participation has \ndeclined to the point that it is now among the lowest of any democratic \nnation. The rate of voter participation among younger Americans--the \nfuture leaders, teachers, and business executives--has declined \nsignificantly. It is our responsibility as elected officials, and, more \nimportantly, as American citizens, to support additional efforts to \nstrengthen the electoral process, to encourage civic awareness, and to \npromote active participation in the exercise of liberty.\n  Therefore, the first goal of the bill is to renew civic spirit and \nhighlight the importance of Americans to fulfill their civic \nresponsibilities by making Election Day a legal public holiday, known \nas Freedom and Democracy Day. This designation gives new meaning to the \nimportance of voting on the first Tuesday in November. We need to \nstress the importance of self-government, encourage Americans to \nexercise their freedom and liberty as citizens by voting, and encourage \nAmericans to reinvigorate their support for their civic duties.\n  Although my bill designates this day as a legal public holiday, I \nwant to emphasize that Freedom and Democracy Day will remain a regular \nworkday. The bill specifically does not reference statutes relating to \npay and leave of federal employees, and it does not affect the regular \noperations of the federal government.\n  We as legislators and as citizens should do more to promote voter \nturnout and increase understanding of the value and importance of the \nright to vote. That is why the second objective of this bill is to \nencourage communities, schools, civic organizations, charitable \norganizations, companies, radio and television broadcasters, and public \nofficials at all levels of government to support and celebrate Freedom \nand Democracy Day. The legislation encourages these key segments of \nsociety to sponsor and publicize appropriate celebrations and events \nwhich stress the importance of participation in self government. Their \nprograms and support will send a strong message that the legitimacy of \nthe democratic process is created from the consent of the governed, and \nvoiced in the full participation of an informed, aware and active \ncitizenry.\n  I believe my bill provides a starting point for a renewed spirit and \nappreciation of freedom and democracy. It is my sincere hope that given \nmore incentive to vote, more Americans will seize and exercise this \nexpression of freedom. It is a small step in the overall effort to \nencourage all American citizens to take pride and participate in their \nrepresentative system of government.\n  Much of the voter apathy reflects many citizens' lack of faith in all \nlevels of government. In America, power is supposed to be delegated \nfrom the citizen and loaned to the government. The Founding Fathers, \nwho pledged their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor for a \nnew country, knew that as a nation we must leave room for change and \ngrowth and development. They knew the nation they left for us would \nmodernize, rethink, and restructure.\n  Let us be vigilant in remembering that the American idea of democracy \nis a government ``of the people, by the people, for the people.'' This \nis the idea of freedom and liberty; uniquely American. And, it is the \ngoal of this bill to strengthen the American people's right to freedom \nand celebrate the spirit of democracy in the country which first \nempowered citizens with ``certain unalienable rights.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be entered into \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S3138]]\n\n                                S. 1922\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) democratic government derives its legitimacy from the \n     consent of the governed, as manifested in the full \n     participation of an informed and aware electorate;\n       (2) since 1960 the rate of voter participation in the \n     United States has declined and is now among the lowest of any \n     nation with a democratic form of government;\n       (3) since 1972 the rate of voter participation among young \n     people in the United States has declined significantly;\n       (4) the Federal Government should encourage personal \n     responsibility and the broader understanding of the value and \n     importance of the right to vote; and\n       (5) the establishment of a legal public holiday on election \n     day, the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November of \n     each even numbered year, could provide a substantial \n     incentive to increase voter participation by the American \n     public.\n\n     SEC. 2. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that educators, civic and \n     charitable organizations, radio and television broadcasters, \n     and public officials at all levels of government should help \n     the people of the United States celebrate Freedom and \n     Democracy Day through appropriate celebrations and events \n     which stress the importance of self-government.\n\n     SEC. 3. DESIGNATION OF ELECTION DAY AS LEGAL PUBLIC HOLIDAY.\n\n       Section 6103 of title 5, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subsection (d) as subsection (e); and\n       (2) by inserting after subsection (c) the following:\n       ``(d)(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the first Tuesday after \n     the first Monday in November in each even numbered year, \n     Election Day, shall be a legal public holiday, with such \n     holiday to be known as Freedom and Democracy Day.\n       ``(2) Freedom and Democracy Day--\n       ``(A) shall be a regular workday;\n       ``(B) shall not be treated as a legal public holiday for \n     purposes of statutes relating to pay and leave of employees \n     as defined by section 2105 of this title; and\n       ``(C) shall not affect the regular operations of the \n     Federal Government.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COVERDELL (for himself, Mr. Breaux, and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 1923. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nensure compliance by Federal facilities with pollution control \nrequirements; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n       The Federal Facilities Clean Water Compliance Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwith the Senior Senator from Louisiana and the Junior Senator from \nOhio. This legislation--The Federal Facilities Clean Water Compliance \nAct of 1998--will guarantee that the federal government is held to the \nsame full range of enforcement mechanisms available under the Clean \nWater Act as private entities, states, and localities. Each federal \ndepartment, agency, and instrumentality will to be subject to and \ncomply with all Federal, State, and local requirements with respect to \nthe control and abatement of water pollution and management in the same \nmanner and extent as any person is subject to such requirements, \nincluding the payment of reasonable service charges.\n  Last year marked the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Clean Water Act. \nThis Act has been an effective tool in improving the quality of our \nnation's rivers, lakes, and streams. Over that period of time, however, \nstates have not had the ability to impose certain fines and penalties \nagainst federal agencies for violations of the Clean Water Act. This is \na double standard that should not be continued.\n  In 1972, Congress included provisions on federal facility compliance \nwith our nation's water pollution laws in section 313 of the Clean \nWater Act. Section 313 called for federal facilities to comply with all \nfederal, state, and local water pollution requirements. However, in \n1992, the United States Supreme Court ruled in U.S. Dept. Of Energy v. \nOhio, that States could not impose certain fines and penalties against \nfederal agencies for violations of the Clean Water Act and the Resource \nConservation Recovery Act (RCRA). Because of this decision, the Federal \nFacilities Compliance Act (H.R. 2194) was enacted to clarify that \nCongress intended to waive sovereign immunity for agencies in violation \nof RCRA. Federal agencies in violation of the RCRA are now subject to \nState levied fines and penalties. However, this legislation did not \naddress the Supreme Court's decision with regard to the Clean Water \nAct.\n  The Federal Facilities Clean Water Compliance Act of 1998 makes it \nunequivocally clear that the federal government waives its claim to \nsovereign immunity in the Clean Water Act. The federal government owns \nhundreds of thousands of buildings, located on millions of acres of \nland, none of which have to abide by the same standards as a private \nentity does under the Clean Water Act. This legislation simply ensures \nthat the federal government lives by the same rules it imposes on \neveryone else.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Coverdell \ntoday in introducing the ``Federal Facilities Clean Water Compliance \nAct of 1998''.\n  My primary reason for sponsoring the bill with the Senator from \nGeorgia is to make the federal Clean Water Act equitable by requiring \nthat it apply to and be enforced against the federal government.\n  Currently, states, local governments and the private sector do not \nhave immunity from the act's enforcement. By the same principle, the \nfederal government should not be granted such immunity from the clean \nwater statute and this bill provides that parity.\n  The bill also provides that the federal government would be subject \nto all the same enforcement mechanisms that apply to states, local \ngovernments and the private sector under the Clean Water Act.\n  Fairness, safety, public health and environmental protection all \ndictate that Federal agencies should be held to the same standards for \nwater pollution prevention and control as apply to states, local \ngovernments and the private sector.\n  Equity is ensured by the Coverdell-Breaux bill because all levels of \ngovernment and the private sector would be treated the same under the \nClean Water Act's enforcement programs. No one would be allowed \nimmunity.\n  To paraphrase a well-known adage, what's good for states, local \ngovernments and the private sector in terms of clean water should be \ngood for the federal government.\n  In addition to the provisions stated previously, the Coverdell-Breaux \nbill reflects the adage's fairness principle in another fashion.\n  The bill would hold the federal government accountable to comply not \nonly with its own clean water statute, but also with state and local \nclean water laws. Again, equity would be upheld. And, safety, public \nhealth and environmental protection would be strengthened.\n  Other provisions are contained as well in the legislation which \nSenator Coverdell and I are introducing today. For example the EPA \nadministrator, the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of \nTransportation would be authorized to pursue administrative enforcement \nactions under the Clean Water Act against any non-complying federal \nagencies. It also includes provisions for federal employees' personal \nliability under the act's civil and criminal penalty provisions and a \nrequirement that the federal government pay reasonable service charges \nwhen complying with clean water laws.\n  Over the past 25 years, the United States has made dramatic advances \nin protecting the environment as a result of the Clean Water Act. We \nhave all benefitted as a result.\n  Today, I encourage other Senators to join Senator Coverdell and I as \ncosponsors of the bill to bring equity to the clean water program and \nto make possible the expansion of its public and private benefits.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MACK (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. D'Amato, Mrs. Feinstein, \n        Mr. Bond, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mr. Coverdell, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \n        Gregg, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Robb, Mr. Grams, Mr. \n        Bumpers, Mr. Coats, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \n        Santorum, Mr. Durbin, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Wyden, and Mr. Hollings):\n  S. 1924. A bill to restore the standards used for determining whether \ntechnical workers are not employees as in effect before the Tax Reform \nAct of 1986; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S3139]]\n\n               the technical workers fairness act of 1998\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today Senator Kerry and I introduce the \nTechnical Workers Fairness Act of 1998. This bill would repeal Section \n1706 of the 1986 Tax Reform Act, something that is long overdue and is \nnow supported by a strong bipartisan consensus.\n  Section 1706 added a new subsection (d) to Section 530 of the Revenue \nAct of 1978. For the class of businesses known as ``technical services \nfirms'' who provide technical services to their customers, Section 1706 \nremoved the Section 530 employment tax safe harbors that otherwise \napply to all other types of businesses that use the services of \nindependent contractors. These Section 530 safe harbors were enacted by \nCongress in 1978 to protect business taxpayers, especially small \nbusinesses, from arbitrary IRS decisions interpreting the common law \nemployment test in employment tax audits.\n  Yet Section 1706 leaves one group of taxpayers back in the pre-\nSection 530 days. As a result of Section 1706, if a technical services \nfirm hires, as an independent contractor, a computer programmer, \nsystems analyst, software engineer, or similarly-skilled worker who \nwill perform services for that firm's customers, then the technical \nservices firm--which is operating in a so-called ``three-party'' \narrangement--must prove to the IRS that this worker is an independent \ncontractor under the centuries-old common law employment test that \nCongress found so troublesome in 1978. Even if the firm can show that \nit has a reasonable basis for treating the worker as an independent \ncontractor--for instance, if its past treatment of this worker as an \nindependent contractor was approved by the IRS in prior IRS audits, or \nits treatment is consistent with industry practice or a relevant court \nruling, all of which constitute a ``safe harbor'' under Section 530--\nnone of these factors is relevant because of the enactment of Section \n1706.\n  The harm caused to the technical services industry and its workers by \nSection 1706 is more than theoretical. Technical services firms which \nuse independent contractors--even if they act in good faith--can be \nseverely penalized by the IRS and forced to pay ``unpaid'' employment \ntaxes even though the contractors have already paid these same taxes in \nfull. In fact, some IRS auditors have used Section 1706 to claim that \neven incorporated independent contractors are not legitimate. Left with \nonly the common law employment test to demonstrate a worker's status to \nthe IRS, many technical services firms will not hire any independent \ncontractors in order to avoid tempting an IRS audit.\n  In 1991, the Treasury Department issued a 100-page study of Section \n1706, as required by Congress. The Treasury Study found that tax \ncompliance is actually better-than-average among technical services \nworkers compared to other contractors in other industries. It also \nfound the scope of Section 1706 was ``difficult to justify on equity or \nother policy considerations.'' Further, Section 1706 is the only \noccasion since the enactment of Section 530 that Congress has ever cut \nback on the safe harbor protections in Section 530. In fact, in \nresponse to concerns that IRS decisions in independent contractor \naudits were too often arbitrary and unpredictable, in the Small \nBusiness Job Protection Act of 1996 Congress expanded the Section 530 \nprotections and even shifted the burden of proof from the taxpayer to \nthe IRS. More recently, the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor \nStatistics found that many high-tech professionals are actually being \nforced to work as employees when their preference is to be independent \ncontractors.\n  It is time to repeal Section 1706 and end the discrimination against \nthis one industry.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1924\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Technical Workers Fairness \n     Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. RESTORATION OF STANDARDS FOR DETERMINING WHETHER \n                   TECHNICAL WORKERS ARE NOT EMPLOYEES.\n\n       (a) Repeal of Section 530(d) of the Revenue Act of 1978.--\n     Section 530(d) of the Revenue Act of 1978 (as added by \n     section 1706 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986) is repealed.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (c) \n     shall apply to periods ending after the date of enactment of \n     this Act.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I join Senator Mack in supporting his \nlegislation to repeal Section 1706 of the 1986 Tax Reform Act. We must \ntake this opportunity to repeal an unfair section of employment tax law \nwhich singles out only the computer and high-technology industry and \nmakes it difficult for firms in that industry to retain the services of \nself-employed contractors.\n  For many years, the common law test used to classify a worker as an \nemployee or an independent contractor for employment tax purposes \nlacked precision and predictability. In 1978, in Section 530 of the \n1978 Revenue Act, Congress acted to allow taxpayers, as an alternative \nto the common law test, to use a ``reasonable basis'' safe haven test \nto classify a worker. However, in 1986, Congress enacted Section 1706 \nwhich eliminated all Section 530 protections from only the technical \nservices industry, and only in so-called ``three party situations'' in \nthat industry in which a worker is paid by a technical service firm to \nperform services for a customer.\n  I have heard from a number of computer consultants in Massachusetts \nwho believe this unfairly discriminates against the computer consulting \nindustry and seriously impairs the ability of legitimate self-employed \ncomputer consultants to work effectively in the marketplace. Many firms \nin Massachusetts will not use the services of valid self-employed \ncontractors because they believe doing so could attract an Internal \nRevenue Service audit and potentially subject the companies to \npenalties or back tax liabilities.\n  For many years, along with many of my colleagues in the Senate, I \nhave worked unsuccessfully to develop and enact a new definition of \n``leased employee.'' The legislation introduced by Senator Mack today \nis another effort to resolve this problem; it will repeal Section 1706 \nand thereby renew the ``reasonable basis'' safe haven test to classify \nworkers in the computer consultant industry. A 1991 Treasury Department \nreport stated that the tax compliance rates of computer consultants \nwere somewhat better than those of other workers who are classified as \nindependent contractors. That study also found that the treatment of \ntechnical service workers as independent contractors actually \n``increases tax revenue'' which ``tends to offset'' any revenue loss \nthat might result from any noncompliance by such individuals ``because \ndirect compensation to independent contractors is substituted for tax \nfavored employee fringe benefits.''\n  Repealing Section 1706 will allow companies to hire computer \nconsultants without fearing a negative ruling from the IRS. We should \ntake this step this year, and I look forward to working with Senator \nMack to gain Congressional passage of this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 1925.

A bill for the relief of Regine Beatie Edwards; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                       private relief legislation\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am proposing a private relief \nbill, under the Immigration and Nationality Act, that would classify \nRegine Beatie Edwards as a child, and therefore, allow her to become a \ncitizen of the United States.\n\n  This bill originates from a request of Mr. Stan Edwards, a United \nStates citizen and Regine's adopted father, concerning his daughter's \nnaturalization application. Regine Beatie Edwards was born on August 3, \n1980 in Germany and arrived in the United States with her mother on \nOctober 16, 1994. In 1997, Mr. Edwards, on several occasions, contacted \nthe Immigration and Naturalization Service to obtain the proper form to \napply for his daughter's naturalization. In response, the INS sent Mr. \nEdwards the form N-643, Application for Certificate in Behalf of an \nAdopted Child, and notified him that the adoption must be completed and \nthat the application must be submitted by his daughter's 18th birthday. \nOn January 13, 1997, Regine was legally adopted by Mr. Edwards. At this \ntime, Regine was 16\\1/2\\ years old. After the completion of the \nadoption, Mr. Edwards delivered his daughter's application, in person, \nto the INS office in Omaha, Nebraska on March 27, 1997.\n  Over the following months, Mr. Edwards became concerned about the \namount of time that had passed since the submission of the application \nto the INS. In January of 1998, the INS reported that Regine Edwards' \napplication was to be denied because the adoption had not been \ncompleted by the child's 16th birthday and that the form N-643 was the \nincorrect form for application. This new information contradicted what \nthe INS had previously told Mr. Edwards that Regine had to be adopted \nby her 18th birthday. The INS indicated that Mr. Edwards' daughter had \nmet three of the four qualifications to qualify for citizenship. As a \nresult of this misinformation, Regine did not meet the qualification of \nan adoption by a citizen parent before the child had reached the age of \nsixteen. In response to the incorrect information given in this case, \nthe INS refunded the money for the N-643 application to Mr. Edwards.\n  I feel that Regine Edwards should not be denied citizenship due to \nthe wrong information provided by the Immigration and Naturalization \nService. The Edwards family fulfilled the qualifications that they were \noriginally told by the INS were necessary. Unfortunately, Mr. Edwards \nwas misinformed which has cost his daughter the opportunity for \ncitizenship at this time. Mr. President, I ask you and my fellow \ncolleagues to support this young woman by allowing her to fulfill her \nwish to become a United States citizen and not deprive her of this \nopportunity.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN:\n  S. 1927. A bill to amend section 2007 of the Social Security Act to \nprovide grant funding for 20 additional Empowerment Zones, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              the empowerment zone enhancement act of 1998\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to \nintroduce the Empowerment Zone Enhancement Act of 1998. This \nlegislation, I believe, will build on the economic success we have \nbuilt over the last several years.\n  We have worked to make this the strongest economy in a generation--by \nbalancing the budget, investing in education and training, and opening \nup new markets for American products around the world. But we have also \nworked to make this the most inclusive economy in history, so everyone \nhas a chance to participate, and no one is left behind. Further, we \nhave stressed Community Empowerment. A strategy that gives people the \ntools--and acts as a catalyst for community collaboration--then \ncommunities can tap the ingenuity and enthusiasm of every citizen, and \nrestore our downtowns and distressed areas to a level even our \ngrandparents would be proud of.\n  I believe that we are beginning to see results in this Community \nEmpowerment Philosophy. The Empowerment Zone Initiative is the \ncornerstone program to ensure that all Americans benefit from the \nstrong economy. The purpose of the EZ/EC Initiative is to assist \ndistressed urban and rural communities to develop and implement \nholistic revitalization programs. In the first round of the Initiative, \n105 urban and rural EZ's and EC's were designated.\n  This Initiative has not only produced the intended benefits of \ncreating economic opportunity, broad-based community partnerships and \nsustainable community development, but has also had far-reaching spin-\noff benefits in bringing together all segments of the EZ/ECs around the \ngoal of community revitalization.\n  Over $4 Billion in private investment has been leveraged in the EZ \nand EC's. Nearly 20,000 jobs have been created that have been filled by \npeople who have previously not had access to economic opportunity. \nEntrepreneurship\n\n[[Page S3142]]\n\nopportunities have been created for people with a dream and the \neconomic opportunity to see that dream realized. Job training and \neducation opportunities have been created for nearly 45,000 residents. \nMore than 12,000 Housing units have been constructed or rehabilitated. \nCommunities have addressed public safety, infrastructure and \nenvironmental clean-up needs through more than 350 programs. More than \n52,000 children, youth and adults have been provided with services to \nhelp overcome challenges and contribute to their communities growth. In \nshort, the EZ/EC Initiative has proven to be a successful holistic \napproach to community revitalization and economic development.\n  The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 authorized designation of 20 \nadditional Empowerment Zones (15 urban and 5 rural), and provided for \ntax incentives for these new zones. However, that Act did not provide \nthe flexible grant funding critical to the core concept and mission of \nthe EZ/EC Initiative. This bill provides for $1.7 billion in grant \nfunds over a 10-year period, $1.5 billion for the urban zones and $0.2 \nbillion for the rural zones. The application process for the second \nround of Empowerment Zones will begin in a few weeks. Communities will \nhave several months to put together a comprehensive strategic plan that \nleverages private investment and provides for economic opportunity.\n  We can rebuild even our poorest areas--if all the people in the \ncommunity get together and decide to do it, and then find the tools \nthey need to get it done. That's why we are so committed to our \napproach. We believe in government as a catalyst--helping to bring \ncommunities together to plan their future, and giving them the tools \nthey need to reach that future. And it's working. For the first time in \n30 years, we're seeing success.\n  From the South Bronx to areas of the Mississippi Delta to South \nCentral LA to North Kenwood in Chicago--there is a growing American \nrenaissance that is turning abandoned buildings, empty lots, and crime-\nridden street corners into new homes, new hope and new opportunity for \nthe millions of Americans. This success makes us more and more \nconvinced we're on the right track to reverse decades of decay, and to \nremake America's distressed areas into sources of pride and prosperity.\n  The hardest part is getting started, and we've got it started now all \nacross the country. Now it's just a matter of moving up the momentum by \nexpanding the number of zones.

A bill to protect consumers from overcollections for the use \nof pay telephones, to provide consumers with information to make \ninformed decisions about the use of pay telephones, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n               the consumer pay telephone protection act\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have voiced my great disappointment many \ntimes with how the Telecommunications Act of 1966 is costing consumers \nmillions of dollars.\n\n  I complained about this at the time that Act passed, and continue to \nbe concerned that Vermonters are being taken to the cleaners.\n  I was one of five Senators to vote against that bill. I thought it \nwas clear then, and it should be clear by now to everyone, that the \nTelecommunications bill means higher costs for consumers.\n  As other hi-tech industries, such as computer technology, offer lower \nand lower prices over time--the telephone and cable TV industries are \npresenting consumers with higher and higher charges.\n  For example, I am mad as heck that pay phone charges in Vermont went \nup to 35 cents--from 10 cents.\n  But what annoys me more is that if I do not have exact change--if I \nuse two quarters--the change the phone company keeps is more than the \nten cents the call used to cost.\n  I have been know to say ``keep the change'' in restaurants, or when I \nbuy a newspaper.\n  But I do not like phone companies taking my change. I am fed up with \npay phone service providers nickel and diming consumers.\n  This bill will make phone companies provide change to consumers at \nthe pay phone--or provide a credit in the amount of the lost change to \nthe consumer or to states to be used to help consumers.\n  My bill will also give the FCC broad powers to give states authority \nto control pay phone rates, if necessary.\n  The bill permits pay phone providers in Vermont to issue a credit \nwhen\n\n[[Page S3144]]\n\nchange is not provided to the consumer which would go to Vermont. This \nmeans that Vermont could provide better pay phone service for public \nsafety or health reasons.\n  For example, this fund could be used by states to provide better pay \nphone service to those with disabilities, or those living in nursing \nhomes. It would provide funding for pay phones to be placed in remote \nareas in case of emergencies.\n  I would rather this change go directly to the consumer, and believe \nwhen this bill is fully implemented that most consumers will not be \novercharged for calls.\n  In the meantime, however, I would rather have the change used to \nbenefit Vermonters than go to the phone companies.\n  There are over 2 million pay phones in the United States. The \nWashington Post explained on Monday that if 75 percent of those pay \nphones charge 35 cents for a local call and if just one person a day \noverpays 15 cents at each of those phones, companies would get more \nthan $230,000 extra a day, or about $7 million a month.\n\n  My guess is that this hugely underestimates the size of this \nwindfall.\n  Keep in mind this windfall, in Vermont, is on top of the raise from \n10 cents to 35 cents. I have also noticed fewer and fewer phone booths \nexcept at places such as airports or train stations where consumers are \nin a hurry and may not have time to track down change.\n  My bill goes beyond just keeping phone companies from getting \nwindfall profits. It calls for a national investigation of monopoly \npricing and price gouging in the pay telephone markets.\n  It goes further than that--it then gives the Federal Communications \nCommission the tough new authority to deal with this problem. It allows \nthem to give states the right to establish rates for local calls if \nnecessary to stop this overcharging. Remember, when Vermont was in \ncharge before the Telecommunications Act passed the pay phone rates \nwere a dime.\n  My bill will also encourage the development of new technologies so \nthat consumers are not overcharged for local phone calls to begin with.\n  My bill also provides funding--and the money comes from telephone \ncompanies not consumers--for public interest pay phones. These are \nphones which the FCC has determined each state should provide to its \ncitizens in areas where there otherwise might not be a phone. They did \nthis in a decision issued on October 7, 1996.\n  This was a good idea--but there is no federal funding to implement \nthe decision.\n  In addition, it is uneconomic for a phone company to provide a pay \nphone in remote areas of Vermont. But in a roadside emergency these \nphones could be vital. My bill would provide for this program using \nmoney that now just goes out of your pockets to the phone companies.\n  Also, public interest pay phones could be placed in nursing homes, \nemergency homeless shelters, emergency rooms in hospitals, and other \nsimilar places.\n  Emergency 911 calls would be free from these phones, and other calls \nwould cost but at least there would be a phone in a location where \nthere otherwise might not be one.\n  What is best about this approach is that Vermont would decide how to \nuse this funding that now goes directly into the coffers of phone \ncompanies.\n  I have also designed the bill in a way that prevents phone companies \nfrom trying to take advantage of this situation.\n  The bill gives the FCC board powers to ensure that the pay phone \nproviders ``do not pass any costs relating to such compliance to \nconsumers.''\n  It also mandates that the FCC monitor this situation and ensure that \nimplementation does not result in any reduction in pay phone service.\n  The bill requires that pay phone companies which charge more than 10 \ncents for local phone calls provide either cash change or other \nalternatives to consumers, or credits to states equal to the value of \nthe unpaid change.\n  These credits to states would be used by states for \ntelecommunications activities that promote the public interest, such as \nsafety, health, emergency services, or education and promote public \ninterest pay phones in hospitals, schools, emergency homeless shelters, \nfacilities for the disabled, and at similar types of locations.\n  The bill directs the FCC, within one year of the bill's enactment, to \nissue proposed rules that apply to pay phone providers that charge more \nthan 10 cents for local pay phone calls. Companies would have to \nprovide for cash change or automatically credit the appropriate public \nservice agency in the respective states to account for instances in \nwhich change is not provided at the pay phone.\n  The bill requires that the FCC ensure that pay phone providers do not \npass any costs of compliance with this bill on to consumers and that \npay phone providers in no way reduce or limit service based on this \nanti-windfall requirement.\n  The FCC is given major new powers to take action to prevent any price \ngouging including giving states back the authority to regulate the \nprice of local calls.\n  The bill requires that small stickers or other notice be posted on \npay phones for the purpose of advising consumers when cash change will \nnot be provided.\n  The bill directs the FCC to reconsider its rules under which the FCC \nremoved authority from states to regulate the charge for local calls \nmade over pay phones. The FCC would reexamine the need for states to \nhave greater decision making roles where local competition between pay \nphone providers is not present.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1928\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Consumer Pay Telephone \n     Protection Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Some payphone service providers have increased the \n     charge for the use of a coin-operated pay telephone for a \n     local call to 35 cents but have not put into place a system \n     for providing change to users of such telephones for amounts \n     deposited in such telephones in excess of such charge.\n       (2) Payphone service providers should charge pay telephone \n     users only for the actual time of use of pay telephones.\n       (3) Most consumers, if given a choice, would prefer that \n     any amount of such excess deposits that are not refunded to \n     consumers be used for pay telephones for public health, \n     safety, and welfare purposes rather than have such excess \n     deposits accrue to the financial benefit of payphone service \n     providers.\n       (4) There are approximately 2,000,000 pay telephones in the \n     United States, and payphone service providers accrue \n     substantial revenue at the expense of Americans who do not \n     have the exact amount of the charge for their use.\n       (5) A decision of the Federal Communications Commission to \n     deregulate the provision of payphone service was premature \n     and did not address adequately the need for local competition \n     that would benefit users of pay telephones.\n       (6) The decision of the Commission does not promote the \n     widespread deployment of affordable payphone service that \n     would benefit the general public, nor does the decision \n     promote the widespread deployment of public interest \n     telephones.\n       (7) The use of coin-operated pay telephones represents an \n     increasing commercial activity that substantially affects \n     interstate commerce.\n       (8) Public interest telephones should be maintained in each \n     State and should be provided to promote the public safety, \n     health, and welfare.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is--\n       (1) to require payphone service providers--\n       (A) to provide cash change to pay telephone users who \n     deposit amounts for local telephone calls in excess of the \n     amounts charged for such calls; or\n       (B) in the event that such providers do not provide such \n     change, to transfer amounts equal to such change to \n     appropriate State entities for public interest purposes \n     related to telephone service;\n       (2) to encourage such changes in pay telephone technology \n     as are needed to assure that payphone service providers--\n       (A) do not overcharge pay telephone users who do not have \n     the exact amount of the charge for local pay telephone calls; \n     and\n       (B) do not charge pay telephone users for any time in which \n     pay telephones are not actually in use; and\n       (3) to require the Federal Trade Commission to determine--\n       (A) whether dysfunctions exist in the market for payphone \n     service including locational monopolies in which the size of \n     the market concerned results in the availability of payphone \n     service from a single provider; and\n\n[[Page S3145]]\n\n       (B) whether rates for coin-operated pay telephones for \n     local telephone calls are market based.\n\n     SEC. 3. PUBLIC INTEREST PAY TELEPHONES.\n\n       Section 276(b)(2) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \n     U.S.C. 276(b)(2)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(2) Public interest pay telephones.--\n       ``(A) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress \n     that--\n       ``(i) in the interest of the public health, safety, and \n     welfare, public interest pay telephones should be available \n     and maintained in locations where there would not otherwise \n     likely be a pay telephone; and\n       ``(ii) such public interest pay telephones should be fairly \n     and equitably supported.\n       ``(B) Use of funds.--In accordance with such regulations as \n     the Commission shall prescribe, each State agency that \n     receives amounts under subsection (c)(2)(A) shall use such \n     amounts to promote or otherwise support the installation, \n     maintenance, and use of public interest pay telephones, \n     including specially designed payphones for the disabled and \n     the provision of payphone service in remote locations, \n     nursing homes, emergency homeless shelters, hospitals, \n     facilities that assist the disabled, schools, and other \n     appropriate locations determined by the State agency \n     concerned.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax incentives to encourage production of oil and gas within the United \nStates, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  the u.s. ENERGY EcOnOmIc GRowTH aCT\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, a healthy domestic energy industry is \ncritical to our nation's security and our economic well-being. That is \nwhy I am pleased today to introduce the U.S. Energy Economic Growth \nAct. My legislation provides much needed tax relief for the domestic \noil and gas industry. It is a part of the omnibus Domestic Oil and Gas \nSecurity Enhancement Plan that I've developed with Senator Murkowski \nand Senator Nickles. Together, our comprehensive legislation represents \nthe most sweeping tax and regulatory relief since before the Gulf War.\n  Our package could not come at a more critical time. The price of \ncrude\n\n[[Page S3146]]\n\noil recently dipped to its lowest level since April 1994. This downturn \nin world oil prices has exposed America's independent producers to \ngreat risk. If current market conditions persist, as is expected, \nthousands of wells could become uneconomic and be shut-in or plugged. \nIt is time we acted to ensure this does not happen, and my bill is the \nfirst step in that direction.\n  The U.S. Energy Economic Growth Act will do three things.\n\n\n                        marGINAL weLL taX RELief\n\n  First, this bill provides tax relief for producers who operate \nmarginal oil and gas wells. A marginal oil well is one that produces \nless than 15 barrels per day or produces heavy oil. A marginal gas well \nis one that produces less than 90 thousand cubic feet a day. Those who \noperate marginal wells are most at risk in times of lower oil prices. \nThe National Petroleum Council (NPC) reported that America has over \n500,000 marginal wells that collectively produce nearly 700 million \nbarrels of oil equivalent each year. Texas alone has over 100,000 \nmarginal wells. These wells contribute nearly 80,000 jobs and generate \nclose to $14 billion each year in economic activity.\n  In 1996, abandonment or plugging of these marginal wells led to a \nloss of more than 3,600 high-quality jobs and a loss of $84.1 million \nin earnings in 1996. States and federal governments lost $18.5 million \nin severance taxes and an equal amount of ad valorem taxes from wells \nplugged during 1996.\n  Many domestic oil and gas businesses rely on these marginal wells as \nthe backbone of their operations. However, as global market factors \ncause commodity prices to fluctuate, the economic viability of these \nwells is precarious. Marginal wells provide countless jobs, energy \nsecurity and federal tax and royalty revenues. The tax credits in my \nbill will help keep these marginal wells in production and Americans \nemployed. My bill provides for a maximum $3 per barrel tax credit for \nthe first 3 barrels of daily production from an existing oil well. In \naddition, marginal gas well will receive $0.50 per mcf for the first 18 \nmcf of daily natural gas production.\n  In addition, this tax credit would only occur when prices are low. \nThis credit is phased out when prices for oil and natural gas increase.\n\n\n                        inactive well tax relief\n\n  The second plank of my bill creates an incentive for independent oil \nand gas producers to recover abandoned wells and put them back into \nproduction. This provision allows producers to exclude income \nattributable to oil and natural gas from a recovered inactive well. In \norder to qualify, the oil or gas well must have been abandoned for at \nleast two years prior to the date of enactment. In addition, this \nincentive would only apply to wells that are brought back on line \nwithin 5 years of the date of enactment.\n  This economic incentive has a proven track record. In Texas, a \nsimilar law resulted in returning over 6,000 wells to production. The \nestimated annual production from these wells is worth $565 million at \nthe wellhead, and approximately $1.65 billion to the economy of Texas \neach year. The wealth from this incentive provides over 10,000 direct \nand indirect jobs each year. The Texas legislature receives an \nestimated $22 million in additional annual tax revenues, over ten \nthousand jobs have been created, and $1.65 billion a year in wealth is \ngenerated. Over 90,000 idle wells remain in Texas. This incentive \npackage would help return them to production and allow them to \ncontribute to a strong economy in America.\n  Thirteen states have inactive well recovery programs, including \nAlaska, Arkansas, California, Florida, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, \nMontana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming. This \nfederal program would allow the benefits experienced by Texas and other \nstates to continue to grow and to be shared by the rest of the country.\n  Importantly, this provision increases the stream of revenue going \ninto the federal government in two ways. First, royalty owners will pay \nfederal taxes on income generated from the recovered well. Currently, \nno taxes are paid on these wells because they are inactive. Returning \nthem to production will increase the royalties paid to the federal \ngovernment. Secondly, the new jobs created will add significantly to \nthe taxes paid on wages and earnings.\n  This one-time shot-in-the-arm for the industry will provide countless \njobs and considerable economic benefit to our communities.\n\n\n                            other incentives\n\n  The third provision of my bill makes changes to the tax code that \nmakes it easier for producers to take full advantage of already \nexisting tax credits. Under these provisions, both geological and \ngeophysical expenditures on domestic production and delay rental \npayments would be allowed to be expensed at the time incurred rather \nthan capitalized over the length of the well. This election would allow \nproducers more control over their income stream without changing the \namount of tax.\n  In addition, two relatively new types of drilling methods are \nincluded as a qualified enhanced oil recovery method for purposes of \nthe Enhanced Oil Recovery Tax Credit. These two drilling methods, \nhydro-injection and horizontal drilling, would be included on the list \nof qualified methods. They provide us with some of the most innovative \nmeans of drilling and we should encourage producers to utilize these \nand other productive methods.\n  Mr. President, my legislation provides incentives for the most \nthreatened parts of the oil and gas industry. Relief for marginal and \ninactive wells encourages full utilization of existing wells, clearly \nprovides jobs and helps the local economy grow. I encourage my \ncolleagues to support this legislation and their local communities by \nmaking marginal and inactive wells productive contributors to the local \neconomy. Our energy security depends upon it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1929\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide certainty for, reduce administrative and \ncompliance burdens associated with, and streamline and improve the \ncollection of royalties from Federal and outer continental shelf oil \nand gas leases, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n                  The Royalty Enhancement Act of 1998\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, once again, our domestic oil and gas \nproducers are facing devastating losses due to a significant drop in \noil prices. This crisis creates a dangerous situation for the industry \nand for our national security. Unfortunately, the policies and \npractices of the Administration have exacerbated the problem, not \nhelped. If we are to maintain a viable domestic petroleum industry, we \nmust reverse these practices. An important step towards this end is \nreforming the Department of Interior's erratic, ever-changing royalty \nvaluation practices. The Royalty Enhancement Act, that I am introducing \ntoday, will reduce regulatory costs and promote development of federal \noil and gas resources vital to our national security. It will also \nsignificantly reduce the administrative costs associated with the \nfederal royalty payment system.\n  Minerals Management Service (MMS), the agency within the Department \nof Interior given responsibility for administering royalties from \nfederal leases, has imposed on oil and gas producers a bureaucratic \nlabyrinth of rules and regulations. One of the most fundamental \nconcepts of our society is the ability of any citizen, in particular, \ncitizens who are parties to contracts with the federal government to be \nassured that the Federal government will not overreach and unilaterally \ninterpret those contracts. Such a situation is what we have today with \noil and gas producers who have contracted with the Federal government \nto expend their capital and resources to explore for, drill and produce \nvaluable oil and gas reserves in the United States and offshore.\n  In the past few years oil and gas producers, both independent and \nmajor, have become increasingly frustrated with the unwillingness by \nMMS to produce a simplified and certain valuation method that \naccurately captures the value of oil or gas at the lease. This is the \nvalue that a federal oil and gas lessee owes and the American taxpayer \ndeserves to be paid.\n  Recently, the MMS has proposed a new oil valuation rule which is the \nmost administratively burdensome and complex method, available to the \ngovernment. This new rule looks like the Clinton health care plan and \nmakes the IRS code look simple. In short, the current MMS valuation \nsystem is badly broken and their outstanding oil proposal will only \nmake it worth.\n  In 1995, I introduced the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Simplification \nand Fairness Act because of the importance of federal royalty revenues \nto the United States Treasury and States.\n\n[[Page S3149]]\n\nThe purpose of that legislation was to streamline and simplify the \nroyalty management program for the over 20,000 federal lessees who are \nrequired to file over 3,000,000 reports annually. Despite the \nbipartisan support for my bill, MMS resisted this much needed reform \nduring the entire legislative process. Fortunately, Congress saw the \nwisdom and need for the law and sent it to the President and it became \neffective in August, 1996.\n  Why is Congressional action needed, Mr. President? Despite the \nobvious importance of the oil and gas industry to our national economy \nand global stability, the MMS has failed to get the message we sent \nthem in 1996 that the American people can no longer tolerate their \nineffective and inefficient bureaucracy. The MMS valuation rules \ncontain complicated formulas that can be both confusing and inaccurate. \nThese ambiguous rules lead inevitably to expensive disputes and \nlitigation that unnecessarily drain resources of the federal government \nand the lessees.\n  To ensure that the American people receive their full and fair value \nof production royalties from oil and gas produced on federal lands, we \nneed to create a royalty valuation system that provides certainty, \nsimplicity and fairness to the federal government, States, oil and gas \nproducers and the American taxpayers. Only by doing this will companies \nwant to take the risk of spending their capital to develop and produce \nfederal oil and gas for our nation's use and benefit. It is important \nthat we maintain the viability of existing production on federal lands \nand encourage development of the new frontiers of production in the \ndeep waters off our coastlines.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues from New Mexico, Alaska, Texas and \nLouisiana, Senators Domenici, Murkowski, Hutchison and Breaux, join me \ntoday in introducing the Royalty Enhancement Act which is the Senate \ncompanion of H.R. 3334, a bill introduced this session by Congressman \nThornberry. This bill cuts through the horrendously complicated and \nambiguous current rules and provides certainty, simplicity and fairness \nto both the taxpayers and the companies who enter into oil and gas \nleases with the federal government.\n  This legislation will replace the current complicated and complex \nsystem of royalty valuation with a much clearer, simpler method of \nroyalty payment that would avoid valuation disputes. This method will \nallow companies to pay the federal government its royalty share in \nactual barrels of oil or cubic feet of natural gas.\n  The bill contains a comprehensive well-designed royalty payment \nmethod that will streamline auditing and accounting systems for both \nthe government and the producers and will reduce administrative costs. \nReduced costs will help keep production economic for a longer period, \nextending the life of producing wells and thus providing more royalties \nfrom this continued production. The best way to be absolutely certain \nthat the government receives fair market value at the lease is for the \ngovernment to take production in-kind and have it marketed and sold by \nqualified private sector marketers who possess the expertise and \nexperience to receive the best value for the United States.\n  Mr. President, it is not fair to subject companies who produce oil \nand gas on federal lands to the whim of the MMS with their record of \nretroactive second-guessing of valuation years after oil and gas has \nbeen produced and sold. It is fundamentally unfair to the American \npeople for the agency's uncertain and ambiguous rules and practices to \ncreate delay in receipt of royalty revenues to the Treasury and to bear \nthe expense of the government's bureaucracy. For these reasons, I am \nintroducing the Royalty Enhancement Act of 1998.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1930\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

For \n     pipelines in more than 200 meters of water, the Secretary may \n     allow a higher rate of return, sufficient for an investment \n     in the fabricating, installing, operating, and maintaining \n     such pipelines as compared to pipelines in waters of less \n     than 200 meters.\n       (5) Restriction on disclosure.--The United States and its \n     qualified marketing agent shall keep confidential and shall \n     not disclose the transportation charge or any facts or \n     information related thereto used by a lessee or its affiliate \n     for reimbursement under this subsection.\n       (c) Charges for Transportation Costs Beyond the Delivery \n     Point.--\n       (1) In general.--Charges by the lessee or its affiliate for \n     transportation of royalty oil or royalty gas through an \n     unregulated pipeline or facility beyond the delivery point \n     shall be a negotiated rate, that--\n       (A) shall not exceed the highest rate charged for \n     transportation provided to a third party, if third party oil \n     or gas is being transported through the pipeline or facility; \n     or\n       (B) shall be the fair commercial value of the \n     transportation services provided by the lessee or its \n     affiliate if no third party oil or gas is being transported \n     through the pipeline or facility.\n       (2) Determination of commercial value.--The standard to be \n     used to determine the commercial value for purposes of \n     paragraph (1)(B) shall be based upon the transportation \n     services provided and not on the ownership of the pipeline or \n     facility by the lessee or its affiliate.\n       (d) Arbitration.--\n       (1) In general.--If negotiations between a qualified \n     marketing agent and an entity owning the pipeline or facility \n     do not result in a mutually agreeable negotiated charge for \n     transportation under subsection (c), then the qualified \n     marketing agent on behalf of the Secretary or the entity \n     owning the pipeline or facility may, at any time during the \n     negotiation, require that such matter be submitted to \n     arbitration in accordance with this subsection.\n       (2) Selection of arbitrators.--Any dispute regarding a \n     charge for transportation that is not resolved by agreement \n     shall be determined by a panel of 3 arbitrators upon written \n     notice given by either party to the other, which notice shall \n     also name one arbitrator. The party receiving such notice \n     shall, within 10 business days thereafter, by written notice \n     to the other party, name the second arbitrator, or failing to \n     do so, the first party who gave notice shall name the second \n     arbitrator.

At the hearing, each party shall submit a \n     proposed transportation rate and evidence to support such \n     rate as it sees fit.\n       (4) Decision.--The panel of arbitrators shall determine \n     which of the rates submitted by the parties shall be the \n     transportation charge used. The arbitrators shall render a \n     written decision within 10 calendar days after the hearing \n     under paragraph (3) based on a majority vote of the 3 \n     arbitrators.

Mr. President, the current royalty system is an \nelaborate after-the-fact game of ``Gotch ya.''\n  Producers are put in the unenviable position of being second-guessed, \nsome times years later, by the Minerals Management Service (MMS). This \ncurrent system is unfair to oil and gas producers. It is expensive and \ninefficient for the federal government.\n  Under the current system, only the lawyers benefit. It results in a \nlot of law suits and big legal bills.\n  The MMS tried to fix the system by proposing a ``producer is always \nthe loser rule.''\n  Under the proposed rules, (now abandoned) the producers would have \nalways lost. The MMS tried a rule tying the fair market value to the \nNYMEX.\n  If producers sold their production for less than the NYMEX price, \nthey would have had to pay the royalty on the ``phantom'' income i.e. \nthe difference between the price they actually received and the NYMEX \nprice. If, on the other hand, they sold their production for more than \nthe NYMEX, they would have had to pay the royalty on the amount they \nactually received. This would have been a very unsatisfactory approach.\n  Fortunately, most independent producers don't have to use that \napproach. However, the existing valuation formula for calculating fair \nmarket value is complicated, fraught with exceptions, and hard to \nadminister.\n  The question: What is fair market value for oil is not as simple as \nit sounds.\n  Some of the variable factors include the quality or refinery value of \ncrude oil; the transportation costs necessary to move that oil to a \nrefiner; relative access to various refineries or markets which may \nvalue a particular type of crude oil differently; the supply, vis-a-\nvis, the demand for certain types of oil or alternative supplies, and \nwhether the contract is a long-term or short-term commitment made by \neither the refiner or the producer.\n  Other factors that influence value include: the volume of the crude \noil produced at the lease. This could affect the unit logistical costs; \nseasonality; and service requirements of the producer.\n\n[[Page S3155]]\n\n  Another question more complicated than it sounds is this: What are \nthe appropriate, allowable, deductible expenses?\n  Under the current system it costs the MMS about $60 million annually \nto debate this question and to administer our royalty collection \nprogram. It takes several hundred employees, many of them auditors, to \noversee the current royalty program. In contrast, royalty-in-kind \nprograms in Canada need only 33 employees to administer their approach.\n  With a royalty-in-kind system, the producer would give some of its \nproduction from the federal lands as a royalty-in-kind payment.\n  A royalty-in-kind program is an accurate way to determine a fair \nmarket value. The federal government would sell its share of the oil on \nan open and competitive market. What you can sell it for is, per se, \nfair market value. That is the essence of what the ``Royalty-in-Kind'' \nProgram, along with the use of the Qualified Marketing Agents \n(``QMA''), would allow.\n  The goal should be treating the producers fairly, maximizing revenues \nfor the federal government, and distributing an accurate amount of \nroyalties to the states.\n  The bill being introduced today by Senator Nickles, Murkowski, \nHutchinson and I would provide a better way for the federal government \nand the Minerals Management Service (MMS) to collect, with certainly, a \nfair value for its crude oil.\n\n\n                         provisions of the bill\n\n  The federal government would take its royalty ``in kind'' at the \napplicable delivery point for each federal onshore and offshore lease.\n  Title of the royalty share taken in-kind would be in the name of the \nfederal government.\n  The U.S. would contract with qualified marketing agents (QMAs).\n  The federal government would select a QMA for each lease on a \ncompetitive bid basis.\n  States entitled to revenues under the net receipts sharing provisions \nof the Mineral Leasing Act or Section 8(g) of the Outer Continental \nShelf Lands Act would be allowed to elect to select the QMA.\n  In selecting a QMA, the State would act for the mutual benefit of the \nState and the federal government. The payment from the federal \ngovernment to any State for its share of royalty taken in-kind from \nfederal leases within a State's boundary would not be subject to cost \ndeductions under the net receipts sharing provisions of the applicable \nstatutes.\n  The lessee must tender the royalty share at the delivery point. This \nwould completely satisfy the lessee's royalty obligation.\n  The lessee would bear the costs of place royalty oil and royalty gas \nin a merchantable condition at the delivery point. The lessee would be \nresponsible for gathering costs. Transportation costs would be borne by \nthe federal government.\n  Mr. President, this is an excellent approach. My only concern is that \nthe final legislative product adequately address the problem of the \nmarginal well that produces a few barrels a day and is in an isolated \narea. The legislation needs to make sure that there is a workable \nmechanism for these isolated wells.\n  I also note that some, including the New Mexico state lands \ncommissioner, have suggested a multi-state pilot program prior to \nmoving to the nation-wide royalty-in-kind program. I respect those \nviews.\n  I hope, that as we move through the hearing process the Committee can \ntake testimony on whether to proceed with a multi-state pilot program \nor whether existing pilots have provided sufficient information for us \nto implement a national program.\n  I want to recognize Senator Nickles for his leadership on this issue \nand look forward to working with him, Senator Murkowski and Senator \nHutchison on moving this legislation through the process so that we can \nstart a royalty-in-kind program in the near future.\n\n

FOR CONSUMER PHOTOGRAPHIC FILM AND \n                                 PAPER\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO (for himself, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Ashcroft, and Mr. \nBingaman) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Finance:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 88\n\n         \n       Whereas the current financial crisis in Asia underscores \n     the fact that the health of the international economic system \n     depends on open, competitive markets;\n       Whereas structural reform in Japan is critical to the \n     resolution of the Asian financial crisis;\n       Whereas for many years the United States Trade \n     Representative has reported to Congress in the National Trade \n     Estimate on numerous barriers to entering and operating in \n     the Japanese market;\n       Whereas Japan's restrictive policies deny opportunities to \n     United States companies and their workers seeking access to \n     Japanese markets;\n       Whereas the United States Trade Representative has engaged \n     over the last several years in an intensive review of the \n     Japanese distribution system;\n       Whereas on June 16, 1996, the United States Trade \n     Representative found that the Government of Japan created and \n     tolerated a market structure that impedes United States \n     exports of consumer photographic film and paper;\n       Whereas the European Union has sought to remove these same \n     barriers to distribution that restrain European exports to \n     Japan;\n       Whereas it is important that United States companies and \n     workers not be disadvantaged by other countries following \n     Japan's model of protecting its market through a closed \n     distribution system and other market access barriers;\n       Whereas a recent panel of the World Trade Organization \n     failed to address the closed distribution system and market \n     access barriers in Japan;\n       Whereas the Government of Japan has consistently stated \n     that it is committed to deregulation, transparency, \n     nondiscrimination, and open distribution systems accompanied \n     by vigorous enforcement of competition laws;\n       Whereas the Government of Japan stated in recent \n     proceedings of the World Trade Organization on consumer \n     photographic film that it is committed to promote \n     distribution policies that make the Japanese market more open \n     to imports and to actively discourage restrictive business \n     practices; and\n       Whereas fulfilling these public statements would benefit \n     both United States trade and Japanese consumers, \n     significantly raising the standard of living in Japan: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress--\n       (1) calls upon the Government of Japan to live up to the \n     standards it has set for open competitive markets;\n       (2) calls upon the Government of Japan to fully implement \n     the representations that it made to a dispute settlement \n     panel of the World Trade Organization regarding deregulation, \n     transparency, nondiscrimination, open distribution systems, \n     and vigorous enforcement of competition laws with respect to \n     consumer photographic film and paper as well as other \n     sectors, such as autos and auto parts, glass, and \n     telecommunications, that face similar market access barriers \n     in Japan;\n       (3) urges the President, the United States Trade \n     Representative, and other appropriate officers of the \n     executive branch to exercise fully existing authority to \n     achieve these objectives; and\n       (4) requests the President to report to Congress, not later \n     than July 15, 1998, and not less frequently than every six \n     months thereafter, regarding progress in eliminating market \n     restrictions in Japan for consumer photographic film and \n     paper.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, the current financial crisis in Asia \nunderscores the need for open, competitive markets, free from \nmanipulation. Clearly, industrial policy does not work. Managed trade \nand managed commerce is a failure. It simply does not work. Mr. \nPresident, we have said it all along--when you manipulate trade and \nerect barriers to open and free trade, the consumer gets hurt.\n  Mr. President, today we are submitting a resolution which is aimed at \nforcing Japan to put their money where their mouth is. This Resolution \nmakes it clear that Japan must fulfill its publicly stated commitments \nto open its markets for photographic film and paper, and other sectors \nfacing market access barriers. The bureaucrats in Japan should be on \nnotice that the U.S. Congress will not tolerate their intervention into \nthe free market. The United States maintains free and open markets in \nevery sector of the economy. Americans should expect nothing less of \nany of our trading partners.\n  Plain and simple, Mr. President, the Japanese Government has allowed \nFuji to use Japan's lax anti-trust laws and\n\n[[Page S3158]]\n\nclosed-market system to erect barriers to free and open competition. \nThe Japanese government, however, maintains that this is not true and \nthat their markets are open and free. This Resolution will simply \nencourage the Japanese government to demonstrate their openness.\n  The Government of Japan has said publicly that they did not build, \nsupport, and tolerate a market structure that thwarts foreign \ncompetition, and in which exclusionary business practices are \ncommonplace. This Resolution simply allows the Japanese government to \ndemonstrate their resolve to open, free and fair trade.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself fully with \nthe remarks of my distinguished colleague from New York. Kodak has \ncompiled volumes of evidence, based on more than 100 years of \nexperience in the Japanese market, that clearly document the thicket of \nlaws and regulations that have the intent--and the effect--of curbing \nsales of foreign photographic film and paper. Through an elaborate \nsystem of restrictions on sales and distribution, Japan has succeeded \nin severely limiting market access for foreign film and paper.\n  Nearly three years ago, on May 18, 1995, Kodak filed a petition with \nthe U.S. Trade Representative under section 301 of the Trade Act of \n1974, urging action on the broad range of trade barriers. After a \nformal investigation, Ambassador Barshefsky found that Japan's \npractices were indeed in violation of our trade laws, and dispute \nsettlement proceedings in the World Trade Organization were begun. The \nverdict from the WTO, issued in its final form on January 30, 1998, was \na great disappointment. But certainly not the end of the argument, nor \nthe end of Kodak's attempts to penetrate the Japanese market.\n  The resolution that I am pleased to cosponsor today emphatically \nendorses the initiative that Ambassador Barshefsky and Secretary Daley \nunveiled on February 3, 1998, which will put the Government of Japan to \nthe test. During the course of the WTO proceedings, as my colleagues \nare aware, the Japanese Government asserted that its market was fully \nopen to foreign film and paper. And so our government has proposed that \nwe monitor that proposition, by collecting data and examining, every \nsix months, the progress that Kodak--and other foreign suppliers--have \nmade in competing in the Japanese film and paper market.\n  This initiative is worthy of our support, Mr. President, and I urge \nmy colleagues to join in supporting this resolution.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, The World Trade Organization (WTO) \ndecision this year against the United States' photographic film and \npaper industry sounded an alarm for U.S. companies participating in the \nglobal arena. Rubber stamping Japanese-style protectionism, the WTO \nleft American companies at a troubling disadvantage in Japan and other \nAsian countries that replicate the ``successful'' Japanese model. It is \ntroubling that many ailing Asian economies, after being bailed out by \nU.S. tax dollars, are still pursuing protectionist trade practices \nagainst the very taxpayers that paid their bill.\n  In the film case, the WTO found that the Japanese market is open to \nthe Eastman Kodak Co., despite the fact that Japan admits that its \nsystem of trade barriers was designed as a ``defensive measure for the \nsubstantial advances of Eastman Kodak after import liberalization'' \nunder the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). This decision \nflies in the face of the U.S. film industry.\n  Equally intolerable is the fact that this Japanese-style \nprotectionism is being used to block an array of critical U.S. exports. \nEven though Japan has the second largest flat glass market in the \nworld, it has systematically excluded foreign imports through an \nexclusive distribution system in violation of its 1995 Flat Glass \nAgreement with the United States. The U.S. also has a ``market \nopening'' agreement with Japan on automobiles, but the Administration \nreported just recently that Japan has failed to keep the agreement's \n``key objectives'' and has reversed progress made last year under the \naccord.\n  I am deeply alarmed at the danger that the WTO's misconceived ruling \nin this case will have. Japan now has a license from the WTO to shelter \nits domestic film and paper producers from competition. Under the WTO \nruling, our Asian trading partners will be encouraged to follow in \nJapan's protectionist footsteps by taking two steps back for every one \nstep forward in trade liberalization. For instance, China recently \nannounced reductions in overall tariff levels from 23 to 17 percent, \nbut China has been implementing an automobile industrial policy much \nlike Japan's to undercut the gains achieved from tariff reductions.\n  It is time to stand up and say, ``No more.'' No more will we ignore \nmercantilist trade policies that block U.S. products and destroy \nAmerican jobs. No more will we allow foreign companies to use their \nillegitimate gains from their closed market to subsidize exports to our \nopen market. No more will we accept a playing field for our products \nthat is not level. No more, Mr. President.\n  As the world's second largest economy, Japan must guarantee the same \nfree and open access to its market as Japanese companies enjoy in the \nU.S. market. Without that guarantee, U.S. businesses are put at an \nimmediate competitive disadvantage when entering the international \narena.\n  Therefore, Senators D'Amato, Moynihan, Bingaman, and I rise today to \nsubmit a Sense of the Senate that the U.S. should use all available \ntools against Japan's toleration of a systematic anticompetitive market \nthat impedes U.S. exports. We need to be able to reassure American \ncompanies and the many U.S. workers they employ that we are tough on \ncountries that break the rules of free trade.\n  We also request the Clinton Administration take swift and aggressive \naction to open Japan's market, not just for film, but also for the U.S. \nindustries that repeatedly struggle to address the intricate web of \nJapanese protectionism.\n  The Administration must confront Japan's trade barriers forcefully, \nor the competitiveness of U.S. companies in that market will be \ncontinually undermined. In 1996, the U.S. Trade Representative made a \nfinding under Section 301 that Japan's restrictions on Kodak film were \na burden to U.S. commerce and an impediment to U.S. film exports. \nHowever, the USTR office stated that using Section 301 to address such \ntrade barriers is too aggressive a policy. I strongly disagree.\n  When the United States makes trade agreements, the American people \nexpect them to be honored. If trade agreements can be violated without \nsanction by the WTO, then our rights must be secured through the use of \nour own law. The only alternative is to accept a new wave of \nprotectionism in Japan and other nations.\n  I supported the Senate proposal on ``fast track'' authority for the \nPresident, but if this Administration is unable to ensure that our \ntrading partners live up to their promises under agreements already \nnegotiated, I see little reason to think that Congress will give fast \ntrack authority to pursue a new round of agreements. The Administration \nclaims to have negotiated 30 separate free trade agreements with Japan, \nbut U.S. exporters clearly are being denied the benefits they had \nexpected from these agreements. Congress and the American people \nrightfully expect the Administration to ensure a level playing field \nfor U.S. companies. The WTO's intolerable ruling in the Kodak film case \nrequires you and your colleagues in the Administration to take a more \nactivist and aggressive approach to opening Japanese markets across the \nboard, before protectionism proliferates throughout Asia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/02/senate-section/article/S3157-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3158-S3159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SENATE RESOLUTION 206--RELATIVE TO THE CRAZY HORSE MEMORIAL\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Indian Affairs:\n\n                              S. Res. 206\n\n       To recognize 50 years of efforts with respect to the \n     creation of the Crazy Horse Memorial, honoring the great \n     Oglala Sioux leader, Tasunke Witko, popularly known as \n     ``Crazy Horse'', and to express the Sense of the Senate with \n     respect to the Crazy Horse Memorial.\n       Whereas Tasunke Witko, popularly known as ``Crazy Horse'', \n     was one of the greatest Native American warriors and \n     spiritual leaders of the United States;\n\n[[Page S3159]]\n\n       Whereas Crazy Horse fought to defend the rights and lives \n     of the Sioux Indians and all Native Americans;\n       Whereas Crazy Horse is best known for leading a force of \n     Cheyenne and Oglala Sioux warriors to victory over George \n     Armstrong Custer in the Battle of Little Big Horn;\n       Whereas in 1940, several Sioux Indian chiefs invited the \n     late sculptor, Korczak Ziolkowski, to create a memorial to \n     their great leader, Crazy Horse, by carving a tribute to \n     Crazy Horse into the Black Hills in South Dakota on a \n     mountain popularly known as ``Thunderhead Mountain'';\n       Whereas on June 3, 1948, the Crazy Horse Memorial was \n     dedicated, which is the date on which the first blast was \n     made to shape the memorial on Thunderhead Mountain;\n       Whereas at the time of that dedication, Korczak Ziolkowski \n     vowed that the Crazy Horse Memorial would be a nonprofit \n     educational and cultural project that would be financed \n     solely through private, nongovernmental sources;\n       Whereas Korczak Ziolkowski dedicated his life to the \n     creation of the Crazy Horse Memorial and continued that work \n     through his death on October 20, 1982; and\n       Whereas once complete, the Crazy Horse Memorial, with a \n     height of 563 feet and length of 641 feet, will be the \n     largest sculpture in the world: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate recognizes--\n       (A) that June 3, 1998, commemorates the 50th anniversary of \n     the blast on the mountain known as Thunderhead Mountain in \n     the Black Hills of South Dakota that constituted the first \n     step made toward the completion of the Crazy Horse Memorial;\n       (B) the admirable efforts of the late Korczak Ziolkowski, \n     the sculptor responsible for the design and techniques \n     involved in the creation of the Crazy Horse Memorial; and\n       (C) that the creation of the Crazy Horse Memorial, from its \n     inception, has been accomplished through private donations \n     and without any Federal funding; and\n       (2) it is the sense of the Senate that the Crazy Horse \n     Memorial will constitute a tribute to--\n       (A) Tasunke Witko, a great Oglala Sioux warrior and \n     spiritual leader; and\n       (B) all Native Americans.\n\n  Mr. Campbell. Mr. President, Congress is beginning its annual process \nof writing a budget and appropriating funds. This is important work and \ngets a great deal of media coverage and public scrutiny. But I think we \ntend to get so caught up in this process that we forget some people in \nthis country accomplish great things without a single dollar from \nWashington.\n  One shining example is the Crazy Horse Memorial. The Ziolkowski \nfamily has worked for 50 years carving the image of the Oglala Sioux \nleader and his horse out of Thunder Mountain in South Dakota. They have \nrelied entirely on private donations, twice turning down $10 million in \nfederal funds.\n  Today I am submitting a resolution recognizing the 50th anniversary \nof the memorial and the efforts of the Ziolkowski family.\n  Crazy Hourse is a permanent fixture in our history as the man who led \na force of Cheyenne and Oglala Sioux to victory over George Armstrong \nCuster at the Battle of Little Big Horn. thanks to the Ziolkowskis and \ntheir many benefactors, he will become a permanent fixture on our \nlandscape as well.\n  Korczak Ziolkowski began this task at the request of Sioux Indian \nChief Henry Standing Bear, who said ``My fellow chiefs and I would like \nthe white man to know the red man has great heroes too.'' Though \nKorczak passed away in 1982, the work is continue by his widow, Ruth, \nand seven of their children. The ambition behind this project is \nbreathtaking. When complete, it will be the largest sculpture in the \nworld. All four of the heads on Mount Rushmore could fit inside Crazy \nHorse's head. Future plans call for a university and a medical training \ncenter to be built at the base of the mountain.\n  Mr. President, this resolution is about more than the dedication of \nthe Ziolkowski family or the legacy of a great Indian leader. It honors \nthe spirit of hard work and independence that make America the country \nit is. It honors all people who have followed a dream.

Res. 207\n\n       Whereas the year 1998 marks the 20th anniversary of the \n     founding of the Vietnam Veterans of America;\n       Whereas the history of the Vietnam Veterans of America \n     organization is a story of America's gradual recognition of \n     the tremendous sacrifices of its Vietnam-era veterans and \n     their families;\n       Whereas the Vietnam Veterans of America is dedicated to \n     serving its membership through advocacy for its membership;\n       Whereas the Vietnam Veterans of America provides public and \n     member awareness of critical issues affecting Vietnam-era \n     veterans and their families;\n       Whereas the local grassroots efforts of Vietnam Veterans of \n     America chapters like Chapter One in Rutland, Vermont, which \n     was founded 18 years ago in April 1980, have greatly \n     contributed to the quality of lives of veterans in our \n     Nation's communities;\n       Whereas the Vietnam Veterans of America promotes its \n     principles through volunteerism, professional advocacy, and \n     claims work; and\n       Whereas the future of the Vietnam Veterans of America \n     relies not only on its past accomplishments, but on future \n     accomplishments of its membership that will ensure the \n     Vietnam Veterans of America remains a leader among veterans \n     advocacy organizations: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commemorates the 20th anniversary of the founding of \n     the Vietnam Veterans of America and commends it for its \n     advancement of veterans rights which set the standard for \n     other veterans organizations around the country;\n       (2) asks all Americans to join in the celebration of the \n     20th birthday of the Vietnam Veterans of America and 20 years \n     of advocacy for Vietnam veterans; and\n       (3) encourages the Vietnam Veterans of America to continue \n     into the next millennium to represent and promote the goals \n     of its organization in the veterans community and on Capitol \n     Hill, and to continue organizing to keep its national \n     membership of 51,000 members and 500 chapters strong.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today with great pride and \nenthusiasm to submit a Senate Resolution Commemorating the 20th \nAnniversary of the founding of the Vietnam Veterans of America. This \nresolution has the cosponsorship of Senator Specter, Senator Akaka and \nSenator Leahy. The resolution also points out that April marks the 18th \nAnniversary of the founding of Vietnam Veterans of America's first \nlocal chapter in my home town of Rutland, Vermont.\n  Mr. President, the VVA is a Congressionally chartered national \nveterans service organization exclusively dedicated to Vietnam-era \nveterans and their families. In the late 1970s, America had come \nthrough its longest and most divisive war. Many of the millions of \nveterans who served during that period felt that their concerns were \nnot being addressed by the veterans community and by the federal \ngovernment.\n  In January, 1978, Bobby Muller and a small band of Vietnam veterans \ncame to Washington, D.C. to create an advocacy organization to push for \nfederal action to address the needs of this unique veteran population. \nThe VVA, initially known as the Vietnam Veterans Coalition and then the \nCouncil of Vietnam Veterans, went to work focusing first on the \ndissemination of government information and coordination of relations \nbetween the federal government and the veteran.\n  In time it became clear that, like many other organizations, this one \ncould not survive simply by making a good case for its initiatives--it \nneeded to build a strong membership base in order to wield political \npower. By the summer of 1979, the new Vietnam Veterans of America began \nto focus on building its membership.\n  The growth of the organization was slow initially, but a breakthrough \ncame following resolution of the American Hostage Crisis in Iran in \nJanuary, 1981. It became clear to many Americans that if the hostages \ndeserved a jubilant homecoming, so did the veterans of Vietnam. Vietnam \nveterans began to clamor for action in the form of programs that would \nplace the last generation of wartime veterans on the same footing as \nveterans from previous wars.\n  The strength of the organization grew with the increase in \nmembership. The public also became more willing to\n\n[[Page S3160]]\n\ndeal with the neglected veterans issues unique to the Vietnam war. This \nculminated in the dedication of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in \nNovember, 1982. The activities around the Memorial rekindled a sense of \ncamaraderie among the veterans and the feeling of a shared experience \ntoo significant to ignore.\n  Since then, the VVA has made great strides in the kinds of services \nit provides to its membership, including the founding of the Vietnam \nVeterans of America Legal Services that provides assistance to veterans \nseeking benefits and services from the government. VVA has also \npublished critical information around benefits for Post-Traumatic \nStress Disorder and Agent Orange illnesses.\n  I can personally vouch for the incredible efforts of people like \nAlbert and Mary Trombley, Jake Jacobsen, Dennis Ross, Clark Howland, \nand of course the late Mike Dodge and Don Bodette to establish and \nfoster the growth of grassroots organizations like Chapter 1 in \nRutland, Vermont. This individual leadership has ensured a steady \ngrowth in VVA's size, stature, and prestige.\n  The legislative accomplishments of the VVA through its high-profile \npresence on Capitol Hill have been impressive. Organizations like \nVietnam-era Veterans in Congress, which now boasts 70 members, have \nserved the overall membership well by supporting the pragmatic agenda \nof the VVA and sticking to its founding principle that ``Never again \nwill one generation of veterans abandon another.''\n  Today, the VVA has a national membership of 51,000 with more than 500 \nchapters. VVA state councils in 43 states coordinate the activities and \nprograms of its national organization, ensuring that grassroots input \nto Congress continues to ensure that the federal government meets its \nobligations to its Vietnam veterans.\n  Mr. President, this Resolution expresses the Senate's gratitude to \nthe organization for its advocacy for its members and wishes it \ncontinued success in the years to come.\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING PASSAGE OF THE SENATE \n                   FINANCE COMMITTEE'S IRS RESTRUCTURING BILL.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the House of Representatives passed H.R. 2676 on \n     November 5, 1997;\n       (2) the Finance Committee of the Senate has held several \n     days of hearings this year on IRS restructuring proposals;\n       (3) the hearings demonstrated many areas in which the \n     House-passed bill could be improved;\n       (4) on March 31, 1998, the Senate Finance Committee voted \n     20-0 to report an IRS restructuring package that contains \n     more oversight over the IRS, more accountability for \n     employees, and a new arsenal of taxpayer protections; and\n       (5) the Senate Finance package includes the following items \n     which were not included in the House bill:\n       (A) removal of the statutory impediments to the Commission \n     of Internal Revenue's efforts to reorganize the agency to \n     create a more streamlined, taxpayer-friendly organization,\n       (B) the providing of real oversight authority for the \n     Internal Revenue Service Oversight Board to help prevent \n     taxpayer abuse,\n       (C) the creation of a new Treasury Inspector General for \n     Tax Administration to ensure independence and accountability,\n       (D) real, meaningful relief for innocent spouses,\n       (E) provisions which abate penalties and interest after 1 \n     year so that the IRS does not profit from its own delay,\n       (F) provisions which ensure due process of law to taxpayers \n     by granting them a right to a hearing before the IRS can \n     pursue a lien, levy, or seizure,\n       (G) provisions which forbid the IRS from coercing taxpayers \n     to extend the 10-year statue of limitations of collection,\n       (H) provisions which require the IRS to terminate employees \n     who abuse taxpayers or other IRS employees,\n       (I) provisions which make the Taxpayer Advocate more \n     independent, and\n       (J) provisions enabling the Commissioner of Internal \n     Revenue to manage employees more effectively.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional to totals in \n     this budget resolution assume that the Senate shall, as \n     expeditiously as possible, consider and pass an IRS \n     restructuring bill which provides the most taxpayer \n     protections, the greatest degree of IRS employee \n     accountability, and enhanced oversight.\n\n     SEC. 302. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE SUNSET OF THE \n                   INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that a simple and fair \n     Federal tax system in one that--\n       (1) applies a low tax rate, through easily understood laws, \n     to all Americans;\n       (2) provides tax relief for working Americans;\n       (3) protects the rights of taxpayers and reduces tax \n     collection abuses;\n       (4) eliminates the bias against savings and investment;\n       (5) promotes economic growth and job creation;\n       (6) does not penalize marriage or families; and\n       (7) provides for a taxpayer-friendly collections process to \n     replace the Internal Revenue Service.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the provisions of this resolution assume that all taxes \n     imposed under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall sunset \n     for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2001 (or in \n     the case of any tax not imposed on the basis of a taxable \n     year, on any taxable event or for any period after December \n     31, 2001) and that a new Federal tax system will be enacted \n     that is both simple and fair as described in subsection (a) \n     and that provides only those resources for the Federal \n     Government that are needed to meet its responsibilities to \n     the American people.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       DORGAN AMENDMENT NO. 2280\n\n  Mr. DORGAN proposed an amendment to amendment No. 2218 proposed by \nhim to the concurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE TAX TREATMENT OF HOME \n                   MORTGAGE INTEREST AND CHARITABLE GIVING.\n\n       (a) Findings--Congress finds that--\n       (1) current Federal income tax laws embrace a number of \n     fundamental tax policies including longstanding encouragement \n     for home ownership and charitable giving, expanded health and \n     retirement benefits.\n       (2) the mortgage interest deduction is among the most \n     important incentives in the income tax code and promotes the \n     American Dream of home ownership--the single largest \n     investment for most families, and preserving it is critical \n     for the more than 20,000,000 families claiming it now and for \n     millions more in the future.\n       (3) favorable tax treatment to encourage gifts to charities \n     is a longstanding principle that helps charities raise funds \n     needed to provide services to poor families and others when \n     government is simply unable or unwilling to do so, and \n     maintaining this tax incentive will help charities raise \n     money to meet the challenges of their charitable missions in \n     the decades ahead;\n       (4) legislation has been proposed to repeal the entire \n     income tax code at the end of the year 2001 without providing \n     a specific replacement; and\n       (5) sunsetting the entire income tax code without \n     describing a replacement threatens our Nation's future \n     economic growth and unwisely eliminates existing tax \n     incentives that are crucial for taxpayers who are often \n     making the most inportant financial decisions of their lives.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the levels in this resolution assume that Congress supports \n     the continued tax deductibility of home mortgage interest and \n     charitable contributions and that a sunset of the tax code \n     that does not provide a replacement system that preserves \n     this deductibility could damage the American dream of home \n     ownership and could threaten the viability of non-profit \n     institutions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       KENNEDY AMENDMENT NO. 2281\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY proposed an amendment to amendment No. 2183 proposed by \nhim to the concurrent resolution, S.

Res. 86, supra; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following:\n\n     SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING A PATIENT'S BILL OF RIGHTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) patients lack reliable information about health plans \n     and the quality of care that health plans provide;\n       (2) experts agree that the quality of health care can be \n     substantially improved, resulting in less illness and less \n     premature death;\n       (3) some managed care plans have created obstacles for \n     patients who need to see specialists on an ongoing basis and \n     have required that women get permission from their primary \n     care physician before seeing a gynecologist;\n       (4) a majority of consumers believe that health plans \n     compromise their quality of care to save money;\n       (5) Federal preemption under the Employee Retirement Income \n     Security Act of 1974 prevents States from enforcing \n     protections for the 125,000,000 workers and their families \n     receiving health insurance through employment-based group \n     health plans; and\n       (6) the Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and \n     Quality in the Health Care Industry has unanimously \n     recommended a patient bill of rights to protect patients \n     against abuses by health plan and health insurance issuers.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense Senate that the \n     assumptions underlying this resolution provide for the \n     enactment of legislation to establish a patient's bill of \n     rights for participants in health plans, and that legislation \n     should include--\n       (1) a guarantee of access to covered services, including \n     needed emergency care, specialty care, obstetrical and \n     gynecological care for women, and prescription drugs;\n       (2) provisions to ensure that the special needs of women \n     are met, including protecting women against ``drive-through \n     mastectomies'';\n       (3) provisions to ensure that the special needs of children \n     are met, including access to pediatric specialists and \n     centers of pediatric excellence;\n       (4) provisions to ensure that the special needs of \n     individuals with disabilities and the chronically ill are \n     met, including the possibility of standing referrals to \n     specialists or the ability to have a specialist act as a \n     primary care provider;\n       (5) a procedure to hold health plans accountable for their \n     decisions and to provide for the appeal of a decision of a \n     health plan to deny care to an independent, impartial \n     reviewer;\n       (6) measures to protect the integrity of the physician-\n     patient relationship, including a ban on ``gag clauses'' and \n     a ban on improper incentive arrangements; and\n       (7) measures to provide greater information about health \n     plans to patients and to improve the quality of care.\n       (8) a requirement that the network of providers included in \n     the plan are adequate to ensure the provision of services \n     covered by the plan.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       NICKLES AMENDMENT NO. 2282\n\n  Mr. NICKLES proposed an amendment to the concurrent resolution, S. \nCon. Res. 86, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON HEALTH CARE QUALITY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Rapid changes in the health care marketplace have \n     compromised confidence in the our Nation's health system.\n       (2) American consumers want more convenience, fewer \n     hassles, more choices, and better service from their health \n     insurance plans.\n\n[[Page S3162]]\n\n       (3) All Americans deserve quality-driven health care \n     supported by sound science and evidence-based medicine.\n       (4) The Federal Government, through the National Institutes \n     of Health, supports research that improves the quality of \n     medical care that Americans receive.\n       (5) This resolution assumes increased funding for the \n     National Institutes of Health for 1999 of $15,100,000,000, an \n     11-percent increase over current funding levels, which are 7 \n     percent higher than in 1997.\n       (6) As the largest purchaser of health care services, the \n     Federal Government has a responsibility to utilize its \n     purchasing power to demand high quality health plans and \n     providers for its health programs and to protect its \n     beneficiaries from inferior medical care.\n       (7) The Federal Government must adopt the posture of \n     private sector purchasers and insist on high quality care for \n     the 67,000,000 medicare and medicaid beneficiaries and the \n     9,000,000 Federal employees, retirees, and their dependents.\n       (8) The private sector has proven to be more capable of \n     keeping pace with the rapid changes in health care delivery \n     and medical practice that affect quality of care \n     considerations than the Federal Government.\n       (9) As Congress considers health care legislation, it must \n     first commit to ``do no harm'' to health care quality, \n     consumers, and the evolving market place. Rushing to \n     legislate or regulate based on anecdotal information and \n     micro-managing health plans on politically popular issues \n     will not solve the problems of consumer confidence and the \n     quality of our health care system.\n       (10) When health insurance premiums rise, Americans lose \n     health coverage. Studies indicate that a 1 percent increase \n     in private health insurance premiums will be associated with \n     an increase in the number of persons without insurance of \n     about 400,000 persons.\n       (11) Health care costs have begun to rise significantly in \n     the past year. The Congressional Budget Office (referred to \n     as ``CBO'') projects that the growth in health premiums will \n     be 5.5 percent in 1998 up from 3.8 percent in 1997. CBO \n     continues to project that premiums will grow about 1 \n     percentage point faster than the Gross Domestic Product in \n     the longer run. CBO also warns that new Federal mandates on \n     health insurance could exacerbate this increase in premiums.\n       (12) The President's Advisory Commission on Consumer \n     Protection and Quality in the Health Care Industry developed \n     the Consumer Bill of Rights and Responsibilities. This \n     includes information disclosure, confidentiality of health \n     information, and choice of providers.\n       (13) The President's Commission further determined that \n     private sector organizations have the capacity to act in a \n     timely manner needed to keep pace with the swiftly evolving \n     health system.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying this resolution assume that \n     the Senate will not pass any health care legislation that \n     will--\n       (1) make health insurance unaffordable for working families \n     and increase the number of uninsured Americans;\n       (2) divert limited health care resources away from serving \n     patients to paying lawyers and hiring new bureaucrats; or\n       (3) impose political considerations on clinical decisions, \n     instead of allowing such decisions to be made on the basis of \n     sound science and the best interests of patients.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                DOMENICI (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 2283\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mr. Craig, and Mr. Lott) proposed an \namendment to amendment No. 2226 proposed by Mr. Rockefeller to the \nconcurrent resolution, S.

And that therefore to compensate veterans \n     for diseases whose sole connection to service is a veteran's \n     own tobacco use should not rest with the Government.''.\n       (B) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the function totals and assumptions underlying this \n     resolution assume the following:\n       (i) The support of the President's proposal to not allow \n     post-service smoking related illnesses to be eligible for VA.\n       (ii) The study and report required by paragraph (3) will be \n     completed.\n       (iii) The Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, \n     the Office of Management and Budget, and the General \n     Accounting Office are jointly required to--\n       (aa) jointly study (referred to in this section as the \n     ``study'') the VA General Counsel's determination and the \n     resulting actions to change the compensation rules to include \n     disability and death benefits for conditions related to the \n     use of tobacco products during service; and\n       (bb) deliver an opinion as to whether illnesses resulting \n     from post-service smoking should be considered as a \n     compensable disability.\n       (iv) The study should include--\n       (aa) the estimated numbers of those filing such claims, the \n     cost resulting from such benefits, the time necessary to \n     review such claims, and how such a number of claims will \n     affect the VA's ability to review its current claim load;\n       (bb) an examination of how the proposed change corresponds \n     to prior VA policy relating to post-service actions taken by \n     an individual; and\n       (cc) what Federal benefits, both VA and non-VA, former \n     service members having smoking-related illnesses are eligible \n     to receive.\n       (v) The study shall be completed no later than July 1, \n     1999.\n       (vi) The Department of Veterans Affairs and the Office of \n     Management and Budget shall report their finding to the \n     Majority and Minority Leaders of the Senate and the chairmen \n     and ranking minority members of the Senate Budget and \n     Veterans' Affairs Committees.\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     ROCKEFELLER AMENDMENT NO. 2284\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER proposed an amendment to amendment No. 2226 proposed \nby him to the concurrent resolution, S.

Mr. President, as some of my colleagues may \nknow, each year tuberculosis claims nearly 3 million lives--more than \nall other infectious diseases combined--making it the number one \ninfectious cause of death worldwide. Unlike many other infectious \ndiseases, tuberculosis is an airborne disease transmitted like the \ncommon cold. Nearly one-third of the world's population is already \ninfected, and cases of multi-drug resistant strains, which are far more \ndifficult and expensive to treat, are on the rise. Overall, \ntuberculosis is responsible for 25% of all preventable deaths.\n  The Los Angeles Times recently published an article about USAID's \nwork to expand and strengthen programs to control tuberculosis, along \nwith other global threats to public health. I think this is a very \nimportant initiative and would urge them to continue their efforts. The \nrenewed focus on tuberculosis is due in part to the activities of \nPrinceton Project 55, established by Princeton University's Class of \n1955, which has pressed for aggressive United States leadership in the \nprevention and treatment of this terrible disease. I commend them on \ntheir involvement and would ask that the full text of the article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, March 6, 1998]\n\n             U.S. Launches Global Effort to Control Disease\n\n                          (By Marlene Cimons)\n\n       Washington--The U.S. Agency for International Development \n     announced Thursday a new initiative aimed at controlling the \n     global emergence of lethal infectious diseases, saying it \n     will develop programs in targeted countries to fight the \n     escalating health threats posed by bacterial resistance, \n     tuberculosis and malaria.\n       The agency also said it will work with other health \n     agencies worldwide to better monitor and respond to new \n     outbreaks of diseases before they get out of hand.\n       ``This is as important for American citizens'' as it is for \n     citizens abroad because ``we are dealing with these problems \n     at their origin, rather than waiting for them to get here,'' \n     said Dr. Nils Daulaire, a senior health advisor to USAID.\n       Congress, recognizing the potential danger from infectious \n     diseases overseas, awarded the agency an additional $50 \n     million for fiscal 1998 specifically for control of \n     infectious diseases--the first time in four years that, \n     ``instead of cutting our budget, Congress has added to it,'' \n     Daulaire said.\n       In response, the agency is pursuing a 10-year effort that \n     it hopes will reduce by at least 10% the deaths caused by \n     infectious diseases, excluding those caused by acquired \n     immune deficiency syndrome, by 2007.\n       The $50 million is in addition to the agency's public \n     health budget of $850 million, which is spent on maternal and \n     child health, family planning and the control of AIDS and the \n     human immunodeficiency virus that causes it.\n       USAID has estimated that more than 17 million people \n     worldwide will die from infectious diseases in 1998. This \n     health problem has gotten worse in recent years due to \n     numerous factors, including rapid population growth, \n     overcrowding, poor sanitation, poverty, loss of trained \n     health personnel and decreasing resources available to public \n     health services in the poorest of countries, according to \n     USAID.\n       The new strategy will focus on:\n       Developing programs that will discourage the indiscriminate \n     use of antibiotics, which only strengthens the ability of \n     resistant strains of bacteria to survive.\n       Developing a global tuberculosis control plan, which will \n     include establishing up to five major sites to serve as \n     models for TB surveillance and control and enhancing programs \n     to identify TB strains that are resistant to multiple drugs \n     before the strains become widespread.\n       Developing programs in Africa--where the most troublesome \n     malaria problems exist--to prevent and control spread of the \n     disease. Rather than control the mosquitoes that transmit the \n     parasite, efforts will focus on preventing infection and \n     quickly treating those who become infected, an approach \n     health officials say will help reduce further \n     transmission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/02/senate-section/article/S3169-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3169-S3170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO GOODRICH MEMORIAL LIBRARY\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nthe Goodrich Memorial Library in Newport, Vermont as it recalls 100 \nyears of community service. On May 2, 1998 the Goodrich Memorial \nLibrary will kick off a year-long celebration with a wide array of \nactivities for people young and old.\n  Converse and Alvira Goodrich donated their entire estate so that \nNewport Village could construct and maintain a new town library. \nArchitect\n\n[[Page S3170]]\n\nGeorge Story's vision became reality when the doors were opened and a \nceremony held to dedicate the new library on September 1, 1898. An \nextremely ornate Victorian building, the Goodrich Memorial Library \nhouses a wealth of information for those interested in Vermont history. \nIn one of its rooms, the library maintains an archive of local \nnewspapers dating back to the 1800s and early 1900s.\n  The Goodrich Memorial Library not only serves as a resource for \ninformation, but also as a critical bond in the community. It brings \npeople together for cultural events and as a shared experience it \nprovides a link between generations. It is a reminder of the town's \nlong and proud history, one that I hope will continue for years to \ncome.\n  Once again, I would like to congratulate the Goodrich Memorial \nLibrary on its centennial anniversary and wish them the best of luck in \nthe next century of service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/02/senate-section/article/S3169-3", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       A TRIBUTE TO BISHOP JAMES\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, President Clinton's visit to \nAfrica is a historic visit, the first time a sitting American President \nhas visited that continent. For a distinguished South Carolinian who is \naccompanying the President, the trip also marks the return to a land \nwith which he is very familiar.\n  Bishop Fred James, a retired Bishop of the AME Church, is one of \nSouth Carolina's most respected men of the cloth. For four years in the \n1970s, he served in Capetown, South Africa, as the presiding bishop of \nthe AME Church for five countries: South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana, \nNamibia, Swaziland, and Mozambique. During Bishop James's tenure, the \nChurch conducted not only traditional religious activities, but also \nunorthodox outreach programs to improve the lives of its congregants. \nAmong other things, it built schools, operated a publishing house, and \nran a cattle ranch. None of these was strictly religious in nature, but \nall helped to relieve the oppressive atmosphere of these countries and \nrestore a sense of community among the AME Church's congregants.\n  After returning from Africa, Bishop James continued to lead outreach \nprograms and fight for civil rights at home. Before settling in South \nCarolina, he was active in the NAACP and lived in Arkansas and \nOklahoma. He also lived in Baltimore, where his responsibilties as \nBishop overseeing thousands of congregants and many churches were even \ngreater than those he shouldered in Africa. As the people of South \nCarolina know so well, Bishop James has been a force for good in every \ncommunity in which he has lived.\n  Mr. President, I can think of no better ambassador of our nation's \ngood will toward Africa than Bishop Fred James. He has spent the better \npart of his life serving God and his fellow men, without expecting \nrecognition or reward. With his selection by President Clinton to be an \ninformal, good will ambassador to Africa, he has at last received some \nof both. Let us all hope the United States can achieve the same, strong \nrelationship with Africa as that of Bishop James.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/02/senate-section/article/S3170-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TOMB GUARDS AT ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY\n\n Mr. HAGER. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to recognize \na very special group of Americans, the Arlington National Cemetery Tomb \nGuards of the Third United States Infantry. The Tomb Guards this year \nmark their 50th anniversary--half a century of dedicated service to the \nAmerican heroes who rest at Arlington.\n  The dedicated and devoted men and women of the Tomb Guards stand \nwatch over the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier 24 hours a day, seven days a \nweek, regardless of weather. Arlington's sacred ground holds many of \nAmerica's heroes, but the unknown soldiers deserve special honor. They \nmade the ultimate sacrifice to preserve America's freedom, and they \ndied in anonymity--soldiers, as inscribed on their headstones, ``Known \nbut to God.''\n  Since 1948, soldiers from the ``Old Guard,'' the Third United States \nInfantry, have kept watch at this most special place in Arlington \nNational Cemetery. Only soldiers of the highest character and \nstandards, with the greatest integrity and professional skill, are \nselected to serve with the Tomb Guards. These men and women are the \nbest of the best. The competition is keen.\n  As young people across America search for role models, they need look \nno further than this group of dedicated professionals who honor the \nsacrifice of all who have fallen for freedom. I salute the Tomb Guards \non their fifty years of dedicated service to America's heroes and wish \nthem well as they continue their devotion to duty. America is grateful \nfor their service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/02/senate-section/article/S3170-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3170-S3172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             PRESIDENT CLINTON AND THE AFRICAN RENAISSANCE\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the \nhistoric visit that is just ending today.\n  I speak of the visit of President Clinton to Africa which began on \nMarch 22. As the Ranking Member of the Africa Subcommittee of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee, I know Africa's vital importance to \nthe United States, and I applaud the President's effort to highlight \nAfrica with this timely trip.\n  President Clinton is the first sitting U.S. president since President \nJimmy Carter to take such an extensive voyage in Africa, and he will \nthe be the first sitting U.S. president ever to visit each of the \nindividual countries on his itinerary.\n  We can not underestimate the significance of this.\n  Mr. President, millions of Americans trace their roots to Africa. \nThousands of Americans have served in Africa in non-governmental \norganizations, church groups, or the Peace Corps, including many \ngraduates of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Our African heritage \nis prominent and pervasive in the art, music, and literature of \nAmerican culture. More and more American tourists are journeying to see \nthe natural wonders of the Serengeti, the Ghanaian Cape Coast or \nVictoria Falls.\n  Although these ties bind every American to Africa, many of them in a \nvery passionate and personal way, I am concerned that there is so \nlittle knowledge about Africa in this country, and so little interest. \nThat is why the President's trip is so important.\n  Many of the 48 distinct nations of Africa are now experiencing what \nsome have called an ``African Renaissance.'' By whatever name, there \ncan be no doubt that Africa is a continent much changed since the years \nimmediately following the independence period.\n  In some nations on that great continent, we see conflicts, coups and \ncorruption. In others, we see the triumph of democracy and of the \ncreative human spirit. In the past few years, too many of Africa's \npeoples have faced atrocities that rank among the worst of this \ncentury. At the same time, healthy changes have swept across much of \nthe continent, and there is more reason for optimism about Africa's \nfuture than at any time in recent memory.\n  First, there has been substantial political progress. In 1989, only \nfive African nations could be described as ``democratic.'' Today, there \nare at least twenty. Where there used to be one-party states or \nmilitary regimes, we now have governments that have developed new \nconstitutions, held multiparty elections, and taken great strides \ntoward reforming key institutions. Parliaments in countries like Ghana \nand Namibia are beginning to exercise a meaningful check on executive \npower. Local and national elections are being conducted freely and \nfairly in many countries. Journalists are more boldly exercising new \npress freedoms.\n  The institutions that nourish true democracy are beginning to take \nroot in the African soil.\n  Second, many of the long-standing, violent conflicts that have \nravaged the land and the peoples of Africa are coming to a close. \nUganda, which suffered terribly throughout the 1980s, is now one of the \nmost stable countries on the continent. The protracted war in the Horn \nof Africa ended with the peaceful secession of Eritrea, an important \nnew actor on the African stage. The seeds of lasting peace have been \nplanted in Liberia and Angola. And the promise of peace dangles before \nthe peoples of Northern Mali and the Western Sahara.\n\n[[Page S3171]]\n\n  Third, many African nations have surged forward in human and social \ndevelopment. The scourge of AIDS continues to take its toll, but infant \nmortality rates have dropped significantly. Population growth has \nslowed to a more manageable rate. The drag of illiteracy still slows \neconomic development, but more African children go to school now than \nat any other time since independence.\n  African women, too, are playing a more active role in the future of \ntheir continent. In Botswana, an organization called ``Stand Up Women'' \nis working to expand the influence of women on national laws and \npolicy. In South Africa, Ghana and elsewhere, female entrepreneurs are \nstarting and managing their own businesses. Throughout Africa, more and \nmore women are becoming involved in political life. Many have been \nelected to fledgling parliaments.\n  Finally, Africa's economies are growing at impressive rates, with an \nestimated 4.5 percent GDP increase in 1997, according to the World \nBank. In Senegal and Uganda, growth has topped 5 percent.\n  Hope abides in Africa. And hope abides among those of us who see that \na thriving Africa is good for America.\n  Still, many African nations are plagued by authoritarian regimes that \ndeny their citizens basic human rights. The economic and political \npotential of some nations are being squandered by ruling military \njuntas. In these few hold-out regimes, corruption, economic \nmismanagement and violent suppression of dissent are the norm. This is \ncertainly true in Nigeria, a nation of great natural and human \npotential, which cannot be realized under the current regime.\n  In Sudan, a decades-old war has killed hundreds of thousands of \ninnocent civilians. Sudanese children are often forced into \nconscription, and many of them know the barrel of a gun better than the \ninside of a classroom.\n  Other obstacles to development abound. Some of the poorest, most \ndesolate places on earth are located in Africa. Life expectancy and \nadult literacy are the world's lowest, while population growth and the \nincidence of HIV/AIDS are the highest. Basic services that we as \nAmericans take for granted--from clean drinking water and health care, \nto school books and paved roads--remain out of reach for millions of \nAfricans.\n  The combination of welcome progress and daunting problems in Africa \npresent enormous challenges for U.S. policy. Some observers look at \nAfrica and say, ``This is a basket case!,'' and see few redeeming \nfeatures. These cynical voices--the so-called ``Afro-pessimists''--\nbelieve America should disengage from the world and particularly from \nAfrica; that the poverty and despair of others is not our problem, that \nthe potential of Africa presents no opportunity.\n  But as the history of this century has shown time and again, the \nproblems of the world community, do, in fact, become ours.\n  As the world becomes smaller and more inter-dependent, new dangers--\nterrorism, international crime, narcotics, and infectious disease, all \nof which are increasingly prevalent in Africa--will not stop at the \nborder. Sudanese involvement is alleged in the World Trade Center \nbombing. In Wisconsin, hundreds of my constituents have received \nfraudulent scam letters from Nigeria. For a few days in 1995, we all \nworried about the threat of the Ebola virus which had recently appeared \nin the former Zaire.\n  Mr. President, we cannot ignore these threats.\n  Though mindful of the grim realities of Africa, the United States \nmust encourage the positive developments that are already taking place \nthere. We must embrace and encourage those changes, and not just \nbecause we are a generous people. Africa is a growing U.S. trading \npartner. U.S. exports to Sub-Saharan Africa increased 14 percent during \n1996; that's twice as fast as the growth rate of total U.S. exports \nworldwide. Few people realize that the United States currently exports \nmore to sub-Saharan Africa than to all of the former Soviet republics \ncombined. More and more forward-thinking American companies have their \neye on the vibrant potential markets in Africa.\n  By going to Africa, President Clinton recognizes Africa's importance \nto the U.S. and demonstrates his steadfast commitment to America's \ncrucial role in supporting Africa's burgeoning democracies, aiding \neconomic growth, maintaining recent peace agreements, and preventing \nfuture conflicts.\n  The President's trip is both symbol and substantive statement. There \nhave been moving moments with genocide survivors in Rwanda and with \nSouth African President Nelson Mandela, with school children in Uganda \nand with Peace Corps volunteers in Ghana.\n  Each of the countries on President Clinton's itinerary represents \nsome facet of Africa's accomplishments. Each is an important U.S. \npartner.\n  The President has also announced several new policy initiatives, \nincluding an important education program and a welcome push for the \nSenate to ratify the U.N. Convention to Combat Desertification, a \ntreaty currently pending before this body. President Clinton has \nexpressed his commitment to maintaining existing programs, including \nthe Africa Crisis Response Initiative, a U.S.-led effort to help \nAfrican militaries gain the capacity to participate in peacekeeping \noperations. I have supported this initiative here on the Senate floor.\n  As part of his itinerary, the President scheduled three highly \nsignificant roundtable meetings. The first, a meeting with young South \nAfrican leaders outside Johannesburg, served to highlight the promise \nof the new generation in Africa--young people who were born well after \nthe independence period, and who are anxious to seize new \nopportunities.\n  The second, a meeting with African environmentalists, helped give \nfocus to some of the environmental challenges on the continent.\n  The third, a meeting with human rights and democracy activists at his \nlast stop in Senegal, served to highlight America's commitment to human \nrights and democracy in Africa and the need to sustain that commitment.\n  Above all, this trip presented a perfect opportunity for the United \nStates to make clear its stated policy of support for human rights and \ngood governance in Africa. Before he departed, I wrote to the President \nand asked him to consider a few ways in which he might demonstrate his \ncommitment to these principles.\n  Recognizing the unique challenges posed by the recent history of the \ntroubled Great Lakes region, I asked that the President make clear the \nUnited States' unwavering support for democracy in the region. For \nexample, I urged him to articulate clear criteria for the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo to gain U.S. assistance, including lifting \nexisting bans on opposition political activity and ceasing harassment \nof lawful components of civil society. I also urged extreme caution in \nany attempt by the administration to seek security assistance for the \nRwandan military, which has been responsible for widespread killing of \ncivilians. Without strong statements by the administration against \nthese practices, the U.S. risks sending the wrong signal about our \npriorities and our values.\n  I also told the President of my hope that this trip would help \nstrengthen the President's resolve with respect to our Nigeria policy, \nparticularly in light of the continuing deterioration of the human \nrights situation in Nigeria. I have long been concerned about the \nperceived lack of a policy in Nigeria. That is why I urged the \nPresident to take the strongest position possible in support of \ndemocracy in that country. I told him I appreciated the remarks \ndelivered recently by Assistant Secretary Susan Rice before the Senate \nSubcommittee on Africa that made clear that the United States would not \naccept the election of a military candidate in Nigeria's upcoming \nelections. This was a very important statement, and one that I had \nhoped would mark the beginning of a more coherent, resolute Nigeria \npolicy for the United States.\n\n  That hope was all but extinguished when I heard the President remark \nlast Friday that Nigeria's current military ruler, General Sani Abacha, \nwould be considered acceptable by the United States if he chose to run \nin the country's upcoming election as a civilian. Other administration \nofficials later tried to clarify the President's remarks by noting that \nthe U.S. objective is to support a viable transition to civilian rule. \nThey also noted, correctly, that the so-called ``transition'' process \ncurrently underway in Nigeria appears\n\n[[Page S3172]]\n\nstructured expressly to keep Gen. Abacha in power. In effect, they \nacknowledged the contradiction between our Nigeria policy and the \npolitical realities there.\n  Virtually none of the institutions that would allow for a free and \nfair election--an independent electoral commission, an open \nregistration process, or open procedures for the participation of \nindependent political parties, for example--have been put into place. \nRepression continues unabated: political prisoners remain in prison, \nthe press remains heavily constrained, and the fruits of Nigeria's \nabundant natural resources remain in the hands of Abacha's supporters.\n  Unfortunately, I fear the President's remarks may have done real \ndamage already, by indicating to Gen. Abacha and his cronies that if \nAbacha were to take off his military uniform, throw on civilian \nclothes, and win an election, it would be OK with the United States. I \nfear the United States has explicitly agreed to accept a wolf in \nsheep's clothing!\n  Well, lest anyone get the wrong idea, let me say that I believe, and \nI hope most of my colleagues believe, an electoral victory for Abacha \nwould hardly represent a transition to democracy. It would be totally \nunacceptable. I hope that President Clinton will clarify the policy of \nthe United States with respect to Nigeria soon. It is high time the \npolicy review that began nearly two years ago is completed, so we do \nnot have this alarming confusion.\n  Nigeria must know that anything less than a transparent transition to \ncivilian rule will be met with severe policy consequences.\n  Finally, I emphasized to the President that the United States should \nmake support for Africa's organizations of civil society a higher \npriority. These groups do courageous work to promote human rights \nstandards and to monitor their governments' compliance. Accordingly, \nU.S. officials must speak out publicly when these courageous people are \nabused by their governments. I have urged the President to take the \nopportunity to highlight the vital work being performed by a broad \nrange of civil society organizations, including those facing government \nrepression.\n  Mr. President, I was concerned last December when some news reports \nfollowing Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's trip to Africa \nincluded statements by U.S. officials that it would be unfair to hold \ncertain African governments to ``Western'' standards of personal and \npolitical freedom. Not only does this contradict stated U.S. policy, it \nis a condescending, unnecessary and dangerous concession to make to \nAfrican governments that flout human rights.\n  A clear message on democracy and human rights is especially important \nas the U.S. works with African nations to strengthen their economies. \nEconomic growth is crucial to any nation's success, but the U.S. must \nensure that as it helps to foster economic development, it also fosters \npolitical and personal freedoms. Not only does the U.S. have a moral \nobligation to promote human rights, Africa's post-colonial history \nshows us that African nations with long-term democratic rule are also \nthe nations with the best long-term economic performances. Freedom \nfosters prosperity.\n  The respect a government shows for human rights can tell us whether \nthat regime will respect its neighbors, its trading partners, and the \nworld community at large. A government that does not respect the rights \nof its people cannot be trusted to honor a trade agreement or a treaty, \nmuch less the rule of law in general. This is as true for Nigeria as it \nis for China.\n  The common thread running through our Africa policy must be the U.S. \ncommitment to democracy and human rights. Without this commitment, true \npeace cannot take root and economic growth will ultimately falter. Now \nmore than ever we must make clear our commitment to democracy and human \nrights, both to governments working toward these goals, and, more \nimportantly, to those repressive regimes that are not.\n  Mr. President, I welcome the energy the Clinton administration has \ndevoted to Africa and to U.S. policy there. I look forward to working \nwith the President in the future to capitalize on the momentum that \nwill certainly be created by this most historic trip.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/02/senate-section/article/S3170-3", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRAGEDY IN CENTRE COUNTY\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay my respects \nto several young people who recently lost their lives in a cabin fire.\n  Two weeks ago, 11 friends from Northumberland and Lancaster Counties \nplanned a weekend retreat at the Wehry family cabin. The site of many \nmemorable family gatherings, the newly remodeled cabin seemed to be the \nperfect setting to eat, play cards, and enjoy rural Centre County's \noutdoor recreation. On Sunday morning, March 22, the friends' fun-\nfilled weekend came to a devastating end. The ``mansion in the \nmountains'' caught fire at 5:20 a.m. All of the 11 friends died in \ntheir sleep from smoke inhalation.\n  Each of these young people was special in his or her own right. A \nquiet girl, Toni Wehry wanted to be a teacher. Amanda Wehry was bright, \noutgoing, and popular. Tyrone Wehry, who was working for the House \nRepublican caucus in Harrisburg, planned to pursue a career in \npolitics. Warwick High School's former basketball star, Erik Gray was \nlearning to be an electrician. Nicholas Berkey was lovingly described \nas a dependable young man who was saving money to buy a house. The \nversatile James Giliberti enjoyed martial arts, music, and finance; he \nhad planned to invest in an IRA this year. Kip Snyder is remembered as \na prankster who pitched for the Line Mountain High School baseball \nteam. Chad Hain, who enjoyed hands-on technical work, had a promising \ncareer in carpentry. Quiet and sensitive, Jason Herrold was studying \nbusiness administration at Susquehanna University. The Wiest brothers, \nToby and David, owned a paint ball supply store. By all accounts, the \nvivacious Toby and the pensive David were best friends.\n  Friends and neighbors have rallied to console the victims' families. \nWell wishers tied blue and gold ribbons--Line Mountain High School's \ncolors--to telephone poles, lampposts, and front doors.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nDavid Murray, a well known and certainly well regarded patient advocate \nat the Veterans' Administration (VA) in White River Junction who is \nleaving the great state of Vermont to relocate to the state of \nWashington. Although I question why anyone would willingly opt to move \nfrom the most beautiful state in the union, I must concede that \nWashington state is probably a close second in terms of beauty and \nquality of life.\n  I certainly wish Dave well as he embarks on this exciting venture, \nthough life at the Veterans' Administration hospital will never be \nquite the same without him. Each day he goes beyond the call of duty in \nhis never-wavering advocacy for veterans. He provides veterans and \ntheir families with their crucial link to understanding and moving \nthrough the system. Dave is probably the most sought after person at \nthe VA and I would venture a guess that he receives more ``pages'' in \none hour than most VA doctors receive in an entire day.\n  Service is a word that Dave knows well. He served honorably in the \nMarine Corps during the Vietnam War, continued his federal service for \nthe next 20 plus years culminating in his current job as Patient \nAdvocate at the VA hospital in White River Junction. He is a member of \nthe Disabled American Veterans, the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the \nAmerican Legion and involved himself in his community as a boy scout \nleader. It is my understanding that Dave, when he's not working or \nwearing one of his many service\n\n[[Page S3173]]\n\nhats, actually enjoys camping, canoeing and gardening.\n  Mr. President, I would like to publicly recognize Dave's outstanding \ncontribution to his fellow veterans and wish him and his wife Diane the \nvery best in their change of venue. I would ask them to remember that \nif they ever decide to come home to Vermont, we will leave the light \non.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/02/senate-section/article/S3172-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n GEORGE GUEDEL'S SERVICE AT THE NAVY'S ACOUSTIC RESEARCH DETACHMENT AT \n                             BAYVIEW, IDAHO\n\n Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise to say thank you to a \npatriot and a technical expert, George Guedel, who is retiring on May \n1, 1998. George was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and was raised in the \nSeattle, WA area.\n  George attended the U.S. Naval Academy for two years until the \nresponsibilities of marriage led him to leave the academy. George \ncompleted his bachelor's degree in physics at the University of \nWashington. In 1965, George began working for the Navy in the \nunderwater acoustics field, and, except for a short stint as a \ngovernment contractor, continued working in that field for the Navy in \npositions of increasing responsibility until his retirement.\n  George's assignments include: Head of the Carr Inlet Acoustic Range; \nHead of the Acoustic Analysis Branch at the Naval Undersea Warfare \nStation in Keyport, WA; Head of the Santa Cruz Island Acoustic Range \nFacility; and Head of the Submarine Noise Measurement & Analysis Branch \nof the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Bremerton, WA. Throughout his \ncareer, Mr. Guedel has been highly regarded for his expertise in \nunderwater acoustics and machinery vibration, as well as for his skill \nin managing complex acoustic testing.\n  George's final and longest assignment was as Director of the Naval \nSurface Warfare Center's Acoustic Research Detachment (ARD) in Bayview, \nID for over ten years. In this important position, George oversaw a \nmajor expansion in facilities and staff in support of critical testing \nfor the Seawolf and New Attack Submarine programs.\n  His work at the ARD also included frequent presentations to top \ngovernment officials and extensive involvement with the Idaho \ncommunity. He has been recognized with an Employee-of-the-Year Award, \nseveral Special Act Awards and Special Achievement Awards, and numerous \nletters of recognition from high-ranking Navy officers. George Guedel \nis the author or co-author of numerous technical reports on ship and \nsubmarine noise characteristics.\n  George and his wife Ruth have 5 adult children, one two-year-old \ngranddaughter, and a golden retriever. George has been an accomplished \nsailor since childhood, regularly competing in regattas. He is also an \navid scuba diver and outdoorsman. After retirement, George plans to \nvolunteer his skills to an organization devoted to preservation of the \nenvironment. George also hopes to spend more time on his hobbies and to \nwin the sailing Nationals.\n  George Guedel has been a stalwart contributor to our Navy's stealth \nservice and he has given outstanding assistance to me in my effort to \nshowcase the impressive work performed at the Navy's premier submarine \nacoustic testing center in Bayview, Idaho. I want to wish George and \nRuth good luck, fair winds and following seas in their next \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/02/senate-section/article/S3173-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CRAZY HORSE MEMORIAL\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I express my strong support for \nthe sense of the Senate resolution commemorating the efforts of the \nZiolkowski family over the past fifty years in their endeavor to honor \nthe great Oglala Sioux leader Tasunke Witko, or Crazy Horse, through \ncreation of the Crazy Horse Memorial. The Crazy Horse Memorial is a \nnonprofit cultural, educational, and humanitarian project dedicated to \nNative Americans throughout North America. The 50th anniversary of the \nfirst blast at the memorial site will occur on June 3, 1998, in my home \nstate of South Dakota.\n  Crazy Horse was one of this nation's greatest Native American \nwarriors and spiritual leaders, who fought to defend the rights and \nlives of his people and all Native Americans throughout his short life. \nHe is widely remembered for leading a force of Cheyenne and Oglala \nSioux warriors to victory over George Armstrong Custer in the Battle of \nLittle Big Horn. Crazy Horse was born on Rapid Creek in 1840, and was \nkilled when he was only 37 years of age. During his life he was a great \nleader of his people. Native Americans agree he did not have an equal \nas a warrior or a chief. He gave submissive allegiance to no man, white \nor Indian, and claimed his inalienable rights as an Indian to wander at \nwill over the hunting grounds of his people. He wanted only peace and a \nway of living for his people.\n  In 1940, several Sioux Indian chiefs invited the late sculptor \nKorczak Ziolkowski to create a memorial to their great leader, Crazy \nHorse, by carving a tribute to him in the Black Hills on what is \npopularly known as ``Thunderhead Mountain.'' The Memorial was dedicated \non June 3, 1948 with the first blast on the Thunderhead Mountain at \nwhich time Mr. Ziolkowski vowed that creation of the Memorial would be \na nonprofit educational and cultural project, financed solely through \nprivate means, and wholly without government funding. Korczak \nZiolkowski dedicated his life to creation of the Crazy Horse Memorial, \nup until his death on October 20, 1982.\n  Once complete, the Crazy Horse Memorial will be the largest sculpture \nin the world standing 563 feet high and 641 feet long. I am pleased \nthat the Senate will recognize June 3, 1998, as the 50th anniversary of \nthe first blast on Thunderhead Mountain, the first step towards \ncompletion of the Crazy Horse Memorial. I would like to congratulate \nthe fifty years of efforts of Korczak Ziolkowski, his wife Ruth \nZiolkowski, and their children in creating the Crazy Horse Memorial and \nnotethat the creation of the Memorial from its inception on June 3, \n1948 to the present day was accomplished through private donations and \ncompletely without federal funding.\n  One of many great and patriotic Indian heroes, Crazy Horse's tenacity \nof purpose, his modest life, his unfailing courage, and his tragic \ndeath set him apart and above the others. Completion of the Crazy Horse \nMemorial will serve as a lasting tribute to the great Oglala Sioux \nwarrior and spiritual leader, Crazy Horse, and to all Native \nAmericans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/02/senate-section/article/S3173-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3173-S3174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO RICK FRIES\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, next week, the students, \nparents and faculty from Orange Grove Junior High in Hacienda Heights, \nCalifornia, will be visiting our nation's Capitol. This will be the \ntwentieth consecutive year that students from Orange Grove have visited \nWashington, D.C. This also marks the twentieth consecutive visit by \nOrange Grove's tour leader and history teacher, Rick Fries.\n  It was in the Spring of 1979 when Rick Fries first led a group of \nmore than 25 students and adults to the East Coast, visiting Jamestown, \nYorktown, Williamsburg, Charlottesville and finally Washington, D.C. \nFor each succeeding year thereafter, he would bring another group of \nOrange Grove students, sometimes to new historic places, but always to \nWashington. His students have seen where Revolution was born in Boston, \nwhere Independence was declared in Philadelphia, where the Union was \npreserved in Gettysburg, and where our laws are made right here in \nWashington.\n  From the very first tour in 1979, Mr. Fries' goal was simple: to make \nAmerican History come to life for his students. The name of his tour \nsays it all: Living History. It's fair to say he has succeeded. This \nyear, Mr. Fries will be leading a group of 63 students and 20 adults to \nWashington. His tour is so popular among Orange Grove students, it is \nsold out well before the beginning of the school year.\n  The tour has remained popular after all these years because the \nenthusiasm Mr. Fries shows for history and for his students has never \nwavered. Those who have traveled with and learned from Mr. Fries all \nagree: He makes the history of our country an enjoyable experience for \nboth students and parents because he enjoys it as well.\n\n[[Page S3174]]\n\n  It's no secret to all who are associated with Orange Grove Junior \nHigh that Mr. Fries consistently has been one of the school's most \npopular teachers--popular with both students and parents. He is well-\nliked simply because he truly cares about his students. And he's \nconsidered a wonderful teacher of history because he truly cares about \nhis country.\n  Mr. Fries is one of those remarkable teachers who has made a lasting \nimpact on the lives of young people. In fact, one of his students who \ntraveled with Mr. Fries on his first tour to Washington back in 1979 is \nnow a Legislative Director for my friend and colleague from Ohio, \nSenator Mike DeWine. This former student has said that his own interest \nin government, and his own love of history, was due largely to Rick \nFries. I am sure there are quite a few more current and former students \nwho were inspired by Mr. Fries, and not just in history and government. \nMr. Fries also dedicates his time with young people as a football and \nbasketball coach, and follows the example of the legendary UCLA Coach \nJohn Wooden, who developed in his athletes not just physical strength, \nbut also strength of character.\n  It is fitting that the Orange Grove students will be visiting Capitol \nHill on April 13--the birthday of the author of the Declaration of \nIndependence and our third president, Thomas Jefferson. I understand \nMr. Fries is a great admirer of President Jefferson, and it shows when \nhe and his students visit Monticello--President Jefferson's home--and \nthe Jefferson Memorial. I also understand that of all the tributes \ngiven to President Jefferson, Mr. Fries is particularly fond of the one \ngiven by President John F. Kennedy, when the following at a White House \ndinner honoring Nobel Prize winners: I think this is the most \nextraordinary collection of talent, of human knowledge, that has ever \nbeen gathered together at the White House, with the possible exception \nof when Thomas Jefferson dined alone.''\n  Mr. President, I am sure I speak for the community of Hacienda \nHeights when I express my admiration and thanks to Rick Fries. 1He is \ntruly an inspiration to his students and his fellow teachers for his \ntireless devotion to young people and to his profession. I wish Mr. \nFries, and the students, parents and faculty from Orange Grove an \nenjoyable and memorable twentieth visit to our nation's \ncapitol.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/02/senate-section/article/S3173-3", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO HOWARD COFFIN\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, Vermont has a long-standing \nreputation of having the most valiant regiments to be dispatched to the \nUnion Army during the Civil War. Vermonters not only fought bravely for \nthe preservation of the Union and for an end to slavery, they made \nvital contributions to many important battles. The Union Army was at a \ngreat advantage when they were lucky enough to have Vermonters fighting \nby their side. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Howard \nCoffin, a Vermonter who has lead the fight for the preservation of this \ncountry's hallowed grounds. I am pleased and honored that Howard Coffin \nwill receive the Vermont Civil War Council's ``Full Duty\" award for his \ndedication and accomplishments in preserving and understanding of our \nnation's most cherished and sacred lands.\n  Preserving our nation's battlefields is very important to me and a \nsubject very close to Howard's heart. Several years ago I had the \nprivilege to travel with Howard, who is well known as the most \nprominent Civil War tour guide in Vermont, from battlefield to \nbattlefield. We relived Jackson's battles of the 1862 campaign and \nretraced the Union campaign of 1864. From that day on I have shared \nHoward's passion and interest in this country's sacred past. \nFortunately for me and this country, Howard took the lead as a member \nof my staff to find out all we could about the battlefields and what \nwas needed to safeguard this nation's Civil War heritage. It quickly \nbecame apparent that the Civil War battlefields were in need of \nprotection. Howard was instrumental in drafting and helping pass \nimportant legislation which led to eventual passage of the Shenandoah \nValley Battlefields Commission and the Civil War Sites Advisory \nCommission.\n  A leader in the effort to preserve Civil War battlefields, Howard has \nserved on the boards of the Association for the Preservation of Civil \nWar Sites and Protect Historic America and served as member of the \nCivil War Sites Advisory Commission. He has published several books on \nthe Civil War, including ``Full Duty'' and his most recent, ``Nine \nMonths to Gettysburg,'' which tells the story of the Second Vermont \nBrigade. He also organized the first ever fundraiser for battlefield \npreservation in Vermont generating over $10,000 for the protection of \nthe battlefield of the 3rd Winchester where Vermonters fought and died \nso valiantly.\n  Mr. President, the American Civil War is thought by many historians \nto be the fundamental event shaping the character of the United States. \nHowever, battlefield sites that are vital to understanding and \nappreciating our nation's history are in grave danger. This country is \nlucky to have Howard Coffin on its side, because he will not rest until \nevery field, hill, dam, valley, and woods in this country that has been \nsaturated with the blood of soldiers who fought so bravely are \nprotected and recognized. I am grateful for the foresight and \ndedication of Howard Coffin and congratulate him on his acceptance of \nthe ``Full Duty'' award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/02/senate-section/article/S3174-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3174-S3176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             BELLA S. ABZUG\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I was greatly saddened to learn \nof the death of Bella S. Abzug. While we began our association as \npolitical rivals, past quickly became past, and I came to respect and \nadmire her as a friend and colleague.\n  She served three terms in the United States Congress with \nextraordinary distinction, establishing an unparalleled record of \ncommitment to women's issues that would distinguish her career. With a \nrare combination of intellect, energy, and wit, Bella properly won a \nplace on the national stage. And she did not stop there--in short order \nBella Abzug became an international figure. As President of the Women's \nEnvironment and Development Organization, she added her voice to a wide \nrange of international debates with a style that was all her own. \nBella's stature was such that in 1995 she was selected to lead a \ndelegation of United States nongovernmental organizations to the United \nNations' Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing, China. She \nmade us proud.\n  To know Bella Abzug was to know a woman of indefatigable passion for \nthe fray. Regardless of the issue, whenever New Yorkers needed an \noutspoken advocate, Bella could be counted on to lead the charge. She \nwill be missed.\n  I ask that her obituary from the New York Times of April 1, 1998 be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The obituary follows:\n\n             [From the New York Times, Wed., Apr. 1, 1998]\n\n    Bella Abzug, 77, Congresswoman And a Founding Feminist, Is Dead\n\n                          (By Laura Mansnerus)\n\n       Bella S. Abzug, New Yorker, feminist, antiwar activist, \n     politician and lawyer, died yesterday at Columbia-\n     Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 77.\n       She died of complications following heart surgery, said \n     Harold Holzer, who was her spokesman when she served in \n     Congress. She had been hospitalized for weeks, and had been \n     in poor health for several years, he said.\n       Ms. Abzug represented the West Side of Manhattan for three \n     Congressional terms in the 1970's. She brought with her a \n     belligerent, exuberant politics that made her a national \n     character. Often called just Bella, she was recognizable \n     everywhere by her big hats and a voice that Norman Mailer \n     said ``could boil the fat off a taxicab driver's neck.''\n       She opposed the Vietnam War, championed what was then \n     called women's liberation and was one of the first to call \n     for the impeachment of President Richard M. Nixon. Long after \n     it ceased to be fashionable, she called her politics radical. \n     During her last campaign, for Congress in 1986, she told The \n     New York Times, ``I am not a centrist.''\n       Bella Abzug was a founding feminist, and an enduring one. \n     In the movement's giddy, sloganeering early days, Ms. Abzug \n     was, like Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem, an icon, the hat \n     bobbing before the cameras at marches and rallies.\n       After leaving the House in January 1977, she worked for \n     women's rights for two more decades. She founded an \n     international women's group that worked on environmental \n     issues. And she was a leader of a conference of nongovernment \n     organizations that paralleled the United Nations' fourth \n     World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995.\n       Even then, she continued to rankle. Former President George \n     Bush, on a private visit to China that coincided with the \n     Beijing conference, said to a meeting of food\n\n[[Page S3175]]\n\n     production executives: ``I feel somewhat sorry for the \n     Chinese, having Bella Abzug running around. Bella Abzug is \n     one who has always represented the extremes of the women's \n     movement.''\n       When told of Mr. Bush's remark, Ms. Abzug, 75, and in a \n     wheelchair, retorted: ``He was addressing a fertilizer group? \n     That's appropriate.''\n       Her forceful personality and direct manner made her a \n     lightning rod for criticism from those who opposed the idea \n     of holding a women's conference. After Bob Dole, then the \n     Senate majority leader, said he could not imagine why anyone \n     ``would want to attend a conference co-chaired by Bella \n     Abzug,'' she responded that she was not running the meeting \n     but simply participating with more than 30,000 other women \n     over how best to achieve equal rights.\n       But much of what Ms. Abzug agitated for--abortion rights, \n     day care, laws against employment discrimination--was by that \n     time mainstream political fare.\n       In Congress, ``she was first on almost everything, on \n     everything that ever mattered,'' said Esther Newberg, Ms. \n     Abzug's first administrative assistant and one of many staff \n     members who quit but remained devoted. ``She was first to \n     call for Richard Nixon's impeachment, first to call for an \n     end to the war.''\n       Ms. Abzug made enemies easily--``Sometimes the hat and the \n     mouth took over,'' Ms. Newberg said--but Ms. Abzug saw that \n     as a consequence of a refusal to compromise, as well as a \n     matter of sport. Of her time in the House, Ms. Abzug wrote in \n     a journal that was published in 1972 as ``Bella.'' ``I spend \n     all day figuring out how to beat the machine and knock the \n     crap out of the political power structure.''\n       She worked relentlessly at organizing and coalition-\n     building. A founder of Women Strike for Peace and the \n     National Women's Political Caucus, she spent a lifetime \n     prodding for change, with a lawyer's enthusiasm for political \n     channels, through organizations from the P.T.A. to the United \n     Nations.\n       She made friends easily, too. ``She's fierce and intense \n     and funny,'' said her longtime friend Gloria Steinem. ``She \n     takes everyone seriously. When she argues with you fiercely, \n     it's because she takes you seriously. And she's willing to \n     change her mind. That's so rare.''\n\n\n                  her first speech in a subway station\n\n       Bella Savitzky Abzug was born on July 24, 1920 in the \n     Bronx, the second daughter of Jewish immigrants from Russia. \n     Her father, Emanuel Savitzky, whom Ms. Abzug later described \n     as ``this humanist butcher,'' ran (and named) the Live and \n     Let Live Meat Market on Ninth Avenue in Manhattan.\n       She said she knew from the age of 11 that she wanted to be \n     a lawyer, and not longer afterward gave her first public \n     speech, in a subway station, while collection for a Zionist \n     youth organization. She went from Hunter College, where she \n     was student body president, to Columbia University Law \n     School, where she was an editor of The Law Review, to a \n     practice representing union workers.\n       Ms. Abzug traced the wearing of her trademark wide-brimmed \n     hats to those days. She once recalled: ``When I was a young \n     lawyer, I would go to people's offices and they would always \n     say: `Sit here. We'll wait for the lawyer.' Working women \n     wore hats. It was the only way they would take you seriously.\n       ``After a while, I started liking them. When I got to \n     Congress, they made a big thing of it. So I was watching. Did \n     they want me to wear it or not? They didn't want me to wear \n     it, so I did.''\n       All the while, she was a leftist and an agitator. Years \n     later, in a moment of exasperation with her Congressional \n     aids, she wrote: ``I just don't understand young people \n     today, quite frankly. Our struggle was political, ideological \n     and economic, and we felt we couldn't make something of \n     ourselves unless we bettered society. We saw the two \n     together.''\n       In the 1950's, Ms. Abzug's law practice turned to other \n     cases identified with the left. One client was Willie McGee, \n     a black Mississippian convicted of raping a white woman and \n     sentenced to death. Ms. Abzug, who was pregnant at the time, \n     argued the case in Mississippi while white supremacist groups \n     threatened her. Though the Supreme Court stayed the execution \n     twice, Mr. McGee was eventually executed.\n       She also represented people accused of Communist activities \n     by Senator Joseph McCarthy's Congressional committee and its \n     counterpart in Albany.\n       In the 1960's, Ms. Abzug became an antiwar activist. A \n     founder of Women Strike for Peace, she was its chief \n     lobbyist, opposing nuclear testing and, later, the Vietnam \n     War. She organized insurgent Democrats into other groups, \n     too, becoming a leader of the movement against President \n     Lydon B. Johnson and prominent in the 1968 Presidential \n     campaign of Senator Eugene McCarthy.\n       During those years, Ms. Abzug started navigating New York \n     City politics. She and her husband, Martin Abzug, moved from \n     Mount Vernon, the Westchester suburb where they had raised \n     their two daughters, to a town house at 37 Bank Street in \n     Greenwich Village. In 1970, Ms. Abzug ran for Congress.\n       The 19th Congressional District, which snaked from lower \n     Manhattan to the West 80's, had four registered Democrats to \n     every Republican and had been represented in Congress for \n     seven terms by Leonard Farbstein, a solid but rather \n     somnolent liberal. Ms. Abzug won the Democratic primary with \n     54 percent of the vote.\n\n\n                   campaign became a women's crusade\n\n       At this point, Bella Abzug became national news, a flash of \n     local color in a political year. She seemed to be everywhere, \n     clapping backs and jabbing biceps. Her campaign headquarters \n     next to the Lion's Head, a writers' and journalists' bar in \n     Greenwich Village, was also a daycare center for her legions \n     of female volunteers. The women's crusade she led brought \n     considerable, if sometimes derisive, attention.\n       Though she eventually took 55 percent of the vote, she had \n     genuine Republican opposition, unusual in an era when New \n     Yorks' main political action consisted of various Democratic \n     factions knifing one another. The Republican-Liberal \n     candidate way Barry Farber, a well-known radio talk show \n     host. Mr. Farber drew many Democrats who resented Mr. \n     Farbstein's humiliation or were simply put off by Ms. Abzug's \n     style.\n       To her chagrin, Mr. Farber accused Ms. Abzug, who advocated \n     direct negotiations between Israelis and Arabs, of flagging \n     in her support of Israel. For years after that, she made a \n     point of stating her Jewish credentials, dating to childhood: \n     her family was religious and she went regularly to synagogue \n     (though she was bother that women were relegated to the back \n     rows of the balcony), studied Hebrew and was enrolled for a \n     time at the Jewish Theological Seminary.\n\n\n                   setting her sights on the pentagon\n\n       When Ms. Abzug went to Washington, she set her sights on a \n     appointment to the House Armed Services Committee. She wanted \n     a resolution calling for an immediate withdrawal from Vietnam \n     and she vowed to take on the military-industrial complex. She \n     wanted an end to the draft. She wanted national health \n     insurance, legislation to finance day-care centers and \n     housing, and more money for New York City, all to be paid for \n     with billions siphoned from the Pentagon's budget.\n       She got little of this, but during the next six years ``she \n     was indefatigable,' Ms. Newberg recalled.\n       ``She yelled a lot,'' Ms. Newberg said, ``only because she \n     couldn't get everything done.'' And if she couldn't, she \n     added, ti was partly because ``her agenda was too pure for \n     her moment in time.''\n       Ms. Abzug became expert at parliamentary rules, worked them \n     skillfully and was famously well prepared for every vote, \n     hearing and committee spat. The ``sunshine law'' requiring \n     governing bodies to meet publicly came out of a subcommittee \n     she headed. She coaxed funds for New York from the Public \n     Works Committee. She was a sponsor of the women's equal \n     rights amendment.\n       ``She was one of the most exciting, enlightened legislators \n     that ever served in the Congress,'' said Representative \n     Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, with whom Ms. Abzug sometimes \n     collaborated and sometimes sparred.\n       From her first day on Capitol Hill, to the day she dismayed \n     her colleagues by introducing her Vietnam resolution, Ms. \n     Abzug derided the Congressional club, the seniority system, \n     the log-rolling and back-scratch. She did not spare fellow \n     Democrats; when she spoke of liberals, it was usually \n     dismissively. She badgered the House leadership over \n     committee appointments and votes.\n       She badgered the President, too. Invited to a reception at \n     Richard Nixon's White House, she accepted (while writing in \n     her journal, ``Who wants to listen to his pious idiocies?''), \n     then told Nixon in the receiving line that her constituents \n     demanded a withdrawal from Vietnam.\n       For all of her railing against Democrats who went along to \n     get along, Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill named her one of his \n     dozen assistant whips, and by most accounts she worked well \n     with some of the crustiest fixtures in the House.\n       Still, in 1972 Ralph Nader estimated that Ms. Abzug's \n     sponsorship of a measure often cost it 20 to 30 votes. Her \n     reputation as an irritant came from all quarters. Jimmy \n     Breslin wrote of a campaign worker who went to the Lion's \n     Head one night, holding his side and vowing never to work for \n     Ms. Abzug again. ``She punched me,'' he said, in a quarrel \n     over scheduling. The next day, Mr. Breslin wrote, Ms. Abzug \n     called the aid. ``Michael, I called to apologize,'' she said. \n     ``How's your kidney?''\n       Mr. Breslin also recounted the Congresswoman's introduction \n     to Sol Linowitz, the former chairman of the Xerox Corporation \n     and a Democratic Party luminary: ``Are you the man that used \n     to be the head of the Xerox?'' Ms. Abzug asked. ``That's \n     right,'' Mr. Linowitz replied. ``I'm glad to meet a big \n     shot,'' Ms. Abzug said. ``I'm in hock $35,000 on my \n     campaign.''\n       Ms. Abzug acknowledged loneliness in her years in Congress. \n     ``Outside of Martin and the kids, I don't feel very related \n     to most people at this point,'' she wrote in 1971. ``I feel \n     detached in social situations. I'm always thinking about \n     other things, about Congress, about the issues, about the \n     political coalition I'm trying to organize. It never leaves \n     me. I even have trouble relating to some of my closest \n     friends, though God knows I still love them, even if they \n     don't know it.''\n       Always, she returned to Manhattan to spend weekends with \n     her husband.\n       She had married Martin Abzug in 1944. The two New Yorkers \n     met on a bus in Miami, on the way to a Yehudi Menuhin \n     concern. Mr. Abzug, a stockbroker and an author of two \n     published novels, had next to no interest in\n\n[[Page S3176]]\n\n     politics. In an interview in 1970, he murmured, while his \n     wife was out of the room, ``The political bug is a curious \n     bug.'' But he was also, she said, her best friend and \n     supporter, and ``one of the few unneurotic people left in \n     society.''\n\n\n                  corrosive ambition hampers a career\n\n       Ms. Abzug's own ambition was too corrosive for many people, \n     even--or, perhaps, especially--for her fellow New York \n     Democrats. When the State Legislature sliced up her district \n     in 1972, they urged her to challenge one of the two \n     conservative incumbent Democrats in adjoining districts, \n     Representative John J. Rooney or Representative John M. \n     Murphy. Instead, she opposed a liberal Democrat, William \n     Fitts Ryan, in the 20th District, encompassing the Upper \n     West Side and the Riverdale section of the Bronx.\n       The primary was bitter and, eventually, politically \n     expensive to Ms. Abzug. Bill Ryan was one of the earliest \n     heroes of the city's insurgent Democrats, an early opponent \n     of the Vietnam War and a genuinely well-liked man who, as \n     many of his constituents knew, was waging a gallant fight \n     against cancer.\n       Mr. Ryan defeated Ms. Abzug in the Democratic primary but \n     died before the general election. The Democratic County \n     Committee appointed Ms. Abzug as the candidate to replace \n     him, but she was challenged by Mr. Ryan's widow, Priscilla, \n     who ran on the Liberal line. Ms. Abzug won in November, but \n     she had made dedicated enemies who believed she was an overly \n     aggressive politician who would not hesitate to attack anyone \n     who got in her way. Ten years later, she was denied a seat in \n     the state's delegation to the national party's biannual \n     conference because New York leaders considered her \n     disruptive.\n       In 1976, she gave up her House seat to run for the Senate. \n     She lost in the primary, to Daniel Patrick Moynihan, by a \n     margin of only 1 percent. Two more campaigns quickly \n     followed. (In a 1978 interview, she said: ``I'm a politician. \n     I run for office, That's my profession.'') She lost to Edward \n     I. Koch in a crowded mayoral primary in 1977. The next year, \n     running for the House again, she lost, again by 1 percent, to \n     a little-known Republican, S. William Green.\n       She was appointed co-chairwoman of President Jimmy Carter's \n     National Advisory Committee on Women, and then after \n     disagreeing with him over economic policy, was dismissed. The \n     majority of the committee members resigned in protest. Ms. \n     Abzug, unapologetic, said with a shrug, ``I've got to find \n     myself another big, nonpaying job.''\n       Her next and last campaign was in 1986, this time for a \n     House seat in Westchester County. She won the primary in a \n     burst of the old, ebullient campaigning style, but lost in \n     November to Joseph J. DioGuardi, the Republican incumbent.\n       It was during that campaign that Martin Abzug died. Her \n     friends said Ms. Abzug never recovered. Nine years later, she \n     said in an interview, ``I haven't been entirely the same \n     since.''\n       There was one more bid for office for her old house seat on \n     the Upper West Side, when she announced her candidacy to \n     replace Representative Ted Weiss on his death just before the \n     1992 election. But she was quickly eliminated from the field \n     at the party convention.\n       During the next decade, Ms. Abzug suffered from ill health, \n     including breast cancer, but continued to practice law and \n     work for women's groups. She wrote a book, ``Gender Gap,'' \n     with her old friend Mim Kelber. She started a lobbying group \n     called Women U.S.A. and founded the Women's Environment and \n     Development Organization, a nonprofit group that works with \n     international agencies.\n       In addition to her daughters, Eve and Liz, Ms. Abzug is \n     survived by her sister, Helene Alexander of Great Neck, N.Y.\n       ``I've been described as a tough and noisy woman, a \n     prizefighter, a man hater, you name it.'' Ms. Abzug said of \n     herself in ``Bella.'' ``they call me Battling Bella, Mother \n     Courage and a Jewish mother with more complaints than \n     Portnoy.''\n       ``There are those who say I'm impatient, impetuous, uppity, \n     rude, profane, brash and overbearing. Whether I'm any of \n     these things or all of them, you can decide for yourself. But \n     whatever I am--and this ought to be made very clear at the \n     outset--I am a very serious woman.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/02/senate-section/article/S3174-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RETIREMENT OF NORTHAMPTON CITY TREASURER, MS. SHIRLEY LaROSE\n\n Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today, to pay tribute to \nMs. Shirley LaRose, a dedicated public servant who has devoted more \nthan forty-three years of her life to the residents of Northampton, \nMassachusetts. The city treasurer's office, which has been brightened \nby her infectious smile and delightful manner, will soon bid farewell \nto this outstanding woman. She is trading in her balance sheets to \nenjoy the splendors of a well-deserved retirement.\n  It is my understanding that Ms. LaRose began her career in the office \nof the Northampton city treasurer in 1954 as a clerk. In the years to \nfollow, she was promoted from junior to senior clerk, and then became \nassistant treasurer. She became treasurer of Northampton in 1972 and \nhas run unopposed for the position in every single election since the \nprimary in 1973. Not only is this stellar record a reflection of her \ncompetent handling of the city's financial needs, but also of the \nrespect she earned from the people of Northampton.\n  During her years of overseeing the receipt and distribution of city \nfunds as well as the salaries, life insurance, and retirement policies \nof its employees, I have been told that Ms. LaRose touched the lives of \ncountless people. She served her community with deep integrity, and her \ncontributions to its prosperity are remarkable. I stand today to thank \nShirley for her years of service to Northampton and to wish her well in \nher retirement. Her loyalty and accomplishments will not soon be \nforgotten by the grateful citizens of Northampton.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/02/senate-section/article/S3176-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3176-S3177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF JAMES HORMEL\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I wish to speak today regarding the \nnomination of James Hormel of California to be the U.S. Ambassador to \nLuxembourg.\n  Last fall, after President Clinton nominated Jim Hormel to serve as \nour nation's next Ambassador to Luxembourg, the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, on November 4, reported the nomination favorably by a vote \nof 16 to 2 and sent the nomination to the full Senate for \nconsideration. During the course of this business meeting, no member of \nthe Committee spoke in opposition to the nomination.\n  The problem is that the Senate has not been able to consider this \nnomination because some of our colleagues have put ``holds'' on it. \nBefore adjourning last year, the Senate confirmed some 50 nominees, \nwhose nominations had been approved by the Foreign Relations Committee. \nThe only nomination that languished was that of Jim Hormel and the \nreason for this is very obvious. Some of my colleagues oppose this \nnomination because Jim Hormel is openly gay. That means, in their view, \nthat he is not fit to represent his country overseas in Luxembourg.\n  It doesn't matter that government officials in Luxembourg have been \neager to support this nominee. It doesn't matter, apparently, that in \nhis correspondence with our colleague Senator Smith from Oregon, Jim \nHormel went on the record--in unprecedented fashion--in saying that he \nwould not use his position as Ambassador to push any personal agenda, \nthat his partner would not travel with him to Luxembourg, and his \npublic positions would be those of the United States government only. \nAll that matters, I suspect, for some members of this Senate, is that \nJim Hormel is gay, that the most private and intimate elements of his \nlifestyle disqualify him from public service.\n  Mr. President, the issue is not and should not be Mr. Hormel's sexual \norientation. The only relevant question here is whether he is qualified \nto undertake the position for which he has been nominated. The answer \nto that is ``yes''.\n  He has impressive academic credentials, having received his \nundergraduate degree from Swarthmore College and his J.D. from the \nUniversity of Chicago. He has served as Assistant Dean and Dean of \nstudents at the University of Chicago. He currently sits on the board \nof managers of Swarthmore.\n  Jim Hormel is a loving father and grandfather, a businessman who ran \na successful company for years, and a philanthropist who has supported, \nin his words but most importantly in his deeds, some of the most \nimportant causes facing this country. Outside the beltway, there's a \nchorus of very public support for this nominee. Those who care about \nautism, breast cancer research, AIDS research, religious diversity and \nhuman rights--they've all rallied together behind this nominee. The \nEpiscopalian Archdiocese of California has called Jim Hormel ``an \nexemplary representative of the United States of America.'' Leaders \nfrom the business world, from the universities, and from diplomatic \ncircles, including, I might add, former Secretary of State George \nSchultz, have stated publicly that James Hormel's public character and \nintellect make him an exceptionally strong nominee.\n  This is not the first time that Jim Hormel has been asked to serve \nhis\n\n[[Page S3177]]\n\ncountry. In 1995 he was a member of the U.S. delegation to the 51st \nU.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva. Last year he was nominated to \nserve an alternative representative of the U.S. delegation to the 51st \nU.N. General Assembly--a position subject to confirmation by the \nSenate. I want to remind my colleagues that no objection was raised to \nhis nomination for this position, and the Senate confirmed him \nunanimously on May 23, 1997. In the final analysis, we've all got to \nmake our private decisions about what we find acceptable, about which \npersonal values we embrace. However, this Senator does not believe that \nprivate considerations should be used to deny an individual the right \nto hold a job for which he is qualified or to deny the full Senate its \nright to exercise its constitutional responsibility to act on a \nnomination. Those Senators standing in the way of this nomination \nshould remove their ``holds'' and let the Senate work its will.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/02/senate-section/article/S3176-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            PRAYER WARRIORS\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I was moved to find that more \nthan 800 members of the D.C. community gathered together yesterday to \npray for the District's public schools. The Rhema Christian Center \nChurch invited people of all faiths to join them and pray for 25 school \nimprovements which ranged from increased parental involvement to better \nsafety.\n  They call themselves prayer warriors. They were each assigned to one \nof the District's 146 schools for the ``Jesus Goes to School Day of \nPrayer.'' As the children of D.C. walked into school--outside the \nprayer warriors prayed.\n  Many of these children walk through dangerous neighborhoods--where \ndrug deals and violence are common--on their way to school every day. \nThese children begin their school day with negative images. Yesterday, \nhowever, was different. Yesterday, the children of D.C. began their \nschool day with a strong, positive message of prayer and support from \ntheir community.\n  The prayer warriors said ``We have tried everything else as a nation \nto save public education. Now, let's try prayer.'' Mr. President, we \nshould recognize and affirm the example these prayer warriors have set \nin the nation's Capitol.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/02/senate-section/article/S3177-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SHEBOYGAN SELECTED TO LAUNCH CAMPAIGN AGAINST YOUTH INACTIVITY\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the City of \nSheboygan, Wisconsin for being selected by the National Sporting Goods \nAssociation to launch the Wannabe Cool, Gottabe Active Campaign. The \ncampaign, which targets students in grades 3-8, is designed to inspire \nconfidence in one's abilities and to spur a lifetime dedication to \nphysical and mental wellness. We must recognize the importance of \nprograms like this which give children options that empower them to \nlead healthy lives.\n  Mr. President, this is especially important when we consider that we \nare witnessing a decrease in activity among our nation's youth. Today, \nonly 22 percent of our children are physically active for the \nrecommended 30 minutes each day. Physical education classes are on the \ndecline with three out of four students in America not attending daily \nphysical education classes and one out of four not attending any \nphysical education classes in their schools--this represents a drop of \nalmost 20 percent in just four years. These are frightening statistics \nand we need to reverse this trend.\n  The Wannabe Cool, Gottabe Active Campaign is a good start. There are \nseveral things I like about the program. First, the campaign targets \nthe right age group, because we know that a commitment to physical \nactivity is formed between the ages of eight and twelve. I am also \nimpressed that the campaign involves a cooperative effort: parents, \nstudents, teachers, and community leaders all working together. \nFinally, the Wanna be Cool, Gotta be Active Campaign is designed to \nencourage all youth, not just those who are athletically inclined to \nparticipate and develop long-term enjoyment of physical activity. This \nis a serious issue which demands our attention.\n  Mr. President, I would like to once again extend my congratulations \nto the wonderful city of Sheboygan, Wisconsin for being selected to \nkick off the campaign. I'm sure that everyone involved will benefit \nfrom this very worthwhile venture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/02/senate-section/article/S3177-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3177-S3178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SATELLITE REFORM\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, during the final days of the first \nsession of the 105th Congress, I announced that I would engage in an \neffort to eliminate outdated regulations and foster competition in the \nglobal satellite market. Since that time, I have held several meetings \nwith representatives from the industry. In addition, my staff has \nconducted a series of open briefings with the various parties currently \ncompeting in the market, as well as representatives from the White \nHouse, the State Department and the International Bureau of the Federal \nCommunications Commission. These meetings have recently concluded, and \nI now plan to move forward legislatively on this critical issue.\n  The international satellite market is poised for phenomenal growth as \nit looks to the 21st century. A mere 10 years ago there was only one \nservice in place: Intelsat. Today a breathtaking array of services are \neither already in existence or planned to be launched in the near \nfuture. With this rapid transformation, it becomes clear that one day \npeople everywhere from Bozeman, Montana, to Beijing, China, will send \nand receive telephone, video and data transmissions via satellite. The \nfuture of satellite communications is a future where opportunities are \nno longer limited by geography.\n  Unfortunately, while the industry hopes to reach a new orbit, U.S. \npolicy in this area is still being left on the launching pad. Not since \nRonald Reagan deregulated the satellite market in 1984 have we taken \nsteps to bring our policy more in line with the competitive pressures \nof today. As a result, many consumers both here and abroad have not \nbeen able to benefit from the increase in services or the lowering of \nprices that have resulted from President Reagan's vision.\n  This is why I am going to use the upcoming recess to begin putting \ntogether a bill that will move U.S. satellite policy from the Stone Age \nto the Space Age. I intend to incorporate the views of all interested \nparties and I urge my colleagues to come to me with their ideas. I \nexpect to have a bill completed and ready for introduction when we \nreturn later this month. I will hold a hearing in the Communications \nSubcommittee on the bill shortly after the Senate returns from the \nEaster recess. While I had originally planned to hold the hearing on \nApril 22, I am moving the hearing date to April 29 to ensure that \nmembers have adequate time to give their insights and suggestions on \nthis most important issue.\n  As I indicated when I first took on this issue, there will be several \nprinciples that will help guide me along the way. Competition, \nderegulation, privatization and competitive neutrality are all \nprinciples that have helped drive past industries toward success. While \nthe global satellite industry is somewhat different because we are \ndealing with sovereign nations around the world, there is no reason \nthat the United States cannot take a strong position and lead by \nexample. It was our leadership under the 1962 Satellite Act that gave \nthis industry its beginning and it can be our leadership today that \nbrings the industry firmly into the 21st century. In fact, Mr. \nPresident, we recently witnessed such U.S. leadership. Last week, the \nIntelsat assembly of parties approved the creation of a spinoff \ncompany. This effort was achieved through the hard work of the U.S. \ndelegation and the 141 member nations of Intelsat. I believe this is a \npositive first step on the path to bringing boundless opportunities to \nfolks all over the globe.\n  I hope that all of my colleagues will join me in crafting legislation \nwith the ultimate goal of encouraging competition in this industry. The \nrapid changes in technology and consumer behavior dictate that we act \nexpeditiously. Market forces simply will not wait. I intend to work \nclosely with my colleagues on the Commerce Committee to make sure that \nconsumer interests are protected as we move forward on this vital \nissue.\n\n[[Page S3178]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/02/senate-section/article/S3177-3", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3177-S3178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SATELLITE REFORM\n\n Mr. BURNS.

It was our leadership under the 1962 Satellite Act that gave \nthis industry its beginning and it can be our leadership today that \nbrings the industry firmly into the 21st century. In fact, Mr. \nPresident, we recently witnessed such U.S. leadership. Last week, the \nIntelsat assembly of parties approved the creation of a spinoff \ncompany. This effort was achieved through the hard work of the U.S. \ndelegation and the 141 member nations of Intelsat. I believe this is a \npositive first step on the path to bringing boundless opportunities to \nfolks all over the globe.\n  I hope that all of my colleagues will join me in crafting legislation \nwith the ultimate goal of encouraging competition in this industry. The \nrapid changes in technology and consumer behavior dictate that we act \nexpeditiously. Market forces simply will not wait. I intend to work \nclosely with my colleagues on the Commerce Committee to make sure that \nconsumer interests are protected as we move forward on this vital \nissue.\n\n[[Page S3178]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/02/senate-section/article/S3177-3", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING THE 1997 WATERTOWN FLOOD\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity \ntoday to recognize the one year anniversary of one of the worst natural \ndisasters to hit Watertown, South Dakota, and the amazing fact that, \nonly one year later, Watertown continues to grow and prosper.\n  Referred to by South Dakotans simply as ``the flood,'' the events \nsurrounding April 5 and 6, 1997, had the potential to cripple one of \nthe state's fastest growing cities. Instead, battling rising waters and \na late season snowstorm, the residents of Watertown, South Dakota, \novercame adversity and forged a true community, defined by selfless \nacts of caring, cooperation, and good will.\n  Few South Dakotans will forget the winter and spring preceding the \nApril floods. Snowdrifts as high as buildings, roads with only one lane \ncleared, homes without heat for days, hundreds of thousands of dead \nlivestock, and schools closed for a week at a time were commonplace. As \nif surviving the severe winter cold was not challenge enough, residents \nof Watertown could hardly imagine the extent of damage Mother Nature \nhad yet to inflict with a 500-year flood.\n  Watertown residents could sense the impending flood. The first snow \nof the season fell in October, and six consecutive months of record-\nbreaking snowfall covered ground that was already saturated from years \nof unusually wet winters. As the first warm days of spring slowly \nmelted layers of the snowpack, Watertown residents began planning for \nflooding. Sandbags and earthen berms ringed Lake Kampeska and the Big \nSioux River. However, despite careful planning, on April 5, an \nunexpected blizzard hit the state, devastating the area. Everything \nfroze, creating further concerns about what was going to happen once \nthe water began flowing again.\n  The unusual weather mix caused water levels to surge in a few hours. \nRecord levels on the Big Sioux River and Lake Kampeska forced over \n5,000 residents of Watertown, or one-fourth the city's population, to \nevacuate their homes. Over one-third of the city was without sewer and \nwater for three weeks. The headline of the Watertown Public Opinion on \nApril 6 read ``Watertown in Peril,'' and I will never forget the image \nof homeowners and neighbors, shrouded in a late-season snow storm, \nsandbagging against the rising waters of the Big Sioux River and Lake \nKampeska.\n  A number of individuals and organizations in Watertown are \nresponsible for the amazing fact that, despite causing millions of \ndollars of damage to property, the 1997 flood failed to claim any \nlives. The work of Mayor Brenda Barger and other community leaders held \nWatertown together with their strength and direction. The city's ad-hoc \ncrisis center brought together local and county officials, volunteer \nagencies including the Red Cross, Salvation Army, Lutheran Social \nServices, and others, to brainstorm and compile ``resource lists'' of \nexpected needs including equipment, people, and funds.\n  Local volunteers, students, prisoners, and National Guard personnel \nwere recruited to first fight the rising waters with sandbags and then \nhelp clean-up as the waters receded. In the following days, over 750 \nport-a-potties were deployed on the lawns of those families who could \nreturn to their homes. Water trucks were brought in to provide people \nwith a fresh water supply, and repairs to the damaged water treatment \nplant were completed ahead of schedule.\n  While those of us from South Dakota will never forget the destruction \nwrought by ``the flood,'' I was heartened to witness first-hand and \nhear accounts of individuals coming together in Watertown to protect \nhomes, farms, and lives from rising flood waters.\n  Mr. President, April 6 marks the one year anniversary of this \nterrible natural disaster in Watertown. However, residents of Watertown \nshould look back on April 6, 1997, and be proud of the way they and \ntheir neighbors came together and worked side by side to see their \ncommunity survive. It is this community spirit and pride that will \ncontinue to make Watertown ``South Dakota's Rising Star.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/02/senate-section/article/S3178-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO THE VERMONT STATE HOUSING AUTHORITY FOR 20 YEARS OF SERVICE\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nVermont State Housing Authority on its 20th Anniversary of providing \nVermonters with access to affordable housing.\n  On March 23, 1968, the Vermont State Housing Authority (VSHA), the \nnation's first statewide housing authority, was established to ensure \nthat Vermonters have access to affordable housing. Over many years of \ninitiative, dedication, and innovation, the VSHA has aggressively and \ncompassionately pursued opportunities to make housing more accessible \nand affordable for Vermont's neediest families. I celebrate and extend \nmy congratulations to VSHA.\n  As a Senator, my highest priorities focus on the essentials for each \ncitizen--economic security, quality education, health care, and \nmeaningful work. We all know that a home is a critical foundation for a \nsuccessful journey through life. Every year VSHA helps Vermonters build \nthis foundation by providing housing services that reach more than \n5,300 families. From mobile home park residents to senior citizens, \nVSHA serves a wide range of clients.\n  Over the years, VSHA has emphasized neighborhood reinvestment \ninitiatives that provide essential supports needed to shape healthy, \nsafe communities so its residents can thrive. The professionalism, \nreliability, and accomplishments of the staff at VSHA are unsurpassed. \nAware of the needs and hopes of Vermonters, the VSHA staff work \ntirelessly to preserve and create hopeful environments for Vermonters.\n  Mr. President, I commend the Vermont State Housing Authority for its \noutstanding contribution and dedication to improving the quality of \nlife for Vermonters. I am both proud and honored to represent such an \naccomplished group of individuals here in Washington as they are a \nnational model for how to provide affordable, quality housing \nopportunities for those in need.\n  I express my sincerest thanks for VSHA's 20 years of commitment to \nVermont and her people. Their continued leadership and drive will \ncontinue to ensure that every Vermonter has a place to call \nhome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/02/senate-section/article/S3178-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3178-S3179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n VIETNAM VETERANS OF AMERICA CHAPTER 1: TWENTY YEARS OF SERVICE TO THE \n                                 NATION\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Vietnam \nVeterans of America for 20 years of service to veterans and their \ncommunities. In particular, I want to recognize the first chapter of \nthe VVA, which was founded in Rutland, Vermont.\n  If we remember back to the late 1970s, our nation was dealing with \nthe aftermath of a war in which more than 58,000 Americans lost their \nlives and 2.8 million veterans had served. Many of those veterans were \nstruggling with physical, emotional, and social problems directly \nrelated to their service in Vietnam.\n  Those problems were worsened by the attitude of many Americans who \ncould not separate their opposition to the war from their treatment of \nour soldiers who had fought it. It was in that spirit that a group of \nVietnam veterans from Vermont approached a resourceful young veteran \nnamed Bobby Muller. I am proud to say that Bobby Muller has become a \nclose friend of mine and in fact was in Vermont with me just last week. \nThe Vermonters, led by Donny Beaudette and Jake Jacobsen, founded the \nfirst chapter of what is now the Vietnam Veterans of America. I \nremember it well. They were soon joined by other Vermonters like Clark \nHowland, Mike Dodge, John Bergeron, and others. Together, Chapter One \nmade it their mission to be there for Vermont Vietnam veterans and \nindeed all veterans.\n  In the twenty years since then, Chapter One has accomplished that \nmission, and in the process they have improved the whole Rutland \ncommunity. They have not only offered assistance to fellow veterans, \nthey have saved the lives of countless troubled veterans who had no \nwhere else to turn. Chapter One is responsible for the Dodge \nDevelopment Center, a veterans center and shelter for homeless veterans \nwhich I have\n\n[[Page S3179]]\n\nbeen proud to support. Members participate in the annual Rutland \nLoyalty Day Parade, Memorial Day and Veterans Day and annual POW/MIA \nDay ceremonies. Chapter One has also initiated an ``Honor the Vet \nProgram'' with area businesses. Under this program, local businesses \nagree to provide a discount to any veteran with a veteran organization \nmembership card.\n  In short, Mr. President, VVA Chapter One honors Vermont, just as its \nveterans honored us with their service in Vietnam. There are now four \nchapters carrying on the VVA tradition in Vermont. Besides Chapter One \nin Rutland, there is now chapter Chapter 601 in Bennington, Chapter 723 \nin Chester and Chapter 753 in St. Albans.\n  I thank them for all they have done and I wish them the best on this \nlandmark occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/02/senate-section/article/S3178-3", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3179-S3180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     ASSESSMENT OF CUBAN THREAT TO UNITED STATES NATIONAL SECURITY\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the 1998 Defense Authorization Bill \ncontains a provision, which I introduced as an amendment, that requires \nthe Secretary of Defense to conduct an assessment of the Cuban threat \nto United States national security. The bill requires the Secretary to \nreport to Congress on this assessment by March 31, 1998. The report has \nbeen delayed, and it now appears that the report will be released after \nCongress begins the Easter recess.\n  While the final report has not been released and no member of \nCongress has yet been briefed on its content, a draft report was leaked \nto the press and several articles have appeared over the past few days. \nI am concerned that this information was leaked to the press before the \nreport was provided to Congress.\n  Members of Congress are now in the position of having to respond to \nthese press reports without the benefit of knowing the actual contents \nof the report. Since Congress will not be in session for over two weeks \nand our ability to respond to the report will be limited, I would like \nto take this opportunity to provide some context for the report and for \nthe reason that I requested it.\n  Cuba, under Fidel Castro's dictatorial regime, has a well documented \nhistory of threatening the national security of the United States. From \nthe Cuban Missile Crisis, to the Mariel Boatlift, to the Brothers to \nthe Rescue shootdown, the pattern of provocation and threat to the well \nbeing of Americans is clear. Unfortunately what is also clear is a \npattern of unpreparedness on the part of the United States to respond \nto Cuban provocations. In fact, NBC News reported that President \nClinton was constrained in responding to the Brothers to the Rescue \nshootdown because of a fear of Cuban counterattacks.\n  It was my intention that this report would force the Defense \nDepartment to assess Cuban capabilities to threaten the United States \nand, since Castro has a long record of using his capability against the \nUnited States, prepare contingency plans to respond to any threat from \nCuba. We should not be caught off guard, unable to respond again.\n  Press reports that the Department of Defense assessment finds no \nnational security threat from Cuba are very troubling. Just two years \nago, Cuban Air Force MiGs shot down two unarmed civilian aircraft over \ninternational waters, killing three United States citizens. Although \nU.S. forces monitored the entire event, no U.S. forces were able to \nrespond. Our advanced fighter aircraft never got off the ground.\n  Equally as troubling as this type of conventional threat are the non-\ntraditional threats posed by Cuba. Biological and chemical weapons, \nintelligence collection activities, immigration crises, drug \ntrafficking, and dangerous nuclear and information warfare programs all \npose national security threats to the United States.\n\n  At the same time, U.S. capability to deal with these threats \ncontinues to erode. A series of base closure decisions have reduced \ncapability in the areas that provide the most direct capacity to \nrespond to Cuban provocations. With the realignment of Homestead Air \nForce Base and Key West Naval Air Station, we are in a worse posture \nthan in 1996 when the shootdown occurred.\n  Mr. President, let me mention a few of the known Cuban capabilities \nthat cannot be overlooked. First, a significant conventional military \ncapability exists that can harm United States interests, as \ndemonstrated by the 1996 shootdown. In addition, Jane's Defense Weekly \nreported last summer that Castro is training elite special force units \nin Vietnam which are prepared to attack U.S. military targets during a \nfinal confrontation. NBC News reported in 1995 that Cuba has operated a \nspecial military training school since the mid-1980's named the Baragua \nSchool in Los Palacios, Pinar del Rio, in a region known as El Cacho. \nIt reportedly trains some 2,500 men and specializes in commando attacks \nand infiltration of other countries.\n  Castro's capability to produce weapons of mass destruction is even \nmore worrisome, particularly his ability to produce biological weapons. \nThere is no question that the capability exists. Cuba has a developed \npharmaceutical industry and a network of biological ``institutes'' \nwhich could be used for more than simply scientific research. Many of \nCuba's engineers and scientists have been trained in former-communist \ncountries such as East Germany and Russia and have ample training to \ncultivate biological weapons. Biological weapons are the easiest to \nconceal and acquire because of the dual-use nature of the technology.\n  Another major threat to U.S. national security is the intelligence \ncollection facilities in Cuba that can intercept all electronic \ntransmissions, emanating from the east coast of the United States. The \n28 acre Russian intelligence facility at Lourdes has two electronic \nsatellite dishes aimed at the United States which can intercept phone \ncalls, faxes, and computer data from the entire Eastern seaboard. \nRussia and Cuba renegotiated a $200 million annual lease for the site \nin 1995. According to U.S. intelligence analysts, one dish listens in \non general U.S. communications, the other is used for targeted \neavesdropping. The facility employs 800 Russian technicians and \nlinguists. An example of the danger this facility poses to U.S. \nnational security is the fact that during the Gulf War, the station's \nspecialists intercepted the details of the U.S. military battle plans \nand were prepared to disclose these plans to Iraq and other U.S. \nenemies.\n  The Russians have spent nearly $3 billion on Lourdes and sources say \nthat the Russians are upgrading its reach. In addition, the operation \nat Lourdes is extremely sophisticated. According to U.S. intelligence \nsources, the Russians program the computers at Lourdes to listen for \nspecific phone numbers. When they detect those lines are in use, the \ncomputers automatically record the conversations or transmissions. For \npriority targets, an alarm signals a Russian linguist who will actually \nlisten in.\n  The Castro regime has also used mass migration as a policy tool. \nThere have been two major refugee crises which have posed a security \nthreat to the U.S. In 1980, 125,000 Cubans came to the U.S. in the \n``Mariel Boatlift.'' In 1994, another 32,000 Cubans left Cuba by boat \nand were picked up at sea by the U.S. Coast Guard. In the Mariel \ncrisis, the Cuban government encouraged criminals and mental patients \nto leave, causing additional security problems for the United States.\n\n  The problem of dealing with a large influx of refugees, whether \ncriminal or not, gives Castro a weapon he can use to threaten the \nUnited States. Mass immigration represents a form of leverage Castro \ncan use to extract concessions from the U.S. on a number of issues.\n  Cuba also has a dormant nuclear capability that can threaten the \nUnited States. Sergei Shoigu, Minister of Emergency Situations in \nRussia, has recently confirmed that Russia and Cuba will forge ahead to \nfinish constructing the Juragua nuclear plant on Cuba's south coast. \nThe Juragua facility is known to be unsafe in both construction and \ndesign. A nuclear accident at Juragua would send a radioactive cloud \nover the lower tier of the U.S. to Texas or up to the East Coast to \nWashington, D.C. within the first four days, depending on the season \nand prevailing winds. According to a National Oceanographic and \nAtmosphere Administration study, an estimated 50-80 million Americans \nfrom Florida to\n\n[[Page S3180]]\n\nTexas could be exposed to dangerous levels of radioactivity.\n  The U.S. State Department lists Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism. \nCuba also regularly conducts political, social, and economic \ninteractions with countries listed on the State Department's List of \nTerrorist Nations, including Libya, Iran, and Iraq, giving it access to \nthese countries' illegal supplies of weapons and biotech products. \nThese activities, all just 90 miles off our shores, must be considered \nas a threat to U.S. national security.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that Cuba has the capability to threaten \nU.S. national security. Castro's track record of provocations and \nattacks should be a warning that he will use whatever capabilities he \nhas. We must take these threats seriously and ensure that we can \nadequately respond to any Cuban provocation. The Constitution requires \nus to provide for the common defense of the American people, and we \nmust never shrink from that responsibility. The threats posed by \nCastro's Cuba are obvious. What must be made clear is an adequate plan \nto deter and defend against such threats.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/02/senate-section/article/S3179-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BOB BARKER\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man \nwho has brought joy and laughter to countless Americans during his \nnearly fifty years in entertainment, Bob Barker. Next week, Mr. Barker, \nwho is the host and executive producer of the legendary game show CBS' \n``The Price is Right,'' celebrates airing the 5,000th episode of his \nseries. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing his achievements.\n  In his 26th season, ``The Price is Right'' is the longest running \ngame show in American history and continues to be America's highest \nrated daytime game show. Beyond the fact that most Americans have \nwatched the show at some point in their lives, more than 42,000 people \nhave been contestants on the program, while an approximate 1.3 million \nhave participated in the studio audience. Both the show's spontaneity \nand Mr. Barker's effortless rapport with contestants have given ``The \nPrice is Right'' its unique popularity. Bob has repeatedly said over \nthe years, ``The Price is Right'' is not just a television show, it is \nan event. Today I commend Mr. Barker not only for reaching this \nimpressive milestone with the show, but also for his longstanding \nability to entertain the American people.\n  Mr. Barker was born in Darrington, Washington, and spent most of his \nyouth on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota where his \nmother was a school teacher. His family eventually moved to \nSpringfield, Missouri, where he attended high school and Drury college \non a basketball scholarship. When World War II intervened, he became a \nNavy fighter pilot, but the war ended before he was assigned to a \nseagoing squadron.\n  Following his discharge, Mr. Barker returned to Drury College and \ntook a job at a local radio station to help finance his studies. It was \nthere that he discovered that what he did best was to host audience \nparticipation shows. After graduating summa cum laude with a degree in \neconomics, he went to work for a radio station in Palm Beach, Florida. \nA year later he moved to Los Angeles, and within a week, he was the \nhost of his own radio program, ``The Bob Barker Show.''\n  Bob Barker's career was forever transformed in 1956 when he debuted \nas the host of the television show, ``Truth or Consequences.'' It was \nhis 3,524 consecutive performances on ``Truth or Consequences'' over \nits eighteen-year run that won him the title of ``Most Durable \nPerformer'' in the Guiness Book of World Records. During his forty-one \nyears on network television, he has taped more shows than any other \nindividual for a network series. Between ``Truth and Consequences,'' \n``The Price is Right,'' and his 21 years as host of both the Miss USA \nand Miss Universe pageants, he has hosted more than 8,500 shows in the \ncourse of his career. According to CBS, he has made more appearances on \ntelevision in general than anyone else in the entire history of the \nmedium. Bob has won 12 Emmy Awards, ten of which were for his \nperformances as a game show host and represent the largest number of \nEmmys given to a single television performer.\n  Bob is an outspoken and eloquent supporter of animal rights, and has \nconsistently used his celebrity to help to control the animal \npopulation, thereby reducing the number of needless animal deaths. Each \nday he closes ``The Price is Right'' with a reminder to spay and neuter \nyour pets. He has established the DJ Foundation to provide funding \nfor free spay and neuter clinics across the nation. In recognition of \nhis efforts, he received the International Society for Animal Rights' \nhighest honor, the Henry Salt Award, in 1995.\n  Therefore, as Mr. Barker commemorates the 5,000th episode of ``The \nPrice is Right,'' I thank him for his special lighthearted touch. As he \ntold the Los Angeles Times in 1996, ``We don't solve the world's \nproblems. But hopefully we help a lot of people to forget their \nproblems for an hour * * * We're there to entertain, laugh, and have \nfun.'' On behalf of the people of the state of California, I \ncongratulate you, Bob, and thank you for entertaining us and making us \nlaugh.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/02/senate-section/article/S3180-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY--TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 105-40\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

I rise in support of No. 555 on the Executive Calendar, \nthe nomination of Kermit Lipez, of Maine, to the first circuit.\n   Mr. President, it is an honor and a pleasure to rise to speak in \nsupport of the nomination of Justice Kermit Lipez to serve on the First \nCircuit Court of Appeals.\n  Having spent the past 12 years as a member of the Maine judiciary, \nJustice Lipez is a highly respected jurist. With experience at both the \ntrial and appellate court levels, it is fair to say that he has been \ntested for the position for which he has now been nominated and that he \nhas passed that test with flying colors.\n  Justice Lipez is universally praised in Maine for his judicial \ntemperament, his sense of fairness, and his intellectual capabilities. \nHis demeanor is consistently that of a gentleman, treating witnesses, \njurors, attorneys, and spectators with great respect, and ensuring that \nothers follow his example. He makes the courtroom a far less \nintimidating place for the average person.\n  Justice Lipez's reputation for impartiality is reflected in the high \nregard in which he is held by all segments of the bar. Indeed, people \nwho agree on little else agree on his sense of fairness. He was \nappointed to the Maine Superior Court by a Democratic Governor, he was \nappointed to the Maine Supreme Court by a Republican Governor, and he \nwas recently praised by an Independent Governor. If public trust in our \ncourt system hinges on the belief that the courtroom is a place where \neveryone can expect equal treatment, no one in Maine has done more to \npromote that perception than Justice Lipez.\n  The nominee is also a man who combines great intellectual acumen with \nconsiderable common sense. He has that rare ability to deal with the \nmost cerebral of issues while keeping his feet planted firmly on the \nground. Despite the talent he possesses and the respect he commands, he \nis a person of humility, an essential trait for someone empowered to \nsit in judgment of others.\n  Mr. President, Kermit Lipez's dedication to his profession is beyond \nquestion. As a judge's son, he came to the bench with considerable \nknowledge of the judicial function. Yet, shortly after his appointment \nto the State Superior Court, he took the unusual step of obtaining a \nmaster's degree in judicial process from the University of Virginia \nSchool of Law.\n  Justice Lipez understands not only the powers of a judge but also the \nlimits on those powers. To use his own words, courts exist to resolve \n``particularized disputes. They do not decide the wisdom of laws. . . . \n[They] squander their resources and their authority when they try to \nmanage problems or impose solutions beyond their competence and their \nproper role.''\n  Mr. President, Justice Lipez has excelled in everything he has \nundertaken--whether as a legislative aide to former Senator Muskie, a \nprivate practitioner, a trial judge, or a Justice on Maine's Supreme \nJudicial Court--and I am confident that he will excel as a member of \nthe First Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Senator Snowe has been a very strong advocate for Justice Kermit \nLipez. It was, in fact, Senator Snowe's husband who appointed Justice \nLipez to the court in Maine. I am delighted to be here tonight to speak \non behalf of this nomination.\n\n\n                   In Support of Justice Kermit Lipez\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nof Justice Kermit Lipez's nomination to become a judge on the First \nCircuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals.\n  Justice Lipez has many qualifications to recommend him and I want to \ntake a few minutes to touch on them. But before I begin, I want to take \nthis opportunity to thank the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Hatch, for all that he has done in getting the Committee to \npromptly consider Justice Lipez's nomination and bringing us to this \nvote today. Throughout this process, Senator Hatch has been \nconsistently thoughtful and cooperative, and I want him to know how \nmuch I appreciate his invaluable contributions and assistance.\n  The Senate's action today will be the culmination of an exemplary \ncareer on\n\n[[Page S3182]]\n\nthe state bench--a career that has earned Justice Lipez universal \nrespect in Maine's legal community, regardless of political \naffiliation. This is a man who was appointed to the state bench by a \nDemocratic Governor, was promoted to the Maine Supreme Court by a \nRepublican Governor--my husband, John McKernan, Jr.--and whose \nnomination to the First Circuit was enthusiastically supported by \nMaine's current Independent Governor.\n  Likewise, it was no coincidence that Maine's entire Congressional \nDelegation--representing both parties--stood proudly with Justice Lipez \nand testified on his behalf at his nomination hearing. All of this \npoints to one irre- futable fact: by all accounts and by any measure, \nKermit Lipez is an exceptional judge. And he will make us proud.\n  At Justice Lipez's hearing before the Judiciary Committee, my friend \nfrom Delaware, Senator Biden, noted the high regard in which the First \nCircuit is held. He wanted to impress upon Justice Lipez that, if \nconfirmed, he would join a very impressive and effective court. I trust \nand share my friend from Delaware's assessment of the First Circuit--\nand I want to assure him and all of my colleagues that in this regard, \nJustice Lipez and the First Circuit are an ideal match.\n  That is not a statement I make lightly. The facts reveal a judge that \nfor thirteen years on the state bench has been a judge personally and \nprofessionally dedicated to excellence.\n\n  But you don't have to take my word for it. Since the President \nnominated Justice Lipez for this post, I have been privileged to read \nnumerous letters in support of his nomination.\n  Justice Lipez's has been called a ``. . . truly outstanding \nnomination,'' by a senior member of the First Circuit, Judge Frank \nCoffin. He has been characterized as ``. . . at the top of Maine's \njurists'' by the Dean of the University of Maine's Law School, Donald \nZillman. And his present colleagues on Maine's Supreme Court have \ncommented that he works as hard on their cases as he does on his own, \nand for that, they will miss him.\n  It's not just Justice Lipez's colleagues or his congressional \ndelegation who support him, but just about anybody who has taken the \ntime to review his record. An editorial that ran in Maine's largest \nnewspaper, the Portland Press Herald, put it this way: ``. . . (he) has \nproven to be a fair and thoughtful judge during his 12 years on the \nstate Superior and Supreme Courts. . . . Lipez's resume and record . . \n. transcend politics.''\n  Maine's second largest newspaper, the Bangor Daily News, echoed this \nsentiment, commenting that Justice Lipez was ``remarkably talented'' \nand that ``. . . the state should feel nothing but honor that Kermit \nLipez will represent Maine on the second-highest court in the nation.'' \nMr. President, I couldn't agree more.\n  I believe we should expect any federal judge to demonstrate a \npersonal dedication to his or her work, a thorough understanding of the \nlaw, and a balanced approach to jurisprudence. Justice Lipez has \ndemonstrated all of these attributes with admirable regularity.\n  What makes me so proud to support his nomination, however, is the \nfact that he will bring so much more than just the prerequisites to the \nfederal bench.\n  For with Justice Lipez also comes a deep respect for the law--and a \njudge's role in its administration. With him comes an outstanding legal \nmind that is not only able, but willing to make the right decision even \nwhen it's not the easy or expeditious one. And with the nomination of \nJustice Lipez, the federal bench will welcome a man of the utmost \npersonal integrity--a man well represented by his work ethic, his \ntremendous talent, and his irreproachable personal character.\n  Mr. President, I am proud that Justice Lipez will represent Maine on \nthe First Circuit. He has precisely the kind of experience and \ndisposition that we should expect from all our nominees. He is well-\ntested, remarkably talented, and perfectly suited for the demanding \nwork of the federal bench. The President and the Judiciary Committee \nhave acted wisely in forwarding Justice Lipez's nomination, and it is \ntime for the Senate to do likewise by confirming him. I hope all of my \ncolleagues will join me in supporting this outstanding nominee.\n\n\n          statement on the nomination of johnnie b. rawlinson\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Johnnie B. Rawlinson was born in Concord, \nNorth Carolina on December 16, 1952. The fourth of seven children, \nJohnnie grew up in Kannapolis, North Carolina where she attended public \nschool and was a member of the first integrated class at A.L. Brown \nHigh School in Kannapolis. Upon graduation, Johnnie received a full \nscholarship to attend North Carolina A University in Greensboro, \nNorth Carolina. She majored in psychology and graduated Summa Cum Laude \nwith a Bachelor's of Science degree in 1974.\n  Johnnie met Dwight Rawlinson, her husband of 21 years, while they \nwere both juniors at A They married in 1976 and moved to California \nwhere Dwight, an officer in the Air Force, had been transferred. \nJohnnie enrolled at the University of the Pacific's McGeorge School of \nLaw where she had been granted a full academic scholarship. In November \nof 1977, at the beginning of her second year of law school, Dwight was \ntransferred to Nellis Air Force Base. Pregnant with their first child, \nJohnnie stayed in California to finish up her schooling. In 1978, \nDwight joined her for spring break and together they celebrated the \nbirth of their daughter Monica. Since Nevada has no law school, Dwight \nand Johnnie decided that Johnnie and Monica would return to California \nfor her third and final year of law school. Monica attended classes \nwith her mother and they both returned to Nellis for long weekends and \nsummers. In 1979, Johnnie B. Rawlinson graduated in the top ten percent \nof her law school class, the first attorney in her family.\n  Johnnie was admitted to the California Bar in 1979 and the Nevada Bar \nin 1980. While she was waiting to find out her Bar results, she worked \nas a law clerk for John O'Reilly, former Chair of the Nevada Gaming \nCommission. In June of 1980, she went to work as a staff attorney for \nNevada Legal Services, where she worked on landlord-tenant disputes and \nunemployment compensation. After four months of work for Legal \nServices, in October of 1980, she was hired as Deputy District Attorney \nby Nevada Governor Bob Miller, who was then serving as Clark County DA.\n  For the past 17 years, Rawlinson has moved steadily up the ladder at \nthe District Attorney's office. She served for nine years as a Deputy \nDistrict Attorney, developing expertise in the areas of Arbitration, \nCollection Law, Hospital Law, Local Government Purchasing, Employment \nLaw, Labor Law, Civil Litigation and Workers Compensation. In September \n1989, she was promoted to Chief Deputy District Attorney and in January \nof 1995, Clark County DA Stewart Bell promoted her to Assistant \nDistrict Attorney. In her current position, she supervises the Civil, \nFamily Support, and Administration Divisions of the office. She \npresents evidence at Coroner's Inquests and is the Chair of the \nProfessional Hiring Committee.\n  In the mid 1980s, Governor Richard Bryan appointed Rawlinson to the \nWelfare Board where she served until 1991. In 1991, she made it to the \nfinal round of the interview process for an open position as U.S. \nMagistrate in Nevada District Court. When another Magistrate position \nopened up in Northern Nevada, she was named to the Magistrate Judge \nSelection Committee.\n  A past member of the State of Nevada Board of Governors and a past \nboard member of the Clark County Bar Association, the Southern Nevada \nAssociation of Women Attorneys, and the Las Vegas Chapter of the \nNational Bar Association, Rawlinson plays an active role in Nevada \nlegal affairs. She currently serves on the State Bar of Nevada Board of \nBar Examiners and is Chair of the Lawyer Referral Services Committee. \nShe has also served as a lawyer representative to the Ninth Circuit \nJudicial Conference and currently serves as a member of Judge Phillip \nPro's Civil Justice Reform Act Advisory Group. A frequent lecturer to \nthe Lorman Business Institute, Rawlinson has also served as an Adjunct \nProfessor of Hospital Law at the College of St. Francis and as an \nadjunct Professor of Employment Law at the Community College of \nSouthern Nevada.\n  Today, Johnnie and Dwight Rawlinson are the proud parents of\n\n[[Page S3183]]\n\nthree children: Monica, a graduate of Western High, received her own \nfull academic scholarship to South Carolina State University where she \nis in her sophomore year studying pre-med; Traci is entering the ninth \ngrade at Western High and David is a second grader at Howard Wasdenn \nElementary School.\n  Residents of Clark County for close to twenty years, the Rawlinsons \nenjoy spending time with their family and friends from church. An \nactive member of the Church of Christ in North Las Vegas, Johnnie \nserved as Secretary of the Church for 10 years and taught Sunday school \nas well.\n  In late August 1997, I sent Rawlinson's name to the President as my \nnominee for Federal District Court Judge for the District of Nevada. On \nJanuary 27, 1998, President Clinton formally nominated her for a seat \non the federal bench. She was unanimously reported out of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee on March 26, 1998. Tonight she was confirmed by the \nSenate. Johnnie B. Rawlinson will be the first African American and the \nfirst woman to serve as a Nevada Federal District Court Judge.\n\n\n                         judicial confirmations\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Majority Leader for calling up \nthe nominations of Justice Kermit Lipez to the First Circuit Court of \nAppeals, Mrs. Johnnie Rawlinson to the District Court for the District \nof Nevada and Mr. Robert T. Dawson to the District Court for the \nWestern District of Arkansas.\n  Before adjourning for a two-week recess, it is important for the \nSenate to clear its calendar of nominations to the maximum extent \npossible. Certainly the confirmation of these outstanding nominee, \nwhich the President sent to us back in October and November last year \nand earlier this year, are a step in the right direction. I have been \nurging the Majority Leader to move judicial nominations through the \nSenate and I thank him for doing so with respect to these nominees.\n  As the Senate prepares to recess, eight judicial nominations still \nremain on the calendar awaiting Senate action. With these three \nadditional confirmations, the Senate will still have confirmed less \nthan 20 judges for the year. This, at a time when we have already \nwitnessed 100 vacancies so far this year and we see another 10 on the \nhorizon. So, while I thank the Senate for its actions today, I must \nnote that we have not closed the vacancies gap or ended the crisis of \nwhich the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court warned in \nhis most recent year end report.\n  Most troubling to me are the continuing vacancies on the Second \nCircuit. I deeply regret the Senate's unwillingness to date to vote \nupon the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Second Circuit or \nto provide hearings for Judge Rosemary Pooler, Robert Sack and Chester \nStraub. I will redouble my efforts to end the emergency that currently \nexists in the Second Circuit due to the five vacancies on that 13-\nmember court.\n  I look forward to prompt action on all of the 36 judicial nominees \nstill pending before the Senate. In addition, I urge the President to \nmake good use of the next several days and to continue to send to the \nSenate qualified nominees for each of the judicial vacancies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/02/senate-section/article/S3181-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2286) was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, on behalf of the Finance Committee, I am \njoining with Senator Moynihan and others today to bring H.R. 3130, the \nChild Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998, before the Senate. \nThis important bill passed the House of Representatives earlier this \nmonth by a vote of 414 to 1.\n  When a bill passes the House by that wide of a margin, it is either \nnoncontroversial, of limited national significance, or an extremely \nimportant piece of legislation with broad and deep support. H.R. 3130 \nclearly falls within this last category.\n  The work on this legislation began shortly after the ``Personal \nResponsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996'' was \nsigned into law. The 1996 welfare reform act required the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to recommend to Congress a new, budget-\nneutral performance-based incentive system for the child support \nenforcement program. H.R. 3130 incorporates those recommendations which \nwere developed in consultation with 26 representatives of state and \nlocal child support enforcement systems. The new incentive program is \nthe centerpiece of this bill.\n  Under current law, the Federal Government returns more than $400 \nmillion per year in child support collections to the states as \nincentive payments. But this incentive structure has been criticized \nfor years as weak and inadequate. All States, regardless of actual \nperformance, receive some incentive payments. But for more than a \ndecade, performance has not been tied to the national goals of the \nprogram.\n  H.R. 3130 breaks with the past and creates five categories in which \nstate performance will be evaluated and rewarded.\n  The States will be measured according to their performance in \npaternity establishment, establishment of court orders, collections of \ncurrent child support payments, collections on past due payments, and \ncost effectiveness.\n  The legislation also requires the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to make a future recommendation on adding another performance \nmeasure on medical support orders. Let me particularly thank Senator \nRockefeller for his work in designing a strategy to overcome the \ninherent barriers to medical support orders.\n  The new incentive structure is an important development not only for \nthe child support enforcement system but also as a model for improving \naccountability and performance in government.\n  The second important feature of this bill is to provide for an \nalternative penalty procedure for those states that have failed to meet \nfederal child support data processing requirements. Less than half of \nthe States have been certified as in compliance. Without this change, \nstates face not only the loss of their entire child support grant, but \nall of their funds in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families \nprogram as well.\n\n[[Page S3184]]\n\n  Such a result would obviously be crippling to a state and would \nultimately hurt the very families these programs are intended to help.\n  Under the new alternative penalty procedures, those states which will \nnot come into compliance this year will face a penalty of four percent \nof their child support funds.\n  This penalty would double each year in the following two years and \nwould reach 30 percent in the fourth year a state failed to come into \ncompliance. These penalties are tough but fair.\n  Under the Finance amendment, states will not face a penalty in the \nyear in which they come into compliance. And states which come into \ncompliance with the first two years after penalties have been imposed \ncan have the penalty from the prior year reduced.\n  H.R. 3130 also provides additional flexibility to the states in how \nthey design their automated systems.\n  In looking back over the history of automation, we find there were a \nnumber of mistakes made at both the federal and state levels which \ncontributed to the delay in getting these systems operational. The \nchild support enforcement system is a prime example of what can happen \nwhen regulations fail to keep pace with real world practices.\n  H.R. 3130 recognizes the advances in technologies and allows states \nto take advantage of these improvements. It properly refocuses federal \npolicy on function and results rather than on rigid rules.\n  All of these changes will work together to get the states in \ncompliance as quickly as possible. This will mean the child support \nenforcement system will work better for the families who depend on \nchild support.\n  H.R. 3130 also makes a correction in how penalties are applied under \nthe new ``Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997'' which became law \nlast November. It is vitally important that the states be held \naccountable for assisting the children in foster care.\n  A child should not be denied the opportunity to be adopted into a \nloving and caring family simply because the prospective parents live in \nthe next county.\n  When the Department of Health and Human Services issues regulations \non how the new penalties are enforced, it should, of course, provide \nthe states with the opportunity to present evidence of how it complies \nwith the new law. The review of this new requirement must be a fair and \ncomplete assessment of whether the law is being met.\n  Mr. President, this is indeed an important, bipartisan bill which \nwill prove itself to pay dividends for America's families. I urge its \nadoption.\n  I ask unanimous consent a summary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSummary of H.R. 3130, ``The Child Support Performance and Incentive Act \n            of 1998'' With Senate Modifications, March 1998\n\n\n                 Title I: Alternative Penalty Procedure\n\n       Eligibility for alternative penalty. A state which is not \n     in compliance with federal data processing requirements may \n     enter into a corrective compliance plan with the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services. The plan must describe how, by \n     when, and at what cost the state will achieve compliance. For \n     failing to achieve compliance, a state would be penalized 4 \n     percent of its federal administrative grant under the Title \n     IV-D program beginning in FY 1998. The penalty will increase \n     to 8 percent for the second year of noncompliance; 16 percent \n     for the third year; and 30 percent for the fourth year and \n     each subsequent year. A state is subject to a single \n     reduction in a fiscal year.\n       Penalty waiver. A state is not penalized in the fiscal year \n     in which it achieves compliance. A state will not be subject \n     to a higher penalty as a result of a delay by HHS to conduct \n     a review.\n       Penalty forgiveness. In the first two year period in which \n     a penalty is applied, HHS shall reduce the penalty from the \n     immediately preceding year when compliance is achieved. For \n     example, the 4 percent penalty for FY 1998 will be reduced by \n     20 percent if compliance is achieved in FY 1999. The 8 \n     percent penalty for 1999 will be reduced by 20 percent if \n     compliance is achieved in FY 2000. There is no forgiveness \n     for the previous year after the second year.\n       Penalty reduction for good performance. In the case of the \n     1996 welfare reform requirements, a state which fails to \n     comply in a fiscal year could have its penalty for that year \n     reduced by 20 percent for each performance measure under the \n     new incentive system provided in Title II for which it \n     achieves its maximum score.\n       Expansion of waiver provision. The authority of the \n     Secretary to waive certain data processing requirements and \n     to provide federal funding for a wider range of state data \n     systems activities would be expanded to include waiving the \n     single statewide system requirement under certain \n     conditions and providing federal funds to develop and \n     enhance local systems which are linked to state systems. \n     To qualify, a state would have to demonstrate that it can \n     develop an alternative system that: can help the state \n     meet the paternity establishment requirement and other \n     performance measures; can submit required data to HHS that \n     is complete and reliable; substantially complies with all \n     requirements of the child support enforcement program; \n     achieves all the functional capacity for automatic data \n     processing outlined in the statute; meets the requirements \n     for distributing collections to families and governments, \n     including cases in which support is owed to more than one \n     family or more than one government; has only one point of \n     contact for both interstate cases (which provides seamless \n     case processing) and intrastate case management; is based \n     on standardized data elements, forms, and definitions that \n     are used throughout the state; can be operational in no \n     more time than it would take to achieve an operational \n     single statewide system; and can process child support \n     cases as quickly, efficiently, and effectively as would be \n     possible with a single statewide system.\n       Federal payments under waiver. In addition to the various \n     waiver requirements described above, and to the requirements \n     in current law, the state would have to submit to the \n     Secretary separate estimates of the costs to develop and \n     implement a single statewide system and the alternative \n     system being proposed by the state plus the costs of \n     operating and maintaining these systems for five years from \n     the date of implementation. The Secretary would have to agree \n     with the estimates. If a state elects to operate such an \n     alternative system, the state would be paid the 66 percent \n     federal administration reimbursement only on expenditures \n     that did not exceed the estimated cost of the single \n     statewide system.\n\n\n                TITLE II. Child Support Incentive System\n\n       Amount of incentive payments. The incentive payment for a \n     state for a given year would be calculated by multiplying the \n     incentive payment pool for the year by the state's share for \n     the year. The incentive payment pool would be:\n\n     FY 2000: $422 million\n     FY 2001: $429 million\n     FY 2002: $450 million\n     FY 2003: $461 million\n     FY 2004: $454 million\n     FY 2005: $446 million\n     FY 2006: $458 million\n     FY 2007: $471 million\n     FY 2008: $483 million\n       After 2008, the incentive payment pool would increase each \n     year by the inflation rate.\n       Performance measures. The incentive payments would be based \n     on five performance measures: paternity establishment, \n     establishment of support orders, collections on current \n     payments, collections on past due payments (arrearages), and \n     cost effectiveness.\n       Treatment of interstate collections. In computing incentive \n     payments, supported collected by the state at the request of \n     another state would be treated as having been collected by \n     both states.\n       Regulations. The Secretary would be required to prescribe \n     regulations necessary to implement the incentive payment \n     program within nine months of the date of enactment.\n       Reinvestment. States would be required to spend child \n     support incentive payments to carry out their child support \n     enforcement program or to conduct activities approved by the \n     Secretary which may contribute to improving the effectiveness \n     or efficiency of the state child support enforcement program. \n     In so doing, states would have to supplement and not supplant \n     other funds used by the state to conduct its child support \n     enforcement program.\n       Transition rule. The new incentive program would be phased \n     in over two years beginning in FY 2000. In FY 2000, \\1/3\\ of \n     each state's incentive payment would be based on the new \n     incentive system and \\2/3\\ on the old system. In FY 2001, \\2/\n     3\\ of the payment will be based on the new system; and in \n     2002, the incentive payment will be based entirely on the new \n     system.\n       General effective date. Except for the elimination of the \n     current incentive program, the amendments would take \n     effect on October 1, 1999.\n\n\n                     Title III: Adoption Provisions\n\n       More flexible penalty procedure to be applied for failing \n     to permit interjurisdictional adoption. Under the ``Adoption \n     and Safe Families Act of 1997, a state is at risk of losing \n     its entire IV-E grant for violating the new requirements on \n     interjurisdictional adoptions. This provision allows the \n     states to enter into a corrective compliance plan and reduces \n     the penalty to 2 percent for the first violation, 3 percent \n     for the second violation, and 5 percent for the third and \n     subsequent violations.\n\n\n                   Title IV: Miscellaneous Provisions\n\n       Elimination of barriers to the effective establishment and \n     enforcement of medical child support. This provision is \n     intended to eliminate the existing barriers to effective \n     enforcement of medical support in three ways.\n\n[[Page S3185]]\n\n     First, it requires the Secretaries of HHS and Labor to design \n     and implement a Standardized Medical Support Notice. State \n     child support agencies will be required to use this \n     standardized form to communicate the issuance of a medical \n     support order, and employers will be required to accept the \n     form as a ``Qualified Medical Support Order'' under ERISA. \n     Second, the Secretaries will jointly establish a medical \n     support working group to identify and make recommendations \n     for the removal of other barriers to effective medical \n     support. Third, the Secretary of Labor is required to submit \n     a report containing recommendations for any additional ERISA \n     changes necessary to improve medical support enforcement.\n       Safeguard of new employee information. This provision \n     imposes a fine of $1,000 for each act of unauthorized access \n     to, disclosure of, or use of information in the National \n     Directory of New Hires. It also requires that data entered \n     into the National Director of New Hires be deleted 24 months \n     after date of entry for individuals who have a child support \n     order. For an individual who does not have a child support \n     order, the data must be deleted after 12 months.\n       General Accounting Office study on program improvements. \n     The General Accounting Office (GAO) is required to report to \n     Congress on the feasibility of implementing an instant check \n     system for employers to use in identifying individuals with \n     child support orders. The report is also to include a review \n     of the use of the Federal Parent Locater Service, \n     including the Federal Case Registry of Child Support \n     Orders and the National Directory of New Hires, and the \n     adequacy of privacy protections.\n       Technical and conforming amendments. There are several \n     technical and conforming amendments made. The two most \n     noteworthy amendments deal with data collection in the \n     calculation of the adopting incentive payments and collection \n     of Social Security numbers and are described below.\n       (1) The new provision would give the states an additional \n     five months to report data needed to calculate adoption \n     incentive payments and the Secretary an additional four \n     months to approve the data.\n       (2) The 1996 welfare reform law requires states to collect \n     Social Security numbers on applications for state licenses \n     for purposes of matching in child support cases by January 1, \n     1998. The ``Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration \n     Responsibility Act of 1996'' required states to collect \n     Social Security numbers on applications for state licenses \n     for purposes of checking the identity of immigrants by \n     October 1, 2000. This amendment would conform the differing \n     requirements by changing the date for child support cases to \n     October 1, 2000, or such earlier date as the state selects.\n       Title V of the House bill regarding immigration provisions \n     is not included in the substitute.\n\n\n                comparison of senate and house penalties\n\n       Example of a state with $100 million IV-D grant:\n       1.

Mr. President, I note that the ``Child Support Performance \nand Incentive Act of 1998'' contains a provision which amends the \n``Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997.'' This provision deals with \nhow the provision on elimination of geographic barriers to adoption is \nenforced. It is my understanding that this amendment does not affect \nthe other provisions in the new law on reasonable efforts or the \ntermination of parental rights.\n  It is my understanding that the purpose of the new law was to clarify \nfederal policy regarding the protection of children in foster care. The \nadoption law makes clear that the health and safety of children must \nalways be of paramount concern in any decision affecting the removal of \nchildren from their homes or the reunification of children with their \nfamilies.\n  To receive foster care and adoption assistance funds, States are \ngenerally required to make reasonable efforts to maintain children in \ntheir own homes or to reunify children and families when possible. \nHowever, it is my understanding that under the new law, the federal \ngovernment does not require States to make such efforts in cases where \na court finds that a parent has killed or assaulted a child or \nsubjected the child to extreme forms of abuse or neglect. At the same \ntime, the new law does not prevent a State from making efforts to \npreserve or reunify a family in such cases, as long as the child's \nhealth and safety are the paramount considerations. Is my understanding \ncorrect?\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes, that is correct. In addition, the adoption law \nestablishes a new requirement that States must initiate termination of \nparental rights proceedings in specific cases that are outlined in the \nlaw. However, the law only requires States to initiate such proceedings \nand does not mandate the outcome. Moreover, the law provides that \nStates are not required to initiate termination of parental rights in \ncertain cases, including when there is a compelling reason to conclude \nthat such proceedings would not be in the child's best interest. Thus, \nthe State retains the discretion to make case-by-case determinations \nregarding whether to seek termination of parental rights.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be deemed read a \nthird time and passed, that the title amendment be agreed to, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements \nrelating to the bill appear at this point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3130) was deemed read the third time and passed.\n  The title was amended so as to read:\n\n       An Act to provide for an alternative penalty procedure for \n     States that fail to meet Federal child support data \n     processing requirements, to reform Federal incentive payments \n     for effective child support performance, to provide for a \n     more flexible penalty procedure for States that violate \n     interjurisdictional adoption requirements, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/02/senate-section/article/S3183-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3185-S3186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    A SPECIAL COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS THE YEAR 2000 TECHNOLOGY PROBLEM\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, tomorrow the Senate will be in a period \nfor morning business from 10 a.m. until 12 noon. It is hoped that at 12 \nnoon the Senate will be able to proceed to the consideration of Senate \nbill 414, the international shipping bill.\n  In addition, the Senate may consider any executive or legislative \nbusiness cleared for Senate action. As previously announced, there will \nbe no rollcall votes during tomorrow's session.\n  When the Senate reconvenes following the Easter holidays, the Senate \nwill resume consideration of the Coverdell A+ Education Act. Also, as \nannounced, the next rollcall votes will occur on that legislation on \nTuesday, April 21, at a time to be announced by the majority leader.\n  Mr. FORD. Will the acting leader yield?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. FORD. We are attempting to get an answer on a question I have. I \ndon't want to hold the Senate here any longer, but there is a \npossibility. Could we have a quorum call, if the Senator would like to \nleave, with a motion that when I get my answer we will go out, or \nsomething like that? I will be more than pleased to do that.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
