The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3633) to amend the Controlled Substances \n     Import and Export Act to place limitations on controlled \n     substances brought into the United States.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, H.R. 3633, ``The Controlled Substances \nTrafficking Prohibition Act,'' addresses a gap in our controlled \nsubstances laws. At present, people entering the United States from \nMexico may bring up to a ninety-day supply of drug products into the \ncountry without a prescription, under the so-called ``personal use'' \nexemption. Many of these drug products are then illegally distributed \nwithin the United States.\n  Such abuses have increased dramatically in recent years, and there is \na need to address this problem now. H.R. 3633 does this by limiting the \npersonal use exemption in certain circumstances to 50 dosage units. But \nthis is only a stopgap measure. What constitutes ``personal use'' is a \ncomplicated issue that will turn on a number of circumstances, \nincluding the nature of the controlled substance and the medical needs \nof the individual. It is the sort of issue that should be addressed not \nthrough single-standard\n\n[[Page S12681]]\n\nlegislation but through measures regulations passed by an agency with \nexpertise in the matter. For this reason, I believe that we will have \nto take this issue up again next year, to direct the Department of \nJustice to study the problems at our borders and to pass regulations \nthat are more finely-tuned to address those problems. In the meantime, \nH.R. 3633 will help to stem the tide of illegal importations of \ncontrolled drugs, which pose dangers to Americans when illegally \ndistributed and used.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nconsidered read the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statement relating to the bill appear \nat the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I have great concerns about our Nation's \npolicy towards Cuba. Castro remains, in the mind of this Senator and \nthe minds of most, as an individual who has brought great harm to that \nnation, and it persists to this day. The human suffering there is \nincalculable.\n  Some months ago, I joined with my distinguished friend and colleague, \nthe senior Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, who has had considerable \nexperience in this region of our hemisphere, in trying to seek \nlegislation to allow the sale of U.S. food, medicine and medical \nequipment to Cuba.\n  Regrettably, that has not been done in its totality. There have been \nsome efforts, but nevertheless that continues to present itself as an \nexample of how I believe--and others share my belief--that the overall \npolicy between the United States of America and Cuba should be \nthoroughly, pragmatically and objectively reviewed. With that purpose \nin mind, I and other Senators--I think some 15 in number--have written \nthe President of the United States requesting that he, hopefully \njointly with the Congress, establish a commission to make such a study. \nIn short, we wrote President Clinton recommending ``the establishment \nof a national bipartisan commission to review our current U.S.-Cuba \npolicy.''\n  My reason for making this recommendation is simple and \nstraightforward. The current United States-Cuba policy in effect for \nnearly 40 years--that is astonishing, 40 years--has yet to achieve its \ngoal of a peaceful transition to democracy in Cuba. Of course, Castro \nremains the single most formidable obstacle to achieving that goal.\n\n  Now the time has come, in our judgment, for a thoughtful, rational \nand objective analysis of our current U.S. policy toward Cuba and its \noverall effect on this hemisphere. I am not alone\n\n[[Page S12682]]\n\nin putting forward this proposal. As I have previously stated, I was \njoined in this recommendation to the President by a distinguished and \nbipartisan group of Senate colleagues. In addition, a world-respected \ngroup of former senior Government officials of our United States have \nwritten to me--I asked for that letter and obtained it--in strong \nsupport of the establishment of the commission.\n  That distinguished group includes Howard Baker, Jr., former Senate \nmajority leader; Frank Carlucci, former Secretary of Defense; Lawrence \nEagleburger, former Secretary State; Henry Kissinger, former Secretary \nof State; William D. Rogers, former Under Secretary of State; Harry W. \nShalaudeman, former Assistant Secretary of State and Malcolm Wallop, \nformer U.S. Senator. Further, I am informed that former Secretary of \nState George Shultz supports our efforts.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that President Clinton will act to \nimplement our recommendation. Should he choose to do so, the analysis \nand recommendations that are put forth will provide both the Congress \nand the Administration with the means to shape and strengthen our \nfuture relationship with Cuba.\n  The recommendation that we have for this commission is parallel to \none that was set up by a past President in response to the need to look \nat the overall hemisphere. It was known as the Kissinger Commission. It \nhas, I think, the customary provisions in it whereby the President \nmakes certain appointments and the Congress will make certain \nappointments. I think there will be a wealth of talent ready, able, and \nwilling to step forward at the call of the Executive branch and the \nLegislative branch to take up the responsibility of a very serious \nchallenge, to establish a revised policy between our Nation and Cuba.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent my letter to President \nClinton, the letter sent to me by Lawrence Eagleburger, and an October \n16, 1998, Washington Post editorial on this subject be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 13, 1998.\n     Hon. William Jefferson Clinton,\n     President of the United States, The White House, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We, the undersigned, recommend that you \n     authorize the establishment of a National Bipartisan \n     Commission to review our current U.S.-Cuba policy. This \n     Commission would follow the precedent and work program of the \n     National Bipartisan Commission on Central America, (the \n     ``Kissinger Commission''), established by President Reagan in \n     1983, which made such a positive contribution to our foreign \n     policy in that troubled region over 15 years ago.\n       We recommend this action because there has not been a \n     comprehensive review of U.S.-Cuba policy, or a measurement of \n     its effectiveness in achieving its stated goals, in over 38 \n     years since President Eisenhower first canceled the sugar \n     quota on July 6, 1960 and President Kennedy imposed the first \n     total embargo on Cuba on February 7, 1962. Most recently, \n     Congress passed the Cuban Democracy Act in 1992 and the \n     Helms-Burton Act in 1996. Since the passage of both of these \n     bills there have been significant changes in the world \n     situation that warrant a review of our U.S.-Cuba policy \n     including the termination, in 1991, of billions of dollars of \n     annual Soviet economic assistance to Cuba, and the historic \n     visit of Pope John Paul II to Cuba in 1998.\n       In addition, during the past 24 months numerous delegations \n     from the United States have visited Cuba, including current \n     and former Members of Congress, representatives from the \n     American Association of World Health, and former U.S. \n     military leaders. These authoritative groups have analyzed \n     the conditions and capabilities on the island and have \n     presented their findings in the areas of health, the economy, \n     religious freedom, human rights, and military capacity. Also, \n     in May 1998, the Pentagon completed a study on the security \n     risk of Cuba to the United States.\n       However, the findings and reports of these delegations, \n     including the study by the Pentagon, and the call by Pope \n     John Paul II for the opening of Cuba by the world, have not \n     been broadly reviewed by all U.S. policy makers. As Members \n     of the U.S. Senate, we believe it is in the best interest of \n     the United States, our allies, and the Cuban people to review \n     these issues.\n       We therefore recommend that a ``National Bipartisan \n     Commission on Cuba'' be created to conduct a thoughtful, \n     rational, and objective analysis of our current U.S. policy \n     toward Cuba and its overall effect on this hemisphere. This \n     analysis would in turn help us shape and strengthen our \n     future relationship with Cuba.\n       We recommend that the members of this Commission be \n     selected, like the ``Kissinger Commission'', from a \n     bipartisan list of distinguished Americans who are \n     experienced in the field of international relations. These \n     individuals should include representatives from a cross \n     section of U.S. interests including public health, military, \n     religion, human rights, business, and the Cuban American \n     community. A bipartisan group of eight Members of Congress \n     would be appointed by the Congressional Leadership to serve \n     as counselors to the Commission.\n       The Commission's tasks should include the delineation of \n     the policy's specific achievements and the evaluation of (1) \n     what national security risk Cuba poses to the United States \n     and an assessment of any role the Cuban government may play \n     in international terrorism and illegal drugs, (2) the \n     indemnification of losses incurred by U.S.-certified \n     claimants with confiscated property in Cuba, and (3) the \n     domestic and international impacts of the 36-year-old U.S.-\n     Cuba economic, trade and travel embargo on: (a) U.S. \n     international relations with our foreign allies; (b) the \n     political strength of Cuba's leader; (c) the condition of \n     human rights, religious freedom, freedom of the press in \n     Cuba; (d) the health and welfare of the Cuban people; (e) the \n     Cuban economy; (f) the U.S. economy, business, and jobs.\n       More and more Americans from all sectors of our nation are \n     becoming concerned about the far-reaching effects of our \n     present U.S.-Cuba policy on United States interests and the \n     Cuban people. Your establishment of this National Bipartisan \n     Commission would demonstrate your leadership and \n     responsiveness to the American people.\n       We have enclosed a letter from former Secretary of State \n     Lawrence Eagleburger outlining his and other former top \n     officials support for the creation of such a commission. \n     Thank you in advance for your thoughtful consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n         John Warner, Chuck Hagel, Rod Grams, James M. Jeffords, \n           Michael B. Enzi, Bob Kerrey, Rick Santorum, Dirk \n           Kempthorne, Kit Bond, John Chafee, Craig Thomas, Dale \n           Bumpers, Chris Dodd, Pat Roberts.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Baker, Donelson, Bearman\n\n\n                                                   & Caldwell,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 30, 1998.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: As Americans who have been engaged in \n     the conduct of foreign relations in various positions over \n     the past three decades, we believe that it is timely to \n     conduct a review of United States policy toward Cuba. We \n     therefore encourage you and your colleagues to support the \n     establishment of a National Bipartisan Commission on Cuba.\n       I am privileged to be joined in this request by: Howard H. \n     Baker, Jr., Former Majority Leader, U.S. Senate; William D. \n     Rogers, Former Under Secretary of State; Frank Carlucci, \n     Former Secretary of Defense; Harry W. Shalaudeman, Former \n     Assistant Secretary of State; Henry A. Kissinger, Former \n     Secretary of State; and Malcolm Wallop, Former Member, U.S. \n     Senate.\n       We recommend that the President consider the president and \n     the procedures of the National Bipartisan Commission on \n     Central America chaired by former Secretary of State Henry A. \n     Kissinger, which President Reagan established in 1983. As you \n     know, the Kissinger Commission helped significantly to \n     clarify the difficult issues inherent in U.S. Policy in \n     Central America and to forge a new consensus on many of them.\n       We believe that such a Commission would serve the national \n     interest in this instance as well. It could provide the \n     Administration, the Congress, and the American people with \n     objective analysis and useful policy recommendations for \n     dealing with the complexities of our relationship with Cuba, \n     and in doing so advance the cause of freedom and democracy in \n     the Hemisphere.\n           Sincerely,\n     Lawrence S. Eagleburger.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                          A Good Idea on Cuba\n\n       By chance, a record 157 countries voted in the U.N. General \n     Assembly against the American embargo of Cuba just as a \n     proposal for a high-powered national bipartisan commission to \n     review the United States' whole Cuba policy was emerging from \n     the Senate. In the Assembly, only Israel supported Washington \n     in defense of an embargo that has been the centerpiece of \n     American policy for 36 years and that has not been soberly \n     reviewed since the Cold War ended. Sen. John Warner (R-Va.) \n     is author of the review proposal. He has gotten heavy-duty \n     legislators and former foreign policy officials to sign on.\n       So much has changed over the four decades of Cuban-American \n     collision. The Cold War is over, terminating Cuban security \n     threats to the United States. Cuba, by its own totalitarian \n     rule and economic mismanagement, and not just by the embargo, \n     has entirely lost luster as a model for modernizing states. \n     The embargo has punished the Cuban economy, though it is \n     slowly recovering, and also the Cuban people. The embargo has \n     embellished the nationalist credentials of Communist ruler \n     Fidel Castro. It has puzzled America's best friends, who do \n     not understand why the United States treats Cuba as though \n     the Cold War were still on.\n       The official answer is that the embargo is a lever to force \n     the democratization of Cuba\n\n[[Page S12683]]\n\n     and, by American law, the termination of Fidel Castro's rule. \n     But the limited changes in this regard are owed less to \n     official American isolation than to such regulated openings \n     as the permissions for calls, emigration, humanitarian gifts \n     and family trips and the historic visit of Pope John Paul II.\n       The American debate on Cuba has come to be an intense \n     unproductive contest between the Miami exile right and its \n     liberal critics. The Warner proposal promises to widen both \n     the terms of the debate and the constituencies participating \n     in it. A broad bipartisan review of Cuba policy is an idea \n     whose time has come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/20/senate-section/article/S12681-6", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12683-S12684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 KOSOVO\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have repeatedly taken the floor to speak \nabout my great concern regarding the people who are suffering today in \nKosovo. As I stated in my remarks on previous days, I visited Kosovo \nsome weeks ago in the company of the KDOM--which is a most unusual \norganization--but it has the permission by which to take unarmed \nmissions into the countryside around Pristina and elsewhere, to see the \nravages of that tragic conflict.\n  Regrettably, even though we have now in place an agreement with \nMilosevic, the fighting and the strife continues. We have recently \nexecuted an agreement. I say ``we.'' Primarily, the United Nations and \nNATO have entered into an agreement with the Yugoslav Government, and \nPresident Milosevic signed it.\n  There have been some changes in the status of forces of the Yugoslav \nArmy and the like, but it is a very fluid situation. We hear one day \nunits are moving out and then today there are reports that other \nYugoslav Army units are being redeployed. The suffering, however, \ncontinues and the winter is coming. The whole world is standing by to \nwitness what is, I think, one of the greatest recent tragedies.\n  Weather is as cruel as weapons. I saw, for my own eyes, these people \nhuddled in the hills, helpless, homeless, without food, without \nmedicine; tens of thousands--we do not know with any specific accuracy \nhow many there are, but it certainly is in excess of 100,000 human \nbeings--innocent victims, by and large, of the conflicts, political and \nmilitary, in this region of Kosovo.\n  I have had the opportunity to get briefed by the Central Intelligence \nAgency, briefed by the Department of Defense; I try to remain as \ncurrent as I can on this issue. The bottom line of what I am saying \ntoday is it is time that we look with great seriousness at the need to \nconstitute a force which will have sufficient arms to go into that \nregion and provide the stability necessary--I repeat, the stability \nnecessary for the nongovernmental institutions and others to bring in \nthe food, the medicine and the shelter that is required to support \nthese people. It is as simple as that. They will simply perish by the \ntens of thousands without this sort of help.\n  The agreement provides for the OSCE to come in. This is the first \ntime in the history of that organization that they have ever undertaken \na challenge of this magnitude. They are not organized, really, to work \nto provide security which requires force of arms, but some attempt will \nbe made along that line. The bottom line, I think, is someone has to \nstand up--and I am prepared to do it--and say that NATO is the only \nforce constituted that can come in, in a short period of days, \nliterally days, to give that degree of stability so these emergency \nsupplies can come in. It is my grave concern that unless that is done \nand done promptly, the world will witness human suffering of a \nmagnitude we have not seen, certainly, in a long time. I think only \nNATO can step in to do this.\n  I know the deep concern here in the Senate and elsewhere in the \nUnited States about employing any U.S. ground troops in the region of \nKosovo. We went through those debates with regard to Bosnia. I \npersonally was never in favor of it. But once we make a decision, as we \nhave now made, and we have the agreements in place, there is absolutely \nno alternative but to faithfully try and execute our responsibility, \ntogether with NATO and the United Nations, to provide the environment \nin which, in the few weeks to come, we can save the lives of tens of \nthousands of innocent people. That can only be done by putting in place \nuniformed, organized, well-trained troops. Their presence could well be \nthe deterrent to stop the fighting.\n  In my judgment, there are no clean hands in this situation. The \npreponderance of the atrocities obviously have been committed by the \nSerbian forces under the direction, either indirectly or directly, of \nSlobodan Milosevic. There is no doubt about that. But there also are \nsome attacks being perpetrated by the KLA, which is that disparate \ngroup, relatively undefined, whose leadership changes from time to \ntime, whose organization has very little coordination between the \nvarious bands of the KLA, but nevertheless they have perpetrated \natrocities and, apparently, there are reports that some atrocities are \ncontinuing to be perpetrated by the KLA.\n  Only an absolutely neutral independence force, as constituted by the \nUnited Nations, together with NATO, can provide the security necessary \nto bring in the needed food and medicine.\n  In looking over the agreement, and in consultation with the \nDepartment of Defense, I have learned of one very interesting \ndevelopment. I have not, as yet, seen it in the open press, but I have \nobtained the authority of the Department of Defense to mention this, \nbecause I think it is a positive goal. There are certain positive goals \nthat have been achieved by this agreement. This one will be severely \ncriticized. I certainly have some criticism of it. But there are some \npositive results of the agreement that have recently been executed \nbetween the United Nations, NATO and the Yugoslav Government.\n  One of them, for example, is as follows:\n\n       Under the agreement, Milosevic has been required to accept \n     a continuing presence of NATO reconnaissance aircraft over \n     his sovereign airspace in order to monitor its compliance \n     with the terms of the accord.\n\n  Under that, we have today--and this is most important--six NATO \nmilitary officers in Belgrade inside the Serbian air defense \nheadquarters to act as liaison with NATO. We expect Yugoslav air \ndefense personnel to report to the Combined Air Operation Center in \nItaly today to perform the same function.\n  That eliminates a lot of uncertainty that could spark a response by \nthe Yugoslav air defense operations against our monitoring aircraft, \nand that must be avoided.\n  We expect this military-to-military coordination to eliminate any \npossibility of miscommunication on the implementation of the air \nverification regime.\n  I wish to say I find that to be a very positive part of this \nagreement. I just hope we will come to the realization that a second \nvery positive step must be taken immediately, and that is placing \nsecurity forces--and I think only NATO is able to do this within the \nfew days that is required for those forces--to enable the food and \nmedicine to reach those in need.\n  Unquestionably, Milosevic bears the primary responsibility for \nfinding an acceptable political solution that grants the people of \nKosovo some degree of autonomy. We know not that level at this time. A \ndegree of self-governance has to come about and, most importantly, \nfreedom from the oppression we have witnessed in the past months and, \nindeed, throughout the past decade when Milosevic removed from Kosovo \nits degree of autonomy and self-governance that it had some years ago.\n  Also, the ethnic Albanians bear responsibility for making this \nagreement a success as well. That primarily falls on the KLA. The \npolitical leadership of Kosovo and the Kosovo Liberation Army, or the \nUCK, as it is called, must refrain from violence and set up some \nestablishment where they can have representatives at the negotiating \ntable and negotiate in good faith and support the OSCE verification \nregime on the ground.\n  Mr. President, I will continue to monitor this. Of course, I will not \nhave an opportunity to do so here on the floor of the Senate, but I \nwill by other means, because I personally am gravely concerned about \nthe plight of these homeless, helpless people who only ask for the \nopportunity to live in peace and quiet in their countryside and in \ntheir small homes, which I have seen in great numbers, but regrettably \nmost that I saw had been blown up and devastated.\n  My prayers, and I think the prayers of the people of this country, \nare with\n\n[[Page S12684]]\n\nthose helpless people. I hope we come to the quick realization of the \nsteps that must be taken to resolve this tragic conflict.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/20/senate-section/article/S12683-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO WORKING WOMEN\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nrecognize the Greenwood Business and Professional Club of Greenwood, \nMississippi, and the working women who comprise its membership. The \nclub was established on November 20, 1931, and will be holding its \nannual Women of Achievement Banquet on Thursday, October 22, 1998. It \nis my privilege to note that my daughter, Tyler Lott, a working woman \nin her own right, will provide the banquet's keynote address.\n  For nearly 67 years, the Greenwood Business and Professional Club has \nbeen a shining example of women helping women through countless \nprograms and projects. More importantly, the members of this club are \nrepresentative of working women across America who make invaluable \nsacrifices every day to strengthen the economy and fiber of our \nfamilies, communities, states and nation.\n  Working women are found in virtually every profession, trade and \nvocation, and constitute well over 62 million members of the United \nStates workforce. In fact, women-owned businesses account for \napproximately one-third of domestic firms and employ over 13 million \npeople. Moreover, we should always remember that, in addition to women \nworking in traditional businesses, women may be found working in homes \nthroughout America making significant contributions each day through \ntheir occupation as homemakers.\n  As working women continue their service to America through \nprofessional, civic and cultural endeavors, it is fitting that we \nrecognize their growing numbers, and congratulate these women who labor \nso tirelessly and effectively both inside and outside the home. Whether \nin business, industry, a profession, or as a homemaker, today's working \nwomen are vital role models for young women coast-to-coast who will \nhelp mold the future of this country.\n  I am honored to have this opportunity to commend our nation's working \nwomen, and to extend my most sincere thanks to the members of the \nGreenwood Business and Professional Club for its 67 years of \nachievement and service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/20/senate-section/article/S12684-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12684-S12686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          PASSAGE OF THE GOVERNMENT PAPERWORK ELIMINATION ACT\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, the Omnibus Appropriations bill that the \nSenate is about to consider contains the full text of S. 2107, the \nGovernment Paperwork Elimination Act, a bill I introduced in April \nalong with Senators Wyden, McCain and Reed. I want to thank Senators \nMcCain, Lott, Wyden, and Hollings for taking the time and effort to \nwork with me in advancing this legislation. Without their active \nsupport and participation, this bill would not have progressed as far \nas it has.\n  Senators Wyden, McCain and Reed joined me in introducing the \nGovernment Paperwork Elimination Act in May of this year. On July 15, \n1998, I chaired a hearing on this legislation before the full Commerce \nCommittee. Two weeks later, S. 2107 was marked up in the Committee with \nseveral modifications. On a voice vote, the bill as amended was ordered \nto be reported.\n  When the Senate returned to session after the August recess, a \nunanimous consent agreement was propounded on S. 2107. This unanimous \nconsent request brought the bill to the attention of Senator Thompson, \nthe Chairman of the Government Affairs Committee. Senator Thompson had \nconcerns with the bill because of the extent to which it dealt with \nFederal agencies.\n  Despite the time constraints--the session was expected to end in two \nweeks--Senator Thompson generously offered to work with me to address \nsome of his committee's concerns and ensure that the bill as offered \ndid not conflict with current mandates on the Executive. Over the \ncourse of the last week in September, Senator Thompson and I modified \nS. 2107 to address the concerns raised in his committee. On Tuesday, \nOctober 7, S. 2107 as amended was added as an amendment to S. 442 by \nunanimous consent.\n  The Internet Tax Freedom Bill passed the Senate on October 8 and was \nsent to the House for consideration. However, because the House did not \nagree with some of the language contained in the bill, House Members \nproposed adding the text of the House passed Internet Tax Freedom Bill \nto the omnibus rather than passing S. 442 as amended.\n  On October 15th, the Senate passed S. 2107 independent of other \nvehicles. On the same day, the text of S. 2107 was included in the \nomnibus appropriations bill. The next day, October 16th, the Omnibus \nAppropriations bill was passed by Congress with the text of the \nGovernment Paperwork Elimination Act included therein.\n  This legislation amends the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 to allow \nfor the use of electronic submission of Federal forms to the Federal \ngovernment with the use of an electronic signature within five years \nfrom the date of enactment. It is intended to bring the federal \ngovernment into the electronic age, in the process saving American \nindividuals and companies millions of dollars and hundreds of hours \ncurrently wasted on government paperwork.\n  In order to protect the private sector and ensure a level playing \nfield for companies competing in the development of electronic \nsignature technologies, this legislation mandates that regulations \npromulgated by the Office of Management and Budget and the National \nTelecommunications and Information Administration be compatible with \nstandards and technologies used commercially in order to ensure that no \none industry or technology receives favorable consideration. It also \nrequires Federal agencies to accept multiple methods of electronic \nsubmission if the agency expects to receive 50,000 or more electronic \nsubmittals of a particular form. This requirement will ensure that no \nsingle electronic signature technology is permitted to unfairly \ndominate the market.\n  This legislation also takes several steps to help the public feel \nmore secure in the use of electronic signatures. If the public is going \nto send money or share private information with the government, people \nmust be secure in the knowledge that their information and finances are \nadequately protected. For this reason, my bill requires that electronic \nsignatures be as reliable as necessary for the transaction. If a person \nis requesting information of a public nature, a secure electronic \nsignature will not be necessary. If, however, an individual is \nsubmitting forms which contain personal, medical or financial \ninformation, adequate security is imperative and will be available.\n  This is not the only provision providing for personal security, \nhowever. Senator Leahy joined me to help establish a threshold for \nprivacy protection in this bill. The language developed by Senator \nLeahy and I will ensure that information submitted by an individual can \nonly be used to facilitate the electronic transfer of information or \nwith the prior consent of the individual. Also included is legislation \nwhich establishes legal standing for electronically submitted \ndocuments. Such legal authority is necessary to attach the same \nimportance to electronically signed documents as is attached to \nphysically signed documents. Without it, electronic submission of \nsensitive documents would be impossible. Finally, the Government \nPaperwork Elimination Act requires that Federal agencies to send an \nindividual an electronic acknowledgement of their submission when it is \nreceived. Such acknowledgements are standard when conducting commerce \nonline. A similar acknowledgement by Federal agencies will provide \npiece-of-mind for individuals who conduct business with the government \nelectronically.\n  As much as individuals will benefit from this bill, so too will \nAmerican businesses. By providing companies with the option of \nelectronic filing and storage, this bill will reduce the paperwork \nburden imposed by government on commerce and the American economy. It \nwill allow businesses to move from printed forms they must fill out \nusing typewriters or handwriting to digitally-based forms that can be \nfilled out using a word processor. The savings in time, storage and \npostage will\n\n[[Page S12685]]\n\nbe enormous. One company, computer maker Hewlett-Packard, estimates \nthat the section of this bill permitting companies to download copies \nof regulatory forms to be filed and stored digitally rather than \nphysically will, by itself, save that company $1-2 billion per year.\n  Efficiency in the federal government itself will also be enhanced by \nthis legislation. By forcing government bureaucracies to enter the \ndigital information age we will force them to streamline their \nprocedures and enhance their ability to maintain accurate, accessible \nrecords. This should result in significant cost savings for the federal \ngovernment as well as increased efficiency and enhanced customer \nservice.\n  Each and every year, Mr. President, Americans spend in excess of $6 \nbillion hours simply filling out, documenting and handling government \npaperwork. This huge loss of time and money constitutes a significant \ndrain on our economy and we must bring it under control. The easier and \nmore convenient we make it for American businesses to comply with \npaperwork and reporting requirements, the better job they will do of \nmeeting these requirements, and the better job they will do of creating \njobs and wealth for our country. That is why we need this legislation.\n  The information age is no longer new, Mr. President. We are in the \nmidst of a revolution in the way people do business and maintain \nrecords. This legislation will force Washington to catch up with these \ndevelopments, and release our businesses from the drag of an obsolete \nbureaucracy as they pursue further innovations. The result will be a \nnation and a people that is more prosperous, more free and more able to \nspend time on more rewarding pursuits.\n  I want to thank my colleagues in the Senate for their support and \nurge the House to support this important legislation. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a statement of intent for the Government Paperwork \nElimination Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Statement of Intent on the Government Paperwork Elimination Act--\n             Senator Abraham, Senator Wyden, Senator McCain\n\n\n         I. Purpose of the Government Paperwork Elimination Act\n\n       The Act, as reported, would require Federal agencies to \n     make electronic versions of their forms available online and \n     would allow individuals and businesses to use electronic \n     signatures to file these forms electronically. The intent of \n     the bill is to provide a framework for reliable and secure \n     electronic transactions with the Federal government, while \n     remaining ``technology neutral'' and not inappropriately \n     favoring one industry over another.\n\n\n                        II. Background and Needs\n\n       The widespread use and world-wide accessibility of the \n     Internet provides the opportunity for enhanced electronic \n     commerce and substantial paperwork reduction. State \n     governments, industry, and private citizens have already \n     embraced the electronic medium to conduct public and private \n     business. Allowing businesses and individuals to conduct \n     their affairs with the Federal government within a stable \n     legal framework would save financial resources by eliminating \n     burdensome paperwork and bureaucracy.\n       The widespread use of electronic forms can greatly improve \n     the efficiency and speed of government services. Such efforts \n     as people traveling to government offices for forms would no \n     longer be required. If implemented, the bill would save the \n     government million of dollars in cost associated with such \n     things as copying, mailing, filing and storing forms.\n       Electronic signatures can offer greater assurances that \n     documents are authentic and unaltered. They minimize the \n     chances of forgeries or people claiming to have had their \n     signatures forged.\n       An electronic signature is a method of indicating that a \n     particular person has originated and approved the contents of \n     an electronic document. There are a wide array of electronic \n     signature technologies currently available, which range from \n     simply typing one's name on an electronic document or e-mail, \n     to scanning a handwritten signature as a bitmap and copying \n     it onto an electronic document. More technologically complex \n     versions of electronic signatures involve the analysis of \n     physical characteristics (biometrics) such as fingerprints, \n     retina scans, and the biometrics of an actual signature to \n     digitally verify the signer's identity. The widely referred-\n     to ``digital signature'' is slightly different, and is merely \n     one type of electronic signature which often, although not \n     always, involves the use of trusted third parties.\n       Security levels for all electronic signatures vary \n     according to the technology used. Simply typing a name on a \n     document offers no security protection, and cannot be \n     verified as unique to the originator. Bitmaps, which are \n     digital versions of handwritten signatures, require large \n     amounts of memory, are vulnerable to copying or pasting, and \n     cannot be used to accurately tie the document to the \n     signature. Electronic signature technologies which use \n     biometric analysis offer a higher level of security. Digital \n     signatures and the use of licensed third parties also yield a \n     higher degree of security.\n       Several states have enacted electronic signature \n     legislation with varying scopes and legal requirements. Some \n     states have chosen to limit the scope of the law to \n     transactions with state or public entities, or even to more \n     specific purposes such as court documents, medical records, \n     and state treasurer checks and drafts. Other states have \n     applied their statutes to private as well as public \n     transactions. State statues also have varying technology \n     requirements which highlight the potential for future \n     compatibility and interoperability problems.\n\n\n                    III. Summary of Major Provisions\n\n       As reported, the Government Paperwork Elimination Act would \n     provide a legal framework and time line for electronic \n     transactions between individuals and businesses and the \n     Federal government. Major provisions of the Act, as reported, \n     include:\n       1. Each Federal agency would be required to make electronic \n     versions of their forms available for electronic submission. \n     Such electronic submission would be supported by guidelines \n     issued by the Director of Office of Management and Budget \n     (OMB) and the National Telecommunications Information \n     Administration.\n       2. The bill establishes the following time lines:\n       (1) At 18 months, the Secretary of Commerce will report on \n     the bill's effect on electronic commerce and individual \n     privacy, agencies will make electronic forms available for \n     downloading and printing, agencies will permit employers to \n     store Federal forms electronically, and agencies will \n     establish policies and procedures for implementation of this \n     Act.\n       (2) At 60 months, final implementation deadline.\n       3. The bill provides definitions of key terms, and \n     specifies under what circumstances, and in what special \n     cases, an agency is not required to provide for the \n     electronic submission of forms.\n\n\n                        IV. Legislative History\n\n       The Government Paperwork Elimination Act, S. 2107, was \n     introduced by Senator Abraham on May 21, 1998. The bill was \n     co-sponsored by Senator Wyden, Senator McCain, and Senator \n     Reed. In June 1998, Senator Lott, Senator Cochran, and \n     Senator Burns were added as co-sponsors to the bill. On July \n     15, 1998 the Commerce Committee held a hearing on digital \n     signatures at which time testimony was heard from Mr. Andrew \n     Pincus, General Counsel, Department of Commerce; Mr. Scott \n     Cooper, Manager, Technology Policy, Hewlett Packard; Mr. Kirk \n     LeCompte, Vice President, Product Marketing, PenOp Inc.; and \n     Mr. Dan Greenwood, Deputy General Counsel, Information \n     Technology Division, The Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n       On July 29, 1998 the Committee met in executive session \n     and, by a voice vote, ordered the bill, as amended, to be \n     reported.\n       On September 17, 1998 the bill was reported to the Senate \n     with an amendment in the nature of a substitute by the Senate \n     Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation and placed \n     on the Senate Legislative.\n       On October 7, 1998, the bill was added as amendment # 3678 \n     to S. 442, the Internet Tax Freedom Act by unanimous consent.\n       On October 8, 1998, the Internet Tax Freedom Act was passed \n     by the Senate and sent to the House of Representatives.\n       On October 15, 1998, S. 2107 was passed in the Senate by \n     unanimous consent.\n       On October 21, the bill passed the Senate as part of the \n     Omnibus Appropriations Act.\n\n\n                               V. Privacy\n\n       This legislation will not have an adverse impact on the \n     privacy of individuals. The Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget, in cooperation with the Administrator \n     of the National Telecommunications Information Administration \n     will conduct an ongoing study of the Act's impact on \n     individual privacy.\n\n\n                             VI. Paperwork\n\n       This legislation will not increase the paperwork \n     requirement for private individuals or businesses. The \n     legislation would require two reports: (1) the Secretary of \n     Commerce would be required to submit to Congress a report on \n     the Act's effect on electronic commerce and individual \n     privacy; and (2) the General Accounting Office would be \n     required to submit to Congress a report on agencies' \n     policies, procedures, and timeliness for the implementation \n     of this Act.\n\n\n     VII. Section-by-section Analysis Of The Government Paperwork \n                            Elimination Act\n\n            Title XVII Government Paperwork Elimination Act\n\n       Section 1. This section would permit the bill to be cited \n     as the ``Government Paperwork Elimination Act.''\n       Section 2. Authority of OMB to Provide For Acquisition And \n     Use Of Alternative Information Technologies By Executive \n     Agencies. Amends current law to provide for the availability \n     of electronic submission as a substitute for paper and for \n     the use and acceptance of electronic signatures.\n\n[[Page S12686]]\n\n       Section 3. Procedures For Use And Acceptance Of Electronic \n     Signatures By Executive Agencies. Subsection (1) would \n     require the Office of Management and Budget, in consultation \n     with the National Telecommunications Information \n     Administration to develop procedures for the use and \n     acceptance of electronic signatures by Executive agencies.\n       Subsection (2) establishes the requirements for these \n     procedures. Paragraph (i) would ensure that these procedures \n     would be compatible with those used in the commercial and \n     State government sectors. Paragraph (ii) would require that \n     these procedures would not inappropriately favor one industry \n     or technology. The intent of the bill is for the government \n     to remain ``technology neutral.'' And, so as not to prescribe \n     one electronic signature security level for all documents, \n     paragraph (iii) would allow the security level to be \n     commensurate with the document's sensitivity. Paragraph (iv) \n     would require agencies to electronically acknowledge the \n     submission of electronic forms. Paragraph (v) would require \n     agencies to ensure multiple methods of electronic submission \n     when it expects to receive 50,000 electronic submittal of a \n     particular form, paragraph E would require the agency to make \n     multiple electronic signature formats available for \n     submitting the forms. To further ensure technology \n     neutrality, ``multiple methods'' are required when a form is \n     submitted in substantial enough volume so that the government \n     does not favor a particular technology provider by accepting \n     only one electronic signature technology.\n       The intent of the bill is not to mandate the use of a \n     particular technology. Rather, the bill is intended to be \n     technology neutral leaving open the possibility that a wide \n     variety of existing technologies or technologies that will be \n     developed in the future may be used by the Federal government \n     in satisfying the requirements of this bill.\n       Section 4. Deadline For Implementation By Executive \n     Agencies Of Procedures For Use And Acceptance Of Electronic \n     Signatures. Requires that, when practicable, Federal forms \n     must be available for electronic submission, with electronic \n     signatures within 60 months after enactment.\n       Section 5. Electronic Storage And Filing Of Employment \n     Forms. After 18 months from enactment, the Office of \n     Management and Budget shall develop procedures to permit \n     employers that are required by law to collect, file and store \n     Federal forms concerning their employees, to collect, file \n     and store the same forms electronically.\n       Section 6. Study On Use Of Electronic Signatures. This \n     section would require the Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget, in cooperation with the National \n     Telecommunications Information Administration to conduct an \n     ongoing study on how this bill affects electronic commerce \n     and individual privacy. A periodic report describing the \n     results shall be submitted to the Congress.\n       Section 7. Enforceability and Legal Effect of Electronic \n     Records.\n       This section stipulates that electronic records, or \n     electronic signatures or other forms of electronic \n     authentication, submitted in accordance with agency \n     procedures, will not be denied legal effect, validity or \n     enforceability because they are in electronic form. This \n     provision is intended to preclude agencies or courts from \n     systematically treating electronic documents and signatures \n     less favorably than their paper counterparts.\n       Section 8. Disclosure Of Information. This section is \n     intended to protect the privacy of individuals who submit \n     information electronically to Federal agencies. Information \n     submitted by individuals may only be used to facilitate \n     electronic communications between that individual and the \n     agency and may not be disclosed by agency employees without \n     the affirmative consent of that individual. This section is \n     not intended to supersede current law in this area.\n       Section 9. Application With Other Laws. This section would \n     exempt the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Department \n     of the Treasury from the provisions in this Act, when in \n     conflict with the administration of internal revenue laws or \n     conflicts the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and \n     Reform Act of 1998 or the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \n     IRS collection process should also be exempted from this Act.\n       Section 10. Definitions. This section would provide the \n     definitions of several key terms used throughout this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/20/senate-section/article/S12684-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12686-S12688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CHARITABLE CHOICE\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, recently, both the House and Senate \nvoted unanimously to pass the conference report on S. 2206, the ``Coats \nHuman Services Reauthorization Act of 1998.'' During House debate on \nthe conference report, some members expressed concerns regarding bill \nlanguage described as the ``charitable choice'' provision, which is \nsimilar to language I drafted for the welfare reform law passed in the \n104th Congress and signed by the President in August of 1996.\n  As I have said in a previous floor statement, the charitable choice \nprovision will expand the opportunities for private, charitable, and \nreligious organizations to serve their communities with Community \nServices Block Grant (CSBG) funds. This provision expresses the \njudgment of Congress that these organizations can play a crucial role \nin helping people out of poverty through the CSBG program.\n  I am confident that the charitable choice language in the Community \nServices Block Grant reauthorization is constitutional and represents \nsound public policy. However, I want to respond to the comments made \nregarding this provision, as critics of the provision seem to overlook \nrecent case law of the Supreme Court regarding this issue, and even \nmischaracterize certain sections of the charitable choice provision.\n  First, most of the concerns expressed by certain House members are \nbased upon case law that does not represent the current jurisprudence \nof the Supreme Court. In recent years, the general trajectory of the \nSupreme Court's Establishment Clause cases has been in the direction of \nwhat constitutional scholars describe as ``neutrality theory.'' Under \nthis theory, private organizations are eligible to provide government-\nfunded services to beneficiaries through contracts, grants, or vouchers \nwithout regard to religious character. Moreover, there are serious \nconstitutional problems when the government screens potential service \nproviders based upon religious beliefs and practices--which is what the \ncritics of charitable choice want to do.\n  The charitable choice provision in the 1996 welfare reform law and \nthe Child Care Development Block Grant Program of 1990 conform to the \nprinciple of religious neutrality. Under the first legislation, \ncharitable and faith-based organizations are eligible, on the same \nbasis as all other non-governmental organizations, to receive federal \nfunds to provide services to welfare recipients. Similarly, the child \ncare law allows low-income parents to choose among an array of private \nproviders--including religious ones--in obtaining federally funded day \ncare services.\n  The test the Supreme Court has used over the years to analyze \nEstablishment Clause cases has been the ``Lemon test,'' which has the \ntwo-fold requirement that the government action in question must have a \nvalid secular legislative purpose, and a primary effect that neither \nenhances nor inhibits religion. (In the recent case of Agostini v. \nFelton, the Court took the third prong, the ``entanglement'' analysis, \nand folded it into the second prong of the test). The first prong, \nrequiring a valid secular purpose, is usually not subject to much \ncontroversy, as the Court has been highly deferential to the \nlegislature's action. In its review of the Adolescent Family Life Act \n(AFLA), for example, the Court noted that the ``provisions of the \nstatute reflect at most Congress' considered judgment that religious \norganizations can help solve the problems to which the AFLA is \naddressed. Nothing in our previous cases prevents Congress from making \nsuch a judgment or from recognizing the important part that religion or \nreligious organizations may play in resolving certain secular \nproblems.''\n  The serious debate generally concerns the second prong of the Lemon \ntest, namely, whether the ``primary effect'' of these social welfare \ninitiatives is to advance religion. In neutrality theory, Lemon's \nprimary-effect inquiry is accomplished by examining how a service \nprovider actually spends the program monies. Obviously, the test is \nwhether funds are being spent in accordance with the valid secular \npurposes set out in the governing statute, and as expressed in the \nservice contract or grant at issue. These purposes necessarily exclude \nuse of the monies for inherently religious programming.\n  On the other hand, critics of charitable choice would argue that the \nprimary-effect inquiry should focus on whether a service provider is \nreligious in character, and if so, how religious. An organization found \n``too religious'' is dubbed ``pervasively sectarian,'' thereby \ndisqualifying the organization as a provider of government-funded \nservices.\n  In recent years, the Supreme Court has been moving away from this \n``too religious'' versus ``secular enough'' inquiry, and toward the \nneutrality approach. Two of the Court's most recent pronouncements on \nthis issue are\n\n[[Page S12687]]\n\nAgostini v. Felton and Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the \nUniversity of Virginia. Although the Court did not embrace the \nneutrality principle in these cases without certain qualifications, the \nlaw today is far closer to neutrality than to the ``no-aid \nseparationism'' of the 1970s and mid-1980s espoused by critics of \ncharitable choice.\n  In Agostini, decided in 1997, the Court held that remedial education \nfor disadvantaged students could be provided on the premises of K \nthrough 12 religious schools--the only entities the Court has declared \nin the past to be ``pervasively sectarian.'' The Court was no longer \nwilling to assume that direct assistance would be diverted to the \ninculcation of religion by authorities at Roman Catholic elementary and \nsecondary schools.\n  In the 1995 Rosenberger case, the Court held that a state university \ncould not deny student activity fund money, which was generally \navailable to all students groups for student publications, to a certain \nstudent group based upon the religious content of its publication. The \nCourt warned that the government's attempt to draw distinctions \nregarding religious content would require the government--and \nultimately the courts--``to inquire into the significance of words and \npractices to different religious faiths, and in varying circumstances \nby the same faith. Such inquiries would tend inevitably to entangle the \nState with religion in a manner forbidden by our cases.'' The critics \nwould ignore this warning in order to apply their ``too religious'' \ntest.\n  Several prominent constitutional law scholars have recognized the \nCourt's movement toward neutrality, including Professor Douglas Laycock \nof the University of Texas, Professor John Garvey of Notre Dame, \nProfessor Michael McConnell of the University of Utah, Professor \nMichael Paulsen of the University of Minnesota, and finally, Professor \nCarl H. Esbeck of the University of Missouri. Professor Esbeck worked \nclosely with my staff to draft the charitable choice provision of the \nwelfare law, as well as my Charitable Choice Expansion Act, which I \nintroduced earlier this year.\n  The consequences of relying upon the view propounded by critics of \nthe charitable choice concept go beyond ignoring recent constitutional \njurisprudence. They also result in bad public policy. Demanding that \nreligious ministries ``secularize'' in order to qualify to be a \ngovernment-funded provider of services hurts intended beneficiaries of \nsocial services, as it eliminates a fuller range of provider choices \nfor the poor and needy, frustrating those beneficiaries with spiritual \ninterests.\n  In examining a neutral program that includes both religious and \nsecular providers, what matters is how the government money is actually \nspent, not the ideological character of the provider. Strict adherence \nto the ``too religious'' distinction perpetuated by the critics could \nactually eliminate current successful providers from eligibility to \nreceive government funds.\n  Congress should continue to find ways to encourage successful \ncharitable and faith-based organizations to unleash their effective \ngood works upon society. The charitable choice provision is one such \nway to accomplish this goal.\n  In their discussion of the charitable choice provisions in the CSBG \nreauthorization bill, critics fail to acknowledge a valid distinction \nmade by the Supreme Court: the difference between direct and indirect \nfunding of government programs. When a program is administered through \nthe use of certificates or vouchers given to beneficiaries, the \nreligious nature of the organization at which the beneficiary redeems \nthe voucher is irrelevant.\n  The Supreme Court has consistently held that government may confer a \nbenefit on individuals, who exercise personal choice in the use of \ntheir benefit at similarly situated institutions, whether public, \nprivate nonsectarian, or religious, even if the benefit indirectly \nadvances religion. The Court has made these rulings in Zobrest v. \nCatalina Foothills School District (1993), a case holding that the \nprovision of special education services to a Catholic high student was \nnot prohibited by Establishment Clause; in Mueller v. Allen (1983), \nwhere it upheld a state income tax deduction for parents paying \nreligious school tuition; and in Witters v. Washington Department of \nServices for the Blind (1986), where the Court upheld a state \nvocational rehabilitation grant to disabled student choosing to use his \ngrant for training as a cleric.\n  Moreover, the Child Care and Development Block Grant program, which \nhas been in existence since 1990, allows parents to send their children \nto day care centers that are unquestionably ``pervasively sectarian'' \nin nature. This program has never been challenged as being violative of \nthe Establishment Clause.\n  Should a community wish to set up a Community Services Block Grant \nprogram that gives individual beneficiaries vouchers or certificates to \nredeem at the location of their choice, there is no constitutional \nconcern as to the religious nature of the organization providing \nservices to that beneficiary.\n  There were also concerns expressed on the House floor that \nindividuals would be directed by the government to religious \norganizations to receive Community Services Block Grant Services and \nforced to participate in religious activities. These concerns indicate \nthat some members may not fully understand how the Community Services \nBlock Grant program operates. Under this program, beneficiaries choose \nwhere they want to receive CSBG services--the government does not force \ncertain individuals into certain programs.\n  CSBG services are not federal entitlements. This program was designed \nin the 1960s to provide flexible federal funding to communities to \nidentify problems and needs in the community, and to then fashion and \ndesign a local solution. This is not a federally-directed solution. \nRather, the CSBG program allows the community to find the most \nappropriate organizations in the community to offer different types of \nservices to individuals.\n  Community Services Block Grant services are offered voluntarily to \nindividuals in the community. People are not directed into these \nprograms by the government. In fact, there are most likely existing \ngovernment programs in the community, offering similar types of \nservices, such as job training, basic education courses, and housing \nservices. The Community Services Block Grant program maximizes \nindividual choice at the local level by providing services to those who \nare fighting their way out of poverty.\n  Therefore, those who say that the charitable choice provision in the \nCSBG program is going to force individuals into religious programs and \nprovide no alternatives misunderstand how the CSBG program operates.\n  The critics are also wrong when they say that a faith-based provider \ncan compel a beneficiary to go to worship services or to submit to an \nattempt of proselytization. The argument fails to acknowledge that the \ncharitable choice provision contains language stating that ``[n]o funds \nprovided directly to organizations shall be expended for sectarian \nworship, instruction, or proselytization.'' Thus, CSBG funds must not \nbe used to carry out inherently religious purposes. Rather, the funds \nare for the secular public purposes of the legislation, which include \nreducing poverty, revitalizing low-income communities, and empowering \nlow-income families and individuals in rural and urban areas to become \nfully self-sufficient, especially those families who are attempting to \ntransition off of welfare.\n  Therefore, the structure of the Community Services Block Grant \nprogram, along with the clearly spelled-out uses of and prohibitions on \nCSBG funding, ensure that beneficiaries will have maximized choices of \nwhere to receive services to help them escape poverty and reach self-\nsufficiency.\n  One argument was made that the charitable choice provision could \nresult in the government having to provide financial audits of churches \nand other religious organizations who might be eligible for funds under \na charitable choice program.\n  This statement appears to express a concern that a religious \norganization would subject itself to government intrusion by its \nreceipt of CSBG funds. I share this concern, and for that reason, I \nincluded in the charitable choice provision language protecting a \nreligious organization from such intrusion. This language requires a \nreligious organization to segregate government funds\n\n[[Page S12688]]\n\nfrom funds received from non-government sources. Additionally, the \nprovision states explicitly that only government funds are subject to \ngovernment audit.\n  Therefore, the charitable choice provision protects participating \nreligious organizations from unwarranted governmental oversight, while \nalso holding such organizations financially accountable in the same way \nas all other non-governmental providers receiving government funding.\n  There was also a statement made on the House floor that the \ncharitable choice provision ``would seek to enact exemptions from the \nreligious discrimination clauses of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.'' \nThis is a misstatement of what the provision says. Charitable choice \ndoes not create an exemption from the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Rather, \nit states that it preserves the exemption in the law allowing religious \norganizations to make employment decisions based on religion. The \nSupreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of this provision in \nCorporation of the Presiding Bishop v. Amos (1987). Receiving \ngovernment funds for a secular purpose does not, of course, result in a \nwaiver of this exemption. See, e.g., Siegel v. Truett-McConnell \nCollege, 1994 WL 932771 (N.D. Ga. 1994).\n  If a religious nonprofit organization must hire persons in open \ndisagreement with the religious background and mission of the \norganization, its religious autonomy would be severely infringed. In \nfact, many successful faith-based organizations have stated that they \nwould not take government funding if it would require them to hire \nemployees who did not hold the same religious beliefs of the \norganization. For example, the International Union of Gospel Missions \nconducted a survey of their missions and found that some of these \nmissions refused government funding if it required them to hire non-\nChristians.\n  The Charitable Choice makes clear that a religious organization \nmaintains its Title VII exemption when it receives government funds to \nprovide social services.\n  There was also an argument made that the charitable choice provision \nwould require the government to consider using fringe religious groups \nto provide CSBG services. Although I find this to be more of a scare \ntactic than a legitimate argument, I think it is obvious that the \ncharitable choice provision will not require the government to blindly \nselect any non-governmental organization that applies for CSBG funds. \nThe government may require legitimate, neutral criteria to all who \napply. No organization, religious or otherwise, can become a provider \nunless it can deliver on its grant or contract.\n  Finally, there was an argument that the charitable choice provision \ncould override the constitutional language of states prohibiting public \nfunds from going to religious organizations. I would simply respond \nthat the charitable choice provisions are in federal law dealing with \nfederal dollars. We do not tell the states how to spend their own state \ntax funds.\n  In conclusion, the opponents of the charitable choice concept have \nnot taken into account the latest Establishment Clause jurisprudence. \nIf there is a comprehensive, religiously neutral program, the question \nis not whether an organization is of a religious character, but how it \nspends the government funds.\n  To reject charitable choice is to jeopardize Congress' ability to \nencourage proven, effective religious organizations to provide social \nservices to our nation's needy with government funds. For years, these \norganizations have been transforming broken lives by addressing the \ndeeper needs of individuals--by instilling hope and values that help \nchange behavior and attitudes. By contrast, government-run programs \nhave often failed in moving people from dependency and despair to \nindependence. We must continue to find ways to allow private, \ncharitable, and religious organizations to help administer the cultural \nremedy that our society so desperately needs. The charitable choice \nprovision in the ``Coats Human Services Reauthorization Act of 1998'' \nis one way of accomplishing this goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/20/senate-section/article/S12686-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE LEGENDARY FRANK YANKOVIC\n\n  Mr. DeWINE.

JANE HENNEY TO THE FDA\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the nomination of Dr. \nJane Henney to be Commissioner of FDA.\n  Mr. President, the nomination of the FDA commissioner is one of the \nmost important nominations the Senate has considered this year. The FDA \nregulates products comprising twenty-five cents of every dollar spent \nby consumers in this country. It deals with literally life and death \nissues on a daily basis. Given the significant impact the FDA has on \nthe life of every American, it is important that the Senate exercise \ncaution to ensure the next Commissioner is qualified and capable of \nleading the Agency.\n  I have let Dr. Henney know, and I let Secretary Shalala know, that I \nhad some concern with FDA as it has been administered for the last few \nyears. The FDA should be a non-partisan science based Agency which \nfocuses solely on its mission to ensure the safety of food and to \nexpeditiously review drugs and medical devices which are intended to \nsave and extend lives. And for this reason I felt I needed personal \nassurance from Dr. Henney that under\n\n[[Page S12689]]\n\nher leadership the FDA would focus on its Congressionally mandated \nmission.\n  FDA is supposed to be an agency that works to improve our health, \nthat works to make sure that drugs and other medical devices are safe \nand effective. What we have found, under Dr. Kessler's regime, \nparticularly during the Clinton administration, was that the FDA was \ninvolved in a lot of political activity. Under the leadership of David \nKessler, the Agency too often became a tool of the Administration to \npush its liberal political agenda. One area where this was particularly \noffensive was the FDA's attempt to regulate tobacco.\n  Let me give an example of where I believe they exceeded their \nauthority. In my State, just recently--I tell my colleagues, this is \ngoing to happen in every State--an FDA talking paper announced that \n``FDA Partners With Oklahoma To Protect Children From Tobacco.''\n\n       The Food and Drug Administration has contracted with the \n     Oklahoma State Dept. of Health to enforce the FDA's new \n     regulation that prohibits retailers from selling cigarettes \n     and smokeless tobacco to children under 18.\n\n  I will go on:\n\n       Under the contract, the State of Oklahoma will receive \n     [$312,000] to conduct approximately 4,500 unannounced retail \n     compliance checks over the next 12 months.\n\n  It goes on:\n\n       The FDA will seek a fine of $250 for the second violation, \n     $1,500 for the third [violation], $5,000 for the fourth, and \n     $10,000 for the fifth.\n\n  So, if a convenience store doesn't comply and they don't check IDs--\nand they have to check IDs up to age 27. In Oklahoma, it is legal to \nsmoke when you are 18--but if a youngster, who is maybe 19, working in \na convenience store, doesn't check somebody's identification who might \nbe 26 or 27 years old, they can be fined up to $10,000. Somebody might \nsay, ``Where is this idea originating? It is legal for them to smoke, \nbut if they don't check IDs of somebody up to age 27 they can be fined \n$10,000?''\n  This is implementing FDA's regulation. FDA's regulation, in my \nopinion, is unconstitutional. They don't have the authority to write \nthe law.\n  The Constitution says in article I, section 1:\n\n       All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a \n     Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a \n     Senate and House of Representatives.\n\n  Where did this regulation come from? It came from FDA, and it came \nfrom the FDA Administrator, working with the Clinton administration, to \nbasically implement a very, I think, political agenda. I might mention \nthat the regulations are being contested in court, and most of those \nregulations are being thrown out. In fact, on August 14, 1998, the \nFourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Congress did not intend to \ngive the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the authority to \nregulate tobacco. In a 2-1 decision the Appeals Court tossed out a 1997 \nfederal district court ruling that gave FDA only limited power to \nregulate tobacco. ``The FDA has exceeded the authority granted to it by \nCongress.'' So said Circuit Judge H. Emory Widener Jr., on behalf of \nthe three-member panel.\n  I happen to favor regulation on tobacco, but I think Congress needs \nto act on it. The FDA does not have the authority to create it out of \nwhole cloth, which is certainly what they did. I favor some decent \nregulations. I don't favor the idea of having a team of people making \n4,500 unannounced retail compliance checks all over my State and the \nFederal Government spending over $300,000 implementing this type of \nplan, or having the regs be so ridiculous we are going to be checking \nIDs up to age 27. I don t support regulations that allow the FDA to \nfine people and businesses who don't comply, up to $10,000 per \nviolation, basically, fining them out of existence. That doesn't make \nsense.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my \nstatement, an FDA talking paper, which announces this implementing \nregulation which has the force and effect of fines up to $10,000, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, another area where I have seen FDA become \nvery involved in the political arena deals with the abortion drug RU-\n486. I have a press release that is dated May 16, 1994. The headline \nis: ``Roussel Uclaf Donates U.S. Patent Rights for RU-486 to Population \nCouncil.''\n  The first paragraph says:\n\n       HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala announced today that French \n     pharmaceutical company Roussel Uclaf, at the encouragement of \n     the Clinton administration, is donating, without \n     remuneration, its United States patent rights for \n     mifepristone (RU-486) to the Population Council, Inc., a not-\n     for-profit corporation.\n\n  Then further in the press release it says:\n\n       ``FDA will do all it can to quickly evaluate \n     mifepristone,'' said Shalala.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this press release be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, this is an administration that had FDA go \nout and recruit a company that manufactures RU-486, a French company, \nto donate its patent rights to a group which is an abortion proponent \nin the United States and then was doing everything they could to \nexpedite the process.\n  RU-486 is an abortion pill which terminates the life of a human \nembryo between FOUR weeks and NINE weeks. It is NOT a contraceptive as \nsome would have us believe. It is a drug which will stop the beating \nheart of an unborn child.\n  In January 1993, President Clinton issued a memo to Sec. Shalala \ndirecting her to promptly ``assess initiatives by which HHS can promote \nthe testing and manufacturing of RU-486 in the US.''\n  Thereafter, the FDA engaged in negotiations with Roussel Uclaf, \nFrench manufacturer and holder of US Patent rights, regarding the \ntesting and marketing of RU-486 in the US.\n\n       In May 1994, Shalala issued this press release, I \n     mentioned, announcing the deal and promising FDA would do \n     everything it could to ``quickly evaluate the drug.'' FDA \n     pushed the drug through the review process in a fraction of \n     time required for most drugs.\n\n  FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research reported that the \nmedian total review time for new drug applications in 1996 was 14.8 \nmonths. FDA review time for RU-486 was only 6 months.\n  At a time when the agency was struggling to approve drugs which cure \ndiseases and save lives, the Agency was focusing a great deal of time \nand effort on a political agenda which would end the life of an unborn \nchild.\n  I am offended by that, and I asked Dr. Henney:\n  Are you going to be promoting an abortion drug? Is that what an FDA \nCommissioner is supposed to do? Is that their purpose?\n  I thought the purpose of FDA was to make sure drugs were safe and \neffective and that medical devices are safe and effective so people can \nhave some confidence in these products. I didn't know it was the \npurpose of FDA to recruit companies to bring abortion drugs to into \nthis country. That is clearly not their purpose.\n  After talking with Dr. Henney, she assured me that wasn't her \nintention. She gave me a letter, and I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the concluding sentence of her letter \nsays:\n\n       If I am confirmed as Commissioner, I would not solicit a \n     manufacturer for RU-486.\n\n  She also says:\n\n       As a general matter, I believe the Agency should only \n     solicit product applications in extraordinary circumstances \n     in which there is a clear public health need.\n\n  Certainly trying to recruit a manufacturer and provider of abortion \ndrugs doesn't fit in that category, and I appreciate her statement she \nwill not solicit a manufacturer of RU-486.\n  It bothers me that the Secretary of Health and Human Services and \nthis Clinton administration have done so much to circumvent the \nprocess, to use FDA in the process. I think it is politicizing an \nagency that is supposed to be focused on its mission to protect the \npublic health and to expeditiously review drugs and medical devices \nthat will save and extend life.\n  Mr. President, I also met with Secretary Shalala a couple of times \nand\n\n[[Page S12690]]\n\nwanted assurances from her that the Department of Health and Human \nServices would interpret the law as written, would enforce the law as \nwritten and not try to rewrite it.\n  Unfortunately, we found out that the Department of Health and Human \nServices was trying to redefine the Hyde amendment which Congress \ndefined. They were trying to redefine it to broaden the exceptions.\n  The Hyde amendment, as most of my colleagues know, says we will not \nhave Federal funding for abortion except for in cases of rape, incest \nor to save the life of the mother. There is not a mental health \nexemption in that. Many people have tried to put it in. The \nadministration has. But we clearly defined it, Congress defined it as \nthe Hyde amendment, no mental health exception.\n  I have a letter from Secretary Shalala that says this activity will \ncease and they will interpret the Hyde amendment as written.\n  We also found, Mr. President, that under the Kidcare Program HHS had \nmisinterpreted the abortion language. We made it very clear in three \ndifferent sections in that law that abortion was not going to be a \nfringe benefit which we were going to provide for teenagers. We made \nthe language very, very clear.\n  Much to my consternation, we were contacted by officials of the State \nof Virginia who said HHS was trying to mandate that they have abortion \nservices covered even though it was certainly their wish and option \nthat they didn't want that to be the case.\n  After meeting with Secretary Shalala, and after an exchange of \nseveral letters, she finally assured me that wasn't the case. I will \ninsert her letters and mine and Representative Bliley's letter into the \nRecord. But we now have assurances from Secretary Shalala. I will read \nthe last part of her letter sent to me on October 15:\n\n       States are not required to provide abortion services, \n     including abortion services for which coverage is permissible \n     under title XXI of the Social Security Act, under any of the \n     S-CHIP--\n\n  That is the State Children's Health Insurance Program--\n\n     benefit package options in section 2103. No State will be \n     denied approval of its S-CHIP plan because its benefit \n     package under section 2103 does not include coverage of \n     abortion services, including abortion services for which \n     coverage is permissible under title XXI.\n       Thank you for your interest in this matter.\n\n  I am pleased that Secretary Shalala agreed with us that she would \ninterpret the law as written, and that includes both the Hyde language \nand language in the Kidcare program dealing with abortion. I am pleased \nthat I have assurances from Dr. Henney that if she is confirmed \nCommissioner of FDA, she will not recruit manufacturers and providers \nfor an abortion drug, including RU-486.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this entire set of \nletters be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 4.)\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, it is my intent to support the nomination \nof Dr. Henney. After meeting with her a couple of times, and having \ndiscussions on these and other issues, I am confident that she will be \na very able administrator who will not play politics. In my opinion, \nshe doesn't have a political agenda, and I believe she will try to \nadminister the Food and Drug Administration as a professional \norganization to make sure that drugs and medical devices are safe and \neffective for America's population, and that she won't try to implement \nlegislation through regulation.\n  Mr. President, I wasn't the only Senator who had reservations about \nthis nominee. I had reservations until we could get certain \nclarifications. I received those. I have asked they be printed in the \nRecord to substantiate the progress that was made, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support her nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                  [From FDA Talk Paper, Oct. 2, 1998]\n\n      FDA Partners With Oklahoma To Protect Children From Tobacco\n\n       The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has contracted with \n     the Oklahoma State Dept. of Health to enforce FDA's new \n     regulation that prohibits retailers from selling cigarettes \n     and smokeless tobacco products to children under 18.\n       Under the contract, the State of Oklahoma will receive \n     $312,386.75 to conduct approximately 4,500 unannounced retail \n     compliance checks over the next 12 months. Minors in typical \n     dress, accompanied by an adult, will attempt to purchase \n     cigarettes or spit tobacco in retail stores throughout the \n     State of Oklahoma.\n       Information about the compliance checks will be sent to \n     FDA, which will issue a warning for the first violation to \n     retailers found selling to the adolescents. These retailers \n     will be subject to repeat inspections. FDA will seek a fine \n     of $250 for the second violation, $1,500 for the third, \n     $5,000 for the fourth, and $10,000 for the fifth.\n       The first provisions of FDA's final rule to protect \n     children from tobacco took effect Feb. 28, 1997, making age \n     18 the national minimum age to purchase tobacco products and \n     requiring retailers to check photo IDs of anyone under age \n     27. These measures are part of a comprehensive program \n     designed to reduce by half the number of young people who \n     smoke in the next seven years. FDA published the final rule \n     Aug. 28, 1996, with provisions that limit access by children \n     and adolescents to tobacco products and reduce the appeal \n     these products have for underage smokers.\n       Children and adolescents have long had easy access to \n     tobacco products. In 13 studies reviewed by the Surgeon \n     General, minors were successfully able to buy cigarettes 67 \n     percent of the time.\n       In fact, 3,000 children and adolescents become regular \n     smokers every day, and nearly 1,000 will die prematurely from \n     a smoking-related disease.\n       On Aug. 14, 1998, a majority of a three-judge panel of the \n     U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, \n     Va., ruled that FDA lacks the jurisdiction to regulate \n     tobacco products, reversing the decision of the U.S. District \n     Court for the Middle District of North Carolina. However, the \n     Department of Justice is seeking review of this decision by \n     the full Fourth Circuit. Under the court of appeals' rules, \n     unless otherwise directed by the Fourth Circuit, the effect \n     of the decision is automatically stayed, meaning the status \n     quo is maintained until the Court has the opportunity to rule \n     on the government's rehearing request. This means, pending \n     the Court's review, the parts of the FDA tobacco program that \n     have been in effect since February 1997 will remain in effect \n     and that state contracts such as this one with Oklahoma \n     continue to be awarded and implemented.\n       This case involves an appeal of an April 25, 1997, decision \n     from Judge William Osteen of the U.S. District Court in \n     Greensboro, N.C. He ruled that FDA has jurisdiction under the \n     Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act to regulate nicotine-containing \n     cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. The court upheld all \n     restrictions involving youth access and labeling, including \n     the two provisions that went into effect Feb. 28.\n       The State of Oklahoma is one of 53 states and territories \n     that are eligible to contract with FDA. FDA will use a \n     portion of the $34 million it has budgeted this year to \n     assist states in enforcing the regulation and to educate \n     retailers and the general public on the new provisions that \n     went into effect in last February. President Clinton has \n     requested $134 million for tobacco regulation in his FY 1999 \n     budget submission to Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                    [From Eagle Forum, Oct. 9, 1998]\n\n   Roussel Uclaf Donates U.S. Patent Rights for RU-486 to Population \n                                Council\n\n       HHS Secretary Donna E.

The \n     drug is also under study for labor induction, contraception, \n     Cushing's syndrome, endometriosis, meningioma and breast \n     cancer.\n       ``We strongly believe that women in America should have \n     access to the full range of safe and effective alternatives \n     to surgical abortion,'' Shalala said. ``The donation \n     announced today is a big step in that direction.''\n       On Jan. 22, 1993, President Clinton signed a Presidential \n     Memorandum directing the Department of Health and Human \n     Services to assess initiatives to promote the testing and \n     licensing of RU-486 in the United States.\n       Shalala commended Roussel Uclaf and the Population Council \n     for coming to closure after months of complex negotiations \n     amid repeated urging from the Clinton administration.\n       Shalala emphasized, however, that the donation does not \n     mean RU-486 has been approved for use in the United States. \n     The Population Council must conduct clinical trials, identify \n     a manufacturer and submit a new drug application to the Food \n     and Drug Administration.\n       ``The FDA will do all it can to quickly evaluate \n     mifepristone,'' said Shalala. ``FDA's decision will be based \n     solely on the scientific and medical evidence as to the \n     safety and efficacy of the drug. That is our responsibility \n     to the women of America.''\n\n[[Page S12691]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                             HHS Fact Sheet\n\n\n          mifepristone (ru-486). brief overview, may 16, 1994\n\n       On Jan. 22, 1993, in one of his first official acts, \n     President Clinton issued a memorandum directing HHS Secretary \n     Donna E. Shalala to assess initiatives to promote the testing \n     and licensing of mifepristone (RU-486) in the United States.\n       During early 1993, Secretary Shalala and FDA Commissioner \n     David Kessler communicated with senior Roussel Uclaf \n     officials to begin efforts to pave the way for bringing RU-\n     486 into the American marketplace.\n       In April 1993, representatives of FDA, Roussel Uclaf and \n     the Population Council, a not-for-profit organization, met to \n     discuss U.S. clinical trials and licensing of RU-486. Over \n     the last year, the parties continued their negotiations, \n     culminating in the donation announced today. Roussel Uclaf \n     will transfer, without remuneration, its United States \n     patient rights to mifepristone to the Population Council. In \n     turn, the Population Council will take the necessary steps to \n     bring RU-486 to the American market.\n       Mifepristone was developed by the French firm Roussel \n     Uclaf. The drug has been marketed for use to non-surgically \n     terminate pregnancy in France, the United Kingdom and Sweden. \n     There are several investigative trials underway with FDA for \n     other uses of the drug, including contraception, labor \n     induction, Cushing's syndrome, endometriosis, meningioma and \n     breast cancer.\n       It must be recognized that termination of a pregnancy is \n     not a simple medical procedure, whether it is done surgically \n     or through a medical regimen. In France, the United Kingdom \n     and Sweden, where RU-486 has been administered to \n     approximately 150,000 women, the procedure requires several \n     visits to the medical facility, a precisc dosing scheme using \n     two different drugs, and close monitoring to care for women \n     who may experience excessive bleeding or other complications. \n     Any use of mifepristone in the United States would have to \n     follow the same type of strict distribution and use \n     conditions.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n                                                 October 14, 1998.\n     Hon.

Donna E. Shalala,\n     Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Secretary: Last July, the Health Care Financing \n     Administration (HCFA) sent to state Medicaid directors a note \n     correctly interpreting the Hyde Amendment as it was enacted \n     in your Department's appropriations bill for FY 1998.\n       ``The recently enacted Appropriations Act contained new \n     requirements for federally funded abortions. One of those \n     requirements is that, in order to receive federal funding, a \n     physician must certify that a woman suffers from a physical \n     disorder, physical injury, or physical illness, including a \n     life-endangering physical condition caused or arising from \n     the pregnancy itself, that would place the woman in danger of \n     death unless an abortion is performed.''\n       That directive forecloses any possible consideration \n     concerning mental health. Yet it now appears that a HCFA \n     departmental meeting has been scheduled to discuss whether \n     some mental problems that have a physical origin might make a \n     patient eligible for a taxpayer-funded abortion. This is the \n     worst kind of bureaucratic loophole-knitting. It must stop.\n       We, therefore, call upon you to take immediate action to \n     investigate and stop any activities that may be taken by \n     officials at HCFA in an effort to circumvent the Hyde \n     Amendment. We also request that you report back to us, by \n     November 1, 1998, your findings regarding this investigation \n     and the action taken by you to halt these activities.\n           Sincerely,\n     Don Nickles,\n                                        Assistant Majority Leader,\n                                                      U.S. Senate.\n     Henry J.

Please let me know if \n     I can be of further assistance in this matter. An identical \n     letter has been sent to Chairman Hyde.\n           Sincerely,\n     Donna E. Shalala.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            U.S. Senate, Office of\n\n\n                                    Assistant Majority Leader,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 7, 1998.\n     Hon. Donna E. Shalala,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Secretary: It has come to our attention that the \n     Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) is wrongly \n     interpreting provisions included in the Balanced Budget Act \n     of 1997 (BBA) regarding Title XXI of the Social Security Act. \n     Despite the clarity of the law, your agency is seeking to \n     compel States to cover abortions under their State Children's \n     Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP) plans HCFA's actions are in \n     direct contravention of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n       As you are aware, Congress codified the Hyde language in \n     the new Title XXI language establishing the S-CHIP program \n     (See sections 2105(c)(1), 2105(c)(7) and 2110(a)(16)). This \n     language prohibits the use of funds under this program to pay \n     for any abortion or to assist in the purchase, in whole or in \n     part, of health benefit coverage that includes coverage of \n     abortion except where the abortion is necessary to save the \n     life of the mother or if the pregnancy is the result of an \n     act of rape or incest.\n       Of particular relevance to the current dispute is the fact \n     that in each of the aforementioned sections, even this \n     limited scope of permissible abortion payment or coverage is \n     triggered by the extent (if any) to which a State elects to \n     include abortion payment or coverage in its S-CHIP State \n     plan. As a result, there exists no requirement that States \n     cover abortions in the case of rape, incest, or life \n     endangerment. Rather, these are the only instances in which a \n     State which chooses to pay for abortions or abortion coverage \n     may do so.\n       In addition to codifying the Hyde amendment, Congress \n     explicitly distinguished in BBA between abortion and \n     medically necessary services under Title XIX of the Social \n     Security Act (See section 4707(e)(1)). By citing abortion as \n     an exception to the standard of medical necessity, Congress \n     removed the basis upon which Medicaid coverage of abortion \n     was previously required.\n       Based on these provisions of law, HCFA has no authority to \n     require any State to provide abortion coverage as part of \n     their Title XXI program. As a result, any disapproval of a \n     State plan on these grounds is contrary to law. We request \n     your immediate written assurance that HCFA will no longer \n     require States to cover abortions under their S-CHIP plans.\n           Sincerely,\n     Don Nickles,\n                                        Assistant Majority Leader.\n     Tom Bliley,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Department of Health\n\n\n                                           and Human Services,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 3, 1998.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     Assistant Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: Thank you for the letter from you and \n     Chairman Bliley concerning abortion coverage under the Title \n     XXI State Children's Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP). As \n     explained in greater detail below, states do have the \n     discretion to determine whether to provide coverage for \n     permissible abortion services in their S-CHIP programs.\n       First, let me say that we have gone to great lengths to \n     ensure that the Department's implementation of the S-CHIP \n     program is consistent with congressional intent and flexible \n     to meet the needs and circumstances of individual states. We \n     have consulted frequently with Members of Congress and staff \n     on a bipartisan basis, and have worked with state officials \n     to facilitate the implementation of their programs. To date, \n     we have approved 42 state plans under the Title XXI program.\n       In addition to the Title XXI Medicaid expansion option, \n     states have three options for insurance coverage under the S-\n     CHIP program, Benchmark, Benchmark-Equivalent, or Secretary-\n     Approved Coverage. States are\n\n[[Page S12692]]\n\n     free to exclude coverage for permissible abortion services in \n     their Benchmark (provided a state's Benchmark plans does not \n     cover abortions) or Benchmark-Equivalent options.\n       To ensure as much consistency as possible in our approval \n     process, we have limited the exercise of our discretion under \n     the third option, Secretary-Approved Coverage, to cases in \n     which the benefits offered under a state's S-CHIP program are \n     the same as under its Medicaid plan. This provided state with \n     the flexibility to use their existing Medicaid programs and \n     structures without have to extend an entitlement to new S-\n     CHIP enrollees. Given the substantial flexibility in design \n     their benefit packages that states enjoy under the Benchmark \n     and Benchmark-Equivalent options, this limited approach to \n     Secretary-Approved Coverage does not unduly constrain the \n     benefits options available to states.\n       Please let me know if I can be of further assistance on \n     these issues. An identical letter has been sent to Chairman \n     Bliley.\n           Sincerely,\n     Donna E. Shalala.\n                                  ____\n\n         U.S. Senate, Office of Assistant Majority Leader,\n                                 Washington, DC, October 13, 1998.\n     Hon. Donna E. Shalala,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Secretary: Thank you for your recent letter. \n     While I appreciate your timely response, I would like \n     specific answers to the concerns that were raised in my \n     earlier letter. On behalf of chairman Bliley and me, I \n     request your direct response to the following questions:\n       (1) On the basis of your letter dated October 13, 1998, is \n     it the Department's view that the Hyde language contained in \n     the S-CHIP program does not require states to provide \n     abortion coverage in the circumstances where the abortion is \n     necessary to save the life of the mother or if the pregnancy \n     is the result of an act of rape or incest (See section \n     2105(c)(1), 2105(c)(7), and 2110(a)(16))?\n       (2) Is it your contention that a state which covers \n     elective abortions under Medicaid and which opts to offer \n     ``Secretary-approved coverage'' under S-CHIP must cover \n     elective abortions for teenage girls under its S-CHIP \n     program?\n       (3) In light of your letter, is it your contention that \n     abortion is no longer considered a ``medically necessary'' \n     service under the Medicaid program (See section 4707(e)(1)?\n       (4) In what manner do you view abortion as ``appropriate \n     coverage for the population of targeted low-income children \n     proposed to be provided such coverage'' by Virginia or any \n     other state which submits an application for Secretary-\n     approved coverage (See section 2103(a)(4))?\n       Again, I request your immediate written response to the \n     questions above. Thank you in advance for your cooperation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Don Nickles,\n     Assistant Majority Leader.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     Department of\n\n\n                                    Health and Human Services,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 14, 1998.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     Assistant Majority leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: Thank you for your most recent letter \n     and the opportunity to clarify our October 13, 1998 response \n     concerning coverage of abortion services under the Title XXI \n     State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).\n       I would like to clarify my response to you concerning the \n     conditions under which I would approve CHIP benefit packages \n     for Title XXI non-Medicaid state programs (S-CHIP). In \n     general, our policy has been that a state must provide a \n     benefit package that is equal to, or better than, Benchmark \n     or Benchmark-Equivalent Coverage. In my letter to you \n     yesterday, I stated that we have limited the exercise of our \n     discretion under the Secretary-Approved Coverage option to \n     cases in which the benefits offered under a state's S-CHIP \n     program are the same as under its Medicaid plan. Indeed, we \n     decided as a matter of policy in devising our S-CHIP \n     implementation process that this approach provided an \n     important benefit option that states might not otherwise \n     have.\n       However, after asking staff to review our records \n     yesterday, it appears that in addition to Medicaid plans, we \n     may have considered as Secretary-Approved Coverage other \n     benefit packages. This occurred in instances in which a state \n     provided benefits in excess of the statutorily defined \n     Benchmarks. Apparently, there was discussion in the \n     Department that it might be desirable to use the Secretary-\n     Approved Coverage option for states that want to provide more \n     benefits than required by law without requiring them to \n     submit a formal actuarial estimate.\n       As a result of this review of our records and staff \n     deliberations, I have decided that as long as a state \n     proposed to provide benefits in excess of Benchmark Coverage, \n     states will not be required to cover permissible abortion \n     services under the Secretary-Approved Coverage option. We \n     have already informed you that states are free to exclude \n     coverage for permissible abortion services in their Benchmark \n     (provided a state's Benchmark plan does not cover abortions) \n     or Benchmark-Equivalent options.\n       I would like to address the specific questions you raised \n     in your October 13, 1998 letter.\n       (1) On the basis of your letter dated October 13, 1998, is \n     it the Department's view that the Hyde language contained in \n     the S-CHIP program does not require states to provide \n     abortion coverage in the circumstances where the abortion is \n     necessary to save the life of the mother or if the pregnancy \n     is the result of an act of rape or incest (See Section 2105 \n     (c)(1), 2105 (c)(7), 2110 (a)(16))?\n       As discussed above, states are not required to provide \n     permissible abortion services under any of the three S-CHIP \n     program options. However, to the extent that a state chooses \n     a package that covers abortion services under the Benchmark \n     option, they must provide these services to the extent they \n     are allowed under the CHIP statute.\n       (2) Is it your contention that a state which covers \n     elective abortions under Medicaid and which opts to offer \n     ``Secretary-approved coverage'' under S-CHIP must cover \n     elective abortions for teenage girls under its S-CHIP \n     program?\n       As discussed above, states are not required to cover \n     permissible abortion services in order to receive Secretary-\n     Approved Coverage. States do, however, have to offer at least \n     the scope of benefits provided in their Benchmark plan.\n       (3) In light of your letter, is it your contention that \n     abortion is no longer considered a ``medically necessary'' \n     service under the Medicaid program (See section 4707(e)(1))?\n       We do not believe that Section 4707(e)(1) affects whether \n     abortion services are medically necessary services under \n     Medicaid. As a general matter, this section of the law \n     describes the intermediate sanction regime a state must put \n     in place in implementing the law. It does not affect the \n     scope of benefits required under a state plan. Specifically, \n     Section (e)(1)(A) permits states to provide for sanctions \n     against any Medicaid managed care organization contracting \n     with a state if that organization fails substantially to \n     provide medically necessary items and services under the law \n     or the organization's contract. Accordingly, if a managed \n     care entity has agreed by contract to provide those services \n     and does not do so, it may be sanctioned by operation of this \n     section of the law. Notwithstanding that provision, Section \n     (e)(1)(B) instructs that there shall not be any sanction \n     imposed on a managed care entity that has contracted with a \n     state and that fails or refuses to provide abortion services, \n     so long as the contract itself reflects no obligation to \n     provide such services. Moreover, the inclusion of these \n     provisions strongly indicates that abortion services are \n     medically necessary services under the Medicaid program, \n     otherwise an exception to the general rule would not have \n     been included.\n       (4) In what manner do you view abortion as ``appropriate \n     coverage for the population of targeted low-income children \n     proposed to be provided such coverage'' by Virginia or any \n     other state which submits an application for Secretary-\n     approved coverage (See Section 2103(a)(4))?\n       Abortion services may be covered under Section 2103(a)(4) \n     to the extent that a state chooses to include coverage for \n     permissible abortion services in its otherwise qualified \n     plan. Limited abortion services qualify as covered services \n     under Section 2110(a)(16) of the CHIP law.\n       I hope this information addresses your concerns. Please let \n     me know if you would like to discuss this matter further.\n           Sincerely,\n     Donna E. Shalala.\n                                  ____\n\n         U.S. Senate, Office of Assistant Majority Leader,\n                                 Washington, DC, October 15, 1998.\n     Hon. Donnal E. Shalala,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Secretary: Thank you for your letter of October \n     14. Chairman Bliley and I have analyzed your responses to the \n     questions posed in the October 13 letter and continue to have \n     grave concerns about the manner in which the Department \n     interprets the plain legislative language of Title XXI of the \n     Social Security Act. In particular, your most recent response \n     states, in part, that ``to the extent that a state chooses a \n     package that covers abortion services under the Benchmark \n     option, they must provide these services to the extent they \n     are allowed under the CHIP [sic] statute.'' (emphasis added)\n       This interpretation has no basis in the statutory language \n     of the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). \n     Section 2103 defines the various options that states have in \n     crafting the benefits package offered through their SCHIP \n     plan. In every instance, states are given the full discretion \n     to establish the specific benefits to be offered to children \n     covered under the state's SCHIP plan. We call your attention \n     to the explicit use of the terms ``equivalent'' in Section \n     2103(a)(1) relating to Benchmark Coverage and Section \n     2103(a)(2) relating to Benchmark-Equivalent Coverage. We also \n     call your attention to the ability of states to ``modify'' \n     the benefits package offered through Section 2103(a)(3), as \n     provided in 2103(d)(2).\n       We appreciate your recognition, as stated in your October \n     14 response, that ``states are not required to provide \n     permissible abortion services under any of the three S-CHIP \n     program options.'' We also appreciate your recognition, as \n     stated in the same letter, that states are not required to \n     provide abortion coverage under the Secretary-Approved \n     Coverage option (Section 2103(a)(4).\n       However, your continuing assertion that any requirement \n     exists in Title XXI of the Social Security Act compelling \n     states to\n\n[[Page S12693]]\n\n     provide abortion coverage or services is unacceptable and \n     contrary to public law.\n       Once again, we request your immediate written response to \n     the concerns stated above. In addition, I invite your staff \n     to meet with our staff as soon as possible to explain the \n     legal basis for the interpretation presented to us in your \n     October 14 letter. Thank you in advance for your cooperation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Don Nickles,\n     Assistant Majority Leader.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     Department of\n\n\n                                    Health and Human Services,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 15, 1998.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     Assistant Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: I wanted to provide further \n     information with respect to issues discussed in our recent \n     correspondence.\n       States are not required to provide coverage of abortion \n     services, including abortion services for which coverage is \n     permissible under Title XI of the Social Security Act, under \n     any of the S-CHIP benefit package options in section 2103. No \n     state will be denied approval of its S-CHIP plan because its \n     benefit package under section 2103 does not include coverage \n     of abortion services, including abortion services for which \n     coverage is permissible under Title XXI.\n       Thank you for your interest in this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Donna E. Shalala.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/20/senate-section/article/S12688-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR KEMPTHORNE\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the Junior \nSenator from Idaho, Mr. Kempthorne. My wife, Jane, and I got to know \nDirk and his wife, Pat, soon after I came to Washington, and they have \nbeen good friends. Pat and Dirk are simply wonderful people, whose \nwarmth and civility make the Senate a better place.\n  Dirk Kempthorne has brought his energy and goodwill with him to the \nSenate every day, making it a better place in which to work and, I am \nsure, improving our ability to work together to pass constructive \nlegislation. In addition, he has brought tremendous insight and common \nsense to the legislative process. I am proud to have worked with him in \npassing Unfunded Mandates legislation in 1995. This bill, which Senator \nKempthorne managed on the floor, is an important step forward for \nAmerican small business and its passage could not have been secured \nwithout his able leadership.\n  Whether as a key member of the Small Business Committee, as Chairman \nof the Drinking Water, Fisheries, and Wildlife subcommittee of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, or as Chairman of the Personnel \nSubcommittee of the Armed Services Committee, Dirk has brought strong \nleadership and reasoned argument to our public policy debates. He was \ninstrumental in initiating the Congressional Commission on Military \nTraining. He laid the groundwork for long overdue reforms to the \nEndangered Species Act; reforms that will protect our wildlife without \nunduly tampering with America's traditional commitment to private \nproperty rights.\n  Dirk has decided, in the interests of his family, to leave Washington \nand return to Idaho. While I am certain all of us here will miss him, \nhe leaves a weighty record of achievement and will continue to serve as \na model of Senatorial conduct for years to come. I know the people of \nIdaho will benefit greatly from his coming service as Governor and wish \nhim, his wife and children, all the best in their return home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/20/senate-section/article/S12693-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12693-S12694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ORGAN TRANSPLANT REGULATIONS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak on a patient care issue of \nenormous importance: regulations being promulgated by the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services (HHS) with respect to organ transplantation.\n  I have long championed the need for our country to bring the \ninnovations of medical science to the forefront of patient treatment, \nbe it through pharmaceutical development, gene mapping, or artificial \norgan development. Nowhere has this been more necessary than in the \nrealm of organ transplantation.\n  Over 14 years ago, with the passage of the National Organ Transplant \nAct (NOTA), Congress intervened to advance medical science at a time \nwhen our health care system was not keeping pace with the tremendous \nadvances medicine had to offer. As a result, we examined the role of \nthe private sector and the Federal government in organ transplantation \nto formulate an equitable policy for individuals throughout this \ncountry to have access to organ transplantation when appropriate and \nnecessary.\n  We needed a better system than that which existed at the time, and \nthat is what NOTA established. As the author of the National Organ \nTransplant Act (NOTA) in 1984, which was cosponsored by our colleagues \nSentors Nickles, Thurmond, Grassley and Roth, I am proud of our \naccomplishment, and I continue to maintain a very keen interest in our \ncountry establishing and operating a viable, effective organ transplant \nnetwork.\n  There is no question that passage of NOTA has allowed us to save \nthousands of lives. The medical community has been transplanting over \n4,000 livers each year. We have seen valuable transplant technology and \nservices spread from only a handful of research institutions to \nhospitals in rural America.\n  In my home State of Utah, LDS Hospital has been able to increase its \nliver transplant volume over 15-fold since its inception only 13 years \nago. We have aspired to promote a system which allows medical science \nto reach the people it was meant to serve, and I believe we are in \nlarge part achieving that goal, in great measure due to enactment of \nNOTA.\n  Today, I stand before the the Senate to urge that we not \nprecipitously reverse that work by allowing implementation of a new \nsystem which could threaten to undermine many of the successful organ \ntransplant centers who are doing so much good in this Nation. Utah's \nown successful transplant center comes to mind, although centers in \nseveral other States such as Alabama, Louisiana, and South Carolina \nwould also be jeopardized if this regulation goes into effect.\n  While we in America are fortunate to enjoy the best health care in \nthe world, we also have concerns about the availability of life saving \ncare should an organ fail. Advances in medicine have made once rare \ntransplants commonplace. Yet, there is a scarcity of organs, despite \nthe hard work of local organ procurement agencies, transplant centers, \nand, indeed, developers of artificial technology such as the work being \ndone on artificial hearts at the University of Utah.\n  Added to this concern about the availability of organs is a growing \nanxiety about the impact of HHS's proposed transplant allocation rules. \nA large source of this concern is within the hard-working transplant \ncommunity. In fact, the Department of Health and Human Services has \nindicated that more than 85% of the almost 18,000 comments received \noppose the organ procurement transplant network final rule.\n  In particular, we are seeing a rising concern about variations in the \navailability of organs from region to region. The HHS response, which \nis to, in effect, nationalize distribution, seems logical at first, but \nupon further reflection is a flawed policy with potentially devastating \nnear-term effects on many transplant centers. By diverting resources \nfrom relatively ``organ-rich'' to relatively ``organ-poor'' regions, \nthe HHS rules penalize communities which have worked to build up \nsuccessful programs, including those which have done so much to improve \nthe harvesting rates of much-needed organs.\n  I commend Secretary Shalala for bringing the need to further improve \nthe organ transplant system to the forefront. One positive step is the \nrecent rule requiring all 5,200 U.S. acute care hospitals to notify an \norgan procurement organization of every death as a condition of \nMedicare participation. Health Care Financing Administrator Nancy Ann \nMin-Deparle estimates that this step alone will increase organ \ndonations by up to 20 percent.\n  While this was a widely supported step, the proposed rules governing \nthe Organ Procurement and Transplant Network have not enjoyed the same \nenthusiasm.\n  In January, I joined 41 other Senators who wrote to Secretary Shalaha \nexpressing concern that the proposed final rule could be used as \nvehicle to turn organ allocation into a political process. Her response \ndid not alleviate my concerns, nor those of the transplant community.\n  We cannot damage the public trust in the organ network, nor in the \ndecisions\n\n[[Page S12694]]\n\nof health professionals who operate the transplant system. While it \nwill never be an easy task to allocate such a critical scarce \nresource--organs--we cannot let this become nothing more than a turf \nwar between large and small transplant centers.\n  Large centers play an important role by being at the heart of the \ninnovations which have brought us the technical advances making current \nliver transplant possible. Smaller centers also make many contributions \nincluding making such technology more accessible to Americans. This \nallows the patient to be closer to family and loved ones during this \nstressful time.\n  We must find a way to increase the organs and reduce the perceived \ninequities in the current system. We need the facts to address the \nproblem.\n  For this reason, I support the provision, which I understand will be \ncontained in the omnibus appropriations bill, that will place a one-\nyear moratorium on the implementation of the HHS rules. This moratorium \nwill allow us to learn the facts necessary to improve the availability \nof transplantation.\n  Mr. President, what we have at stake is not just the amelioration of \na flawed organ transplant procurement and allocation system, but the \nfuture of allocating scare health care resources of all types. It \nbehooves us to proceed carefully on this matter of utmost concern.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/20/senate-section/article/S12693-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12694-S12695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  ADDRESS OF PRESIDENT MARY McALEESE OF IRELAND AT THE KENNEDY LIBRARY\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last Thursday, Mary McAleese, the \nPresident of Ireland, visited Boston and delivered an important address \nat President Kennedy's Library. In her address, she paid tribute to \nPresident Kennedy and to the long-standing ties between Ireland and the \nUnited States, and she spoke eloquently of the peace process in \nNorthern Ireland and Ireland, and the people's hopes for lasting peace \nand a permanent end to the violence.\n  I believe that President McAleese's remarks will be of interest to \nall of us who care about these issues, and I ask unanimous consent that \nit be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n Remarks by the President of Ireland, Mary McAleese at a Dinner Hosted \n by the Kennedy Library Foundation at the John F. Kennedy Presidential \n            Library Boston, Massachusetts, October 15, 1998\n\n       Senator and Mrs. Kennedy, Mayor Menino and Distinguished \n     Guests.\n       On behalf of Martin and myself, as well as our delegation, \n     I want to thank you for your wonderful welcome and \n     hospitality this evening. I would also like to acknowledge \n     the presence here this evening of representatives of the \n     Irish Times, who will be our co-hosts at the Institute of \n     Politics at Harvard tomorrow.\n       It is truly a special moment for me to visit this \n     remarkable Library and Museum, to join the members of your \n     family who are here, and to share this occasion with so many \n     friends of Ireland who are present.\n       Since its foundation the Library has represented the ideals \n     of President Kennedy through a range of research and \n     activities which is truly admirable. I wish to pay tribute to \n     that achievement to you, Senator, to the Library's President \n     Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, to all of your family, as well \n     as the dedicated Board and Staff who have worked so \n     effectively to achieve this and of course to honour also the \n     memory of Senator Robert Kennedy, particularly this year.\n       Just two years ago, as a private citizen, I came to visit \n     here. As for thousands of other Irish visitors to Boston, we \n     feel this is instinctively where we want to come. I was \n     profoundly moved. The Library and Museum must surely be the \n     most outstanding living testimony of its kind. For my \n     generation, growing up in the 1960's, we were of course \n     irrevocably shaped and motivated by that extraordinary time. \n     It means a great deal to me, at a personal level, that my \n     first official event in Boston as President of Ireland should \n     be at the Kennedy Library--I can think of nowhere more \n     appropriate.\n       When we visit here, we are of course sharply reminded of \n     what we lost, butI would prefer to reflect on what we found, \n     on the legacy which we have and the ideals which we must \n     protect. The Kennedy Library is as much about our future as \n     our past.\n       President Kennedy's Irish roots have never been forgotten. \n     His election in 1960 was, for Irish people everywhere, a \n     source of inspiration and joy. None of us will forget the \n     impact of his visit to Ireland at a time of dramatic change \n     and challenge in our own country. As he said in his address \n     to our Parliament in 1963, ``our two nations, divided by \n     distance, have been united by history.'' Those four days \n     which President Kennedy spent in Ireland were unforgettable \n     for all involved. His impact was total, for young and old \n     alike. The words of Ralph Waldo Emerson, another son of New \n     England, perhaps reflect the mood of that time.\n\n       He spoke and words more soft than rain\n       Brought the age of gold again:\n       His action won such reverence sweet\n       As hid all measure of the feet.\n\n       I am pleased to think that in just a few months time, next \n     May, the Dunbrody ship from the President's own County \n     Wexford will sail into this harbour, offering a powerful \n     symbol of the Irish emigrant story and reminding us in \n     particular of the arrival of the Kennedy family in the United \n     States. The emigrant story is part of us all--for many of you \n     here in this room who bear Irish names and constantly \n     acknowledge and celebrate your Irish heritage.\n       One of the great achievements of this Library is the fact \n     that it has established such an important place in the lives \n     of the children of Massachusetts and beyond. Our future is in \n     their hands, as it is also in Northern Ireland.\n       When Mrs. Hillary Clinton visited Northern Ireland last \n     month, she addressed the Vital Voices Conference. She \n     observed then that in Belfast today, a playground is being \n     built with the advice of children on both sides of the \n     community. They will be, literally, architects of their own \n     environment. Since the Good Friday agreement reached last \n     April, and the subsequent elections held in Northern Ireland \n     this summer, all the people living in Northern Ireland have \n     the chance to design and shape their own future. I know that \n     all of you here shared the great joy of that time.\n       The day of the Agreement, however Senator George Mitchell, \n     who did so much to bring the Agreement about, noted that this \n     would not yet put an end to violence and unfortunately this \n     proved to be true. However, despite the awful event in Omagh \n     and other recent tragedies, the Agreement does represent the \n     best opportunity yet for a new beginning, for new structures, \n     for real democracy and equality and for lasting peace. The \n     referendums of this summer have put beyond all doubt that the \n     Agreement is the democratic mandate of the people to their \n     political leaders. A great deal of progress has been made \n     already in forging new partnerships at political, economic \n     and social levels. Difficult work and challenges lie ahead in \n     all of these areas, but, with your help, we are now firmly \n     established on the road to a peaceful future.\n       Tomorrow morning, I look forward to paying tribute to an \n     important and tragic part of that heritage when I visit the \n     Famine Memorial in Boston with Mayor Menino and Tom Flatley. \n     That Memorial, on your Freedom Trail, is a sombre and \n     important reminder of the devastation of that time and of \n     Boston's central place in that story.\n       But we know too that the story of the Irish in \n     Massachusetts in this century is one of overcoming adversity, \n     endeavour, courage and success. Few of us would have dared to \n     dream of how far that success could eventually reach, in \n     1998, in terms of political achievement and economic \n     prosperity. The United States, President Clinton, and \n     outstanding leaders such as Senator Kennedy, have played a \n     central role in both.\n       To Jean, I want to offer our gratitude, affection, and \n     highest respect. Jean, to borrow the Senator's phrase, came \n     back in the springtime. She not only made thousands of \n     friends in Ireland, she became a pivotal figure in our quest \n     for peace. We will miss her very much. She leaves, however, \n     with the satisfaction of knowing that her legacy will remain \n     and that her good work will continue at the American Embassy \n     in Dublin.\n       The tour which we have just enjoyed serves as a powerful \n     reminder both of President Kennedy's life and work but also \n     of the challenges which face us all and particularly those \n     dedicated to public service. This institution reminds us of \n     the challenges of public service and of the obligation which \n     we all share to improve the lives of all, while cherishing \n     the ideals of equality, justice and mutual tolerance. The \n     values inherent in good public service are eloquently \n     represented in this Library. We all need to reinforce those \n     principles constantly in our lives and above all through \n     political leadership.\n       I want to particularly acknowledge the exceptional support \n     from Massachusetts and the city of Boston for their sustained \n     efforts over the years to promote economic development in \n     Northern Ireland. Many of you will be familiar with the \n     tireless work of John Hume, the SDLP leader, with Boston-\n     Derry Ventures to bring much needed jobs to the Derry area. \n     Northern Ireland today continues to rely on your economic \n     assistance. In that regard, I too would like to pay tribute \n     to the generosity and leadership shown by figures such as \n     John Cullinane, present here tonight--and the ``Friends of \n     Belfast'' who are supporting the economic regeneration there, \n     which is so necessary to underpin the Agreement and the peace \n     process. Indeed, I know that here in the Kennedy Library on \n     Tuesday there was a major event to promote economic \n     investment in Northern Ireland.\n       I would also like to acknowledge the tremendous support \n     that John Cullinane is giving to the creation of a National \n     Military\n\n[[Page S12695]]\n\n     Museum at the National Museum of Ireland--which will \n     recognise the enormous contribution of Irish nationals \n     serving in many armies and in many countries over the past \n     250 years--including those who served with distinction in the \n     Armed Forces of the United States--and of course the two \n     hundred thousand from all parts of Ireland, who were proud to \n     serve in the British Army during the First World War--so many \n     of whom paid the ultimate price.\n       The hopes and ideals which we all share for Northern \n     Ireland are represented and cherished under this roof each \n     and every day. As I conclude, I can do no better than to \n     quote from the Library's own words, that in leaving here, we \n     come away with new insights--we are all inspired by President \n     Kennedys vision that one person can make a difference and \n     that every person should try.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/20/senate-section/article/S12694-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12695-S12696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MILITARY READINESS AND THE DEFENSE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, over the past several weeks, the Senate \nArmed Services Committee held a series of hearings to review the status \nof our armed forces. I scheduled these hearings because I have been \nconcerned for some time that the Administration's defense budget was \ninadequate to maintain readiness and because members and staff were \nbringing back anecdotal information indicating the readiness of our \narmed forces was declining.\n  On September 29, the committee heard from General Shelton, the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other members of the Joint \nChiefs, General Reimer, Admiral Johnson, General Ryan, and General \nKrulak. The hearing has been described by the media as adversarial, \nhowever, I would describe it as open, candid and productive. It was not \nsurprising that the Chiefs acknowledged the U.S. military is falling \ninto a readiness crisis and faces the danger of becoming a ``hollow'' \nforce if appropriate measures are not taken. They specifically \nindicated the need for additional resources now and in the out years. \nMost illustrative of the testimony is the following quote by General \nShelton:\n\n       I must admit up front that our forces are showing \n     increasing signs of serious wear. Anecdotal and now \n     measurable evidence indicates that our current readiness is \n     fraying and that the long-term health of the Total Force is \n     in jeopardy.\n\n  Mr. President, on October 6, the committee followed up the hearing \nwith the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with a hearing at which Secretary of \nDefense Cohen and General Shelton testified. Although the focus of the \nhearing was to be primarily on world trouble spots, the readiness \nstatus of our forces also became a subject of intense debate. Secretary \nCohen reiterated the concerns of the service chiefs and indicated that \nhe would seek additional funds in the fiscal year 2000 budget.\n  Mr. President, the indicators that most concerned the service chiefs \nand brought them to the realization that readiness was clearly \ndeclining included downturns in recruiting and retention, a shortfall \nin unit training, and widespread equipment breakdowns and spare parts \nshortages. These are basic indicators whose impact is felt throughout \nthe ranks, in units throughout all the services and affect operations, \ntraining, morale and esprit de corps.\n  Mr. President, when pressed to explain the reasons for the decline in \nreadiness, Secretary Cohen and the Joint Chiefs of Staff attributed the \ncause primarily to the high operational tempo and the under funding of \nthe defense budgets. General Reimer encapsulated the problem in this \nway during the September 29 hearing:\n\n       Soldiers are asking, ``When is it going to stop? When will \n     the downsizing end? When will our leaders stop asking us to \n     do more with less?'' Our soldiers are smart, hard working, \n     and dedicated. They are also very tired.\n\n  For many of us, the acknowledged shortfall in defense spending is not \na surprise. Last year, during the Senate debate on the budget \nresolution, I expressed my concerns that funding levels for defense \nconsidered in the budget agreement would not provide sufficient funds \nto adequately sustain over time the personnel, quality of life, \nreadiness and modernization programs critical to our military services. \nRegretfully, my concerns have become a reality sooner than expected and \nwe must now take measures to resolve these problems and reverse the \ndecline in the readiness of our military services.\n  Mr. President, as long as the administration continues to pursue a \nforeign policy that requires the U.S. military to be a global police \nforce, our troops will be challenged by an operational tempo higher \nthan that of the cold war. If the administration persists in this \nendeavor, we must ensure that our armed forces have the funds to carry \nout these operations while maintaining a force structure that \nwithstands the impact of the high operational and personnel tempos \nassociated with our current aggressive foreign policy.\n  More importantly, we have the responsibility to correct those quality \nof life and modernization shortfalls identified during our hearings. \nGeneral Shelton recommended the following:\n\n       My recommendation is to apply additional funding to two \n     very real, very pressing concerns. First, we need to fix the \n     so-called REDUX retirement system and return the bulk of our \n     force to the program that covers our more senior members--\n     that is, a retirement program that provides 50 percent of \n     average base pay upon completion of twenty years of service. \n     Second, we must begin to close the substantial gap between \n     what we pay our men and women in uniform and what their \n     civilian counterparts with similar skills, training, and \n     education are earning.\n\n  General Reimer described the modernization problem as follows:\n\n       In order to preserve future readiness, we must begin today \n     to increase our modernization accounts and to develop the \n     equipment, force structures, professional development \n     systems, training, and doctrine we will need to prepare for \n     the future. And we must develop all these capabilities \n     together.\n\n  Mr. President, during the October 29 hearing, Secretary Cohen assured \nus that he would address these problems in the fiscal year 2000 budget \nrequest. In my judgement, it would require a substantial increase in \nthe defense budget to alleviate the problems recently acknowledged by \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff. During the hearings, the service chiefs \ntestified they needed approximately $17.5 billion additional annually \nto correct the near and long term readiness problems. This amount does \nnot include a pay increase nor does it include the funding necessary to \nchange the retirement program.\n\n  With respect to the retirement issue, the Armed Services Committee \nwill consider carefully the recommendations of the Secretary of Defense \nin his fiscal year 2000 budget request and will address this issue in \nthe Defense authorization bill. Senator Levin and I wrote the Secretary \nof Defense on October 8 indicating that we believe he should conduct \nappropriate analyses to determine the greatest readiness payoff among \nthe measures under consideration to improve recruiting and retention, \nincluding pay, retirement, housing, health care, personnel tempo, and \nmorale and recreation programs and facilities. These analyses will be \ncrucial to making the difficult funding decisions we will face next \nyear. I ask unanimous consent that our letter of October 8 be printed \nin the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the Joint Chiefs described alarming \nindicators of declining readiness. I strongly believe that if there is \nan actual emergency that should be addressed in this omnibus \nsupplemental bill, it should be military readiness. The Joint Chiefs \ntestified that while the $1 billion readiness supplemental requested by \nthe Department of Defense would be helpful, it is inadequate to \nmaintain the readiness of our military forces. I believe that, as the \nhighest priority, the Congress should have provided an emergency \nsupplemental for military readiness of at least $2 billion. Mr. \nPresident, while I appreciate and commend the Chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee and the majority leader for negotiating this \nagreement under difficult circumstances, I regret that the final \nagreement provides only half that amount which I believe is required \nnow to shore up our military readiness.\n  Mr. President, next year, we are going to have to face up to the \nserious fiscal problems our military services are experiencing in \naddition to already existing outlay problems. The Secretary of Defense \nis conferring now with the Office of Management and Budget to determine \nhow additional funds can be provided for defense next year and in the \nout years. I do not believe the administration will request\n\n[[Page S12696]]\n\nthe additional $20 billion or so which the Joint Chiefs indicated will \nbe required annually over the next 5 years to address personnel, \nreadiness, and modernization deficiencies.\n  The Congress will have to come to grips with these funding realities \nor consider significantly scaling back our worldwide commitments. We \ncannot continue to have it both ways. It is unfair to our men and women \nin uniform and cannot be sustained over time.\n  Mr. President, our hearings have substantiated the readiness and \nfunding problem facing our armed forces. The solution to these problems \nwill require the close cooperation between the Congress and the \nadministration. It will require the Congress to relook the balanced \nbudget agreement and will require challenging decisions by all parties. \nWe have no choice but to make careful and deliberate decisions. The \nfuture of our Nation and the lives of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, \nand marines depend on it.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 8, 1998.\n     Hon. William S. Cohen,\n     Secretary of Defense,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: In light of your recent testimony and \n     the testimony of the Joint Chiefs of Staff before the \n     Committee, it is obvious that maintaining the delicate \n     balance among the key components of personnel and quality of \n     life, readiness and modernization in the FY2000-2005 Future \n     Years Defense Plan will be difficult. The current discussions \n     of ``catch-up'' pay raises, returning to a richer military \n     retirement system, funding modernization programs, providing \n     adequate training funds and controlling high personnel and \n     operational tempos make your task of setting priorities a \n     significant challenge.\n       As you develop the defense budget request for fiscal year \n     2000, it is imperative that the Department thoroughly analyze \n     any proposals to address the pay gap or return to the pre-\n     August 1986 military retirement system. We are totally \n     committed, as we are sure you are, to taking care of our \n     military personnel and their families. However, before \n     enacting any proposals in this area with significant long-\n     term costs, the Department of Defense and the Congress must \n     have a clear view of the likely impact of the proposals on \n     recruiting, retention, and military readiness.\n       During our hearing on October 6, 1998, you testified that \n     you would address the issues of military pay and retirement \n     in your fiscal year 2000 budget. As you and the Chiefs \n     testified, there are a number of programs that combine to \n     make up Quality of Life for our military personnel and their \n     families, including pay, retirement, housing, health care, \n     personnel tempo and morale and recreation programs and \n     facilities. We believe that recommendations included in your \n     budget request for the areas indicated above must be fully \n     supported by careful analyses justifying the costs and \n     providing assurance of measurable increases in recruiting, \n     retention and military readiness.\n       We look forward to reviewing your recommendations in the FY \n     2000 budget request.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carl Levin, \n       Ranking Member.\n     Strom Thurmond, \n       Chairman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/20/senate-section/article/S12695-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NEWMAN POSTAL SITUATION\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, it is with great concern that I rise to \naddress a recurring problem in my state with the United States Postal \nService. It seems that we are continually faced with situations where \nthe Postal Service has created controversy by indicating--in some \ncases--that they will move existing post offices from downtown areas. \nIn Georgia, as in many states, these post offices have been main street \nfixtures for residents, creating a meeting place for shoppers, business \npeople and officials. The idea of moving these post offices is \nparticularly worrisome for rural areas where local merchants have long \nrelied upon this common bond. It is a problem that Congress should \nexamine in order to work with the Postal Service to promote a better \nunderstanding and working relationship with the affected communities.\n  We currently have a particular case in Newnan, Georgia which \nillustrates the problem. After receiving word from the community that \nthe post office was moving out of the downtown area, we began contact \nwith the Postal Service to determine whether or not these rumors were \ntrue. We gained assurances from the Postal Service that they did not \nintend to move from the downtown area because there was ``overwhelming \ncommunity support'' for keeping it there. Since that time, we have \nreceived another report from the Postal Service that, because of \nsecurity requirements, they indeed may have to move to an alternate \nlocation. I am concerned by the lack of clarity in the reports my \noffice has received on this matter and am working to get a \nclarification from the Postal Service. I would like to reiterate for \nthe record my commitment to maintaining a full service postal facility \nin downtown Newnan. I would welcome the opportunity to work with local \nofficials and businesses in Newnan and the Postal Service to meet this \ngoal.\n  As I mentioned, Mr. President, this matter in Newnan is a reflection \nof the work we have ahead to avoid these controversies between smaller \ncommunities and the post office. It is a problem I hope we rectify \nfavorably for the citizens of Newnan in this case, and for people all \nover America in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/20/senate-section/article/S12696-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there now be \n3 hours equally divided for debate today on the conference report to \naccompany H.R. 4328, the omnibus appropriations bill for 1999, \nnotwithstanding the receipt of the papers, and that when the Senate \nreceives the conference report, it be considered as having been read \nwith no action other than debate occurring and the vote to occur at 9 \na.m. on Wednesday, without any intervening action, debate or motion, \nand that paragraph 4 of rule XII and all points of order be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing none, without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that 15 \nminutes of the time under my control as manager of the bill on our side \nbe under the control of Senator Gregg, and that following the vote \nSenator Specter be recognized for up to 15 minutes for general debate, \nto be followed by Senator Ashcroft for 30 minutes of general debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is with some regret that it is my job \nto bring before the Senate the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency \nSupplemental Appropriations Act of 1999. Throughout the year, I have \nurged that we find a way to move on the individual appropriations bills \nso that we would avoid a repetition of what took place 2 years ago. \nUnfortunately, that request was not followed, despite the urging of the \ndistinguished majority leader and minority leader to work with the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  We were unable to finish the bills within the normal timeframe this \nyear.\n  We had an extremely difficult calendar because of the fact that Labor \nDay--the first Monday was the 7th of September. We then had the Jewish \nholidays which we were in recess for. We were just unable to finish in \ntime. We had to get first one and then another and then another and now \nanother continuing resolution in order to try and finish our work. I \ndeeply regret the process that we are going through now.\n  It is my task to present to the Senate, I think, the largest \nappropriations bill in a decade. Mr. President, it contains a grand \ntotal of $486.8 billion in\n\n[[Page S12697]]\n\nappropriations. The regular appropriations bills are a total of $203 \nbillion; the balance are in the supplemental and emergency \nappropriations.\n  It has been a very difficult process to go through. We have had a \nseries of meetings with representatives of the President and with our \nleaders. I thank the distinguished chairman of the House committee, \nCongressman Livingston, and his colleague, the ranking member there, \nCongressman Obey, as well as my colleague and great friend here in the \nSenate, the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd.\n  We have worked many long hours now. And I really think our staffs \ndeserve a great deal of credit, because we worked a lot of long hours, \nbut they worked through the night after we had worked long hours and \nwere there again the next morning when we started our negotiations once \nagain.\n  These negotiations have gone on now almost 3 weeks, and the product \nis the bill that was filed in the House last night. That bill, Mr. \nPresident, contains 11 divisions.\n  Division A contains 8 of the 13 annual appropriations bills for the \nfiscal year 1999; for the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce-Justice-\nState, the District of Columbia, Foreign Operations, Interior, Labor, \nHealth and Human Services-Education, Transportation, and Treasury-\nGeneral Government.\n\n  This division also contains the emergency agricultural assistance \npackage and supplemental appropriations under Energy and Water \nDevelopment and VA-HUD. It also contains the spending offsets that were \npresented to us by the administration.\n  I might state that those were checked out by our Budget Committees \nand by the Congressional Budget Office. We believe that we are under \nthe caps as were set by the budget agreement with the President.\n  The division B contains emergency appropriations for military \nreadiness and overseas contingency operations, storm damage to defense \nfacilities, antiterrorism, the year 2000 conversions--the so-called Y2K \nproblem--and counterdrug activities.\n  Divisions C through K are various authorizing measures that were \nadded to the bill. I hasten to point out that while many of them come \nfrom authorization committees, it is the Appropriations Committees that \nmust put our names on these bills as they are presented to the House \nand Senate. We have done our very best to check through these bills. \nAnd I might state that our staffs have read them through not just once \nbut twice to make certain that each one of them is as it was \nrepresented to us as these measures were brought to us.\n  Division C is in fact a potpourri of measures, including the FAA \nreauthorization extension, post office namings, the Olympic and Amateur \nSports Act amendments, Internet legislation, the American Fisheries \nAct, Persian Gulf veterans health, and others.\n  Division D is the Drug Demand Reduction Act.\n  Division E covers methamphetamine trafficking. It is another drug \nbill.\n  Division F covers the marijuana for medical purposes.\n  Division G is the State Department reauthorization bill.\n  Division H is the new provisions concerning Sallie Mae.\n  Division I covers the chemical weapons convention.\n  Division J covers tax extenders and home health care provisions.\n  Division K contains pay-as-you-go provisions to maintain the \nseparation of mandatory and discretionary spending as outlined in last \nyear's balanced budget agreement.\n  Let me just take a few minutes of the Senate, Mr. President, to \nprovide some highlights of the bill under the Appropriations \nCommittee's jurisdiction; that is divisions A and B.\n  The total discretionary spending in division A is $206 billion. This \nincludes $2.8 billion in offsets.\n  The agriculture portion of the conference includes the conference \nreport on the agricultural appropriations bill that was vetoed by the \nPresident with some modifications. It contains an additional $1.64 \nbillion in emergency crop and market loss assistance for farmers and \nranchers. This brings the total agricultural emergency assistance \nfunding for this year to $5.9 billion.\n  There are also increases for food safety and rural empowerment zones \nand enterprise communities. The Commerce-State-Justice portion of this \nbill contains funding through June 15. It supports crime fighting and \nantidrug activities, counterterrorism, and border patrols.\n  The Census Bureau will receive the funding it needs to continue to \nprepare for the decennial census. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, National Weather Service, and Science programs are, in \nmy judgment, adequately funded. The State Department would receive \nfunds for international programs and U.N. arrearages subject to \nauthorization.\n  The District of Columbia provisions would largely ratify the \nDistrict's own consensus budget and continue ongoing management \nreforms.\n  The Foreign Operations portion contains funding for export promotion \nand economic aid, as well as the funding for the International Monetary \nFund, IMF, with conditions for reform. I might say, I am personally \nvery gratified that this is finally being sent to the President for \napproval.\n  The Department of the Interior would receive increases for park \noperations and much-needed maintenance, funding for the Everglades \nrestoration effort, and other public land needs. Full funding for many \ncultural and historical preservation programs are also included in that \nportion of the bill.\n  The Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education bill provides \nfunds for worker assistance, increases funding for medical research at \nthe National Institutes of Health by $2 billion, and fully funds the \nLow Income Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP. Increases were \nprovided for child care block grants, special education, and to reduce \nclass size.\n  The Transportation portion of the bill contains the highest \nlimitation in history on obligations in the highway trust fund--$4 \nbillion above last year's level. Adequate funds for the Coast Guard and \nthe Federal Aviation Administration and our mass transportation \nprograms are included.\n\n  The Treasury-General Government portion contains funding to increase \ndrug control programs and improve IRS customer relations.\n  Two bills already passed by the Congress and signed by the President \nwere, in fact, reopened by the final negotiations and additional \nmaterials are available for those bills.\n  Division A contains additional appropriations under Energy and Water \nDevelopment, including funds for the Tennessee Valley Authority, and \nauthorization to refinance its debts, and funds for the Department of \nEnergy's energy supply programs.\n  The VA-HUD bill is also augmented by additional spending for urban \nempowerment zones, the Boston Harbor cleanup, climate change, and the \nCorporation for National and Community Service.\n  As I said, division B contains the emergency supplemental spending in \nthe omnibus bill, with the exception of agriculture assistance, which \nis in division A.\n  The total discretionary spending in division B is $14.9 billion. It \nincludes $6.8 billion to improve military readiness and to fund ongoing \noverseas contingency operations such as Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, $2.4 billion is included to protect our embassies \naround the world and to fund our continuing fight against terrorism \nworldwide. And $3.4 billion is provided to address the Y2K problem--the \nyear 2000 problem--throughout the Federal Government as a whole. This \nis provided in emergency appropriations subject to the President's \napproval.\n  Mr. President, $700 million is included for a package of counterdrug \nactivities. Another $1.5 billion is provided to address the damage \ncaused by Hurricane Georges and Hurricane Bonnie.\n  Mr. President, as I indicated, this is a very complicated bill.\n  Mr. President, I want to take a moment to talk about two of the \nprovisions that are in the bill that are legislative items. They were \nbills that I presented to the Senate. One is the American Fisheries \nAct. It is a culmination of the negotiations that were undertaken with \nmy colleagues from the State of Washington after I had introduced \nSenate bill 1221.\n  We reached the agreement to include this American Fisheries Act in \nthe legislation that is being considered. It is title II of division C \nof the bill. This\n\n[[Page S12698]]\n\nact will not only complete the process begun in 1976 to give the U.S. \ninterests a priority in the harvest of U.S. fishery resources, but will \nalso significantly decapitalized the Bering Sea pollock fishery.\n  The 1976 act was, in fact, the Magnuson Act, that extended our \njurisdiction to the 200-mile limit. The Bering Sea pollock fishery is \nthe largest, and its present state of overcapacity is the result of \nmistakes in, and misinterpretations of, the 1987 Commercial Fishing \nIndustry Vessel Anti-Reflagging Act, which is generally known as the \nAnti-Reflagging Act.\n  In 1986, as the last of the foreign-flag fishing vessels in the U.S. \nfleet were being replaced by U.S.-flag vessels, we discovered that \nFederal law did not prevent U.S.-flag vessels from being entirely owned \nby foreign interests. We also discovered that Federal law did not \nrequire U.S. fishing vessels to carry U.S. crew members, and that U.S. \nfishing vessels could essentially be built in foreign shipyards under \nthe existing regulatory definition of the word ``rebuild.''\n  The goals of the 1987 Anti-Reflagging Act were to, one, require the \nU.S. control of fishing vessels that fly the U.S. flag; two, stop the \nforeign construction of the U.S.-flag vessels under the ``rebuild'' \nloophole; and, three, to require the U.S.-flag fishing vessels to carry \nU.S. crews. Of these three goals, only the U.S. crew requirement was \nachieved by the 1987 act.\n  The Anti-Reflagging Act did not stop foreign interests from owning \nand controlling U.S.-flag fishing vessels. About 30,000 of the 33,000 \nexisting U.S.-flag fishing vessels are not subject to any U.S. \ncontrolling interest requirement.\n  The Anti-Reflagging Act also failed to stop the massive foreign \nrebuilding programs between 1987 and 1990 that brought almost 20 of the \nlargest fishing vessels ever built in the world into our fisheries as \n``rebuilt'' vessels.\n  Today, half of the Nation's largest fishery--which is the Bering Sea \npollock--continues to be harvested by foreign interests on foreign-\nbuilt vessels that are not subject to any U.S.-controlling interest \nstandard.\n  On September 25, 1997, I introduced the American Fisheries Act, S. \n1221, to try to fix these mistakes. Senators from almost every fishing \nregion of the country joined me in supporting that effort, including \nSenators Breaux, Hollings, Gregg, Wyden and Murkowski.\n  As introduced, the bill had three primary objectives: requiring the \nowners of all U.S.-flag fishing vessels to comply with a 75-percent \nU.S.-controlling interest standard, similar to the standard for other \ncommercial U.S.-flag vessels that operate in U.S. waters; two, to \nremove from U.S. fisheries at least one-half of the foreign-built \nfactory trawlers that entered the fisheries through the Anti-Reflagging \nAct foreign rebuild grandfather loophole and that continued to be \nforeign-owned as of September 25, 1997; and, third, to prohibit the \nentry of any new fishing vessels above 165 feet, 750 tons, or with \nengines producing greater than 3,000 horsepower in the North Pacific \nfisheries fleet.\n  I am pleased to report that the package we are submitting to the \nSenate today accomplishes all three of these main objectives of S. 1221 \nas introduced. I thank Senator Gorton and his colleague from \nWashington, Senator Murray, for their efforts, particularly Senator \nGorton for his tremendous effort in finally reaching an agreement on \nthis bill. For almost a decade now, he and I have had various \ndisagreements on the Bering Sea pollock fishery and issues related to \nthe Anti-Flagging Act.\n  At the Commerce Committee hearing in March of this year, and later at \nan Appropriations Committee markup in July, Senator Gorton plainly \nexpressed his concerns with my bill, S. 1221. In August, he spent \nconsiderable time with representatives from the Bering Sea pollock \nfishery and by sheer will managed to develop a framework upon which we \ncould agree. After he presented the framework to me, we convened \nmeetings of fishery representatives in September that literally went \naround the clock for 5 days. Those meetings included Bering Sea pollock \nfishery industry representatives, industry representatives from other \nNorth Pacific fisheries, the State of Alaska, North Pacific council \nmembers, National Marine Fisheries, the Coast Guard, the Maritime \nAdministration, environmental representatives and staff for various \nMembers of Congress and the Senate and House committees that have \njurisdiction over this.\n  At the end of those meetings, a consensus had been achieved among \nBering Sea fishing representatives on an agreement to reduce capacity \nin the Bering Sea pollock fishery. For the next 3 weeks, we drafted \nlegislation. We have spent considerable time with the fishing industry \nfrom other fisheries that were concerned about the possible impacts of \nthe changes in the Bering Sea pollock fishery upon their areas in \noffshore fisheries.\n  The legislation we are passing today includes many safeguards for \nthose other fisheries and for the participants in those fisheries. By \ndelaying implementation of some of the measures until January 1, 2000, \nit also provides the North Pacific Council and the Secretary of \nCommerce with sufficient time to develop safeguards for those other \nfisheries.\n  This legislation is unprecedented in the 23 years since the enactment \nof what is now known as the Magnuson- Stevens Act. With the council \nsystem, congressional action of this type is not needed in Federal \nfisheries anymore. However, the mistakes in the Anti-Reflagging Act and \nthe way it was interpreted created unique problems in the Bering Sea \npollock fishery that only Congress can fix. The North Pacific Council \ndoes not have the authority to turn back the clock by removing fishery \nendorsements, to provide the funds required under the Federal Credit \nReform Act to allow for the $75 million loan to remove the overcapacity \nin the area, and to strengthen the U.S.-control requirements for \nfishing vessels, to restrict Federal loans on large fishing vessels, \nand to do many other things we have agreed to do in this legislation.\n  While S. 1221 as introduced was more modest in scope, I believe the \nmeasures in this agreement are fully justified as a one-time corrective \nmeasure for the negative effects of the Anti-Reflagging Act that I have \nmentioned before.\n  There is also in this bill the Olympic and Amateur Sports Act \nAmendments of 1998. This legislation includes that bill, a bill that \nSenator Campbell joined me in cosponsoring to update the Federal \ncharter for the U.S. Olympic Committee and the framework for Olympic \nand amateur sports in the United States. This framework is known as the \nAmateur Sports Act because most of its provisions were added by the \nAmateur Sports Act of 1978.\n  The act gives the U.S. Olympic Committee certain trademark \nprotections to raise money--and does not provide reappropriations--\ntherefore, it does not come up for routine reauthorization.\n  The Amateur Sports Act has not been amended since its comprehensive \nrevision in 1978 which provided the foundation for the modern Olympic \nmovement in the United States. The bill we are considering does not \nfundamentally change that act. Our review showed us it is fundamentally \nsound.\n  We believe the modest changes that we ask the Senate and the Congress \nto make will ensure that the act serves the United States well into the \n21st century. The significant changes which have occurred in the world \nof Olympic and amateur sports since 1978 warrant what I call fine-\ntuning of this act.\n  Some of the developments of the past 20 years include, first, that \nthe schedule for the Olympics and Winter Olympics has been alternated \nso games are held every 2 years instead of every 4--significantly \nincreasing the workload of the U.S. Olympic Committee; second, that \nsports have begun to allow professional athletes to compete in some \nOlympic events; third, that even sports still considered ``amateur'' \nhave athletes who with greater financial opportunities and professional \nresponsibilities now compete more than we ever considered in 1978;  \nfour, that the Paralympics--the Olympics for disabled amateur \nathletes--have grown significantly in size and prestige.\n\n  These and other changes led me to call for a comprehensive review of \nthe Amateur Sports Act in 1994.\n  The Commerce Committee has held three hearings since then.\n  At the first and second--on August 11, 1994 and October 18, 1995--\nwitnesses identified where the Amateur Sports Act was showing signs of \nstrain.\n\n[[Page S12699]]\n\n  We postponed our work until after the 1996 Summer Olympics in \nAtlanta, but on April 21, 1997, held a third hearing at the Olympic \nTraining Center in Colorado Springs to discuss solutions to the \nproblems which had been identified.\n  By January 1998, we'd refined the proposals into possible amendments \nto the Amateur Sports Act, which we discussed at length at an informal \nworking session on January 26, 1998, in the Commerce Committee hearing \nroom.\n  The bill that Senator Campbell and I introduced in May reflected the \ncomments received in January, and excluded proposals for which \nconsensus appeared unachievable.\n  With the help of the U.S. Olympic Committee, the Athletes Advisory \nCouncil, the National Governing Bodies' Council, numerous disabled \nsports organizations, and many others, we continued to fine tune the \nbill until it was approved by the Commerce Committee in July.\n  I will include a longer summary of the bill for the Record, but will \nbriefly explain its primary components:: (1) The bill would change the \ntitle of the underlying law to the ``Olympic and Amateur Sports Act'' \nto reflect that more than strictly amateurs are involved now, but \nwithout lessening the amateur and grass roots focus reflected in the \ntitle of the 1978 Act; (2) the bill would add a number of measures to \nstrengthen the provisions which protect athletes' rights to compete; \n(3) it would add measures to improve the ability of the USOC to resolve \ndisputes--particularly close the Olympics, Paralympics, or Pan-American \nGames--and reduce the legal costs and administrative burdens of the \nUSOC; (4) it would add measures to fully incorporate the Paralympics \ninto the Amateur Sports Act, and update the existing provisions \naffecting disabled athletes; (5) it would improve the notification \nrequirements when an NGB has been put on probation or is being \nchallenged; (6) it would increase the reporting requirements of the \nUSOC and NGB with respect to sports opportunities for women, \nminorities, and disabled individuals; and (7) it would require the USOC \nto report back to Congress in 5 years with any additional changes that \nmaybe needed to the act.\n\n  Mr. President, I am the only Senator from President Ford's Commission \non Amateur Sports who is still serving.\n  It has therefore been very helpful to have Senator Campbell--an \nOlympian himself in 1964--involved in this process. He is a good \nfriend.\n  Over my objection, he attempted to have this package named after me--\nan honor that I have declined.\n  There are many others who deserve recognition for their work to bring \nabout the 1978 Act, and that continues to be the case. Specifically, I \nrefer to my friend from Colorado, who has done a tremendous amount of \nwork on this.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my summary of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         The Olympic and Amateur Sports Act Amendments of 1998\n\n       (1) Incorporates Paralympics into Amateur Sports Act; \n     clearly reflects equal status between able-bodied and \n     disabled athletes; continues original focus of Act to \n     integrate disabled sports with able-bodied National Governing \n     Bodies (NGB's), but allows USOC to recognize paralympic \n     sports organizations if integration does not serve best \n     interest or if NGB objects to integration; officially \n     recognizes U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) as the national \n     Paralympic committee.\n       (2) Allows USOC to remove certain lawsuits against it to \n     federal court.\n       (3) Statutorily requires the creation of an Athletes' \n     Advisory Council and National Governing Bodies' Council to \n     advise the USOC.\n       (4) Adds requirement that USOC Board be 20 percent active \n     athletes (USOC already does this, but original Act only \n     required 20 percent on NGB Boards).\n       (5) Gives USOC trademark protection for the Pan-American \n     Games, Paralympics, and symbols associated with each.\n       (6) Requires USOC to keep agent for service of process only \n     in CO, rather than all 50 States.\n       (7) Requires USOC to report to Congress only once every \n     four years, instead of annually.\n       (8) Requires the USOC report to Congress to include data on \n     the participation of women, disabled individuals, and \n     minorities.\n       (9) Protects the USOC against court injunction in selecting \n     athletes to serve on the Olympic, Paralympic, or Pan-American \n     teams within 21 days of those games if the USOC's \n     constitution and bylaws cannot provide a resolution before \n     the games are to begin.\n       (10) Requires USOC to hire an ombudsman for athletes \n     nominated by the Athletes' Advisory Council to provide advice \n     to athletes about the Act, relevant constitution and bylaws \n     of the USOC and NGBs, rules of international sports \n     federations and IOC/IPC, and to assist in mediating certain \n     disputes involving the opportunity to an amateur athlete to \n     compete.\n       (11) Allows USOC/NGBs not to send to the Olympics, Pan-\n     American Games, or Paralympics athletes who have not met the \n     eligibility criteria of the USOC and appropriate NGB, even if \n     not sending those athletes will result in an incomplete team.\n       (12) Requires improved notification and hearing \n     requirements by USOC when an NGB is being challenged to be \n     replaced or put on probation.\n       (13) Clarifies that NGBs must agree to submit to binding \n     arbitration at request of athletes under the Commercial Rules \n     of the American Arbitration Association (as in existing USOC \n     constitution and bylaws), but gives USOC authority to alter \n     the rules with the concurrence of the Athletes' Advisory \n     Council and National Governing Bodies Council, or by a \\2/\n     3\\'s vote of the USOC Board of Directors.\n       (14) Allows NGBs to establish criteria on a sport-by-sport \n     basis for the ``active athletes'' that must comprise at least \n     20 percent of their boards of directors and such other \n     governing boards; the USOC, AAC, and NGB Council would set \n     guidelines, but an NGB would have authority to seek \n     exceptions to the guidelines from the USOC.\n       (15) Requires NGBs to disseminate and distribute to \n     athletes, coaches, trainers, etc., all applicable rules and \n     any changes of the NGB, USOC, international sports \n     federation, IOC, International Paralympic Committee and Pan-\n     American Sports Organization.\n       (16) Requires special report to Congress at end of five \n     years on implementation of the provisions and any additional \n     changes USOC thinks needed to Act.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, let me mention one final section in the \nbill. We have had a lot of contention in conferences over the small \nfishing village of King Cove, which lies at the tip of the Alaskan \npeninsula, 625 miles southwest of Anchorage. It is exposed to the \nPacific Ocean and the Bering Sea, and this community is often ravaged \nby 80-mile-per-hour winds, or more, and by driving sea winds. This \nextreme weather often shuts down access into or out of King Cove for \ndays at a time.\n  In an effort to improve King Cove's access to emergency medical \nfacilities, I added language to the Interior appropriations bill that \nwould grant a right-of-way from King Cove to the giant airport at Cold \nBay. Mr. President, that road would have gone through a portion of the \nold army military base that is now known as Izembek Wildlife Refuge. \nThis 30-mile road would have provided the cheapest and most reliable \nmeans of access to my constituents who live at King Cove.\n  However, the administration raised environmental considerations \nregarding the wildlife refuge and refused to accept the provision that \nwould authorize the road.\n  After much discussion on a series of options being offered to us by \nthe administration, we have crafted a compromise that provides for the \nhealth and safety of the Alaskan Native people of King Cove and still \nprotects the refuge, as it was indicated that the administration \nbelieved that was its highest priority.\n  This provision now provides King Cove Natives with the money to build \na road from King Cove to a small lagoon some 20 miles away. There they \nwill build a dock and use a small vessel to cross over the lagoon to \nproperty that they own adjacent to the runway at Cold Bay. The \nprovision also provides funding to improve the airstrip at King Cove \nand for improvements to the health clinic at King Cove; namely, to put \nin state-of-the-art medical facilities and telemedicine capability \nthere to protect our people until these transportation facilities are \nconstructed.\n  Mr. President, I will have other comments to make about this bill \nlater. I have taken too long already.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, we are about to take up the conference \nreport on the so-called omnibus appropriation measure, which contains \nfunding for Fiscal Year 1999 for the departments and agencies under the \njurisdiction of eight Appropriations Subcommittees: Agriculture, \nCommerce/Justice/State/The Judiciary, the District of Columbia, Foreign \nOperations, Interior, Labor/Health and Human Services and Education, \nTransportation, and Treasury and General Government. In addition, this \nomnibus package contains\n\n[[Page S12700]]\n\nsome $20 billion, which has been designated as an emergency, in a \nsupplemental package for such things as: agriculture disaster \nassistance--$6 billion; defense, including military readiness, $6.8 \nbillion; hardening of embassies and other security matters--$2 billion; \nY2K--$3.25 billion, of which $1.1 billion is for the Department of \nDefense; war on drugs--$690 million; and various disaster assistance \nprograms, such as FEMA, Community Development Block Grants, and other \nprograms which aid those who have suffered from natural disasters in \nthe past months, such as Hurricane Georges--$1.4 billion. Also included \nare a substantial number of legislative riders that have been \nrecommended by various members of the House and Senate and have been \napproved by not only the Appropriations Committees but also the joint \nleadership and the administration. As if that were not enough, this \nconference report also includes a $9.2 billion tax package.\n  This omnibus conference report is massive. It numbers thousands of \npages. I haven't seen it yet, but that is what I am told. It provides \nfunding totaling nearly $500 billion, or close to one-third of the \nentire Federal budget. If you don't think that is a lot of money--$500 \nbillion--that is $500 for every minute since Jesus Christ was born. Let \nme say that again. That $500 billion is $500 for every 60 seconds since \nJesus Christ was born. It is virtually beyond comprehension when we \ntalk about funding of that size. Webster's Dictionary does not contain \nwords enough to allow me to appropriately express my disappointment and \nmy regret that we have reached the point we have, to present this \ncolossal monstrosity to the United States Senate.\n  All too often in recent years, we have faced similar situations where \nCongress has failed to enact its 13 separate annual appropriation bills \nin a timely manner and, in many cases, we have failed to enact them at \nall, except in an omnibus package. Just 2 years ago, under the \nchairmanship in the Senate of the distinguished Senator from Oregon, \nMr. Hatfield, the Senate was placed in a similar position. It wasn't \nMr. Hatfield's fault, but the Senate was placed in a similar position \nof having to vote on an omnibus appropriation bill that contained six \nof the annual appropriation bills in one conference report.\n  Then, as today, Members were asked to vote on those appropriation \nbills in their entirety, plus hundreds of other provisions, sight \nunseen, a pig in a poke, without satisfactory opportunities to \nunderstand those provisions and virtually without opportunity to amend \nthe omnibus bill.\n  In 1996, I joined Chairman Hatfield and our present chairman, Senator \nStevens, in expressing my regret that the Senate was put into that \ndifficult position. Senator Stevens indicated that he hoped the Senate \nwould never have to appropriate by way of an omnibus bill again. Last \nyear, Chairman Stevens and his counterpart, the distinguished chairman \nof the House Appropriations Committee, Representative Livingston, with \nthe support of the ranking members on each of the subcommittees, were \nable to complete action on all 13 appropriation bills without the need \nfor omnibus legislation. That was last year, and that is the way the \nprocess ought to work every year.\n\n  It is very, very costly to the U.S. taxpayers to have to govern \nthrough a series of continuing resolutions. Departments and agencies \nhave to curtail their operations and alter their plans in many cases \nbecause they are not certain as to what their appropriation will be for \nthe full fiscal year. We have now had five continuing resolutions in \nrelation to the fiscal year 1999 appropriation bills. Five continuing \nresolutions!\n  As Members are aware, we have only enacted into law three fiscal year \n1999 regular appropriation bills--defense, military construction and \nenergy and water. Furthermore, the Senate never took up the District of \nColumbia, or the Labor-HHS appropriation bills, and although it was \ntaken up on the Senate floor, action was never completed on the \nInterior appropriation bill. Yet, here we are today faced with having \nto vote not only on those three appropriations bills, but also on five \nmore in this conference report, plus many authorization measures and a \ntax bill.\n  The process that has brought us to this point is deplorable. It is \nmanifestly preposterous in that no Member of the House or Senate could \npossibly know, much less understand, all of the provisions that are \ncontained in this conference report. It is absolutely inexcusable. It \nranks, as far as the legislative lexicon is concerned, with the \nunpardonable sin in the spiritual realm--the unpardonable sin. It is \nabsolutely unpardonable for Members of the Senate and the House to put \nthemselves into this kind of situation. It should be difficult for \nevery one of us to face the voters of this country. If the voters \nreally understood what we are doing here, they would probably feel like \nvoting us all out of office. Thank God, only one-third of the Senators \nhave to go before the voters each 2 years. By failing to enact our \nregular appropriation bills on time, we have brought this situation \nupon ourselves. There is nobody here but us; there is nobody to blame \nbut us. We are to blame for this. We brought this situation on \nourselves.\n  Senators are being asked to vote on this massive piece of legislation \nthat provides funding of nearly one-half trillion dollars--\napproximately one-third of the entire Federal budget--without an \nadequate opportunity to consider it or amend it. Senators cannot amend \nthis conference report--in spite of the Constitution, which says, with \nreference to revenue-raising bills, that they shall originate in the \nHouse of Representatives, but that the Senate may propose amendments to \nrevenue-raising bills, as on all other measures, as on all other \nlegislation. The Constitution didn't foresee this kind of a \nmonstrosity--eight appropriations bills wrapped into one conference \nreport, one tax bill, and a supplemental appropriation bill--right? \nRight. Eight. What a monstrosity, what a gargantuan monstrosity!\n\n  Do I know what is in the measure? Are we kidding? No. I don't know \nwhat is in this measure. I know a few things that are in it, but only \nGod knows everything that is in this monstrosity. Only God knows what \nis in this conference report. And very few people, relatively speaking, \nare on speaking terms with Him.\n  Nobody in this Government--not one person in this Government--\nunderstands every jot and tittle that are in this measure; not one.\n  We have no opportunity to amend it. In other words, the \nrepresentatives of the people are being denied by the rules the \nopportunity to offer an amendment on behalf of one's constituencies. No \nSenator can offer any amendments to this conference report. And, yet, \nwe have seen in the last several days daily press conferences where \nboth sides--both sides, out in the Rose Garden they appeared, and out \nhere somewhere near the Capitol--both sides were patting themselves on \nthe backs, patting each other on the backs, and congratulating \nthemselves and each other. For what? For finally putting together a \nmassive gargantuan monstrosity referred to as ``the conference report'' \ncontaining the bills that we should have passed long months ago.\n  We put off acting on these bills for months, and then, finally, when \nwe get beyond the beginning of the new fiscal year, we finally bring in \na massive piece of legislation. We don't know what is in it. Nobody in \nhere knows everything that is in it. Certain Members know certain \nthings about it. And then we pat ourselves on the back. What a great \nvictory--it was proclaimed down in the Rose Garden--what a victory for \nthe American people! What a shame. Webster wouldn't define that as a \nvictory.\n  I was invited to go down to the White House. I didn't go. I didn't \nconsider that a victory. I am not going to be a prop, a backup prop, \nfor that kind of victory. Why is it a victory? Several months late we \nall gather in the Rose Garden and pat ourselves on the back for having \nfinally gotten around to doing the work that we should have done months \nago? Is that a victory?\n  Mr. President, although I strenuously object to the process, I will \nvote for this monstrous measure in the form of a conference report for \nthe same reason that many other Senators will vote for it--and that is \nto keep the Government running.\n  All that I have said is not to say that this huge legislation does \nnot have some good things in it. There are some\n\n[[Page S12701]]\n\ngood things in it that we know about--good things for the Nation--and \nwe do have to pass appropriations bills to keep the Government running. \nIf Congress does nothing else in an entire year, it must pass \nappropriations measures to keep the Government running. But it is not a \nvote which I relish casting.\n  I would be less than honest if I did not state here and now that I do \nnot know--as I have stated already--a great deal about what is in this \nlegislation. In that, I am not alone. This conference report is a \ncreation, without a mother or a father--rather more like a Frankenstein \ncreature, a being of some sort that has been patched together from old \nlegislative body parts that do not quite fit. And just as Dr. \nFrankenstein was quite surprised by the results of his creation, so may \nwe be startled by the result of ours.\n  So we all gather down in the Rose Garden to proclaim what a victory \nthis Frankenstein monster is for the American people! Hail, hail the \nvictory for the American people.\n  Hastily drafted legislation, as Senators in this body well know, \noften has strange and unintended consequences. I don't fault the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee. Senator Stevens and the \nAppropriations Committee worked hard and reported the appropriations \nbills. We could long ago have acted upon these bills in the Senate and \nsent them down to the White House. We could have long ago done it. The \nAppropriations Committee didn't hold up the bills. I fault the entire \nCongress for repeatedly failing to do its work, and for bringing us to \nthe brink all too often.\n  Thirteen appropriations bills, Mr. President, and several \nsupplemental bills comprise the sum total of what this Congress \nactually has to accomplish each year. Those 13 bills, and any \nsupplementals which may be needed, make up our basic work requirement \neach year before we can go home. Yet, how often we have to cobble \ntogether continuing resolutions or horrific omnibus bills like this one \nbecause we will not do our work in a timely way. Out there in the real \nworld when you don't do your work you are fired. On the real job site, \ncolleagues, we would be gone! We would have been gone, out there on the \nreal job site! That is us, the delayers.\n  What results when we get to the end of a session and go through these \nagonies is Government at its worst. Someone said that making \nlegislation was like making sausage. Don't kid yourselves. I have made \nsausage. It is nothing like making this piece of goods. I have made \nsausage. I can tell you that what we did this year in gobbling together \nthis appropriations conference report is significantly more sloppy, \nmore messy than making sausage.\n  Congress did not even pass a budget resolution this year. How about \nthat. The Senate passed a budget resolution. The House passed one. But \nthey never got together in conference, so Congress never passed a \nbudget resolution this year.\n  I believe that this is probably the first time since 1974, when we \nenacted the Congressional Budget Act, that we have gone ahead and \nwritten appropriations bills without the discipline of a budget \nresolution.\n  It is rather like writing checks when you have no idea how much money \nis in your bank account. No sane, responsible citizen would do that. \nBut that is what we have done with the Federal budget in this \nunfortunate year. We have prostituted the legislative process. We have \nprostituted the appropriations process. Aha, what a victory!\n  But the worst part about this year-end charade we so often play with \nappropriations bills, and especially this year's belly dance with the \nWhite House, is the way that we have flaunted the Constitution--\nflaunted the Constitution!\n  Mr. President, I do not like to be tedious about these things, but \nthe Constitution is not a rough draft.\n  Article I, Section 1, of the U.S. Constitution says:\n\n       All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a \n     Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a \n     Senate and House of Representatives.\n\n  Earlier this year, I filed an amicus brief before the Supreme Court \nof the United States along with Senators Moynihan and Levin with the \naim of bringing down a gross aberration of the framers' intent called \nthe line-item veto.\n  One of the major agreements made in support of our case against the \nline-item veto was that the President is not empowered to legislate, \nand the Supreme Court upheld that. The President is supposed to \nfaithfully execute the law, not write it. And so we argued that when \nthe President can completely alter an appropriations bill by lining out \nportions of it, by repealing it, by canceling it, canceling portions of \nit, thus creating an entirely different bill--one that has never passed \neither House of Congress--he, the President, has become not just a \nlegislator but a superlegislator. The Court agreed. God save the \nSupreme Court of the United States! The Court agreed. They wisely \nstruck down this unwise and dangerous statute.\n  But now look, just look now at what we have done. Look at what we \nhave done now to the framers' handiwork at the close of the 105th \nCongress. We invited--we, the Congress invited--the executive branch to \nlegislate. We said, ``We can't do it. You come on in.'' We invited them \nto legislate. Shame, shame on us! We eagerly offered the executive \nbranch a seat at the legislative table. They are, in fact, in every way \nco-architects of this giant piece of legislation.\n  We have allowed--not only allowed, we have invited--this White House \nto participate in this process, just as if, under the Constitution, the \nexecutive branch were legislators. So we have invited the executive \nbranch to be coauthors of this giant, hybrid measure in the form of a \nconference report. It contains both legislation and appropriations \nbills about which most Members of Congress, especially on this side of \nthe aisle, know very little.\n  Why do I say ``especially on this side of the aisle'' we know very \nlittle about it? I will tell you why. We had two or three levels of \nconferences going on, all at the same time. The appropriators, Senator \nStevens, Representative Livingston, the chairmen of the two \nappropriations committees, respectively, and Mr. Obey of the other body \nand I, as ranking members of the two appropriations committees, met. We \nmet all day Saturday; we met all day on the Sabbath; we met all day \nMonday, Columbus Day, and we hammered out item after item after item. \nOn the other side of the table were the executive branch people. Can \nyou imagine that. We invited them by our having delayed action on the \nappropriations bills.\n  Then on another level there was Speaker Gingrich and the majority \nleader of the Senate, Mr. Lott, both Republicans, a great political \nparty--I have nothing against that; I have nothing against those two \nmen, but there was the majority, the Speaker of the House, and the \nmajority leader of the Senate. Where were the Democratic legislators at \nthat level? There weren't any. No Democrats from the Senate or House \nwere there to represent the minority in those negotiations.\n  Who represented the minority? The executive branch--the executive \nbranch represented the minority in the Senate and House because the \nminority in the Senate and House wasn't at the table. We weren't at the \ntable. The minority in the Congress had been blacked out of the picture \nbecause our seat at the legislating table was occupied, by whom? By the \nPresident's men. I don't think the President attended any of the \nmeetings. But he was represented. He had his representatives from the \nWhite House at the table.\n  On one side of the table were the representatives of the President; \non the other side of the table were the Speaker and the majority leader \nof the Senate representing the majority. We in the minority in the \nSenate and in the House were not at that table. If Banquo's ghost would \nhave appeared there, I wouldn't have seen him.\n  I deplore this process. We have run roughshod over the Constitution \nof the United States of America. Through this process, we have, in \neffect, circumvented the supreme law of the land because we have \ncircumvented the Constitution, Section 9 of Article I and Section 1 of \nArticle I.\n  We have blurred and we have blended the very clear lines of the \nseparation of powers set out in our national charter, and instead we \nhave cooked up this unsavory soup which will be force fed to\n\n[[Page S12702]]\n\nthe American people in order to avoid a completely avoidable, but for \npartisan games, Government shutdown. This time there is no Supreme \nCourt to save us from ourselves. We are quite randomly doing violence \nto the Constitution, and justifying it because of political expediency. \nNot only are we justifying it, we are claiming that it is the ``second \ncoming.'' ``Hallelujah, what a victory for the American people. Come \none, come all. Come down to the Rose Garden! Hallelujah, what a great \nvictory for the American people!''\n  What a shame! Call that a victory!\n  I extend my thanks to the distinguished chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, Mr. Stevens. He has worked hard. He has done \na masterful job in bringing the bills to the floor. He has worked \nzealously, assiduously, and effectively. I have never seen a finer \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee. I take my hat off to him. And \nI do the same with respect to his counterpart in the House, Mr. \nLivingston. I commend them both and I thank them both for their hard \nwork in bringing this measure to the floor under very difficult \ncircumstances. And I also commend the ranking member of the House \nAppropriations Committee, Mr. Obey. Moreover, I appreciate the tireless \nefforts of the subcommittee chairmen and the ranking members of the \nsubcommittees. I thank the staffs that have been hard at work, far into \nthe nights. Our staffs on both sides worked far into the nights to \ncobble together these webs, fragments, and pieces of legislation. Each \nchairman and ranking member, and their staffs, on a bipartisan basis, \nhave worked many long hours and weekends in order to complete this \npiece of legislation.\n  While I do sincerely appreciate all their efforts, I hope that they \nwill join me in my belief that this has to stop. How long, how long are \nwe going to have to deprive our constituents of the opportunity of \nhaving their Representatives offer amendments to legislation on the \nSenate floor? I will never vote for another such monstrosity as long as \nI am privileged to hold this office. And I hope I never see another \nsuch monstrosity. I will never again support such a convolution of the \nlegislative process as the one we have seen this year. And I hope that \nothers will agree that this process is just as silly and as sad and as \nridiculous and as disgraceful as I think it is. I hope they will join \nme in an effort to prevent it in the future.\n  I again thank the chairman of the committee. I am sure that he does \nnot think any more of this process than I do. Under the Constitution, \nthe legislative branch is to appropriate. The legislative branch has \ncontrol over the purse, and the legislative branch should never so \nconduct itself as to essentially invite the executive branch to \nparticipate in the writing of appropriations bills.\n  The President has his right under the Constitution to veto a bill, \nbut I say we ought to appropriate. We ought to pass the bills. We ought \nto be able to have them called up here, be able to offer amendments on \nboth sides of the aisle--and on another day I will talk about that part \nof the process that is partly to blame for this situation we are in. \nBut we ought to send the President the bills. Send them on time. If he \nwants to veto them, fine; he has that right under the Constitution. And \nthe Senate and the House can try to override if they can. If they \ncannot, then they just cannot. But we ought not, ought not be a party \nto inviting the executive branch to participate in legislating \nappropriations bills and then gather on the White House lawn and here \nat the Capitol to proclaim that it is a victory for the American \npeople.\n  Shame on us!\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that 15 minutes of my time be \nreserved for Mr. Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Wellstone \nhave 15 minutes of time, later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I see the Senator from Nebraska here. I will yield him \nsuch time as he wishes on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I wish to thank my friend, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, for the \ntime. I also wish to acknowledge, with a great amount of respect, the \nwork that he has done on the Omnibus appropriations bill. He has done \nthis work after being placed in an almost impossible situation, being \nplaced in a situation not of his making. Nonetheless, the quality of \nhis effort and leadership is recognized in this Capitol, as it has been \nfor many years. I, too, wish to recognize that.\n  With that said, I rise today to oppose the omnibus appropriations \nbill. In my opinion, this bill is the irresponsible product of a \ndishonest process. It is wrong for America, and I will vote against it.\n  For the first time in a generation, this Congress balanced the \nFederal budget. We had a chance to deliver--deliver real tax relief for \nthe second year in a row. Instead, we began to drift early this year by \nfailing to pass an annual budget resolution--the first year without a \nbudget resolution since the Budget Act became law in 1974. Now we have \nthis unaccountable bill that gives away much of our hard-fought budget \nsuccess.\n  It is humanly impossible for any of us in this Congress to know all \nthat is in this bill. Some parts were still changing as recently as \nyesterday, and the full text of the bill was not available even to most \nU.S. Senators until almost noon today. It will take months for us to \nstudy the more than 3,000 pages of text and learn what is in it. Yet, \nwe are asked to vote on this package, up or down, no amendments, with a \ncouple of hours of debate. Take it or leave it.\n  Mr. President, that is irresponsible. That is irresponsible. We \ncannot forget that the American people are watching. We have to take a \nstep back from all of this, from the swirl of negotiations and the \ndeal-making--oh, yes, there has been a lot of deal-making--and remember \nwho pays the bills. Whose money is it? We seem to forget whose money we \nare dealing with. We talk about a billion here, and a billion there--\n$100 billion. Now we are up to over $500 billion in this bill. This \nmoney comes from the pockets of the American taxpayer. It is their \nmoney. It is not the Congress' money. And they are watching. The \nAmerican taxpayers are watching. They are watching how we spend their \nhard-earned money.\n\n  We don't have very good answers, certainly not in this bill. None of \nus knows, or could possibly know everything that the money is going \nfor--the taxpayers' money is going for--in this bill, or how many \nmillions of dollars have been tucked away for special projects for \nindividual Members thrown in at the last minute behind the curtain \ndeals. Can anyone possibly believe that this mindless process gives the \nAmerican people any confidence that Congress knows what is going on, or \nCongress knows what it is doing, or Congress knows or cares about how \nwe spend the taxpayers' money? The American people look at this \nprocess, and they turn away in disgust, as they should.\n  I want to share with this body, Mr. President, a couple of comments \nfrom letters and e-mail I have received from constituents in Nebraska \nin the last 48 hours.\n  This one comes from Mr. Lee Hamann of Elkhorn, NE. He writes:\n\n       Absolutely incredible. The 100,000-teacher item is another \n     hoax, just like the 100,000-police-officer scam a few years \n     ago--that the Congress and President Clinton pulled on \n     America. Where do the local governmental bodies get the money \n     to continue to pay these new positions after the Federal \n     money runs out? And who says we need 100,000 new teachers?\n\n  Who invented that number?\n\n       One of the biggest problems in funding education is that \n     the majority of the money is not being spent on teachers; \n     it's going to administration. Compliance with Federal \n     mandates [and regulations] and a whole host of other \n     politically correct nonsense that has nothing to do with \n     teaching our children and maintaining good discipline in \n     schools. If Congress wants to do something positive for \n     education, then give us a realistic school voucher system and \n     allow parents to deduct tuition to private schools [church or \n     secular].\n\n  This comes from a constituent, a taxpayer.\n  Another one from Mr. Michael J. Snyder from Edison, NE. He writes:\n\n       I would like to have seen a tax cut for the family. Not \n     everybody in Nebraska farms.\n\n  Not everybody is going to get some of the extra money.\n\n\n[[Page S12703]]\n\n\n       There are some of us who would like to see a cut in our \n     income tax so that we would be able to keep more of our own \n     money to use for our own purposes. I think we can find better \n     ways to use it than the Federal Government.\n\n  Another one from David Begley from Omaha, NE. He says:\n\n       Why do all the appropriations bills get done at the last \n     minute and then the President threatens to shut down the \n     Government and blame the Republicans?\n       Who is in charge back there?\n\n  Good question.\n  Mr. President, I understand very well that our democracy requires \ncompromise. There is much room for honorable give and take in \nnegotiations--honest, open, honorable negotiations. I am well aware \nthat our negotiators had to face a President who pushed again and again \nand again for irresponsible new spending programs. I did not expect \nthis bill to be absolutely pure and free from all blemishes. None of us \ndid. But there must be a limit. This bill gave up too much. This bill \nbusts the budget. This bill busts the budget by more than $20 billion.\n  I don't believe the Founding Fathers of this country ever intended \nfor a few Members and staff to make more than one-half of a trillion \ndollars worth of arbitrary, closed-door decisions for the rest of us, \nfor America--almost one-third of the Federal budget--and then present \nthem to all other Senators and Representatives, men and women elected \nby the people of this country, by the taxpayers, and then say take it \nor leave it, an up-or-down vote. No debate, no amendments. This \nprocess, Mr. President, is not worthy of the U.S. Senate.\n  Instead of cutting taxes, paying down the national debt, or even \n``saving Social Security,'' this bill squanders the first budget \nsurplus in almost three decades. Almost one-third of the projected \nsurplus is going to more than $20 billion of new spending not paid for \nby offsetting it, by cutting any other spending. Instead of reflecting \nthe priorities of the American people, this bill reflects on the \npriorities of the minority in Congress, such as $1.2 billion in new \nFederal money to pacify the National Education Association.\n  Instead of less regulation, this bill gives us more government.\n  It includes a provision that will hamstring Federal prosecutors by \nsubjecting them to a patchwork of State ethical guidelines. On its \nmerits, this provision never would have survived the U.S. Senate.\n  It includes $192.5 million for the Global Environmental Facility, \neven though, Mr. President, the Senate and the House had rejected this \nlevel of funding. We had actually rejected it. And this is to advance a \ntreaty, the Global Warming Treaty, that the administration does not \nhave the guts to send to this body to debate. They don't have the guts \nto do it, because they know it would be defeated. But, yet, through \nback-door spending--and what we have given up after the House and the \nSenate said we weren't--but yet this is now put in this bill. We are \nallowing this administration to get away with it. How did something \nlike this get into this bill?\n\n  Of course, this bill also includes much that is good, much that I \nsupport and fought for, along with Chairman Stevens and others. I \nworked hard, like many of us, to win full funding and reforms for the \nInternational Monetary Fund.\n  I strongly support the agricultural relief provisions and many \nprovisions of this bill. But we should have the guts to stand up and \nsay these and other important programs are priorities. And we should \nhave the courage--we should have the courage--to tell the American \npublic how we are going to pay for it. We shouldn't use budget gimmicks \nto hide what we have spent.\n  This bill includes a full range of spending by the Federal \nGovernment, and it should have been subject to the full range and full \nscrutiny of honest, open debate. It should have been subject to debate \nand amendment--the most powerful, the most powerful and important tools \navailable for the U.S. Senators to carry out their constitutional \nresponsibilities. But, instead, this bill is presented to us without \nopportunity for amendment or opportunity to really know what is in this \nbill. Over 3,000 pages make up this bill.\n  This ``omnibus'' bill also includes several authorization bills--\npolicy bills--that should have risen or fallen on their own merits, not \nby finding their way into this unamendable tome. Congress should set \nnew government policy when ideas are fully debated. Congress should set \nnew government policies when ideas are amended and considered, and \ndefined and voted for--not when a small group of negotiators decides \nthat idea or this idea has merit. But this ``omnibus'' bill includes \nentire policy bills included in this one-half-trillion-dollar, over-\n3,000-page document.\n  Many of these policy bills have been slipped in from overhauls of \nimmigration policy to regulation of the Internet. Seven separate \nantidrug authorization bills were slipped into this ``omnibus'' bill. \nAnd we can't amend any of it. We can't shape it, change it, influence \nit, delete it. We can't do our jobs as representatives of the American \npeople.\n  Mr. President, this is not how the U.S. Senate should operate. The \nAmerican people deserve better, and until recently they got better.\n  Throughout the 1980s--let's go back to the 1980s--Congress did \nbusiness by passing ``omnibus'' bills, or ``continuing resolutions'' \nvery much like this one. These were unaccountable, pork-laden bills \nthat ran thousands of pages like this bill. They made a mockery of \naccountability of our democratic process. And then in 1988, many of you \nwill remember that President Reagan stood up against what he described \nas ``. . . monstrous continuing resolutions that pack hundreds of \nbillions of dollars worth of spending into one bill. . . .''\n  In his very memorable State of the Union Address, he stacked 3,296 \npages of budget bills weighing 43 pounds at the podium in the House of \nRepresentatives and implored Congress, ``Let's change all this.''\n  President Reagan called on Congress to pass spending bills the right \nway--the right way--one at a time, and he pledged to veto any future \ncontinuing resolutions. For 8 years, from 1988 through 1996, Congress \ndid its work, as it should, as the American people expected, and passed \nindividual appropriations bills in full and open debate.\n  Then Congress started slipping into an old pattern. The omnibus bill \nthat year, in 1996, rolled six of the 13 annual appropriations bills \ninto one. This year is worse, one of the worst ever, including eight of \nthe annual appropriations bills, plus authorization bills, in this \nomnibus appropriations bill.\n  It is time for us to stand up before this old process takes new root. \nIt is time once more to look at ourselves and declare: Let's change \nthis. I will vote against this bill because I believe it is wrong and \nthe process is wrong. I believe the right thing to do is to kill this \nbill and for Congress to keep working for the rest of this year, if it \ntakes that, until we do this right.\n  I believe we should worry less about the elections and polls and \ngovernment by calculation and more about doing our jobs, the jobs the \nAmerican people sent us here to do. But more importantly, I believe we \nwill all work hard--I will--to prevent this unaccountable process from \never happening again.\n  A top priority for this new Congress, the 106th Congress, that will \nbe seated in January of next year must be, must be, to make the \nnecessary changes and reforms to keep the budget process on track. \nPerhaps we should enact biennial budgeting and appropriations. The \ndistinguished chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Senator \nDomenici, has talked of this; Senator Stevens has talked of this. Or we \nmake other changes to ensure that we will put an end to this moonlight \nmadness. This must stop.\n  Mr. President, this is not Halloween. This isn't trick-or-treat time. \nThis is serious business. I am prepared to work with the Senate's \nbipartisan leadership, with all my colleagues, to make these changes \noccur. The American taxpayers expect and deserve better. We owe it to \nthe people who pay the bills.\n  My colleagues, we can change this nonsense. We must change this \nnonsense.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank my friend, the distinguished chairman \nof the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Alaska has 39 \nminutes.\n\n[[Page S12704]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. And Senator Byrd?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-one minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is my understanding I had reserved 15 minutes for the \nSenator from New Hampshire. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does my time that the Chair just announced include \nSenator Gregg's 15 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it does.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It does.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Chair.\n  How much time does the Senator from Montana wish, Mr. President?\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Senator. No more than probably 5 or 6 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the Senator such time as he wishes to use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, one does not have to reiterate the \ncomplexity of going through this process of appropriations. I rise on \nthis floor of the Senate with mixed emotions this afternoon as we \nconsider the omnibus appropriations bill for 1999. I, as the speaker \nbefore me, know and understand what the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee has gone through to bring this process to this point. I shall \nvote yea on this bill, but anybody who tells me that they have a handle \non this bill would be just like their local weather forecaster--they \nare either a fool or a newcomer.\n  The framers of our Constitution did not envision the process which \nwas the design of an administration that was irresponsible and reckless \nin both actions and words with the Congress and the people of this \ncountry. Being forced into a situation where the will of Americans is \ndenied in the spending of their hard-earned money, that is not my idea \nof representative government. The same Americans were even denied \ndebate on issues that would become the law of the land. I think it was \nThomas Jefferson who said that the Constitution should be flexible; it \nshould be subject to change with the times to reflect the will of the \npeople and not to the master politician. I believe the American people \nhave fallen prey to those who have mastered their craft very well.\n  The process, as all appropriations processes, started as it should \nhave; subcommittees, working with the administration, held hearings \nwith the different Departments of the Federal Government, which is the \nadministration. After being completed at that level, the consideration \nmoved to the full Appropriations Committee. All members of that \ncommittee debated and passed on to the full Senate the appropriations \nbill that was started at the subcommittee level some 6 or 7 months ago.\n  Where were all the voices that we hear now when the work was being \ndone at the grassroots level? Now we hear them as we come to the close \nof the 105th Congress. Did we not know then that a well-orchestrated \ndelaying action was taking shape? The answer is a resounding yes. There \nwas not one, not one who as a Member of Congress representing their \nrespective States, was not aware, did not know where we were heading. \nAttempts by this administration were made to shortcut or shortcircuit \nthe process. So when the 105th Congress closes its work, it will be the \nresponsibility of the 106th Congress to ensure that this will never \nhappen again. The American people deserve no less.\n  Now, as to the bill itself, to those critics who say there is not \ngood in this bill, I say you are wrong. To those who say there is no \ntax relief in this bill, I say you are wrong--small as is might seem. \nAnd to say that tax relief is not for the proper segment of our \nNation's economy, I say you are also wrong. To those who would say we \nhave saved, saved I say, Social Security and the financial foundation \nof our Nation, I say you are wrong again.\n  It is disingenuous to ask that money be spent from the Nation's \nTreasury for domestic social programs under emergency conditions \nknowing of the surplus of funds that now exists and knowing the \nappropriations would not be subject to budget caps that were agreed to \nover a year ago. The only absolute condition--Social Security can be \nsaved and reformed--is when Congress has created and saved, saved those \nsurplus funds to ensure its solvency. Spending some of the surplus \nweakens our ability to reform and ensure the solvency of any \nentitlement deemed by this Congress or the administration.\n  The most important ingredient to make our system work for all \nAmericans is trust and integrity. The framers of the Constitution \nwarned us that there are weaknesses and pitfalls and certain dangers in \nself-government. In fact, the self-governed, who have the power to vote \nthemselves bread with not one drop of sweat falling from their brows, \nare not absolved from the responsibility that they have at the ballot \nbox. We, every American, all share this duty.\n\n  For this system to survive depends on the degree of national \nresponsibility that is found in their elected Representatives. This \n105th Congress has addressed crises that fell on our ability to produce \nfood and fiber for this Nation. We addressed the crisis that has \nbefallen our rural communities as a result.\n  We have attempted to address education by using money alone. Again, I \nfear that we will be disappointed with the results. In this body, we \nmake most of our decisions based on history. The key has always been \nthe past. Communities of this Nation should have, and have had, the \npower and the wisdom to say ``what, why, and how'' they should educate \nthe next generation.\n  The stakes are high, as the very freedoms we all hold dear and above \nall else are at issue. The price of freedom is too dear to change the \nvery basic foundation. The Nation has always drawn its power from local \ncommunities and their ability to solve not just local problems, but \nmost of the problems of the Nation's interests. To abandon that premise \nwould be dangerous and unwise.\n  It is unfortunate that we have to pass a measure of this magnitude, \nof this size, but that is the way it was forced upon this Congress this \nyear. Were bad decisions made early on? Yes. But we can make some good \ndecisions now. We must always keep in mind: We only have a surplus in \nour Nation's Treasury as a result of a strong economy. You could say \nthe taxpayer really overpaid us. If they did, they are also telling us \nthat we should not keep the change.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n modifying section 110 of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant \n                       responsibility act of 1996\n\n  Mr. Abraham. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to comment \non a provision included in the omnibus appropriations measure that \nwould modify section 110 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and \nImmigrant Responsibility Act of 1996.\n  Section 110 would have required the INS to establish, by September \n30, 1998, an automated entry and exit control system to document the \narrival and departure of every alien entering the United States. This \nparticular language in the Illegal Immigration Reform Act was adopted \nonly in conference and had the unintended and unforeseen consequence of \nrequiring the INS to implement automated entry and exit control at land \nborders and at seaports, rather than simply at airports.\n  I learned of this market early this Congress and realized that \nextremely grave consequences would result to trade, commerce, tourism, \nand legitimate cross-border traffic if it were implemented anywhere \nother than at airports. My home State of Michigan would be hard-hit. \nMore United States-Canada trade crosses the Michigan border than in any \nother State. The American automobile industry in particular would be \ndevastated. That industry alone conducts over $300 million of trade \nwith Canada every single day, and relies on new ``just-in-time'' \ndelivery methods that make United States-Canada border crossings an \nintegral part of American automobile manufacturing. A delivery of parts \ndelayed by as little as twenty minutes can cause expensive assembly \nline shutdowns.\n  Unfortunately, testimony at the two Immigration Subcommittee hearings \nI chaired on this topic indicated that delays at the border could \nimmediately exceed 24 hours. Implementation of entry and exit control \nat the land borders would effectively shut the border and effectively \nshut down the auto and many other industries. It would also\n\n[[Page S12705]]\n\ninvolve untold expenditures in the billions of dollars for new \ninfrastructure and personnel.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues for appreciating the seriousness \nand urgency of this problem. The Senate spoke with one voice on this \nissue when it granted unanimous consent to the legislation I \nintroduced. Senate bill 1360, that removed any requirement to implement \nentry and exit control at the land borders and instead provided for a \nfeasibility study on implementing section 110 at the land borders. Last \nweek, the Senate granted unanimous consent to a stopgap measure I \nintroduced to ensure that implementation would not be required pending \nour resolving this on a longer-term basis.\n  My colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, who is the chairman \nof the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Subcommittee, also \nappreciated the importance and urgency of this issue when he ensured \nthat a provision concerning section 110 was included in the Senate \nCommerce, Justice, State appropriations bill.\n  Mr. Gregg. I thank the Senator from Michigan for pointing that out. \nWe included a repeal of section 110 in the CJS appropriations bill. \nSection 110 would require a tremendous amount of appropriations for \nwhat would be, in my view, almost no tangible benefit. We should be \nresponsible with our appropriations and ensure that federal monies are \nspent on immigration enforcement efforts that really will be effective, \nrather than on unintended, untried, and untested systems.\n  Mr. Abraham. Is my understanding correct that the current \nappropriations legislation before the Congress does not include any \nfunding for implementing entry and exit control at the land borders?\n  Mr. Gregg. That is correct.\n  Mr. Abraham. I would hope that the appropriators will ensure in the \nfuture that no money is appropriated for this system until it is \ncertain that the system will cause no additional delays at the land \nborders and will not harm American trade, tourism, or other legitimate \ncross-border traffic in any way. Do you agree?\n  Mr. GREGG. I agree with you entirely on that.\n  Mr. GORTON. Let me just add, both as a member of the Appropriations \nCommittee and as a Senator from the State of Washington, that I agree \nthat no money should be spent on implementing any such system at the \nland borders or seaports until we are assured that no adverse \nconsequences will result. I am convinced that the consequences would be \ndisastrous. I would also like to ask the distinguished Majority Leader \nfor his support.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank my colleagues. I agree that we have no idea at this \npoint what sort of system would be implemented at land borders and \nseaports or how much it would cost. Under the compromise worked out \nwith the House and included in the omnibus legislation, there will be \nno implementation at the land borders or seaports for 2\\1/2\\ years. I \nhope that will give us enough time to figure out what to do with this.\n  Let me assure my colleagues that if it becomes clear that such a \nsystem will not be able to be implemented without adverse effects on \nour border communities, on trade, or on tourism, I will work with them \non authorizing legislation to remedy any problems and will work with \nthem to ensure that no appropriations go toward implementing any system \nthat will not be acceptable to them and supported in their States.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the distinguished Majority Leader for his \nconcern and his support. I would also like to note that the compromise \nlanguage provides that the system to be developed by the INS must ``not \nsignificantly disrupt trade, tourism, or other legitimate cross-border \ntraffic at land border points of entry.''\n  As I have noted, delays of even 20 minutes or less could cause very \nsignificant disruptions in the auto industry in Michigan. I am sure the \nmany other industries and States affected will face similar devastating \nconsequences from increases in waiting time at the land borders. \nDisruptions must be considered all along the chain of production and \ntrade and in the widest possible context, not simply in terms of what \nactually occurs at the border, in determining whether or not they are \nsignificant. Do my colleagues agree?\n  Mr. LOTT. I agree.\n  Mr. GORTON. I agree.\n  Mr. GREGG. I agree.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank my colleagues and appreciate their support.\n  I will be working to ensure that such a system never harms our \nborders and our trade, and will also be working on providing that this \nissue is properly studied before it is implemented.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to commend the distinguished \nSenator from Michigan for all of his hard work on the H1B visa program. \nI voted against passage of this measure in the Senate in the spring but \ntoday am happy to have it included in the omnibus. This is due to the \nincredible efforts of Senator Abraham. This is a well-balanced measure \nthat addresses the needs of the business community while protecting the \nwell-being of American workers. One of the most impressive \naccomplishments in this proposal is that it attempts to meet a short-\nterm labor shortfall while instituting a program to ensure a long-term \nlabor supply. The bill creates a new program of grants to provide \ntechnical skills training for workers.\n  This bill contains provisions to ensure that Americans will not be \nharmed by this legislation. A $500 fee paid by businesses wishing to \nparticipate in the H1B program will raise approximately $75 million \nannually to be split between a scholarship program for underprivileged \nhigh school students studying mathematics, computer science, or \nengineering and funding for job training programs which focus on \ninformation technology.\n  One project that I hope would be supported under this new program is \nthe DePaul University High-Tech Workforce Pilot Program in Chicago. It \nwas developed in conjunction with Chicago companies and local \ngovernment with the goal of preparing America's workforce to compete in \nthe dynamic high-tech industry. It has also been developed to be a \nmodel that can be replicated by other universities and cities. I \nbelieve that DePaul's training, retraining and education program will \nexpand America's skilled labor force.\n  Let me again congratulate, Senator Abraham for his success and hard \nwork.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois. As he \npointed out, the American Competitiveness and Workplace Improvement \nAct, includes a provision to provide math, engineering and computer \nscience scholarships to needy students and a provision to provide \nadditional worker training programs. There are a number of pilot \nprograms being developed around the country to provide high-tech \ntraining to American workers. As Senator Durbin mentioned, DePaul \nUniversity has developed just such a pilot program to address the \nshortage of qualified U.S. high-tech workers that might well serve as a \ngood model for other programs across the country. Programs like the one \ndeveloped by DePaul University are what we had in mind when the \ntraining provisions were drafted.\n\n\n                           national security\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I understand that language has been added to \nsection 117 of the FY99 Treasury-Postal appropriations bill since that \nbill was passed by the Senate. It is also my understanding that this \nbill will be included in the omnibus spending bill. I would like \nclarification from my colleague from North Carolina who attended the \nconference on this legislation.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I join my colleague from Florida in making this inquiry. \nSince enactment of the provision by the Senate, I have noted that a new \nsection (d) has been added in conference, which provides that the \nPresident may waive the ``requirements'' of this section in the \nnational security. I note that the term ``requirements'' may require \nclarification. As I understand the import of this language, it does not \nallow the President to waive the section as a whole, but only those \npart that relate to ``requirements'' on the Secretaries of Treasury and \nState. Is that the understanding of the Senator from North Carolina?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Yes, that is my understanding, and that is confirmed \nby the Report of the Conference Managers, which distinguishes between \nthe term\n\n[[Page S12706]]\n\n``provision'' and the term ``requirements of this provision.'' And it \nis further my understanding that, to the extent that the section 117 \nestablishes any ``requirements`' within this so-called waiver \nprovision, those requirements are contained only in new section (2)(A).\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. As the author of the original provision, Mr. \nPresident, I can assure my colleagues that it was my intention that \nstate sponsors of terrorist acts against Americans pay the price for \ntheir deeds set by U.S. courts. I did not include a waiver because I \ndon't believe countries which sponsor terrorism should be shielded from \nthese judgements. On the interpretation of the waiver added in \nconference, I would have to rely on the Senator from North Carolina and \nthe chairman of the Appropriations Committee.\n\n\n                 department of energy's windows program\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I would like to engage Senator Graham in a \ncolloquy concerning the Department of Energy's energy saving windows \nprogram. I would first like to thank Senator Gorton for his past \nefforts in assisting the State of Florida's development of \nelectrochromic technology. We support the Department of Energy's \ncontinued support of the State of Florida's electrochromic program.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Electrochromic technology provides a flexible means of \ncontrolling the amount of heat and light that pass through a glass \nsurface providing significant energy conservation opportunities. I \nunderstand the Department of Energy estimates that placing this \ntechnology on all commercial building windows in the United States \nwould produce yearly energy savings equivalent to the amount of oil \nthat passes through the Alaskan pipeline each year.\n  Mr. MACK. I have been told the State of Florida has provided over \n$1.2 million toward the advancement of plasma enhanced chemical vapor \ndeposition (PECVD) techniques for electrochromic applications. The \nprogram is being undertaken in conjunction with the University of South \nFlorida and utilizes the expertise and patented technology of the \nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. This program is an excellent example of successful \ntechnology transfer from a national laboratory as well as an example of \na successful public/private partnership. I understand the program is \nconsistent with industry priorities and the goals of the Department of \nEnergy's energy saving windows program.We hope that the Department of \nEnergy will provide no less than $1 million of Fiscal Year 1999 funding \nfor electrochromics to further the State of Florida's development of \nPECVD techniques for electrochromic technology.\n  Mr. MACK. I understand that the State of Florida's development of \nplasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) for electrochromic \napplications is consistent with the priorities of the industry within \nthe United States and the goals of the Department of Energy's windows \nprogram?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Senator you are correct. I would also like to voice my \nconcern regarding Fiscal Year 1998 funding that has not been provided \nby the Department of Energy to assist the State of Florida's program.\n  Mr. MACK. I agree with you Senator. I hope the Department of Energy \nwill move quickly to release Fiscal Year 1998 funding in an effort to \nmaintain domestic superiority in this important energy conservation \ntechnology.\n\n\n   fiscal year 1999 treasury and general government appropriations--\n                             midwest hidta\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to thank Chairman Campbell \nfor his hard work, commitment, and dedication to increasing the funding \nlevel for the high-intensity drug trafficking areas in the fiscal year \n1999 Treasury and General Government appropriations bill. When the \nSenate version of this legislation was being debated on the floor, \nChairman Campbell and I worked together to increase funding for several \nof these areas, including an additional $3.5 million for the Midwest \nHIDTA.\n  Mr. President, in the last three years, the Midwest has experienced a \nphenomenal increase in the importation, distribution, and clandestine \nmanufacturing of methamphetamine. The region's central location, \nvariety of interstate highway systems, along with its air and rail hubs \nenhance, its popularity as a market for Mexican methamphetamine \ntrafficking operating out of the Southwest border areas. The Midwest \nHIDTA is integral to the strategy employed by each state to reduce \nmethamphetamine importation, distribution, manufacturing, and related \ncriminal activity.\n  Although the conference report for the fiscal year 1999 Treasury and \nGeneral Government appropriations bill did not include specific funding \nfor each HIDTA, the conferees did include a significant increase in \nHIDTA funding.\n  Therefore, I would like to ask the Chairman of the Treasury and \nGeneral Government Appropriations Subcommittee if it was the intent of \nthe conferees that a large portion of the increase in HIDTA funding \nshould go to the areas which were specifically listed in S. 2312 as \npassed by the Senate. These areas include the current Midwest HIDTA, an \nexpansion of the Midwest HIDTA to include the State of North Dakota, \nthe Central Florida HIDTA, the Cascade HIDTA, and the Southwest Border \nHIDTA.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank my colleague from Iowa for raising this issue. \nThe Senator from Iowa is correct that the conferees did not include a \nspecific increase in funding for the individual HIDTA's. However, it is \nmy hope that the Office of National Drug Control Policy will use these \nextra resources to fund an increase in those HIDTA's which demonstrates \nthe greatest need. Consideration should be given to those HIDTA's cited \nin the amendment described by the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my colleague from Colorado for his assistance in \nthis matter, and for his efforts to increase the safety of our citizens \nby substantially reducing drug-related crime and violence.\n\n\n                           energy efficiency\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to further clarify that \nthe language in the legislative report that accompanied S. 2237 with \nrespect to energy efficiency codes and standards was not intended to \nconflict with existing laws. This issue was debated thoroughly when the \nCongress passed the Energy Policy and Conservation Act in 1975, and \nagain in the debate over the 1992 Energy Policy Act. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record a letter from seven of my \ncolleagues expressing concern over this language.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 3, 1998.\n     Senator Frank H. Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman.  We are deeply concerned over language \n     in the legislative report that accompanies S. 2237, The \n     Department of the Interior and Related Agencies \n     appropriations bill. Several sentences in the Energy \n     Conservation section of the report (pp. 100-101) reverse \n     nearly a quarter-century of federal policy and ignore the \n     clear statutory direction given in the Energy Policy and \n     Conservation Act 1975 (``EPCA'').\n       EPCA is where the Department of Energy's appliance \n     efficiency program began and it clearly says (at 42 U.S.C. \n     6291) that DOE should measure ``the quantity of energy \n     directly consumed by a consumer product at its point of \n     use.'' Then and now, others believe that DOE's standards \n     should be based upon a more expansive definition of energy \n     use, one that included exogenous factors like ``total fuel \n     cycle'' costs, emissions and externalities.\n       Congress and the President wisely rejected such an approach \n     both in 1975 and in succeeding debates in recognition that \n     determining the energy use of an appliance at its point-of-\n     use is a measurement, while attempting to factor in various \n     exogenous factors is an attempt to estimate that which cannot \n     be measured, projected, quantified or extrapolated with any \n     real accuracy. It is a case of comparing hard, objective \n     measurements with soft, subjective estimates.\n       This approach was clearly seen as unworkable in 1975. \n     Nothing that has happened in the intervening twenty-three \n     years makes it any more workable toady. No two people could \n     agree on which exogenous factors should be quantified, let \n     alone how they might be quantified. The resulting numbers \n     would be useless, reflecting politics rather than good \n     science, engineering or mathematics.\n       This report language, which directs the Department to drop \n     the current ``point of use'' standard in favor of this \n     expansive ``source based'' standard, was inserted with no \n     hearings, no debate and no attempt to involve the committee \n     of jurisdiction, which you chair. In addition, DOE's recently \n     formed Advisory Committee on Appliance Standards\n\n[[Page S12707]]\n\n     was completely ignored by the ``source energy'' advocates, \n     who are themselves members of the Advisory Committee.\n       We urge you, as Chairman of the Energy Committee, to assert \n     your committee's jurisdiction over this statute and program. \n     A program that has provided America's consumers with accurate \n     and useful information for the past twenty-three deserves \n     thorough review before changes of this magnitude.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tom Harkin.\n     Chuck Grassley.\n     Craig Thomas.\n     Michael B. Enzi.\n     Larry E. Craig.\n     John Glenn.\n     Jan Kyl.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. During past consideration of this issue, the majority \nof Congress determined that energy consumed at the point of use can be \nmeasured, projected and extrapolated with greater accuracy than data \nbased on subjective estimates of externalities, such as emissions, and \n``source energy.'' This determination is clearly reflected in the \nauthorizing statute, 42 USCS Section 6291, which defines ``energy use'' \nas ``the quantity of energy directly consumed by a consumer product at \npoint of use, determined in accordance with test procedures under \nsection 323 (42USCS Sec. 6293).'' Any substantive change in existing \nlaw and policy should only be undertaken after careful consideration by \nthe authorizing committee of jurisdiction, the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  With respect to the Federal Energy Management Program, another \nprogram potentially affected by this language, 42 USCS 8253 and \nExecutive Orders 12759 and 12902, which relate to improvement in energy \nefficiency in federal buildings, stating that ``each agency shall apply \nenergy conservation measures to, and shall improve the design for the \nconstruction of, its Federal buildings in use during the fiscal year \n1995 is at least 10 percent less that the energy consumption per gross \nsquare foot of its Federal buildings in use during the fiscal year \n1985. . . .''\n  The June 1996 policy statement of the Federal Intergency Energy \nPolicy Committee interprets these authorities as encouraging cost-\neffective energy projects that results in ``operational cost savings,'' \nregardless of whether that consumption is measured on a site basis or a \nsource basis. While this allows the goal of reduced energy consumption \nto be demonstrated by source or site analysis, saving taxpayer dollars \nis retained as its primary criteria for projects. A change to \nconsideration of externalities and ``source energy efficiency'' over \ndirect cost savings would be a major change that should also be \nundertaken only after thorough analysis of its impact by the \nauthorizing committee.\n  I understand the concern that the Department could improve the \nanalytical methods that are used to calculate ``source'' energy \nefficiency, which would give consideration to the full panoply of costs \ninvolved in using various appliances and making other energy efficiency \ndecisions. Under the authorizing statute, the Department may make an \neffort to reduce the subjectivity involved in making the estimates \nnecessary to make ``source energy'' calculations.\n  This work can be taken into account as the appropriate authorizing \ncommittees consider changes in our existing national policy. Until that \ntime, the existing statutes are the law of the land.\n\n\n                       The American Fisheries Act\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Omnibus Appropriations measure before \nus contains an important provision regarding foreign ownership and \ncontrol of United States fishing vessels as well as a resolution of \ndisputes regarding the North Pacific pollock fishery. More than one \nyear ago, Senator Stevens introduced S. 1221, the American Fisheries \nAct. A major purpose of this legislation, and a goal I strongly \nsupport, was to further increase the level of ownership of U.S. fishing \nvessels. The Americanization of the U.S. fishing industry began in 1976 \nwith the passage of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management \nAct which established a 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and \nprioritized access to fishery resources within the EEZ to American \ncitizens. This legislation is an historic milestone in international \nmarine policy and set a precedent that all coastal nations have \nfollowed. It was an important step in securing American control of the \nvast fishery resources off our coastlines.\n  Eleven years later, another step was taken to further Americanize \nU.S. fisheries. The 1987 Anti-Reflagging Act required U.S. citizens to \nown and control at least 51% of any U.S.-flag fishing vessels. This Act \nalso included grandfather provisions that, because of drafting errors, \nallowed any current U.S. flag fishing vessels that did not meet the new \nstandard to be exempt from the new ownership standard and allowed \nvessels under contract to be rebuilt into fishing vessels in foreign \nshipyards to retain their U.S. fishing privileges. The two grandfather \nprovisions allowed a far greater degree of foreign owned and controlled \nfishing vessels to remain is U.S. fisheries than had been intended. \nAlthough the United States Coast Guard correctly interpreted these \ngrandfather provisions in a legal sense, there has been ongoing \ncontroversy regarding Congressional intent with these grandfather \nprovisions and their application by the Coast Guard.\n  Eleven years later, the American Fisheries Act will finally resolve \nthis issue. It requires a real, effective, and enforceable U.S. \nownership threshold for U.S. flag fishing vessels. Under this Act, U.S. \ncitizens must own and control 75 percent of the ownership interest in \nany U.S. flag fishing vessel. I strongly support these provisions as an \nimportant step in our ongoing efforts to Americanize the fisheries of \nthe United States EEZ. It is time to more fully ensure that the vast \nfishery resources of the United States are harvested by Americans. \nThese provisions will go a long way to making that the case.\n  In addition to the further Americanization of U.S. fisheries, the \nTitle included in the Omnibus Appropriations measure also resolves the \nlong-standing allocation battles surrounding the North Pacific pollock \nfishery. When S.1221 was introduced by Senator Stevens in September \n1997, one of the goals in addition to Americanizing the U.S. fishing \nfleet was to phase out a number of Seattle-based catcher processors \nthat had used the grandfather provisions of the 1987 Anti-Reflagging \nAct to enter the pollock fishery. Senator Slade Gorton and I strongly \nopposed the original legislation because of the devastating impact this \nphase out would have had on Washington state jobs andthe Puget Sound \neconomy. However, there were a number of Washington state \nconstituencies who strongly supported the legislation and the phase out \nof these catcher processors.\n  In the interest of resolving this issue, Senator Gorton convened a \nmeeting in August 1998 of all the major participants in the North \nPacific pollock fishery to explore the possibility of reaching a \nsettlement of the dispute. My good colleague from Washington state \nestablished a number of principles which all the parties agreed to and \nguided the discussion of potential solutions. Those discussions led to \nthe conclusion that 4 key issues needed to be addressed: \nAmericanization, decapital-\nization, rationalization, and reallocation. This meeting led to a \nseries of intense negotiations among the major North Pacific pollock \nfishery participants, led by Senator Stevens office, that provided the \nframework for the legislation before us.\n  While my colleagues from Alaska and Washington have provided a much \nmore detailed outline of the provisions of the American Fisheries Act, \nI would like to summarize some of the key aspects.\n  This bill includes a substantial reallocation of the North Pacific \nfishery resource, one of the most valuable fishery resources in the \nworld. The 1.2 million metric ton fishery is worth approximately $250 \nmillion annually. For the last 6 years, there has been tremendous \nallocation disputes regarding this resource before the North Pacific \nFishery Management Council. Prior to 1992, the offshore component of \nthe fishery harvested approximately 85% of the resource. In 1992, the \nNorth Pacific Fishery Management Council reduced this harvest level by \nallocating 35% of the resource to the onshore component of the fishery, \nthat is, catcher boats delivering to onshore processing plants. \nRecently, the Council recommended to the Secretary of Commerce \nincreasing this percentage to 39%. This bill provides 50% of the \nresource to the onshore sector, 10% to the mothership\n\n[[Page S12708]]\n\nsector, and 40% to the offshore sector, permanently resolving the long-\nstanding allocation battles over this valuable resource. With each \npercentage point of the total allowable catch valued at approximately \n$5 million, this shift in harvest opportunity represents anywhere from \na $55 million to $75 million reallocation.\n  To offset this massive move of fish, the legislation includes a \nsubstantial reduction in the excess fishing capacity in the offshore \nsector. Overcapitalization has been an ongoing problem in all North \nPacific fisheries and is the source of the allocation battles that \nensue over these fisheries. This act will permanently remove nine \npollock factory trawlers from the pollock fishery, in fact, from the \nU.S. EEZ entirely. Eight of these vessels will be scrapped, preventing \nthem from being used in any fishery in the world. In exchange for \nretiring these vessels and transferring the pollock catch history \nassociated with them to the onshore sector, the owners of these vessels \nwill be paid $90 million. An additional $5 million will be paid to the \nremaining participants in the offshore sector of the fishery for the \nadditional reduction in the offshore allocation. $20 million will be \nprovided by the federal government as it bears responsibility for the \nfailure of the 1987 Anti-Reflagging Act to effectively keep foreign \nfishing vessels out of the U.S. EEZ. The remaining $75 million will be \npaid by the onshore sector through a federally-guaranteed loan.\n  Replacement of the capacity represented by these removed vessels is \nprevented by statutorily establishing either through explicit listing \nof the vessels or specific criteria for participation, the factory \ntrawlers, motherships, catcher boats, and onshore processors that can \ncontinue to participate in the North Pacific pollock fishery. This \nlisting of the eligible fishery participants is essential to preventing \nrecapitalization of the fishery and ensuring that steps toward \nrationalizing the fishery can proceed. It has not been done without \ncontroversy, however. There has been a great deal of concern among the \nfishing industry in Washington state and Alaska about the exclusive \nlisting of onshore processors. Many fishery participants have made a \ndistinction between addressing overcapitalization on the water and on \nthe land. Many have argued that the exclusive listing of onshore \nprocessors will deny fishermen competitive markets for their fish. \nOthers are concerned that it locks in substantial foreign investment in \nthe processing sector of the fishery while at the same time the bill \nseeks to further Americanize the harvesting of fish in the U.S. EEZ. I \nshare these concerns. However, the need to rationalize this fishery \nnecessitates this action. In the absence of this provision, the ability \nto proceed with the formation of fishery cooperatives as a means to end \nthe race for fish could not be successful. In the end, I feel the \npotential benefits such rationalization could provide for both the \nresource and the industry dependent upon it justify this action. \nNonetheless, I think it imperative that both the Council and the \nCongress closely monitor the impacts of this provision to ensure it \nachieves our goal of improving the situation for fishermen. If not, \nadditional measures may need to be taken.\n  This bill relies in great measure on the ability and willingness of \nthe North Pacific pollock fishery sectors to form fishery cooperatives. \nFishery cooperatives, authorized under current law, are a privately \nnegotiated allocation on a company-by-company or vessel-by-vessel basis \nof a portion of the total allowable catch. Similar to an individual \nfishing quota program, cooperatives provide fishery participants with \nthe certainty they need to stop the race for fish, and harvest and \nprocess the fish on a more flexible schedule with greater attention to \nbycatch, efficiency, and safety. The existing fishery cooperative in \nthe offshore sector of the Pacific Whiting fishery has shown tremendous \nbenefits in these regards and has helped rationalize the fishery. It is \nhoped that cooperatives can do the same in the pollock fishery.\n  In the interest of ensuring that small, independent fishermen are the \ntrue beneficiaries of fishery cooperatives, the bill includes a number \nof requirements for fishery cooperatives in all three sectors which are \ndesigned to provide these small, independent fishermen with sufficient \nleverage in the negotiations to protect their interests.\n  In addition, the bill attempts to ensure adequate protections for \nother fisheries in the North Pacific and Pacific from any potential \nadverse impacts resulting from the formation of fishery cooperatives in \nthe pollock fishery. The formation of fishery cooperatives will \nundoubtedly free up harvesting and processing capacity that can be used \nin new or expanded ways in other fisheries. Although many of these \nvessels and processors have legitimate, historic participation in these \nother fisheries, they should not be empowered by this legislation to \ngain a competitive advantage in these other fisheries to the detriment \nof participants who have not benefitted from the resolution of the \npollock fishery problems.\n  While we have attempted to include at least a minimum level of \nprotections for these other fisheries, it is clear to many of us that \nunintended consequences are likely. It is therefore imperative that the \nfishery management councils not perceive the protections provided in \nthis bill as a statement by Congress that these are the only \nprotections needed. In fact, the opposite is true. Although the \nprotections provided for the head and gut groundfish offshore sector \nfrom the pollock offshore sector are more highly developed and \narticulated in the bill, the protections for other fisheries are \nlargely left for the Councils to recommend. Those of us involved \nintimately in the development of this legislation strongly urge the \nCouncils to monitor the formation of fishery cooperatives closely and \nensure that other fisheries are held harmless to the maximum extent \npossible.\n  In particular, the legislation directs the North Pacific Council to \naddress the issue of latent capacity in the Bering Sea crab fishery. I \nam deeply concerned by the recent failure of the North Pacific Council \nto address this issue in response to this legislation. The relatively \nminor level of protection provided in the bill for the Bering Sea crab \nfishery should in no way be construed by the Council as sufficient to \nprotect the crab fishery from potential adverse impacts of pollock \nfishery cooperatives nor should it be deemed sufficient to address the \nissue of overcapitalization of the crab fishery and the need to remove \nlatent capacity. I strongly urge the Council to take measures to \nfurther reduce latent capacity in the crab fishery beyond that which \nthe License Limitation Program addressed and to avoid rewarding \nspeculative participation in anticipation of the developing industry-\nfunded capacity reduction program being developed by the crab industry. \nAt the same time, the Council should ensure that true historic \nparticipants in the crab fishery who have made legitimate investments \nto harvest crab are not eliminated.\n  The American Fisheries Act title in this Omnibus Appropriations \nmeasure is an important next step in our efforts to Americanize U.S. \nfisheries and ensure their long-term sustainable use. I support this \nprovision and will work with my colleagues to ensure that is \neffectively and fairly implemented. In closing, I want to thank Senator \nStevens, Gorton, and Murkowski for their hard work on this legislation. \nI would also like to acknowledge the hard work of Trevor McCabe, Jeanne \nBumpus, Bill Woolf, Martin Kodis, and my own staff, Justin LeBlanc. \nWithout their dedication and perseverance, we would not have put this \nlegislation together.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding there is some time \nremaining on this issue, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is indeed. There are 41 minutes under \nthe order; 30 of those minutes have been allocated so there remains 11 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to address this piece of \nlegislation which is being talked about on the floor. Millions of \npeople come to Washington, DC, every year to see the sights of \nWashington. One of the most impressive is a trip to the Archives. Go to \nthe Archives and see the glass cases. In those cases you will find the \nConstitution of the United States in its original form and the \nDeclaration of Independence. Schoolchildren remember that for a \nlifetime. They have seen a document that is historic.\n\n[[Page S12709]]\n\n  I might say to my colleagues in the Senate, I have just seen a \ndocument that is historic. Not 50 feet away from where I stand, in room \n224, sits a document of 4,000 pages; some 25 pounds of paper that \ncomprise this omnibus legislation we are talking about, a measure \nrarely seen by anyone.\n  Is it important? A third of the Federal budget is in that document in \nthat room, and most of the Members of the Senate, aside from a glance \nwalking through, will not see anything else in the document. If we are \nquizzed as to what is in the measure, we are hoping that our staff or \nsomeone else has read it because, frankly, we have not.\n  How did we get in this predicament? How are we here, on October 20, \nat the tail end of a misspent life, wondering why this Senate and this \nCongress were so unproductive during the 105th Congress? Some want to \nblame the President. But I remind those who do to take a look at the \nConstitution, because the Constitution has established three branches \nof Government, each with a responsibility. In this case, our \nresponsibility was, on April 15, to pass a budget resolution, a \nresolution which was to be basically a blueprint for all spending by \nthe Appropriations Committee.\n  I see the Senator from Alaska, the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, here. I have served on the House Appropriations Committee, \nand I know that budget resolution is your guide, your roadmap, for \ndetermining how much each department can be given in money. Does the \nPresident write the budget resolution? No. It is passed by the House, \nthen the Senate. It is enacted by them as a resolution and not a law. \nThe President doesn't even sign it.\n  What happened this year? We never passed a budget resolution. For the \nfirst time in 25 years we failed to pass a budget resolution. Was it \nthe President's fault? Not at all. It was the fault of the House and \nthe Senate. You see, the Senate passed its version of the budget \nresolution. When it went over to the House, they said, ``We think the \nsurplus is so invigorating we want to give away $800 billion in tax \ncuts.'' Luckily, some Republican Senators--Democrats as well--said that \nis irresponsible and stopped it in its tracks, and that was the end of \nthe discussion.\n  Then everything started piling up. We did not pass a budget \nresolution. We did not pass seven appropriations bills. In fact, you \nwould need a bloodhound and a flashlight to find anything that we have \ndone in the past year that we have been in session--with the exception \nof renaming Washington National Airport after President Reagan.\n  Here we are, 3 weeks into this new fiscal year, without a budget \nresolution trying to play catchup. We are fearful of another Government \nshutdown, because Congress has failed to meet its responsibility, and \nwe are moving to try, in one vote in the House today and the Senate \ntomorrow, to correct the mistakes of a year with one bill: 4,000 pages, \n25 pounds of documentation.\n  This Congress has failed to pass campaign finance reform, a \nbipartisan measure supported by the President--killed on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate. This Congress has failed to pass any effort to stop \nthe tobacco companies from luring our children into addiction--another \nbipartisan effort, killed on the floor of the Senate. This Congress has \nfailed to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights, reform of managed care so \nthat all of us as patients have some rights to quality care when we go \nto see a doctor or to a hospital--killed on the floor of the Senate. We \nhave failed to do anything to preserve the Social Security system \nbeyond the year 2030, even though we have the wherewithal in this \nsurplus to start speaking in specific terms about doing that. We have \nfailed to pass the legislation proposed by my colleague, Senator Carol \nMoseley-Braun of Illinois, to invest in 5,000 new and repaired schools \nacross America to try to address the onslaught of children who will be \ncoming into school, increasing the school population of our Nation and \nmaking certain that current schools have the technology to be able to \nteach our children as they should. We did not address that, either.\n  Literally in the closing days of negotiations, President Clinton came \nto the negotiators, to the Republican leaders, and said: This Congress \nwill not leave town without doing at least one thing, one thing for \neducation, but an important thing--reducing, on a nationwide basis, \nclass size in grades kindergarten through 3 to no more than 18 students \nin a classroom. That is what the 100,000 teachers are about, so we have \nenough teachers so kids have the kind of attention they need at the \nearliest time in their educational development.\n  I happen to think that is one of the most important things we could \ndo in our Nation. My wife and I raised three children. We are watching \na little grandson grow up right now. You come to realize what early \nchildhood development means. The biggest growth industry in America \ntoday is the construction of prisons. How many of those prisoners might \nhave had a different life if they got off to a better start?\n  That better start could have been a better classroom experience, a \nbetter education.\n  When I asked the warden of a prison in Illinois recently about how \nmany of the inmates there came to prison even close to any level of \ncompetency in education, he said fewer than half. Most people who show \nup in prison have little or no educational skills. It is part of their \nfrustration. I won't make that as an excuse for committing a crime, but \ncertainly you can understand the frustration and waste involved when we \ndon't use education well.\n  President Clinton said to the negotiators, ``You won't leave town, \nyou won't put together this bill unless and until you include at least \none initiative for education in America.'' He pushed hard for it. He \nachieved it.\n  I am happy there is more money for Head Start. That is an excellent \ninvestment.\n  There is more money as well for the National Institutes of Health. On \na bipartisan basis, we are increasing medical research by 14 percent--a \nsmart thing to do.\n  The health insurance deduction for the self-employed is accelerated \nso they can be treated fairly, so small businesses and farmers get a \nfair share.\n  And there is agriculture relief which, to those of us in the Midwest, \nmeans a lot. In Illinois, the Dakotas, Minnesota, all across the \nMidwest, we face a crisis. Luckily, with the President's leadership, we \nincrease the money in this bill to take care of it.\n  There are other things as well--food safety initiatives, which I \nsupport, and funding the IMF.\n  But there are things we failed to do. Can you believe we are still in \na deadbeat status, the United States of America, when it comes to \npaying our United Nations dues? We were a few million dollars away from \nbeing disqualified in voting in the Security Council because we \ncontinue to stiff the United Nations year after year after year, an \nagency which we turn to, as President Bush did with the Persian Gulf \nwar, as we do on a frequent basis, to try to promote peace in the world \nand to promote the goals of our foreign policy.\n  This Congress refuses to pay our dues. It is an embarrassment. We are \na nation which calls on the world to meet its moral responsibilities, \nand yet we don't meet our moral responsibility in paying these dues. \nThat is a disgrace, as far as I am concerned.\n  There are going to be things in this 4,000-page bill--I just learned \nof one. My friend, Senator Barbara Boxer, got on the floor with me--and \nSenator Wellstone remembers the debate --and we talked about all the \noil companies drilling for oil on publicly owned land, land owned by \nthe taxpayers, and refusing to pay us a fair rental based on the cost \nof the oil.\n  We basically said to the Department of the Interior: Adjust that \nrate; make sure the taxpayers don't get cheated on this oil.\n  Guess what? A provision in this 4,000-page bill will cost the \ntaxpayers 60 million bucks a year so these oil companies can continue \nto drill on our land that we own as a nation and refuse to pay a fair \namount for drilling for that oil. Sound like welfare to anybody? Sounds \nlike welfare to me, and it is in this bill. It is corporate welfare for \na handful of the biggest oil companies, and it is shameful.\n  There are people who take the television stage and go on the shows \nand talk about, Where is the sense of outrage in America? Good \nquestion. They want to address that question as to one\n\n[[Page S12710]]\n\nperson. I want to address it as to one bill of 4,000 pages. There \nshould be a sense of outrage that this bill was promulgated in \ndarkness, behind closed doors that literally no one has read, that \nincludes gifts like the $60-million-a-year gift to the oil industry, \nand God knows what else. And here we are.\n  I said to the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, ``If we don't \nneed a budget resolution, why do we need a Budget Committee?'' Maybe we \ncan start by saving money in the 106th Congress by eliminating the \nBudget Committee. We didn't need it this year because whatever we did \ncertainly wasn't useful. It didn't produce a budget resolution which \nwas so important for all of us.\n  There are provisions in here as well that touch people where they \nlive: the whole question, for example, of home health care interim \npayments. There is a lot of concern, because so many seniors and \ndisabled people rely on home health care. The current system needs to \nbe changed. I will tell you, the so-called ``fix'' in this bill is no \nfix at all. We will have to revisit it. It is another failure of the \n105th Congress, and that is troublesome to me and, I hope, to a lot of \nothers.\n  Then, of course, we have this doomsday scenario in the bill which \ncuts off the spending for the Commerce Department, the State \nDepartment, the Justice Department and the judicial branch of \nGovernment as of June 15 of next year. So even with the 4,000-page \nbill, we are not appropriating enough money to fund those agencies for \na year.\n  We are postponing, again, facing the reality of what needs to be done \nin this Nation. All of us who are elected to the House and Senate are \nentrusted with the responsibility to enforce and live by the \nConstitution and to meet the obligations of this country. This 105th \nCongress has failed to do that. The fact that we are even here on \nOctober 20, the fact that we are considering this mystery bill of 4,000 \npages, still unread by most, the fact that we don't know what is \nincluded, we don't know what favors have been given to special interest \ngroups or individuals and the fact that we are going to vote on this \nalmost blindly within the next 24 hours is testimony to the fact that \nthis Congress has accomplished little or nothing.\n  When the American people are asked, What did this Congress do this \nyear, what did it achieve? they are at a loss for words.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I virtually am at the same loss today. I regret that. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, let me just thank my colleague, Senator Durbin, for \nhis remarks. I think they were important. I hope we can translate what \nthe Senator from Illinois had to say about this bill--not into action \ntomorrow because this is a conference report, there are no amendments, \nit is voted up or down--I hope it leads to some important changes in \nthis legislative process.\n  I listened to my colleague from Illinois, and there are two points \nthat he made that I want to build on. The first has to do with the way \nthis was done. I really think it is not just a question of the people \nin the country, whether they be in Illinois, whether they be in \nMinnesota, whether they be in Idaho, Alaska or any other State. It is \nnot just a question of people in this country saying, ``Listen, we want \nto have campaigns, not auctions; is there a way we can get this big \nmoney out of politics?'' But we didn't do anything in this Congress.\n  It is not just a question of people saying we are one of 43.5 million \npeople with no health insurance, or we are elderly people who are \npaying a quarter of our budget for prescription drugs, or I am one of \ntoo many examples in the country where I was turned down for care that \nI needed by a kind of bottom-line medicine with insurance companies too \nmuch in control; isn't there any protection for me?\n  It is not just bad enough we didn't respond to any of that. It is not \nenough that this Congress did absolutely nothing, in spite of all of \nthe hype and too many of the speeches that were given for children in \nAmerica. I am convinced that the ultimate indictment of the failure of \nthis Congress to do hardly anything positive for people in our country \nis the way in which we continue to abandon too many children in the \ncountry and devalue the work of too many adults who work with those \nchildren. For all the families that said to us, Is there some way that \nyou can make child care more affordable for us; is there some way that \nwe can make sure that when both of us have to work, there is good child \ncare for our children, child care that we can afford? --our response \nwas to do nothing.\n  It is not enough, Mr. President, that when it comes to the issue of \nliving-wage jobs--which I think is going to become a bigger and bigger \nissue. Sometimes I fault my own party for continuing to talk about the \nnumber of jobs and the relatively low level of unemployment. But boy, I \nwill tell you, when you add to the equation people who are only working \npart time because they can't find the full-time jobs, or when you add \nto the equation people who are working full time, 52 weeks a year, 40 \nhours a week and are still poor in America and still look for a raise \nfor themselves, a decent wage, again, the response of our Congress was \nto do nothing.\n  I don't think that is the real issue that we are faced with here. I \nwant to count myself as someone who is in profound disagreement with a \nCongress that basically has been a do-nothing Congress. I think that in \nthe last several months out here on the floor, as a Senator who really \nbelieves in coming out here with amendments and trying to respond to \npeople and really do something for people, it has been a little \nfrustrating to have a process that is just not open and you are able to \ndo that. I also understand the majority leader and some of what he has \nhad to deal with.\n  Now we have a bill before us--I heard my colleague from Illinois say, \nI think, 25 pounds. I heard it weighs 40 pounds. Somebody will have to \nweigh it. It is 2 feet tall. That is a third of my height, if you want \nto believe that. Actually, not quite. I guess I can't get away with \nthat. But it is 2 feet tall, roughly 40 pounds, and we haven't even \nseen it.\n  We have had staff that are now trying to evaluate it. Can you \nimagine? You have eight appropriations bills put into this piece of \nwhat Senator Byrd called ``this monstrosity,'' weighs close to 40 \npounds, 2 feet tall, and we have hardly had a chance to look at it. And \nwe are going to vote on it tomorrow.\n  And in all due respect to my colleague from Alaska, I want to be \nclear about it. At least in the time I have been here--and I am not \njust trying to make friends because, boy, if Senator Stevens does not \nagree with you, he is out on the floor and he makes it clear what his \nposition is--he is probably the best there is at getting things done \nhere. It is amazing what he can put together. So I do not think it is a \nquestion of my colleague from Alaska.\n  But looking at this overall process, it is no wonder that people lose \nconfidence in us. We have to do better. It is just unbelievable. It is \nnot true that process does not matter. If this just looks like a bunch \nof behind-the-scenes deal making, with very few people kind of deciding \nwhat is in and what is out of a bill that is--how many pages?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Four thousand.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Four thousand pages. If ordinary citizens--which I \nmean not in a pejorative way, but in a positive way--have not the \nfaintest clue of what is going on, and those of us supposed to be \nrepresenting people have not been in a position to know what kind of \ndecisions have been made, then it is no wonder that people say we do \nnot believe in this.\n  I tell you, between what has happened with this bill and anonymous \nholds--which is another feature of this process that I really think we \nhave to confront to take on where somebody can just put a hold on \nsomething or an individual judge, or whatever; and it is anonymous; and \nyou never find out who it is--between that and conference committees \nwhere even if you pass an amendment in both bodies, the conference \ncommittee can take it out or something can be put in, I think we do \nhave to do a lot better in this process. I think that should be at the \ntop of the agenda in the next Congress.\n  Mr. President, I think that this bill--and as I speak, I do not even \nknow how\n\n[[Page S12711]]\n\nI will vote on it. On one hand, it is like Fiddler on the Roof. It is \ncertainly better than a Government shutdown. On the other hand, there \nare some important provisions in this bill. There are some things that \nare important that have been done. My colleague from Illinois talked \nabout the strong position the President took and the strong leadership \nthe President took on making sure that there are more teachers and how \nwe can reduce class size in grades K through 3--critically important.\n  On the other hand, I do not really know all that is in this bill. I \nguess that puts you in a position of not necessarily voting--it is hard \nto vote for or against a bill if you do not really know what is in it. \nBut I will tell you, some things I heard my colleague talk about--\nspecial deals for the oil industry, corporate welfare for the oil \nindustry, and gosh knows what else has been put in this piece of \nlegislation--makes me wonder, makes me wonder.\n  I say this, I think this bill--25 pounds, 40 pounds, 2 feet tall, \nseveral thousand pages--that we have not had a chance to review sort of \nrepresents our failure to deal with these appropriations bills, deal \nwith this budget, have an open debate, have an accountable political \nprocess. And I think this bill that we are supposed to vote up or down \non tomorrow--a conference report--represents the profound failure of \nthis Congress to do well for people in Minnesota and people in the \ncountry. I think that is really what it is all about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have been on the floor for all of about \n15 minutes. And I have heard----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the floor manager yield time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time does the Senator seek?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the Senator 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Let me thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nfor yielding time. I think he has probably been here on the floor, as I \nhave, for the last few minutes to watch, at least by rhetoric, a very \nlarge piece of appropriations grow well beyond the dimension of \nreality, more into the dimension of hyperbole.\n  Let us talk about reality for a few moments, because I suspect that \nthere is no Senator on this floor who will today or tomorrow express a \ngreat appreciation for the process under which we are now concluding \nthis Congress--by the bringing together under an omnibus appropriations \nbill a variety of appropriations bills that should have been dealt \nwith, one by one, on an individual basis.\n  That would have been the desire of every Senator on this floor. It \nwould have also been the desire of every Senator on this floor, if we \nhad not had 128 filed cloture motions in the last 4 years--cloture \nmotions that were the result of the other side denying or filibustering \ngiven provisions of the process that ate up phenomenal amounts of time. \nThat is not an excuse for anything. That is an expression that there is \nenough blame to go around for any of the process that gets criticized \ntoday by any Member who comes to this floor. It takes 60 votes in the \nSenate--if someone does not want the process to go forward, for that \nprocess to be denied to them--to require then the action on any given \npiece of legislation.\n  Time and time again, we were faced with the reality of having to file \ncloture. That is substantially more than was ever filed by Democrats \nbecause Republicans forced them to do that. It is the character of the \ndifference--or should I say it is the character of the intensity of \nconcern as it relates to the issues that came to the floor of the 105th \nCongress. I do not deny that. Those are facts. That is the reality of \nit.\n  I also say, if the measurement is a ``do-nothing Congress,'' you are \ndarn right. We cannot take HMOs and turn the world of medicine upside \ndown, as some of our colleagues on the other side wanted us to do.\n  We did not raise hundreds of billions of dollars of new taxes on \nmiddle America through a tobacco provision, as some of the folks on the \nother side of the aisle wanted us to do. And we did not take the right \nof free speech away from the average American in campaign finance \nreform, as most of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle wanted \nus to do.\n  If we did nothing on those things, we did a heck of a lot for the \nfreedom of the average citizen in this country. And that is what ought \nto be the responsibility of this Congress: to make darn sure that we do \nnot trample on the constitutional rights of our citizens. And that we \ndid not do, over the loud cry and protest of our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle.\n  Now, what did we do? Because the American public has the right to \nknow what the 105th Congress did. Did we balance the budget? You bet we \ndid.\n  In 1981, I introduced one of the first constitutional amendments to \nrequire a balanced budget on the floor of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. And the old dogs and the pundits at the time laughed \nand said, ``Freshman Congressman, not in your lifetime will you ever \nsee a balanced budget. Deficit spending is the way we stimulate the \neconomy of this great country. It's the way we give out pork. It is the \nway we buy political favor. And it won't happen in your lifetime, \nCongressman Craig''--at that time. ``You'll not see a balanced \nbudget.''\n  Well, in 1994, the American people spoke. And they spoke in a way \nthey had never before. And that was to change the Congress from \nDemocrat and liberal to Republican and conservative. And not in 10 \nyears, and not in my lifetime--but in 4 years the budget is balanced. \nAnd what we are debating here is an appropriations process that \nbalances the Federal budget and still leaves $60 billion, or near that, \nin surplus, to deal with the strengthening and saving of Social \nSecurity, and also to deal with some of the emergency expenditures that \nthe White House said were absolutely necessary and that most of us \nagreed with.\n  So criticize, if you will--and in any bill this big there is a world \nof criticism, if you want to be selective--but if you want to look at \nthe biggest picture of all, and that is a fiscal policy in our country \nand a monetary policy that have meshed to bring one of the strongest \neconomies in the history of the world together into the robust \ncharacter that it is, then you ought to look at that. And that is \ncalled a balanced budget, that is called denying this President his \n$150 billion tax increase, and leaving more money in the pockets of the \naverage citizens in our country, and especially the lower middle income \nworking Americans. And that was not a Democrat Congress that did it; it \nwas a Republican Congress.\n  I am proud of that. If the Democrats want to call that a do-nothing \nCongress, then please call it what you think it is, but tell the truth. \nWe don't get it from the White House; we don't get it from the \nPresident.\n  We understand the reality of the work we do. The reality of the work \nwe do--whether we like the process at hand --is that the budget is \nbalanced, our Nation is in surplus, we will strengthen Social Security, \nand we didn't raise taxes on the backs of the American people. There \nisn't an economist in the world today who doesn't say if it wasn't for \nthe U.S. economy, the world would be in a major recession, but it is \nbecause of the strength of our fiscal policy and our monetary policy \ncombined that drives this great economic engine that has more Americans \nworking than at nearly any time in modern history.\n  What about the problems in the farmlands of America in agriculture? \nMany of my colleagues went home in August, like I did, to talk to our \nfarmers, and found our farmers not in recession but in depression. \nNearly every commodity price was at or below break even, and many of \nthem were well below break even. We had tried to respond in June and \nJuly in a very bipartisan way. We came back in August, dedicated to \nresponding more, and we did. Democrat and Republican joined alike.\n  Now, we had a difference in philosophy. But in the end, we came \ntogether with tremendous benefit for production agriculture --both \nshort term, cash-in-the-pocket to the farmer to pay his banker and to \npay for his seed and fertilizer costs and, hopefully, to put food on \nthe table for his family and to get ready to farm for next year.\n\n[[Page S12712]]\n\n  We also did something else. We said what we are doing is short term; \nlet's do some long-term good. Let's do what we promised American \nagriculture we would do when we passed the 1996 farm policy known as \nFreedom to Farm. Let's give them some permanent management tools to \nassure that they can strengthen their economic well-being. We did that \nin this bill, in this bill that some of our colleagues say they will \nwant to vote against because they haven't read the fine print.\n  Permanent income averaging, accelerated 100-percent reduction for \nself-employed health care insurance premiums for both agriculture and \nsmall business--the same thing that big business has to write off their \nhealth care costs. Good management, good business. You are darn right \nit is. We offered it to them. We have also allowed them to reach back \nand pick up losses to carry forward, a tremendous help to production \nagriculture. I am proud of that. I think we ought to be because it was \na promise made and a promise kept.\n  We also dropped a couple of sanctions that were denying us the \nability to sell some of our product in world markets, with the pledge \nfrom our chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee that will do even \nmore of that next year. That was all done in a bipartisan way. We can \npick around the edges and we can criticize the process, and my guess is \nthere is lots of room for that.\n  As a conservative, I am as much a critic of that as anyone. But I am \nalso a realist. I am proud of a balanced budget and I am proud we have \na surplus. I am excited that the surplus goes to strengthen Social \nSecurity and pay down our debt. And I am pleased that in a real sense \nwe were able to address the problems of American agriculture. I am \npleased that in a real sense we were able to address the problems of \npeople who had lived in a crisis because of Mother Nature, and we \nresponded to that.\n  I also recognize that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nhad a lot of heavy lifting to do when it came to trying to represent \nthis White House. They wanted to talk about saving Social Security, yet \nthe President never sent up one bill to address the Social Security \nproblem. They wanted to rail on about taxes and teenage smoking, yet \nthe President did not send up one bill to deal with it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that the time allocated to \nSenator Gregg be vitiated, and I yield the Senator from Idaho the time \nreserved for Senator Gregg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank my chairman for yielding.\n  What I have talked about is the reality of the 105th Congress. Will \nit go down as a do-nothing Congress? Not if you read the facts. If you \nget caught in the political rhetoric and listen to it, you might be \nswayed a bit. But if you like balanced budgets, if you don't like to \npay more taxes, if you don't want the Federal Government telling you \nwhat to do in a variety of areas--including health care--if you want to \nmake sure that we develop and strengthen Social Security and provide \nfor the future of our young people, if you want to assure us that you \nwill work with us as taxpayers to keep the American food supply whole, \nthen you would say that this Congress did something.\n  Now, let me, for just a moment, talk about some of what we ought to \ndo when we get back. There will be a new Congress. It will convene in \nJanuary. It will be called the 106th. There is no question in my mind \nthat we ought to address change. The rules of the Senate that we \noperate under today were not written by this Senator. They were, in \nlarge part, by Senators from the other side of the aisle. I, and other \nSenators on this side of the aisle, have not had the votes to change \nthose rules. Some of those rules ought to change. Why should we take 60 \nvotes to lower taxes? Why should we penalize ourselves for wanting to \nreturn money to the American people? We shouldn't. It only takes 51 \nvotes to spend money; why should it take more than that to deny \nCongress the right to spend? Those are some changes that we ought to \nmake.\n  What we saw in this process in the last couple of weeks is something \nthat I don't enjoy. The legislative and the executive branches are \ncoequal branches of Government, but our budget and our appropriations \nprocess didn't work the way we wanted it to work. We could never engage \nthe White House until they chose to be engaged. You heard on this \nfloor, and it was a fact of life, that our President spent most of the \nyear out of town. I am confident it wasn't too comfortable in the Oval \nOffice because he spent most of his time out of town either in foreign \ncountries or raising money for his colleagues. It wasn't until the last \n3 weeks that we finally got his attention. It was only in the last 2 \nweeks that the White House finally came to the Hill to negotiate. That \nisn't the way it ought to be but that is the way it was.\n  Did the President get some of what he wanted? Yes, he did. Did he get \nall of what he wanted? Absolutely not. In fact, he got little of what \nhe wanted.\n  All you hear about the President's gains are 100,000 teachers. I \ndon't mind spending money for 100,000 teachers as long as it is under a \nformula where 30 percent of it doesn't stay in Washington to fund the \nDepartment of Education; in this instance it doesn't. It is block \ngranted, in large part, back to the States and the local educational \nunits. I don't think that is a Democrat idea. I think that is a \nRepublican idea. I am proud of that. I think most of our colleagues, \nwhen they look at it, will be.\n  We did something else that this President did not want. We put more \nmoney into defense. In 1986, after 6 years of voting for every defense \nbudget from 1981 forward, I quit voting for defense and started voting \nagainst it because I thought we spent too much money. Four years ago, \nI, once again, started voting for defense appropriations at a time when \nour President wouldn't own up to the fact that he was sending our \ntroops everywhere around the world and pulling that defense money from \ncurrent operating budgets and depleting our readiness and denying our \nsoldiers the kind of environment and lifestyle that I think they all \ndeserve.\n  Finally, this Congress and this negotiation process in the last 2 \nweeks said, ``Mr. President, we are going to stop it whether you want \nto or not. We cannot deny our military its readiness if you are going \nto use it as a police force running all around the world.'' And we put \nin more money.\n  That process shouldn't have happened in a small room with a few \nnegotiators, but it did. By the way, it wasn't in the dark of night; \nand by the way, the room wasn't closed. But by the character of where \nthis White House caused us to go, that is ultimately how the process \ngot conducted, with fewer than the whole process and fewer than all of \nthose who should have been there.\n\n  We have our work to do in the coming year, and I hope we can make \nsome reforms. I am one that would like to see us streamline this \nprocess a good deal more and change some of the rules that allow for a \nmore predictable outcome. But in the end, I am not going to be one \nstanding on the street corner trying to beckon attention to the fact \nthat the 105th Congress was some Congress that did nothing. We didn't \ndo a lot of what some of our liberal colleagues wanted, and that is \nprobably why they yell out today. We did not address the White House \nagenda in so many areas; we did not tax middle America; we did not take \naway flexibility from health care recipients; nor did we handcuff the \nprovided.\n  Most importantly, we balanced the budget. We left a surplus. We are \ndirecting it at Social Security. I believe that is a hallmark, and I \nthink the 105th Congress can be credited with doing more for the \nAmerican economy and more for the working people of our country by \nkeeping them employed in good, high-paying jobs and not taking more out \nof their pocket than any other Congress in history. That is a record I \nwill stand by. That is a record I think most of our colleagues will \nwant to stand by. If you believe as I do, then I think you ought to \nvote ``yes'' tomorrow--``yes'' on an appropriations process that is \nfinalized, with all of those hallmarks of accomplishment and success \nand a balanced budget, and an economy that is strong, and a work force \nin America that is working, and a sense of security and well-being that\n\n[[Page S12713]]\n\nhas not been felt in decades. I am proud of that, and I credit the \n105th Congress for delivering it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, am I to be recognized for 15 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the 105th Congress is limping to a close, \nand I listened to my colleague from Idaho who, incidentally, I think is \na good legislator and does good work in this Chamber. He is someone \nwith whom I am pleased to work on a wide range of issues, including \nagricultural issues.\n  But I must say that I have a different view of the 105th Congress. \nAbraham Lincoln once said, ``Die when I may. Let it be said by those \nwho know me best that I always picked a thistle and planted a flower \nwhere I thought a flower would grow.''\n  Let me talk for a minute about thistles and flowers. There is \napparently a 4,000 page bill lying in state--Lord knows in what room; I \nguess it's over here in 224. I heard the previous speaker from \nMinnesota say it was 40 pounds. I expect that is a guess because he \nprobably didn't weigh it. I guess that the Presiding Officer, the \nSenator from Minnesota, and most other Senators here have not read it. \nIt is a process that results in a lot of concern here in the Congress. \nThere are 4,000 pages on display.\n  The whole country is moving toward miniaturization and we are going \nin exactly the opposite direction. On the final day of the legislative \nsession, we are going to have a 4,000-page bill--a third of the Federal \nbudget--presented in the Senate, and we are told to vote up or down on \nthis. ``We assume you have read it, even though we know you just got \nback into town.''\n  Let me talk about a thistle for just a minute. In this piece of \nlegislation is a provision called section 1005 of the Revenues and \nMedicare part of the Omnibus Bill, which contains the so-called Subpart \nF Active Financing Provisions. Now, there might be a couple of \nAmericans who are intimately familiar with Subpart F of the Tax Code \nand its Active Financing Provisions--but not many. These provisions \nwere added at a time when I spent a lot of time on this floor trying to \nget some money for the construction of Indian schools, for the Ojibwa \nSchool that is falling apart. Kids are walking between trailers in the \nwinter with howling winds blowing and are going back and forth to \ntrailers. These are conditions that every study says are unsafe, but \nyou can't get money to improve these conditions; there's not enough \nmoney. Or the Cannonball School, where a little girl named Rosie said \nto me, ``Mr. Senator, will you buy us a new school?'' There are 150 \nkids there, and there's only one water fountain and two bathrooms. One \nof the rooms those kids study music in stinks of sewer gas once or \ntwice a week and they have to vacate the room. Half of the school has \nbeen condemned. But there's no money for that little girl and her \nclassmates. We just can't afford it.\n  But let me tell you what we could afford. Stuck somewhere in the \n4,000 pages, deep in the bowels of that carcass, are lucrative Subpart \nF Active Financing Provisions. This means $495 million of revenue loss \nto our Government, and an enormous tax windfall to a select group of \nlarge multinational financial service businesses. It says to them, in \neffect, that we provide an incentive in our Tax Code for them to take \ntheir businesses--and the jobs they provide--overseas. This bill not \nonly extends this misguided incentive for one additional year at a cost \nof $260 million; it also makes matters worse by expanding it by another \n$235 million, despite strong opposition from the Treasury Department. \nIt is now a $495 million gift to say to the financial services industry \nof this country: Move overseas, hire foreign workers, take your \nbusiness and jobs elsewhere and we will give you a large tax cut for \ndoing it. What a terrible thing to do, at a time when we don't have \nmoney to do the important things here. We are told, gee, there is \nplenty of money for somebody to slip somewhere in the middle of those \n4,000 pages for a special little deal for some very big taxpayers who \nwant to do business elsewhere and get paid for it. Bob Wills of the \nTexas Playboys talked about this in the 1930s: ``The little bee sucks \nthe blossom and the big bee gets the honey; the little guy picks the \ncotton and the big guy gets the money.''\n  Why is it that every time you turn around here and reach into 4,000 \npages, you find something like this? This is just one example. You talk \nabout absurdity at a time when we're told that our priorities aren't \naffordable. You can't invest in the Cannonball or Ojibwa School; \nthere's not enough money. But there is plenty of money for the big \nshots.\n  Let me talk for just a minute about how we got to this point. The \nSenator from Idaho talked about it at some length. While I disagree \nwith some of his conclusions, I think most people would view this \nprocess--coming to the end stage of this Congress with 4,000 pages to \nbe voted on in one vote, with a third of the Federal budget \nappropriated in one large piece of legislation--as a terrible \nlegislative practice. Does anybody think that makes sense? Instead of \npassing the bills as they should be passed by Congress, where they can \nbe debated and amended, you put them all in a big package at the end so \nthat you just have one vote. It is just a lot more convenient. That way \nyou don't have to amend and debate all these things.\n  Does anybody think that is a good idea? I don't. I think it is a \nterrible idea. How did this start? On April 15, the law requires that \nCongress pass a budget. That is what the law requires. It says Congress \nmust pass a budget. This Congress said, no, we have decided not to pass \na budget. We have a bunch of folks that are feuding, so we will decide \nnot to pass a budget at all. Then they decided that because we can't \nagree on a budget, we just won't pass all of our appropriations bills. \nSo they stagger to the end of the 105th Congress, having no budget, few \ncompleted appropriations bills, and they create this 4,000-page \nmountain. Then you have a bunch of folks who say: If there is going to \nbe a pile here, let me stick something in the pile. So the pile grows.\n  And here we are. I don't happen to think that this is just one \nparty's fault. I agree with the Senator from Idaho on that point, \nalthough I reject his implication that somehow the Democratic Members \nwere hindering the business of the Senate and therefore, cloture \nmotions had to be filed. That is not true at all.\n  In fact, I can tell you example after example after example when a \nbill is brought to the floor, and before there is any debate--and \ncertainly before there are any amendments--cloture motions are filed at \nthe desk to say, ``No, we haven't had any amendments yet, but we want \nto foreclose amendments; we want to shut off debate.''\n  What kind of practice is that? That doesn't make any sense. That is \nimpeding work of the Senate. That is saying we want to have a \nlegislative body in which there is supposed to be debate, and we want \nto cut off debate. We don't want debate. We don't want you to offer \nyour amendments. We think our legislation is so good that no one can \nimprove it, and, by the way, you have no right to offer amendments. \nThat is what these cloture motions are about.\n  With respect to the question of where we are and the balanced budget \nthat was mentioned by one of the previous speakers, there is no \nquestion that both parties contributed to a better fiscal policy. But \nit started in 1993 with a piece of legislation proposed by this \nPresident that was unpopular. I voted for it. The easiest thing would \nhave been to vote no. It passed by one vote here in the Senate and one \nvote in the House and became law. It began the long trail towards \nstable fiscal policy and getting rid of the Federal budget deficit.\n  When we cast that vote, the expectation that year was a $290 billion \nFederal budget deficit; completely out of balance. We were told by some \non the other side of the aisle, if you do this, you are going to wreck \nthis country's economy; if you do this, you are going to throw this \ncountry into a recession; if you do this, you will kill jobs. You will \nthrow this country into a depression, we were told. Well, we did it, \nbecause the American people understood the fiscal policy we were on. \nThey understood that the road we were traveling was destructive to this \ncountry's\n\n[[Page S12714]]\n\ninterest. They wanted us to make the tough choices. And we did.\n  Guess what? We have wrestled that budget deficit to the ground. We \nnow have a budget that is very close to being in balance. We now have \nan economy that is growing. Inflation is almost gone. Home ownership is \nthe highest in 30 years. Unemployment is down, down--way down. Things \nare better in this country.\n  Starting in 1993, when the American people saw that Congress was \nwilling to make tough choices, we did it alone. There was not one vote \nfrom the other side of the aisle. But I will say this: The Republican \nParty has helped after that 1993 vote. They also provided some \nassistance with a fiscal policy that is better for this country, and we \nought to have more of that. We ought to have more bipartisanship and \nmore cooperation to do the right things for this country's future.\n  The difference is, it seems to me, that a product of debate ought not \nbe about aggregate fiscal policy, but rather about priorities. What \nrepresents the priorities for our country's future? What should we do \nthat is important?\n  Again, I think where I would disagree with some previous speakers is \nthat doing nothing ought not be a badge of honor when the agenda of \nthis country cries out to do something to address critical needs. We \nshould have done something on managed care reform. We should have said \nto HMOs in this country, you must tell patients all of their medical \noptions for treatment--not just the cheapest. You must do that. You \nmust provide reimbursement for emergency care when someone shows up at \nan emergency room.\n  I told the story--there are stories that go on forever--of a woman \nwho broke her neck, comes to an emergency room unconscious, and is told \nlater, ``We will not reimburse you for the emergency room stay because \nyou didn't have prior approval.''\n  Those are the kinds of things that have been going on in managed care \nin the name of saving money, but actually degrade and diminish health \ncare standards. This Congress certainly should have addressed this \nissue. Doing nothing is not a badge of honor on this issue of managed \ncare reform.\n  Certainly, it is not a badge of honor that we weren't able to pass \nFAA reform. We should have done that. That piece of legislation \nincluded an amendment of mine that would have substantially changed the \nway the major airlines have to connect with regional jet carriers. And \nwe would have more regional jet carriers in this country, more \ncompetition and lower prices for airfares had we passed that piece of \nlegislation. I regret that it was not done.\n  Let me also mention the issue of family farmers and the farm crisis \nin our part of the country. I know there is a difference of philosophy \nabout this. But there ought not be.\n  If this country wants family farmers in its future, it ought to \ndecide that when prices collapse it is going to have to help build a \nbridge across those price valleys, because, if not, the family farmers \nwon't get across the valley. They will just wash out and be gone. And \nwe will have corporate farmers farming America from the west coast to \nthe east coast, and we will still have crops growing. There will just \nbe no people living out on the land. And this country will have lost \nsomething important.\n  We did something at the end of this session. We reached some \nbipartisan agreement on an emergency package. But it wasn't enough. It \nwas nearly $2 billion short of what the President requested, nearly $3 \nbillion short of what the commissioners of agriculture and the Farm \nBelt said was necessary to address this farm crisis. We will be right \nback in this set of circumstances in January, February and March as \nfarmers begin to consider spring planting.\n  With respect to the agriculture package, we did get nearly $1 3/4 \nbillion more because we fought and because we did accept the admonition \nof some to take what they are willing to give you and quit. There was \n$100 million more for the family farmers of my State. Is that \nimportant? Yes. Some will survive. Some who would not have survived \nwithout it will survive to be able to continue farming in the future.\n  I have mentioned a couple of times the letter from a young boy named \nWyatt in North Dakota, a sophomore in high school, the son of a family \nfarmer who wrote to me, and said, ``Mr. Senator, my dad can feed 180 \npeople, and he can't feed his family.'' This young boy wanted to know \nwhat kind of a system allows that to happen. This country needs to do \nbetter by family farmers.\n  I was impressed that we could work together on a bipartisan basis \ntoward the end of this session. I hope we can do the same at the start \nof the next session to address many of these issues.\n  Let me complete my comments.\n  There are so many issues in this omnibus appropriations bill. One of \nthem is an issue that I have worked on with the Senator from Alaska, \nSenator Stevens, and Senator Byrd, that will create a trade deficit \nreview commission. The reason I mention this is because today the new \ntrade deficit numbers were released for this month. It shows a $2 \nbillion increase, the largest trade deficit in the history of this \ncountry, the largest trade deficit in the history of human kind. We \nhave wrestled the fiscal policy budget deficit to the ground, and our \ntrade deficit is swelling and growing, and we need to do something \nabout it. This omnibus package will include a requirement that a trade \ndeficit review commission be established, and that recommendations will \nbe made to Congress on how to deal with those issues. I hope the \nCongress will be able to take some steps early in the next session of \nCongress to respond to that issue.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that I hope we will never \nagain be confronted with this circumstance at the end of a Congress. I \nunderstand that at the end of Congress there is wrap-up. Sometimes a \nbill or two doesn't get passed. Sometimes you wrap one or two bills \ninto a package. But this is not a good way to legislate.\n  It is, in my judgment, subverting the legislative process--the \nregular order of bringing bills to the floor so we have open debate and \namendments, when at the end all of these things are put into one large \npackage, and we are told to just read it, think about it, and then vote \non it.\n  I don't think that is the best that this Congress can offer the \nAmerican people. I hope this will be the last chapter of this kind of \ncongressional action, or lack of it.\n  Mr. President, finally, the chairman of the full Appropriations \nCommittee is on the floor. I thank him for his work.\n  I have not been complimentary of the process, but I know Senator \nStevens and Senator Byrd and their staffs, and many others, have spent \nan enormous amount of time trying to put this package together simply \nbecause the Congress did not get its work done during the year. I \ncompliment them for their work to try to do that. I know, especially \nfrom a staff standpoint, what kind of effort and time was required to \nget this to this point.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his comments \nconcerning Senator Byrd and myself. I do want to emphasize just a few \nthings as we close.\n  In this year, the Appropriations Committee has tried very hard to \nmove forward as quickly as possible to get bills before the Senate as \nearly as possible so that this would not happen.\n  I wish to place in the Record a status of appropriations bills in the \nsecond session of this 105th Congress. It shows, and I have circled--\nand I hope in the Record they will highlight those dates circled--the \ndays that the Appropriations Committee first brought to the Senate's \nattention its work product of the 13 subcommittees that deal with \nappropriations measures. They were all in June and July, with the \nexception of one bill, Labor, Health and Human Services, which was \nbrought first to the Senate's attention on September 1 when we held the \nfull committee meeting and reported the bill to the Senate on September \n3. This was because of the illness of one of our colleagues. But all of \nthese bills were available for the Senate to act on and for the \nCongress to act on very early.\n  This also shows the action by the House committee under Chairman \nLivingston--probably one of the earliest periods in history when all of \nthe bills were completed, except one to bring before the House, and the \ndelay has not\n\n[[Page S12715]]\n\nbeen the delay of the appropriations process; but it has been caused by \nthe process of handling those bills once they were reported to the \nHouse and Senate.\n  I decry the process also, as so many people have here today, but I am \nnot ashamed of the work product. I have signed my name to the work \nproduct, as Chairman Livingston has, and a majority of both of our \ncommittees has endorsed these bills to be reported to the House and \nSenate.\n  We are still the largest military power in the world, the last \nsuperpower in the world. We have added $7.5 billion so the men and \nwomen who serve us in uniform can be fully equipped, they can be \nassured we are trying to get them the best systems available, and we \nare doing our best to restore the lifestyle we believe a person should \nbe able to lead in the uniform of the U.S. military.\n  We have not been able to handle one basic problem, and that is the \nproblem over the pension system. I hope that the Armed Services \nCommittee early next year will address that problem and that we can \npresent in the first bills brought out to the floor by the \nAppropriations Committees money to fund the restoration of a pension \nsystem that is adequate and is an incentive to people to stay in \nuniform and particularly to use the skills they have developed as \nmembers of the armed services in our defense.\n  Mr. President, this is a good bill. I know a lot of people are going \nto vote against it for one reason or another, but I hope that the \npublic understands, while this is the largest bill to ever be \npresented, it is large because it contains eight separate bills plus \nthree supplemental appropriations bills. It contains really 11 \nappropriations bills. The total adds up to almost $1/2 trillion. It is \nlarge in the sense of spending, but we do spend a lot of money as a \nlarge Government, and we have kept these bills to the minimum in terms \nof the appropriations process. These negotiations that we have been \ntalking about added $20 billion to that total--plus $20 billion.\n  I do believe that the bill is a good one, and I urge our colleagues \ntomorrow to vote for it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the ``Status of Appropriations\" be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                          STATUS OF APPROPRIATIONS MEASURES, SECOND SESSION, ONE HUNDRED FIFTH CONGRESS\n                                                                                    [As of October 17, 1998]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                     House                                       Senate\n                                                        Report   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Conference       Law        Public\n    Measure of subcommittee      Bill and report(s)     filed                          Full                                        Full                        report       approved      Law\n                                                                    Subcommittee     committee      Floor       Subcommittee     committee       Floor\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nVeto override of a bill          H.R. 2631\\1\\        ...........  ...............  ............

In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication, stating that \nthe emergency declared with respect to significant narcotics \ntraffickers centered in Colombia is to continue in effect for 1 year \nbeyond October 21, 1998.\n  The circumstances that led to the declaration on October 21, 1995, of \na national emergency have not been resolved. The actions of significant \nnarcotics traffickers centered in Colombia continue to pose an unusual \nand extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and \neconomy of the United States and to cause unparalleled violence, \ncorruption, and harm in the United States and abroad. For these \nreasons, I have determined that it is necessary to maintain in force \nthe broad authorities necessary to maintain economic pressure on \nsignificant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia by blocking \ntheir property subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and by \ndepriving them of access to the United States market and financial \nsystem.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to prevent Federal agencies from pursuing policies of \nunjustifiable nonacquiescence in relitigation of precedents established \nin the Federal judicial courts; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                   THE FEDERAL AGENCY COMPLIANCE ACT\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Federal Agency\n\n[[Page S12721]]\n\nCompliance Act. This legislation is the redraft of prior legislation \nthat I introduced, S. 1166, the Federal Agency Compliance Act, which \nwas the subject of a hearing on June 15, 1998 before the Senate \nJudiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, \nchaired by Senator Grassley.\n  At the June 15 hearing, Lynn Conforti from Denver, CO, testified on \nbehalf of the thousands of Social Security disability claimants, who \nare denied their claims not on the basis of Federal circuit court \nopinions but on the basis of agency policy that is contrary to Federal \nlaw. In November 1996, Ms. Conforti was forced to quit work because of \nsevere pain due to failed surgery on her back to correct corvature of \nthe spine, scoliosis. Until that time. Ms. Conforti had been employed \nher entire life since she was 19 years old and paid her FICA taxes into \nthe Social Security Disability Program for 27 years. At the hearing, \nshe described her 32-month struggle with the Social Security \nAdministration that had twice denied her benefits, because they did not \ngive due weight to the medical opinion of her treating physicians or \nthe severity of her pain, contrary to Federal court decisions. Ms. \nConforti described her physical ordeal, having two back surgeries, \nremoving 10 discs, two sets of surgical rods and screws, 38 days in the \nhospital, 334 physical therapy visits, 128 physician visits, and 16 \nmonths of chronic pain. Despite her disability, Ms. Conforti hopes to \nbe able to return to work in the future, but she needs the disability \nresources to continue rehabilitation efforts.\n  Finally, in July 1998, Ms. Conforti was awarded her disability \nbenefits by an administrative law judge (ALJ) in an on-the-record \ndetermination. The ALJ, unlike lower level decisionmakers at SSA, was \nable to apply Federal court decisions to her case. For this reason, the \nbill I am introducing today contains a provision included in a similar \nbill, H.R. 1544, that states that agency employees and ALJ's shall \nadhere to court of appeals precedent within the circuit, insuring that \nMs. Conforti and thousands of other claimants will no longer be victims \nof agency intracircuit nonacquiescence with the passage of this \nlegislation.\n  I want to thank my colleagues, Senator Sessions and Senator Durbin, \nfor their support for this important legislation and for their \nassistance in revising the legislation that I introduce today. Through \nthe effort of Senator Sessions, the bill clarifies that adherence by \nagencies to court of appeals precedent shall be in civil cases and \nthere is no prohibition on an agency relitigating a matter in more than \nthree circuits if such relitigation is necessary. Also, Senator Durbin \nclarified that certain agencies, such as the National Labor Relations \nBoard [NLRB], are not bound by adherence to court of appeals precedent \nwhen it is not certain that the court of appeals that established the \nNLRB precedent has exclusive jurisdiction over the matter or by another \ncircuit. Again, I want to thank my colleagues for these clariications \nand for their support of the bill I introduce today.\n  Intracircuit agency nonacquiescence to appellate precedent is not \nlimited to the Social Security Administration, which was described at \nour hearing, but has been a long-term problem with all agencies and one \nthat the Congress has struggled with since the early 1980's. Finally, \nwe have a consensus on legislation that will solve this problem and \nreturn us to the rule of law that we expect and that citizens deserve. \nI ask my colleagues to support this legislation to ensure Federal \nagencies follow the law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2641\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PROHIBITING INTRACIRCUIT AGENCY NON-ACQUIESCENCE \n                   IN APPELLATE PRECEDENT.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Federal \n     Agency Compliance Act''.\n       (b) In General.--Chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code, \n     is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 707.

All officers and employees of an \n     agency, including administrative law judges, shall adhere to \n     such precedent.\n       ``(b) An agency is not precluded under subsection (a) from \n     taking a position, either in administrative or litigation, \n     that is at variance with precedent established by a United \n     States court of appeals if--\n       ``(1) it is not certain whether the administration of the \n     statute, rule, regulation, program, or policy will be subject \n     to review exclusively by the court of appeals that \n     established that precedent or a court of appeals for another \n     circuit;\n       ``(2) the Government did not seek further review of the \n     case in which that precedent was first established, in that \n     court of appeals or the United States Supreme Court, \n     because--\n       ``(A) neither the United States nor any agency or officer \n     thereof was a party to the case; or\n       ``(B) the decision establishing that precedent was \n     otherwise substantially favorable to the Government; or\n       ``(3) it is reasonable to question the continued validity \n     of that precedent in light of a subsequent decision of that \n     court of appeals or the United States Supreme Court, a \n     subsequent change in any pertinent statute or regulation, or \n     any other subsequent change in the public policy or \n     circumstances on which that precedent was based.''.\n       (c) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections for chapter \n     7 of title 5, United States Code, is amended by adding at the \n     end the following new item:\n\n``707.

A bill to create an official parliamentary station in the \nUnited States fully to participate in the Global Legal Information \nNetwork; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n       global legal information network participation act of 1998\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, as the world is catapulted into the \nelectronic information age, the United States has a rare opportunity \nnot only to participate in a truly international legal database but \nalso to sustain a leadership role in setting the highest standard for \nthe creation and maintenance of such a database. It is also a \nfortuitous moment for the Congress to encourage and support an effort \nthat will inure to the direct benefit of the Congress in its \nlegislative functions by having access to foreign laws \ncontemporaneously with or shortly after publication in the country of \norigin. This effort, conceived and developed by our own Law Library of \nCongress, is the Global Legal Information Network, popularly referred \nto as ``GLIN.''\n  GLIN is an international, cooperative, non-commercial database of \nlegal information contributed to by governments of member nations in \nAfrica, Asia, Europe, and the Americas. As a mission-driven project, \nGLIN was developed by the Law Library as a way to organize and gain \naccess to legal information so that the Law Library could respond to \nrequests from Congress in a timely, efficient manner since the Law \nLibrary is responsible for doing research and analysis on the laws of \nother nations, comparative law, and international law. This continues \nto be the goal of the Law Library's participation in GLIN.\n  The database comprises abstracts of legal material, full texts of \nlaws and regulations, and a legal thesaurus. The GLIN database is \nstructured so that the full range of legal material including \nconstitutions, laws and regulations, judicial decisions, parliamentary \ndebates, scholarly writings, and legal miscellanea can be added to the \ndatabase over time as countries are able to make these contributions.\n  Since 1995, GLIN has become a truly ``global'' legal information \nnetwork and the Law Library has trained technical and legal teams from \nnumerous countries plus a team from the United Nations. These countries \nare at various stages of compliance with the GLIN standards for \norganizational, technical, and telecommunications capabilities.\n  GLIN is the centerpiece of the Law Library's transition from a paper-\nbased library to one that effectively exploits the advantages of \nelectronic sources of information. The amount of time and resources \nneeded to acquire, process, and store foreign legal material make\n\n[[Page S12722]]\n\nGLIN a top priority for the Law Library, and as the United States \nstation for the network it has also undertaken the task of putting \nUnited States law into the database using the same high standards \ndemanded of other nations. To date, the Law Library has not received \nappropriated funds for work on GLIN.\n  What other Parliaments around the world are doing concerning many of \nthe issues we face is vital for our legislative functions. A 1886 \ntreaty, still in force today, recognized the important need for the \nexchange of official journals, parliamentary annals, and documents. \nCongress needs access to the most reliable, current legal information \navailable. GLIN can provide this information, but only if it is \ndeveloped and maintained properly. With limited resources, and using \nthe only technology and technological support available from an already \nstrapped technology support staff in the Library of Congress which is \nconsumed by other Library programs, participation by the Law Library in \nGLIN is at a critical point. The system now requires urgent updating \nand upgrading to enhance the performance of the Network and to attract \nadditional countries, particularly those that are of interest to \nCongress. To best serve Congress, it is essential that the Law Library \nretain a leadership role technologically and content-wise. To \nfacilitate such participation, the Law Library needs a special \nappropriation to bolster its staff and technological infrastructure on \nits own without being dependent or in competition with other Library of \nCongress programs.\n  Besides affording the Law Library the ability to bolster resources to \nmeet this important growing initiative, this special appropriation will \npermit the Law Library through development and training to fulfill its \nnatural role as the largest law library in the world to set the highest \nof standards for the form and content of legal information to be \nexchanged between nations to ensure that such material is accurate and \ncomplete, and thereby totally reliable. It also fosters \ninterparliamentary cooperation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2645\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       The Act may cited as the ``Global Legal Information Network \n     Participation Act of 1998.''\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS OF PURPOSE.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings and declarations:\n       (1) It is the policy of the United States to promote the \n     reasonable, timely and authentic exchange of official legal \n     information between parliaments of nations of the world as \n     originally expressed in the 1886 Convention for the Immediate \n     Exchange of the Official Journals, Parliamentary Annals, and \n     Documents:\n       (2) participation by the United States in an international, \n     cooperative, noncommercial legal database contributed to by \n     governments of member nations, the ``Global Legal Information \n     Network'' (GLIN), which would be available over the Internet, \n     contributes to the promotion of security and international \n     understanding through the exchange of legal information and \n     promotes the rule of law, and therefore is in the interests \n     of the United States;\n       (3) the timely and accurate availability of laws and \n     regulations of the United States and other legislatures \n     around the world is of the utmost importance to the Congress, \n     both in its own work as well as in the interests of \n     developing and nurturing interparliamentary cooperation; and\n       (4) the centralization of the function and control of \n     participation by the United States in such an international \n     legal database will assist in establishing uniformity for the \n     electronic exchange and retrieval of legal information.\n\n     SEC. 3. THE UNITED STATES GLIN STATION.\n\n       In order to carry out the purposes of this Act,\n       (a) the United States station for the Global Legal \n     Information Network shall be the Law Library of Congress in \n     the Library of Congress;\n       (b) The Director of the United States GLIN station shall be \n     the Law Librarian of Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 2646. A bill to authorize the Disabled Veterans' LIFE Memorial \nFoundation to establish a memorial in the District of Columbia or its \nenvirons, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n      to authorize a disabled veterans memorial in washington, dc\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to offer legislation to authorize \nthe Disabled Veterans' LIFE Memorial Foundation to establish a memorial \non Federal land in the District of Columbia to honor all disabled \nAmerican veterans. This legislation is not controversial, costs \nnothing, and deserves immediate consideration and passage as the 105th \nCongress prepares to adjourn for the year.\n  As a nation, we owe a debt of gratitude to all Americans who have \nworn their country's uniform in the defense of her core ideals and \ninterests. We honor their service with holidays, like Veterans Day and \nMemorial Day, and with memorials, including the Vietnam Wall and the \nIwo Jima Memorial. But nowhere in Washington can be found a material \ntribute to those veterans whose physical or psychological health was \nforever lost to a sniper's bullet, a landmine, a mortar round, or the \npure terror of modern warfare.\n  To these individuals we owe a measure of devotion not accorded those \nwho served honorably but without permanent damage to limb or spirit. \nFor these individuals, a memorial in Washington, DC, would stand as \ntestament to the sum of their sacrifices, and as proof that the country \nthey served values their contribution to its cause.\n  We cannot restore the health of those Americans who incurred a \ndisability as a result of their military service. It is within our \npower, however, to authorize a memorial that would clearly signal the \nnation's gratitude to all whose disabilities serve as a living reminder \nof the toll war takes on its victims.\n  Under the terms of this legislation, the Disabled Veterans' LIFE \nMemorial Foundation would be solely responsible for raising the \nnecessary funding. Our bill explicitly requires that no Federal funds \nbe used to pay any expense for the memorial's establishment.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me and Senators Cleland, Coverdell, and \nKerrey in support of this legislation. America's disabled veterans, of \nwhom Senator Cleland himself is one of our most distinguished, deserve \na lasting tribute to their sacrifice. They honored us with their \nservice; let us honor them with our support today.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise as a proud original cosponsor of \nlegislation to establish a national Disabled Veterans Memorial here in \nWashington, DC.\n  I am honored to join my fellow colleagues, veterans and friends \nSenators McCain and Cleland in establishing a memorial to the brave men \nand women who have served our Nation with honor and dignity, but have \npaid a grave price.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to \nestablish and construct a memorial that is not only a tribute to our \nveterans, but will also serve the residents of the District as a place \nof civic and national pride.\n  I will insist on an open and fair process as we move forward, and \nwill be diligent in representing the best interests of the veterans, \nthe District, the Nation, and the American people.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 2647. A bill to provide for programs to facilitate a significant \nreduction in the incidence and prevalence of substance abuse through \nreducing the demand for illegal drugs and the inappropriate use of \nlegal drugs; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                       drug demand reduction act\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Drug Demand \nReduction Act,'' a bill that improves demand reduction efforts by \nfocusing on the anti-drug media campaign, drug-free jails, and drug-\nfree schools. The bill also contains several congressional resolutions \naimed at encouraging community involvement, rejecting efforts to \nlegalize illegal drugs, and streamlining prevention and treatment \nprograms.\n  This legislation is supported by General Barry McCaffrey, Director of \nthe Office of National Drug Control Policy. The original companion bill \nwas introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Portman \nand Congressman Barrett on September 16, 1998, and passed with \noverwhelming bipartisan support, 396-9. I commend\n\n[[Page S12723]]\n\nthem for their leadership and thank them for their efforts.\n  As many of you know, I worked hand in hand with my colleagues in the \nHouse on this issue, I held hearings in the Senate Committee on the \nJudiciary concerning these issues, and more recently, I worked with the \nLeadership to include this bill into the legislative package of anti-\ndrug bills that is being incorporated into the Omnibus Appropriations \nbill for Fiscal 1999. This bill represents a substantial step toward \nreducing the rates of drug abuse in our country.\n  According to the respected Monitoring the Future from 1991 to 1997, \nthe lifetime use of marijuana--the gateway to harder drugs--has \nincreased among school-age youth. The lifetime use of marijuana by 8th \ngraders--that is those 8th graders who have ever used marijuana--\nincreased by 122% from 1991 to 1997. For 10th graders, marijuana use \nincreased by 81% and for 12th graders, 35%.\n  Cocaine use among our youth has also seen staggering increases. From \n1991 to 1997, the lifetime use of cocaine increased by 91% for 8th \ngraders. The lifetime use of cocaine by 10th graders increased by 73% \nduring the same time period. The number of 8th graders who have used \ncocaine within the past year increased by 154% from 1991 to 1997.\n  Heroin use has also exploded since 1991. The reported lifetime use of \nheroin for both 8th and 10th graders increased by 75%. For 12th \ngraders, heroin use increased by 133%. The number of 8th graders who \nhave used heroin within the past year has increased by 86% from 1991 to \n1997. For 10th and 12th graders, heroin use increased by 180% and 120%, \nrespectively.\n  These figures are staggering when you consider that each percentage \npoint represents thousands of teens who are much more likely to become \nbigger problems for society as they become adults.\n  The drug abuse situation in our country is an issue about which I \ncare deeply. In June of this year, the Judiciary Committee held a \nhearing on the growing national crisis of drug abuse among our \nchildren. I think it is clear from all the available information and \nfrom the testimony heard at the hearing that youth drug abuse is not \nstable, but is instead rising sharply. Several of the witnesses who \ntestified described how accessible drugs were to our young people.\n  For example, Chris who works as an undercover investigator in high \nschools in Dayton, Ohio, described to the Committee how easy it was to \nget drugs in today's high schools. ``Within the first investigation, I \nwas approached within three weeks, by someone offering to sell to me. \nThe second investigation, I was approached in a week-and-a-half by \nsomeone again wanting to sell to me. In high schools, you don't have to \ndo a lot of seeking, you know. . . . Pretty much, they are going to \ncome to you.''\n  What is the reason behind this surge in teen drug consumption? I \nbelieve several things. First, there has been a decline in anti-drug \nmessages from elected leaders--like President Clinton and similar \nmessages in homes, schools, and--until recently with the airing of \nanti-drug messages developed for the Youth Media Campaign--the media. \nSecond, the debate over the legalization of marijuana and the \nglorification of drugs in popular culture has caused confusion in our \nyoung people. Third, disapproval of drugs and perception of risk has \ndeclined among young people. The percent of 8th, 10th and 12th graders \nwho ``disapproved'' or ``strongly disapproved'' of use of various drugs \ndeclined steadily from 1991 to 1995. In 1992, 92% of 8th graders, 90% \nof 10th graders, and 89% of 12th graders disapproved of people who \nsmoked marijuana regularly. By 1996, however, those figures had dropped \nsignificantly.\n  We must change tactics and find a way to do something to stop this \nepidemic from continuing and destroying the future of our children. \nThis bill, which I expect will be enacted as part of the Omnibus \nAppropriation bill, will begin to address these problems and offer \nincentives to help schools, and communities to reinforce the message \nthat drugs are dangerous. I urge all of my colleagues to support this \nbill. I ask consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2647\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Illegal drug use is dangerous to the physical well-\n     being of the Nation's youth.\n       (2) Illegal drug use can destroy the lives of the Nation's \n     youth by diminishing their sense of morality and with it \n     everything in life that is important and worthwhile.\n       (3) According to recently released national surveys, drug \n     use among the Nation's youth remains at alarmingly high \n     levels.\n       (4) National leadership is critical to conveying to the \n     Nation's youth the message that drug use is dangerous and \n     wrong.\n       (5) National leadership can help mobilize every sector of \n     the community to support the implementation of comprehensive, \n     sustainable, and effective programs to reduce drug abuse.\n       (6) As of September 1, 1998, 76 Members of the House of \n     Representatives were establishing community-based antidrug \n     coalitions in their congressional districts or were actively \n     supporting such coalitions that already existed.\n       (7) The individual Members of the House of Representatives \n     can best help their constituents prevent drug use among the \n     Nation's youth by establishing community-based antidrug \n     coalitions in their congressional districts or by actively \n     supporting such coalitions that already exist.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the individual Members of the House of Representatives, \n     including the Delegates and the Resident Commissioner, should \n     establish community-based antidrug coalitions in their \n     congressional districts or should actively support any such \n     coalitions that have been established.\n             Subtitle B--Rejection of Legalization of Drugs\n\n     SEC. 211. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Illegal drug use is harmful and wrong.\n       (2) Illegal drug use can kill the individuals involved or \n     cause the individuals to hurt or kill others, and such use \n     strips the individuals of their moral sense.\n       (3) The greatest threat presented by such use is to the \n     youth of the United States, who are illegally using drugs in \n     increasingly greater numbers.\n       (4) The people of the United States are more concerned \n     about illegal drug use and crimes associated with such use \n     than with any other current social problem.\n       (5) Efforts to legalize or otherwise legitimize drug use \n     present a message to the youth of the United States that drug \n     use is acceptable.\n       (6) Article VI, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United \n     States states that ``[t]his Constitution, and the laws of the \n     United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and \n     all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the \n     authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of \n     the land; and judges in every state shall be bound thereby, \n     any thing in the Constitution or laws of any state to the \n     contrary notwithstanding.''.\n       (7) The courts of the United States have repeatedly found \n     that any State law that conflicts with a Federal law or \n     treaty is preempted by such law or treaty.\n       (8) The Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.) \n     strictly regulates the use and possession of drugs.\n       (9) The United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic \n     in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotrophic Substances Treaty \n     similarly regulates the use and possession of drugs.\n       (10) Any attempt to authorize under State law an activity \n     prohibited under such Treaty or the Controlled Substances Act \n     would conflict with that Treaty or Act.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the several States, and the citizens of such States, \n     should reject the legalization of drugs through legislation, \n     ballot proposition, constitutional amendment, or any other \n     means; and\n       (2) each State should make efforts to be a drug-free State.\n  Subtitle C--Report on Streamlining Federal Prevention and Treatment \n                                Efforts\n\n     SEC. 221. REPORT ON STREAMLINING FEDERAL PREVENTION AND \n                   TREATMENT EFFORTS.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the efforts of the Federal Government to reduce the \n     demand for illegal drugs in the United States are frustrated \n     by the fragmentation of those efforts across multiple \n     departments and agencies; and\n       (2) improvement of those efforts can best be achieved \n     through consolidation and coordination.\n       (b) Report Requirement.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 18 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Director of the Office of National \n     Drug Control Policy shall prepare and submit to the \n     appropriate committees a report evaluating options for \n     increasing the efficacy of drug prevention and treatment \n     programs and activities by the Federal Government. Such \n     option shall include the merits of a consolidation of \n     programs into a single agency, transferring programs from 1 \n     agency to another, and improving coordinating mechanisms and \n     authorities. The report shall also include a thorough review \n     of the activities and potential consolidation of existing \n     Federal drug information clearinghouses.\n       (2) Recommendation and explanatory statement.--The study \n     submitted under paragraph (1) shall identify options that are \n     determined by the Director to have merit, and an explanation \n     which options should be implemented.\n       (3) Authorization of appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Office of National Drug Control \n     Policy to carry out this subsection $1,000,000 for \n     contracting, policy research, and related costs.\n       (c) Appropriate Committees Defined.--In this section, the \n     term ``appropriate committees'' means the Committee on \n     Appropriations, the Committee on Commerce, and the Committee \n     on Education and the Workforce of the House of \n     Representatives, and the Committee on Appropriations, and \n     Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/20/senate-section/article/S12720-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 597\n\n  At the request of Mr. Bingaman, the name of the Senator from \nConnecticut (Mr. Dodd) was added as a cosponsor of S. 597, a bill to \namend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for coverage \nunder part B of the medicare program of medical nutrition therapy \nservices furnished by registered dietitians and nutrition \nprofessionals.\n\n\n                                S. 1326\n\n  At the request of Mr. Daschle, the name of the Senator from Nevada \n(Mr. Reid) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1326, a bill to amend title \nXIX of the Social Security Act to provide for medicaid coverage of all \ncertified nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists services.\n\n\n                                S. 1525\n\n  At the request of Mr. Specter, the name of the Senator from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Santorum) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1525, a bill \nto provide financial assistance for higher education to the dependents \nof Federal, State, and local public safety officers who are killed or \npermanently and totally disabled as the result of a traumatic injury \nsustained in the line of duty.\n\n\n                                S. 2353\n\n  At the request of Mr. Johnson, his name was added as a cosponsor of \nS. 2353, a bill to redesignate the legal public holiday of \n``Washington's Birthday'' as ``Presidents' Day'' in honor of George \nWashington, Abraham Lincoln, and Franklin Roosevelt and in recognition \nof the importance of the institution of the Presidency and the \ncontributions that Presidents have made to the development of our \nNation and the principles of freedom and democracy.\n\n\n                                S. 2623\n\n  At the request of Mr. Glenn, his name was added as a cosponsor of S. \n2623, a bill to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the \nFederal Government, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 2640\n\n  At the request of Mr. D'Amato, the name of the Senator from New York \n(Mr. Moynihan) was added as a cosponsor of S. 2640, a bill to extend \nthe authorization for the Upper Deleware Citizens Advisory Council.\n\n\n                         Senate Resolution 199\n\n  At the request of Mr. Torricelli, the name of the Senator from \nFlorida (Mr. Graham) was added as a cosponsor of Senate Resolution 199, \na resolution designating the last week of April of each calendar year \nas ``National Youth Fitness Week.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/20/senate-section/article/S12725-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12725-S12726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 129--TO CORRECT A TECHNICAL ERROR IN THE \n                        ENROLLMENT OF H.R. 3910\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI submitted the following concurrent resolution; which \nwas considered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.

FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The economic, security, and humanitarian interests of \n     the United States and the nations of sub-Saharan Africa would \n     be enhanced by sustainable, broad-based agricultural and \n     rural development in each of the African nations.\n       (2) According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, the \n     number of undernourished people in Africa has more than \n     doubled, from approximately 100,000,000 in the late 1960s to \n     215,000,000 in 1998, and is projected to increase to \n     265,000,000 by the year 2010. According to the Food and \n     Agriculture Organization, the term ``under nutrition'' means \n     inadequate consumption of nutrients, often adversely \n     affecting children's physical and mental development, \n     undermining their future as productive and creative members \n     of their communities.\n       (3) Currently, agricultural production in Africa employs \n     about two-thirds of the workforce but produces less than one-\n     fourth of the gross domestic product in sub-Saharan Africa, \n     according to the World Bank Group.\n       (4) African women produce up to 80 percent of the total \n     food supply in Africa according to the International Food \n     Policy Research Institute.\n       (5) An effective way to improve conditions of the poor is \n     to increase the productivity of the agricultural sector. \n     Productivity increases can be fostered by increasing research \n     and education in agriculture and rural development.\n       (6) In November 1996, the World Food Summit set a goal of \n     reducing hunger worldwide by 50 percent by the year 2015 and \n     encouraged national governments to develop domestic food \n     plans and to support international aid efforts.\n\n[[Page S12727]]\n\n       (7) Although the World Bank Group recently has launched a \n     major initiative to support agricultural and rural \n     development, only 10 percent, or $1,200,000,000, of its total \n     lending to sub-Saharan Africa for fiscal years 1993 to 1997 \n     was devoted to agriculture.\n       (8)(A) United States food processing and agricultural \n     sectors benefit greatly from the liberalization of global \n     trade and increased exports.\n       (B) Africa represents a growing market for United States \n     food and agricultural products. Africa's food imports are \n     projected to rise from less than 8,000,000 metric tons in \n     1990 to more than 25,000,000 metric tons by the 2020.\n       (9)(A) Increased private sector investment in African \n     countries and expanded trade between the United States and \n     Africa can greatly help African countries achieve food self-\n     sufficiency and graduate from dependency on international \n     assistance.\n       (B) Development assistance, technical assistance, and \n     training can facilitate and encourage commercial development \n     in Africa, such as improving rural roads, agricultural \n     research and extension, and providing access to credit and \n     other resources.\n       (10)(A) Several United States private voluntary \n     organizations have demonstrated success in empowering \n     Africans through direct business ownership and helping \n     African agricultural producers more efficiently and directly \n     market their products.\n       (B) Rural business associations, owned and controlled by \n     farmer shareholders, also greatly help agricultural producers \n     to increase their household incomes.\n       (b) Declaration of Policy.--It is the policy of the United \n     States, consistent with title XII of part I of the Foreign \n     Assistance Act of 1961, to support governments of sub-Saharan \n     African countries, United States and African nongovernmental \n     organizations, universities, businesses, and international \n     agencies, to help ensure the availability of basic nutrition \n     and economic opportunities for individuals in sub-Saharan \n     Africa, through sustainable agriculture and rural \n     development.\n\n               TITLE I--ASSISTANCE FOR SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA\n\n     SEC. 101. AFRICA FOOD SECURITY INITIATIVE.\n\n       (a) Additional Requirements in Carrying Out the \n     Initiative.--In providing development assistance under the \n     Africa Food Security Initiative, or any comparable or \n     successor program, the Administrator of the United States \n     Agency for International Development--\n       (1) shall emphasize programs and projects that improve the \n     food security of infants, young children, school-age \n     children, women and food-insecure households, or that improve \n     the agricultural productivity, incomes, and marketing of the \n     rural poor in Africa;\n       (2) shall solicit and take into consideration the views and \n     needs of intended beneficiaries and program participants \n     during the selection, planning, implementation, and \n     evaluation phases of projects;\n       (3) shall favor countries that are implementing reforms of \n     their trade and investment laws and regulations in order to \n     enhance free market development in the food processing and \n     agricultural sectors; and\n       (4) shall ensure that programs are designed and conducted \n     in cooperation with African and United States organizations \n     and institutions, such as private and voluntary \n     organizations, cooperatives, land-grant and other appropriate \n     universities, and local producer-owned cooperative marketing \n     and buying associations, that have expertise in addressing \n     the needs of the poor, small-scale farmers, entrepreneurs, \n     and rural workers, including women.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, \n     if there is an increase in funding for sub-Saharan programs, \n     the Administrator of the United States Agency for \n     International Development should proportionately increase \n     resources to the Africa Food Security Initiative, or any \n     comparable or successor program, for fiscal year 2000 and \n     subsequent fiscal years in order to meet the needs of the \n     countries participating in such Initiative.\n\n     SEC. 102. MICROENTERPRISE ASSISTANCE.\n\n       (a) Bilateral Assistance.--In providing microenterprise \n     assistance for sub-Saharan Africa, the Administrator of the \n     United States Agency for International Development shall, to \n     the extent practicable, use credit and microcredit assistance \n     to improve the capacity and efficiency of agriculture \n     production in sub-Saharan Africa of small-scale farmers and \n     small rural entrepreneurs. In providing assistance, the \n     Administrator should use the applied research and technical \n     assistance capabilities of United States land-grant \n     universities.\n       (b) Multilateral Assistance.--\n       (1) In general.--The Administrator of the United States \n     Agency for International Development shall continue to work \n     with other countries, international organizations (including \n     multilateral development institutions), and entities \n     assisting microenterprises and shall develop a comprehensive \n     and coordinated strategy for providing microenterprise \n     assistance for sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (2) Additional requirement.--In carrying out paragraph (1), \n     the Administrator should encourage the World Bank \n     Consultative Group to Assist the Poorest to coordinate the \n     strategy described in such paragraph.\n\n     SEC. 103. SUPPORT FOR PRODUCER-OWNED COOPERATIVE MARKETING \n                   ASSOCIATIONS.\n\n       (a) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--\n       (1) to support producer-owned cooperative purchasing and \n     marketing associations in sub-Saharan Africa;\n       (2) to strengthen the capacity of farmers in sub-Saharan \n     Africa to participate in national and international private \n     markets and to promote rural development in sub-Saharan \n     Africa;\n       (3) to encourage the efforts of farmers in sub-Saharan \n     Africa to increase their productivity and income through \n     improved access to farm supplies, seasonal credit, technical \n     expertise; and\n       (4) to support small businesses in sub-Saharan Africa as \n     they grow beyond microenterprises.\n       (b) Support for Producer-Owned Cooperative Marketing \n     Associations.--\n       (1) Activities.--\n       (A) In general.--The Administrator of the United States \n     Agency for International Development is authorized to utilize \n     relevant foreign assistance programs and initiatives for sub-\n     Saharan Africa to support private producer-owned cooperative \n     marketing associations in sub-Saharan Africa, including rural \n     business associations that are owned and controlled by farmer \n     shareholders.\n       (B) Additional requirements.--In carrying out subparagraph \n     (A), the Administrator--\n       (i) shall take into account small-scale farmers, small \n     rural entrepreneurs, and rural workers and communities; and\n       (ii) shall take into account the local-level perspectives \n     of the rural and urban poor through close consultation with \n     these groups, consistent with section 496(e)(1) of the \n     Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2293(e)(1)).\n       (2) Other activities.--In addition to carrying out \n     paragraph (1), the Administrator is encouraged--\n       (A) to cooperate with governments of foreign countries, \n     including governments of political subdivisions of such \n     countries, their agricultural research universities, and \n     particularly with United States nongovernmental organizations \n     and United States land-grant universities, that have \n     demonstrated expertise in the development and promotion of \n     successful private producer-owned cooperative marketing \n     associations; and\n       (B) to facilitate partnerships between United States and \n     African cooperatives and private businesses to enhance the \n     capacity and technical and marketing expertise of business \n     associations in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n     SEC. 104. AGRICULTURAL AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES OF \n                   THE OVERSEAS PRIVATE INVESTMENT CORPORATION.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to encourage \n     the Overseas Private Investment Corporation to work with \n     United States businesses and other United States entities to \n     invest in rural sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in ways that \n     will develop the capacities of small-scale farmers and small \n     rural entrepreneurs, including women, in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Overseas Private Investment Corporation should \n     exercise its authority under law to undertake an initiative \n     to support private agricultural and rural development in sub-\n     Saharan Africa, including issuing loans, guaranties, and \n     insurance, to support rural development in sub-Saharan \n     Africa, particularly to support intermediary organizations \n     that--\n       (A) directly serve the needs of small-scale farmers, small \n     rural entrepreneurs, and rural producer-owned cooperative \n     purchasing and marketing associations;\n       (B) have a clear track-record of support for sound business \n     management practices; and\n       (C) have demonstrated experience with participatory \n     development methods; and\n       (2) the Overseas Private Investment Corporation should \n     utilize existing equity funds, loan and insurance funds, to \n     the extent feasible and in accordance with existing \n     contractual obligations, to support agriculture and rural \n     development in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n     SEC. 105.

I ask that the full text of this proclamation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The text follows:\n\n       Whereas world population stands today at more than 5.9 \n     billion and increases by more than 80 million per year, with \n     virtually all of this growth in the least developed \n     countries;\n       Whereas the consequences of rapid population growth are not \n     limited to the developing world but extend to all nations and \n     to all people, including every citizen of the State of \n     Nebraska concerned for human dignity, freedom and democracy, \n     as well as for the impact on the global economy;\n       Whereas 1.3 billion people--more than the combined \n     population of Europe and North Africa--live in absolute \n     poverty on the equivalent of one US dollar or less a day;\n       Whereas 1.5 billion people--nearly one-quarter of the world \n     population--lack an adequate supply of clean drinking water \n     or sanitation;\n       Whereas more than 840 million people--one-fifth of the \n     entire population of the developing world--are hungry or mal-\n     nourished;\n       Whereas this unmet demand for family planning is projected \n     to result in 1.2 billion unintended births;\n       Whereas the 1994 International Conference on Population and \n     Development determined that political and appropriate \n     programs aimed at providing universal access to voluntary \n     family planning, information, education and services can \n     ensure world population stabilization at 8 billion or less \n     rather than 12 billion or more;\n       Now, therefore, I, E.

Mr. President, Americans from every region in the \ncountry, from all walks of life--Americans straight and gay --have \nspent the past week expressing our sense of shock and outrage for what \nhappened on a dark road in Wyoming. We have also expressed our \npassionate conviction and knowledge that there is no room in our \ncountry for the kind of vicious, terrible, pathetic, ignorant hate that \ntook the life of Matthew Shepard.\n  We are a better country than that and, Mr. President, I know that \nWyoming is filled with good people who share our shock tonight.\n  But the question, here in this city of monuments, is what will we do \nabout it as a country? Is there a lesson that can become a monument to \nMatthew Shepard and so many others who suffer because of other people's \nlimitations?\n  The reason we are here is to guarantee that lesson and to make \ncertain that there will be no period of indifference, as there was \ninitially when the country ignored the burning of black churches or \noverlooked the spray-painted swastikas in synagogues; or suggested that \nthe undiluted hatred which killed this young man is someone else's \nproblem, some other community's responsibility.\n  We must all accept national responsibility for the killing in \nWyoming, and commit--each of us in our words, in our hearts, and in our \nactions--to insure that the lesson of Matthew Shepard is not forgotten.\n  To my friends in the Congress, I say let us pass the Hate Crimes \nPrevention Act. And, let the so-called leaders in this country stop \ntheir immature and nonsensical rhetoric which encourages, or justifies, \nthese barbaric acts. Look to the 58 high schools in my own beautiful \nstate of Massachusetts where 22 percent of gay students say they skip \nschool because they feel unsafe there and fully 31 percent of gay \nstudents had been threatened or actually physically attacked for being \ngay. Matthew Shepard is not the exception to the rule, Mr. President; \nhis tragic death rather is the extreme example of what happens on a \ndaily basis in our schools, on our streets and in our communities. And \nthat's why we have an obligation to pass laws that make clear our \ndetermination to root out this hatred. We hear a lot from Congress \ntoday how we are a country of laws, not men. Let them make good on \nthose words and pass hate crime legislation.\n  To all Americans, I encourage you tonight to stare down those who \nwant you to live in fear and declare boldly that you will not live in a \ncountry where private prejudice undermines public law.\n  Each of us has the power to make this happen, and in a small way \nchange misperception and reverse prejudice. Our belief in the strength \nof human justice can overcome the hatred in our society--by confronting \nit.\n  So we must confront it as Martin Luther King did when he preached in \nBirmingham and Memphis and all over this country, when he thundered his \nprotest and assuaged those who feared his dreams. He taught us how to \nlook hatred in the face and overcome it.\n  We should face it as Nelson Mandela did the day he left prison in \nSouth Africa, knowing that if his heart was filled only with hatred, he \ncould never be free. Nelson Mandela destroyed systemic hatred, faced \nthe fear--and today sets an example to the world about moving away from \nignorance.\n  We need to challenge it as Harvey Milk did in San Francisco, when he \nbrushed aside hatred, suspicion, fear and death threats to serve his \ncity. Even as he foretold his own assassination, Harvey prayed that \n``if a bullet should enter my brain, let that bullet destroy every \ncloset door.'' He knew that true citizenship belongs only to an \nenlightened people, undeterred by passion or prejudice--and it exists \nin a country which recognizes no one particular aspect of humanity \nbefore another.\n  Today, the challenge is to face our fears and root out hatred \nwherever we find it--whether on Laramie Road in Wyoming, or on the back \nroads of Jasper, Texas, or in the Shenandoah National Park.\n  The Declaration of Independence framed it all for us and everything \nwe try to be is based on the promise of certain inalienable rights; \nlife, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n  Mr. President, those two young high school dropouts threaten each and \nevery one of us when they stole Matthew's rights and life itself.\n  That kind of hate is the real enemy of our civilization--and we come \nhere to call on all people of good conscience to pass the laws that \nhelp us protect every citizen and we ask all Americans to make the \npersonal commitment to live their lives each day in a way that brings \nus together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/20/senate-section/article/S12729-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12729-S12730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO MATTHEW SHEPARD AND HIS FAMILY\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to remember a young \nman who was wrongly, viciously struck down in the prime of his life. \nMatthew Shepard was an innocent, kind, young man pursuing his education \nand enjoying the life of a college student. Tragically, he is now a \nreminder of what happens when we do not stand up to hate and bigotry.\n  On Monday night in Seattle and Spokane, Washington, hundreds of \npeople from all walks of life came together to remember Matthew and to \ncall for action to end hate crimes. Many people in Washington were \noutraged and shared in our Nation's sorrow. I was touched by this \nresponse and join with so many others in expressing my own deep sense \nof hopelessness. I know that this was not just an isolated incident. \nHate crimes are a real threat. We cannot be silent any longer.\n  A week ago today, I joined many of my colleagues down at the White \nHouse in celebration of the signing of the Higher Education \nReauthorization Act. I was proud to be there to call attention to the \nimportance of this act. I was proud that the legislation increased \nopportunities for young students and improved access to quality \neducation for all students. I thought about how important it was for us \nto be focused on the needs of young Americans and their families \nstriving to achieve a higher education.\n  I thought of the many college students and high school students I \nhave met who would benefit from these opportunities. I thought about my \nown college age children and the opportunities they would have. I knew \nthis was a big accomplishment.\n  Today, my thoughts are with another young college student who will \nnever experience the opportunities and improvements we worked so hard \nto achieve. My thoughts have gone from improving opportunities to how \nto prevent the terrible heartache that Matthew Shepard's family and \nfriends are now experiencing.\n  When I first heard of this horrible crime I immediately felt deep \nsympathy for Matthew's parents. How frightening it must have been for \nthem to fly half way around the world to be with their child who was \nalmost unrecognizable because of the violent attack he suffered. I \ncan't imagine the pain they must be experiencing. There are simply no \nwords that I could offer in comfort.\n  I then felt deep sorrow for the community and the University. To know \nthat those who committed this violent and hateful crime are part of \ntheir community must be unbearable. This community will never be the \nsame.\n  I now feel sorry for our Nation. What we have lost? A young man with \nso much potential. What might Matthew Shepard have become? We know that \nhe was interested in political science and very interested in this \nfield of\n\n[[Page S12730]]\n\nstudy. Could Matthew have become a U.S. Senator?\n  I think now that maybe Matthew can teach us all. We need to use this \ntragic and despicable crime to attack hate as we attack any other \ndisease that kills. We must treat hate crimes as the deadly threat that \nthey are and do more to prevent them. Hate is nothing more than a \ncancer that needs to be stopped.\n  S. 1529, Hate Crimes Prevention Act, offers us that opportunity. I am \npleased to have joined with many of my colleagues in cosponsoring this \nimportant legislation. The bill would expand the definition of a hate \ncrime and improve prosecution of those who act out their hate with \nviolence. No one beats a person to death and leaves them to die without \nbeing motivated by a deep sense of hate. This was no robbery. The \nmotive was hate.\n  The immediate response of local law enforcement officials illustrates \nwhy we need to strengthen Federal Hate Crimes laws and why the Federal \nGovernment must take a greater role in ending this violence.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to think about the many Matthew Shepards, \nwe have all met. Kind and hard working young adults. Let us act now to \nprevent any more senseless violence and deaths.\n  It is often said that from tragedy we can learn. Let us learn from \nthis tragic event and make a commitment that we will act on Hate Crimes \nPrevention legislation. Let our actions serve as a comfort to Matthew's \nparents and the hundreds of other parents who fear for their children.\n  There are so many tragedies that we cannot prevent. Another \nsenseless, brutal attack like the one experienced by Matthew is a \ntragedy that we can prevent. We spend millions of dollars a year \nseeking cures for deadly diseases that strike the young and old. We \nsimply cannot accept a disease that strikes without warning and takes \nthe life of a precious vulnerable child. We need to treat hate the \nsame. It cannot and will not be tolerated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/20/senate-section/article/S12729-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n HOUSE DELAY IN PASSAGE OF THE DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT, H.R. \n                                  2281\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am glad that the House Republican \nleadership relented and after several days' delay allowed the House to \nconsider and adopt the conference report on the landmark Digital \nMillennium Copyright Act, H.R. 2281.\n  Just two weeks ago, the Senate unanimously passed the Conference \nReport on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, H.R. 2281. This \nimportant legislation is based on the implementing legislation \nrecommended by the Administration and introduced last year by Senators \nHatch, Thompson, Kohl and me, to implement the new World Intellectual \nProperty Organization (WIPO) copyright treaties. The bill provides the \nprotection necessary to encourage copyright owners to make their works \navailable over the Internet and in other digital formats. This \nlegislation sets a standard for other nations who must also implement \nthese treaties.\n  The Senate bill was reported unanimously by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and passed the Senate without opposition. The House-Senate \nconference over the last several weeks also led to all conferees \nsigning the conference report and supporting the final version of the \nlegislation. As the only Senate Democratic conferee I was pleased to \nserve on this conference and participate in working out agreements with \nHouse Republican and Democratic conferees.\n  With the approval of the chairmen and ranking Democrats on both the \nHouse Judiciary Committee and the House Commerce Committee, this \nlandmark legislation--which Senator Hatch has called the most important \nbill we will pass this year--seemed to have finally cleared the last \nhurdle and be ready to be sent to the President for enactment. On \nThursday, October 8, Senator Hatch and I were both present on the \nSenate floor for Senate final passage and had been informed that the \nHouse leadership had determined to take up and pass the bill that very \nday.\n  Surprisingly, the bill was not taken up in the House on Thursday or \nFriday or Saturday or Sunday. There was a threat that it would not be \nbrought up by the House leadership at all, and I think that the Senate \nand the American people are entitled to an explanation.\n  It turns out that the House Republican leadership had decided to hold \nthis critical legislation hostage to petty partisan politics. According \nto reports in Roll Call on October 8 and 12, Reuters on October 10 and \nthe Washington Post on October 14 and 15, House Republicans were mad \nthat a pal of theirs was not hired to head the Electronic Industries \nAlliance. The hold on this legislation is to ``send a message.''\n  Apparently, in the world of Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey and Tom \nDeLay, trade associations better hire their Republican friends or there \nwill be retribution, including stalling action of important bipartisan \nlegislation that promotes the national interest. This is childish \nbehavior beneath the dignity of those who hold leadership positions in \na House of Congress. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a good bill \non which so many of us have worked so hard and cooperated so closely \nacross the aisle, was finally allowed to be considered by the House and \ndid pass. I thank the House Republican leaders for ending their pout in \ntime for this landmark legislation to be adopted.\n  This bill should help create jobs and economic opportunities to \nAmerica's leading copyright-based industries. We all recognize that \nbecause the U.S. is the world-wide leader in intellectual property, the \nU.S. will be the main beneficiary if Congress enacts this legislation.\n  Protecting and encouraging the intellectual creations of our citizens \nhas always been a fundamental priority for our country and a \nresponsibility of our national government. Our creative industries \nproduce the material that makes the global information infrastructure \nsomething worth having. I want to ensure that the creators of movies \nand television and cable programming and recordings and books and \ncomputer software and interactive media continue to create, that their \ncreativity is rewarded, that their creations are not stolen or pirated, \nand that those basic tenets are followed in all the world's markets.\n  The 1998 report of the International Intellectual Property Alliance \nconfirms the importance of copyright-based industries to our American \neconomy and our economic future. The report demonstrates, for the \nseventh straight year, that the U.S. copyright industries continue to \nbe one of the largest and fastest growing segments of the U.S. economy. \nThese industries are leading this country into the digital age and the \n21st century. Thanks goodness cooler heads finally prevailed and \nCongress was allowed to complete work on the Digital Millennium \nCopyright Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/20/senate-section/article/S12730-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12730-S12731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   JACK HECHLER: DECADE OF SERVICE TO CONGRESSIONAL EXCHANGE PROGRAM\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN.

For the past \nten years, Mr. Hechler has been the contract interpreter and escort for \nthe German staff delegation which arrives each summer for a three week \nprogram in the United States. Born and raised in Germany, Mr. Hechler \ngraduated from American University in Washington, DC, served in Korea \nwith the U.S. Armed Forces and for more than 37 years was an active \nCivil Service employee who, prior to retirement was the Director of \nPolicy, Plans and Evaluation at the General Service Administration. Now \nretired, Mr. Hechler has been devoted to the U.S. Congress--Bundestag \nStaff Exchange Program.\n  Jack Hechler has been invaluable to the U.S. Congress-Bundestag Staff \nExchange program by providing continuity to a program which relies \nheavily on alumni volunteers. The ten member German delegations and the \nnetwork of American alumni have counted on his insight and discussions \nto add to this annual program. A recipient of the Order of Merit from \nthe Federal Republic of Germany for his work with this\n\n[[Page S12731]]\n\nexchange program, he has provided a tremendous service and I offer my \nmost sincere thanks to Jack for his efforts on behalf of the U.S. \nCongress-Bundestag Staff Exchange program.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. \n1802, the reauthorization of the Surface Transportation Board (Board). \nI have spoken out in favor of the Board on many occasions. I want to \nreemphasize today my commitment to seeing that the Board will be in \nbusiness for a long time and will be given the resources that it needs \nto continue its vital work.\n  The Board is the independent economic regulatory agency that oversees \nthe Nation's rail and surface transportation industries. A healthy \ntransportation system is critical to sustaining a vibrant and growing \neconomy. Under the able and forward-looking leadership of Linda Morgan, \nthe Board's Chairman, who was with us on the Commerce Committee for \nmany years, the Board has worked to ensure that the transportation \nsystem is both healthy and responsive. Although it was established to \nbe principally an adjudicatory body, the Board has reached out to the \ntransportation community in an unprecedented way. It has handled the \ncrisis in the West appropriately, letting the private sector work it \nout where possible, but intervening when necessary. It has initiated \nproceedings at the request of Senator McCain and Senator Hutchison to \nreview the status of access and competition in the railroad industry, \nand its actions have produced a mix of government action and private-\nsector solutions. With its staff of 135, it puts out more work than \nmuch larger agencies, issuing well-reasoned, thoughtful, and balanced \ndecisions in tough, contentious cases. Just recently, in the Conrail \nacquisition case, the Board issued one such decision that is good for \nmy State, and for the Nation.\n  But the Board is stretched thin. It needs to train new people to \nreplace the many employees who are likely to retire soon. And next \nyear, it will continue to expend resources monitoring the \nimplementation of the Conrail acquisition and the rest of the rail \nnetwork. The Board needs adequate resources to do the hard work that we \nexpect it to do.\n  Because we need the Board, and because the Board has done a fine job, \nI am here today supporting a clean reauthorization bill. I supported \nthe Staggers Act when it was passed, and I think in large part it has \nbeen a success.\n  I know that there is some concern about how our transportation system \nought to look, and that there are many important issues on the table \nright now. Several of those issues are being handled by the Board, in \nconnection with its competition and access hearings. I am confident \nthat the Board will do the right thing with the issues before it.\n  However, some of the tougher issues that have not yet been resolved--\nfor example, the substantially more open access that some shippers \nwant--are not for the Board.

HAMILTON OF INDIANA\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today humbled by the \nconsiderable accomplishments of a great friend and colleague, Lee \nHamilton of Indiana. After 17 terms, he will leave the House of \nRepresentatives at year's end. What a profound loss for us all.\n  Not surprisingly, Lee Hamilton continues to be recognized for his \nachievements. Last Tuesday's New York Times quotes Congressman Hamilton \nas ``feeling pretty good about the job'' he has held for 34 years. ``I \nhave more confidence in the institutions of government and the Congress \nthan most of my constituents. The process is often untidy, but it \nworks.'' David S. Broder wrote in a column entitled ``Lee Hamilton's \nMark,'' ``. . . no one will be more missed by his colleagues of both \nparties than Lee Hamilton of Indiana . . . (h)e is an exemplar of the \ncommon-sense, instinctively moderate model of legislator that used to \nbe common in Congress but is increasingly rare today.''\n  I had the honor of serving with Representative Hamilton on the \nCommission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy (1995-1997). \nOur Commission recommended unanimously that legislation should be \nadopted to govern the system of classifying and declassifying \ninformation, which for a half century has been left to executive \nregulation. The Congressional members of the Commission introduced such \nlegislation in the House and Senate and one of my largest regrets for \nthe 105th Congress is that we could not get this legislation adopted in \nhonor of Lee Hamilton's retirement. This will take some time, but \neventually, surely, we will pass such a bill.\n  As the former Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Joint \nCommittee on the Organization of Congress, the Select Committee to \nInvestigate Covert Arms Transactions with Iran, and the Permanent \nSelect Committee on Intelligence, Lee Hamilton has showed an \nextraordinary capacity to lead our country through difficult times. \nLast year, Lee received the Edmund S. Muskie Distinguished Public \nService Award from the Center for National Policy and, just last month, \nthe Hubert Humphrey Award from the American Political Science \nAssociation.\n  I might note here that Hubert Humphrey was the first Chairman of the \nBoard of Trustees of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for \nScholars here in Washington. To our great benefit, Lee Hamilton has \njust recently agreed to head the Wilson Center. He will assume his new \npost in January, succeeding the Center's distinguished director, \nCharles Blitzer. Dr. Blitzer's tremendous achievement--the building of \na permanent home for the Wilson Center at the now complete Federal \nTriangle--fulfills the commitment to President Wilson's living memorial \nas established in its 1968 founding statute. That statute required that \nthe Center be located on Pennsylvania Avenue. Today the Wilson Center \ncan be found at One Woodrow Wilson Plaza on Pennsylvania Avenue where \nit maintains architectural and functional autonomy from its neighbor, \nthe Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center.\n  It is of enormous comfort to this Senator to know that Lee Hamilton \nwill remain close at hand and continue to engage us all in matters of \ngreat import.\n  I ask that David Broder's column ``Lee Hamilton's Mark'' from The\n\n[[Page S12732]]\n\nWashington Post and the article, ``A Life Reflected in a House \nTransformed,'' by Melinda Henneberger in The New York Times be printed \nin the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n              [From the Washington Post, October 11, 1998]\n\n                          Lee Hamilton's Mark\n\n                          (By David S. Broder)\n\n       He's not the oldest or longest-serving of the 21 House \n     members who are retiring this year and not running for other \n     offices. Those distinctions belong to two other Democrats, \n     Illinois' Sidney Yates, the ardent defender of arts funding, \n     and Texas's Henry Gonzalez, the populist scourge of bankers \n     and other big shots.\n       He may not have had the political impact of a much more \n     junior Republican retiree, New York's Bill Paxon, who led the \n     1994 campaign that ended 40 years of Democratic control of \n     the House and who appeared to be on track to a future \n     speakership until he fell out last year with his former ally \n     Newt Gingrich.\n       But my hunch is that no one will be more missed by his \n     colleagues of both parties than Lee Hamilton of Indiana, who \n     is ending a notable 34-year career in the House with the \n     adjournment of this Congress.\n       Hamilton is a throwback to the old days of the House--and \n     not just because he still has the crew cut he wore when he \n     came to Washington as a small-town Hoosier lawyer in the \n     Democratic landslide of 1964. He is an exemplar of the \n     common-sense, instinctively moderate model of legislator that \n     used to be common in Congress but is increasingly rare today.\n       Hamilton has made his mark in two areas unlikely to produce \n     public acclaim. Like his mentor and friend, former \n     representative Morris Udall of Arizona, he has struggled with \n     modest results to improve the internal organization and \n     operations of the House and the way its members pay for their \n     campaigns. More notably, he has been the Democrats' leader on \n     international policy, serving as chairman of the Foreign \n     Affairs Committee when his party had the majority. In both \n     arenas, he has consistently placed principle above \n     partisanship and worked comfortably with like-minded \n     Republicans.\n       He first attracted attention in 1965 when, as chairman of \n     the big freshman Democratic class, he wrote President Lyndon \n     Johnson urging ``a pause'' in the breakneck pace of Great \n     Society legislation, the first clear signal that Johnson has \n     pushed the mandate of his election sweep beyond safe \n     political limits. Johnson came to Indiana to help Hamilton \n     with his first--and hardest--reelection campaign in 1966, but \n     the following year, Hamilton again demonstrated his \n     independence--and his prescience--by sponsoring one of the \n     first (but unsuccessful) amendments to scale back American \n     military operations in Vietnam.\n       As Hamilton recalled in a speech last November, Johnson had \n     been a friend as well as his ally. ``He had the freshman \n     class in the Cabinet Room and told us, `Buy your home.' He \n     said, `If you're like most politicians, it'll be the only \n     decent investment you'll ever make.' I did, and it was.''\n       But after the Vietnam amendment, Johnson called him in. ``I \n     will never forget his eyes when he asked me, `How could you \n     do that to me, Lee?' '' Hamilton recalled. ``I have served \n     with eight presidents and 11 secretaries of state, and I have \n     sympathized with the burdens and pressures all of them have \n     faced.'' But he has operated on the principle that if \n     Congress is to meet its responsibilities, it must offer its \n     best and most candid counsel to an administration. ``Our \n     great fault,'' he told me, ``is timidity. We don't like to \n     stick our necks out.''\n       That has not been true of Lee Hamilton. He has given his \n     best judgment freely and plainly, usually supportive of the \n     president, but has never been reluctant to dissent.\n       In his final months in office, Hamilton received the Edmund \n     S. Muskie Distinguished Public Service Award from the Center \n     for National Policy and the Hubert Humphrey Award from the \n     American Political Science Association. Accepting the first \n     award, he said, ``Politics and politicians may be unpopular, \n     but they're also indispensable. . . . Representative \n     democracy, for all its faults, enables us to live together \n     peacefully and productively. It works through a process of \n     deliberation, negotiation and compromise--in a word, the \n     process of politics. At its best, representative democracy \n     gives us a system where all of us have a voice in the process \n     and a stake in the product.''\n       Hamilton understands that ``when healthy skepticism about \n     government turns to cynicism, it becomes the great enemy of \n     democracy.'' So his new career will position him to battle \n     for understanding of politics and against corrosive distrust. \n     He will head the Woodrow Wilson International Center for \n     Scholars in Washington, where academics from other nations \n     gather with Americans to think and write about contemporary \n     public policy problems. He will also lead a newly formed \n     Center on Congress at Indiana University, an \n     interdisciplinary program aimed at making the legislative \n     branch less mysterious and suspicious. He is the right man \n     for both jobs.\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 13, 1998]\n\n                A Life Reflected in a House Transformed\n\n                        (By Melinda Henneberger)\n\n       Washington, Oct. 12.--As he waits for the last votes of his \n     34-year Congressional career, Democratic Representative Lee \n     Hamilton runs one hand through his crew cut and thinks out \n     loud, in his right-down-the-middle way, about why the House \n     is both meaner and cleaner, more hard-working and less \n     thoughtful, than when he arrived here from Columbus, Ind., in \n     1965.\n       In those days, he recalls, members of Congress palled \n     around, played cards and made a good-faith effort to be on \n     the golf course by 1 P.M. Now they barely have time to get to \n     know one another, let alone contemplate the meaning of \n     legislative life, in the press of 24-hour news cycles and \n     three-day work weeks bracketed by rush-rush trips home.\n       Back then, you could legally accept fancy gifts and pocket \n     leftover campaign money when you retired. Even if you managed \n     to get into trouble, there was no House ethics committee \n     until 1978. Then again, neither was there any need to work \n     full time raising money. Mr. Hamilton is nostalgic about the \n     $30,000 he spent as a small-town lawyer on his first race in \n     1964, the year of Lyndon B. Johnson's landslide. He spent $1 \n     million on his last race in 1996.\n       In his office, the Congressman's papers are already being \n     packed up, and the mail marked ``return to sender.'' Settling \n     in for a leisurely interview, the 67-year-old Indiana \n     Basketball Hall of Famer drapes his large frame over a \n     straight wooden chair in a room adorned with paintings of his \n     dogs, Tawny and Buffy.\n       The politically moderate son of a Methodist minister from \n     Evansville, Ind., he has been a major force on foreign policy \n     and led opposition to aid for the Nicaraguan contra \n     guerrillas. He was House chairman of the panel that \n     investigated Reagan Administration support for the contras \n     with the proceeds of illegal arms sales to Iran, and also \n     chaired the Foreign Affairs and Intelligence Committees. The \n     Presidential nominees Michael S. Dukakis and Bill Clinton \n     seriously considered him as a running mate.\n       Yet when invited to linger for a moment over some favorite \n     accomplishment, he mentions, not very grandly, that he was \n     proud simply to have been among those who voted for the \n     creation of Medicare, even if he did not write the bill.\n       Despite his talk about 1960's sociability on the Hill, Mr. \n     Hamilton seems always to have put in long hours. A 1966 \n     profile in The Washington Star noted that, ``Hamilton gets to \n     the office every morning at about 6:30, reads all the mail, \n     answers nearly all the roll calls, and has missed going back \n     home on weekends only a couple of times since he took office. \n     He doesn't drink and he doesn't smoke and he works hard.''\n       He has been enormously popular in the Ninth District in \n     southeastern Indiana. (He is also popular among his staff in \n     a workplace in which aides are often treated casually. Behind \n     his back, staff members are misty about his retirement.)\n       ``I've been going to a lot of retirement dinners back in \n     Indiana,'' he said, ``and the things people remember are the \n     simple things, that I've tried to be accessible and honest \n     and tried to make government work. When I drive through my \n     district and see a sewage system or a library or a school \n     I've had something to do with, that gives me a lot of \n     satisfaction.''\n       And most likely, this unwillingness to trumpet his career \n     and contributions would have set him apart at any moment in \n     the history of the big, noisy institution he clearly loves.\n       On the other side of the ledger, Mr. Hamilton said, ``You \n     don't walk away from a 34-year career without some regrets, \n     and I leave very disappointed that we haven't done something \n     on campaign finance or affordable health care.''\n       Not surprisingly, his most immediate regret is what he sees \n     as the necessity of an inquiry into the possible grounds for \n     impeaching the President, a man he has praised on policy and \n     excoriated for the private conduct that got him into trouble.\n       ``It's a depressing way to end a career, on the note of \n     impeachment,'' he said, removing his glasses, fiddling with \n     them, putting them back on. ``I'm distressed with the ending, \n     but you don't control these things.''\n       Still, living through Watergate and Iran-contra, Mr. \n     Hamilton said, has given him some perspective on the current \n     situation: ``We look back now and say the system worked in \n     Watergate but in the middle of it, it was messy and partisan. \n     And something like that is happening now, in my view.''\n       How does he answer those in his own party who respond to \n     criticism of Mr. Clinton's behavior by saying essentially \n     that President Reagan did far worse and survived? ``In Iran-\n     contra you were looking at a President abusing the powers of \n     the Presidency''--as opposed to the personal conduct under \n     discussion in the Clinton case, in his view. ``But though a \n     lot of people on the left were disappointed we didn't hang \n     him, the evidence didn't point to that.''\n       Mr. Hamilton was among the 31 Democrats who broke party \n     ranks and voted for an open-ended impeachment inquiry. He \n     thought it only right to continue the process, he said, \n     though he has concluded that the President's wrongdoing \n     does not meet the constitutional standard of an \n     impeachable offense and believes Mr. Clinton will finish \n     his term.\n       And as Mr. Hamilton leaves office, he wants to spend some \n     time thinking about how the President might be rehabilitated \n     to assure that America is not weakened, particularly on the \n     international stage.\n       Mr. Hamilton's future includes two new jobs, as director of \n     the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, a Government-\n     sponsored\n\n[[Page S12733]]\n\n     institution that promotes research as well as exchanges \n     between scholars and policymakers, and of a new center for \n     the study of Congress at Indiana University. He and his wife, \n     Nancy, will stay on here, in their home in Alexandria, Va.\n       Not only Congress, he said, but political life in general \n     is a different game now than it was in 1960, when Mr. \n     Hamilton was unable to turn out a respectable crowd to greet \n     Senator John F. Kennedy in Columbus.\n       ``I called everybody I knew and couldn't get 40 people to \n     come out to the Old City Hall to see him just a few months \n     before he got the nomination'' for the Presidency, he said, \n     laughing at the innocence of the time. ``Now you start \n     running for President four years ahead of time and the voters \n     are so well informed, you do something and get back to the \n     office and the phones are already ringing.''\n       Not all of that sophistication is progress, he said. He \n     dared to say what no candidate would: that today's elected \n     officials pay too much attention to constituents, tracking \n     every hiccup in public opinion.\n       In some ways, he feels he is leaving on the same note he \n     came in on: ``We're still fighting about Medicare 30 years \n     later.'' But there has been positive change, he said, in that \n     the workings of Congress are much more open now, and the body \n     more truly representative, with many more women and members \n     of minority groups in office. If he has learned anything, he \n     said, it is the difficulty of making representative \n     government work.\n       He has for some time now missed the collegiality of his \n     early years in Washington, when a senior Republican corrected \n     a glaring parliamentary error Mr. Hamilton had made on a bill \n     the man opposed--an act of generosity that he said would be \n     unimaginable today.\n       He will miss his colleagues, too. And if he has not fully \n     focused on his feelings about leaving, because there has not \n     been time, Mr. Hamilton exits feeling pretty good about the \n     job: ``I don't leave as a pessimist. I'm not gloomy because I \n     have more confidence in the institutions of government and \n     the Congress than most of my constituents. The process is \n     often untidy, but it works.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/20/senate-section/article/S12731-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ERIN POPOVICH\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, Butte, Montana has a long history \nof excellence in sports and the cultivation of champions. On Sunday, \nOctober 11, 1998 in Christchurch, New Zealand, a young champion from \nButte won a gold medal in the 200-meter individual medley at the \nParalympic World Swimming Championships. At age 13, Erin Popovich \nobtained a gold medal with her personal best time of 3:32.45, \nshattering her previous mark of 3:37.18 which had been a world record.\n  On Thursday, October 15 Erin significantly added to her trophy case \nby winning gold medals in the 50-meter freestyle and 50-meter butterfly \nraces. The Butte Central Junior High 8th Grader improved on her United \nStates record time in the 50-meter butterfly with a time of 45.63. She \nalso recorded a personal best in her 50-meter freestyle with a time of \n37.54. In the freestyle Erin was in second place until the final 4 \nmeters when she went on to win the gold. Erin also won a bronze medal \nin the 100-meter freestyle and helped win a gold for the women's 200-\nmeter team freestyle relay.\n  The most amazing aspect of this is that Erin only started \ncompetitively swimming 10 months ago when she joined the Butte Tarpons \nSwim Club, under the direction of Swim Coach Marie Cook and Assistant \nCoach Bill Sever. She is a natural athlete, but her true strength lies \nin her dedication. ``Her determination is her strength,'' Coach Cook \nsays. ``Her mental attitude is just tough.'' Erin's focus provides an \nexcellent example for her teammates, Coach Cook says. ``The kids on \nthis team don't think of her as disabled . . . when she gets on the \nblocks with taller kids you can see it--she's such an inspiration to \neveryone.''\n  Erin, who is the daughter of Dr. Keith and Barbara Popovich, is only \none of 30 swimmers to qualify for the United States Disabled Team. The \nParalympics features 585 swimmers from 55 countries.\n  I want to join with her family and friends and all the Butte Tarpon \nSwimmers in congratulating Erin on her tremendous success.

Mr. President, Kentucky suffered a grievous \nloss last week when law enforcement officer Regina Nickles of \nHarrodsburg, Kentucky was shot and killed, in the line of duty, early \nWednesday morning as Officer Nickles and her partner were responding to \na call reporting a man sneaking around the parking lot of a Harrodsburg \nfactory. She was 45 years old.\n  Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, Regina Woodward Nickles grew up in Boyle \nCounty in Central Kentucky. She went to high school in Danville and \nthen attended Eastern Kentucky University. In 1983, at the age of 29, \nOfficer Nickles became the first--and remains the only--woman to ever \nserve on the Harrodsburg Police force. When she was profiled in the \nlocal newspaper in 1983, she said, ``I want to do the best job that I \ncan, and I still feel like I have to prove myself because I'm a woman. \nI don't want to let these men down who had enough confidence in me to \nhire me.''\n  In a town as small as Harrodsburg--population 8000--all the officers \nare well known. And Officer Nickles was particularly well regarded. She \nwas known in the community as a peacemaker, an officer with a special \ntalent for resolving disputes before they became violent. She is \nremembered as kind and caring, known for pulling over motorists, giving \nthem a stern warning and sending them on their way. But she could also \nbe tough when called for, and had the respect of the community and all \nof her fellow officers.\n  Reflecting the the goodwill that she had built up in Harrodsburg over \nher career, Officer Nickles was recently nominated as the Republican \ncandidate for sheriff in the November elections. A remarkable \nreflection of the rapport she had with the community is the fact that \nseveral people who had once been arrested and jailed by Officer Nickles \nhave said that they still intended to vote for her because of the way \nshe had treated them.\n  The murder of Officer Nickles has left the Harrodsburg community in a \nstate of shock. Much like our small Capitol Hill community was \ndevastated by the murders of Officer J.J. Chestnut and Detective John \nGibson, the residents of Harrodsburg are asking how this could happen \nin their small town. As we are painfully aware, no community is immune \nfrom such heinous acts.\n  Mr. President, Officer Regina Woodward Nickles leaves behind an \nextended family that must now cope with an unimaginably horrific loss. \nOfficer Nickles will also be mourned by the tight-knit Harrodsburg \ncommunity in which she was such a valued participant.\n  When Officer Nickles announced her candidacy for Sheriff, she \nelaborated on her motivation for pursuing the position. ``I want to do \nmore than wear a badge and a gun,'' she observed. ``I want to touch \npeople's lives.'' Officer Nickles didn't need to be elected sheriff to \ndo that. It is abundantly clear that she had touched many people during \nher too-brief life, and she will be sorely missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/20/senate-section/article/S12733-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12733-S12734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          REPUBLICAN OBSTRUCTION OF PATENT REFORM LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have long been involved in high \ntechnology issues and those affecting American industry that relies on \nintellectual property at its core. Over a decade ago, I helped \nestablish and chaired a Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Technology \nand the Law. This year, we have successfully completed work on \nlegislation to address the impending millennium bug with the Senate and \nHouse adopting the Hatch-Leahy substitute for S. 2392, the Year 2000 \nInformation and Readiness Disclosure Act.\n  I have also worked closely with Senator Hatch on a number of other \nintellectual property measure including the Digital Millennium \nCopyright Act, H.R. 2281, the Trademark Law Treaty Implementation Act, \nS. 2193, and the United States Patent and Trademark Office \nReauthorization Act, H.R. 3723. Working with Senators Daschle, \nBingaman, Boxer, Harkin, Kohl and others, we have been able to put the \ninterests of the nation and the nation's economic future first and \nenact significant legislation with respect to both copyright and \ntrademark matters this year. Unfortunately, we have not made the \nprogress that we should have on patent matters.\n  A critical matter from the intellectual property agenda, important to \nthe nation's economic future, is reform of our patent laws. I have been \nworking diligently along with Senators\n\n[[Page S12734]]\n\nDaschle, Bingaman, Cleland, Boxer, Harkin and Lieberman to get the \nOmnibus Patent Act, S. 507, considered and passed by the Senate. It is \nan important measure to America's future. Working in tandem with \nSenator Hatch, we developed a good bill that was reported to the Senate \nby a vote of 17 to one over a year ago.\n  We have been seeking Senate consideration and a vote for more than a \nyear, but Republican objections have prevented its passage. Last month, \nI signed on to offer our patent bill as an amendment to the bankruptcy \nbill. I felt strongly that it was long past time for the Senate to \nconsider this patent reform legislation. Unfortunately, Republican \nopposition, again, prevented Senate consideration and prevented the \namendment from even being offered.\n  I deeply regret that Republican objections succeeded in preventing \nSenator Hatch from even offering our amendment, in spite of the \namendment spot that we had reserved for that purpose. I know that there \nis strong support for this measure and I know that no Senate Democrat \nhas been preventing or objecting to its consideration.\n  Anonymous Senate Republican have prevented the patent bill from being \ngiven the opportunity to be debated. This is not the way for the Senate \nto act. Republican objections killed patent reform silently, without \nfingerprints, and without debate.\n  I want to thank Secretary Daley and the Administration for their \nunfailing support of effective patent reform. Our patent bill would be \ngood for Vermont, good for American innovators of all sizes, and good \nfor America. Unfortunately, some secret minority of Senate Republicans \nwill not allow patent reform to proceed.\n  The patent bill would reform the U.S. patent system in important \nways. It would reduce legal fees that are paid by inventors and \ncompanies; eliminate duplication of research efforts and accelerate \nresearch into new areas; increase the value of patents to inventors and \ncompanies; and facilitate U.S. inventors and companies' research, \ndevelopment, and commercialization of inventions.\n  Republican and Democratic Administrations alike, reaching back to the \nJohnson Administration, have supported these reforms. Last year, five \nformer Patent Commissioners sent a letter to the President and to the \nmembers of the Senate supporting the patent reform bill.\n  Senator Hatch and I agreed to incorporate suggestions from the White \nHouse Conference on Small Businesses and I am pleased to report that as \na result, the White House Conference on Small Businesses, the National \nAssociation of Women Business Owners, the National Venture Capital \nAssociation, National Small Business United, and the Small Business \nTechnology Coalition concluded that the bill would be of great benefit \nto small businesses.\n  Unfortunately, because of Republican opposition to this bipartisan \nbill, the Senate will have no opportunity to consider this legislation \nto assist U.S. inventors small and large. I find this particularly \nunfortunate since our patent bill was geared toward improving the \noperational efficiency at the PTO and making government smaller and \nleaner.\n  Today's inventors and creators can be much like those of Thomas \nJefferson's day--individuals in a shop, garage or home lab. They can \nalso be teams of scientists working in our largest corporations or at \nour colleges and universities. Our nation's patent laws should be fair \nto American innovators of all kinds--independent inventors, small \nbusinesses, venture capitalists and larger corporations. To maintain \nAmerica's preeminence in the realm of technology we need to modernize \nour patent system and patent office. Our inventors know this and that \nis why they support this legislation.\n  I have received many letters of endorsements for S. 507, some of \nwhich I placed into the Congressional Record on June 23, July 10 and \nJuly 16, from the following coalitions and companies: the White House \nConference on Small Businesses, the National Association of Women \nBusiness Owners, the Small Business Technology Coalition, National \nSmall Business United, the National Venture Capital Association, the \n21st Century Patent Coalition, the Chamber of Commerce of the United \nStates of America, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufactures of \nAmerican (PhRMA), the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, \nthe Software Publishers Association, the Semiconductor Industry \nAssociation, the Business Software Alliance, the American Electronics \nAssociation, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, \nInc., the Biotechnology Industry Organization, the International \nTrademark Association, IBM, 3M, Intel, Caterpillar, AMP, and Hewlett-\nPackard. In addition, I have letters of support from the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, TSM/Rockwell International, Obsidian, and \nAllied Signal.\n  I am deeply disappointed that the Senate is being prevented from \nconsidering this important legislation by Republican recalcitrance. \nAmerican inventors deserve better and America's future is being short \nchanged.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/20/senate-section/article/S12733-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12734-S12735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IMMIGRANT NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the \nattention of my colleagues a recent article in the Washington Times \ndealing with the large proportion of Nobel Prize winners in the United \nStates who are immigrants. As reported in this article, while only \napproximately 8 percent of the American population was foreign-born as \nof 1990, approximately one third of American winners of the Nobel Prize \nhave been immigrants.\n  The Times also reports that, according to the National Research \nCouncil, ``immigrants have won 32 percent of the U.S. Nobel Prizes for \nphysics, 31 percent of the medicine and economics prizes, and 26 \npercent of the chemistry prizes.'' This year, Austrian-born American \nWalter Kohn won the Nobel Prize for Medicine and Daniel Tsui, born in \nChina, won the Nobel Prize in Physics as a naturalized American.\n  Mr. President, I believe every American should take great pride in \nthese gentlemen's accomplishments. By keeping American society free and \nopen we attracted them to our borders. Through our willingness to seek \nout and hire the most talented people available we gave them the \nopportunity to excel. By rising above considerations of national origin \nand family background all of us have benefitted from the discoveries, \nthe intelligence and the hard work of literally millions of \nimmigrants--from my own grandparents to the ancestors of our Founding \nFathers to the latest immigrant, intent on making a better life for \nhimself and his family.\n  I ask that the full text of the article from the Washington Times be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Oct. 17, 1998]\n\n              Immigrants Help U.S. Bring Home Nobel Bacon\n\n                            (By Ruth Larson)\n\n       This week's announcement of the Nobel Prizes for science \n     continued America's long-standing dominance of the \n     prestigious awards, thanks in large part to a wealth of \n     foreign-born talent.\n       A National Research Council report last year found that \n     about a third of all U.S. Nobel Prizes were won by scientists \n     born overseas. Immigrants have won 32 percent of the U.S. \n     Nobel Prizes for physics, 31 percent of the medicine and \n     economics prizes, and 26 percent of the chemistry prizes.\n       Although the report does not state where the immigrants \n     were born, the last 16 winners since 1987 have come from \n     places like Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Hungary, Canada, \n     Mexico and Korea.\n       ``There's no doubt about it: Immigrants represent a very \n     high proportion of Nobel Prize winners,'' said Cato Institute \n     economist Stephen Moore.\n       The number of foreign-born Nobel Prize winners is all the \n     more striking, given that the U.S. foreign-born population \n     reached just 8 percent in 1990, the report said.\n       The Nobel Prizes, considered the ultimate symbols of \n     scientific achievement, show how America in the 1990s has \n     become a high-tech melting pot, recruiting science and \n     engineering talent from around the world to fuel the growth \n     of industries from computers and electronics to \n     pharmaceuticals and biotechnology.\n       In 1993, 23 percent of those holding science and \n     engineering doctorates were born overseas, according to the \n     National Science Foundation's latest figures.\n       Shirley Malcom of the American Association for the \n     Advancement of Science, said, ``The best and the brightest \n     come here because there has been a tremendous research \n     establishment built up in this country.''\n       Mr. Moore agreed: ``If you're one of the world's top \n     scientists, you want to be at Stanford or Harvard or MIT, \n     where they have some of the bsst academic research \n     facilities.\n       History has helped, too. Obviously, World War II played a \n     major role, with many of the\n\n[[Page S12735]]\n\n     more repressive regimes discriminating against scientists of \n     a particular heritage or background,'' Ms. Malcom said.\n       ``In many cases, scientists had no choice but to leave. \n     They came to the U.S. because they were offered opportunities \n     to pursue their life's work without regard to those \n     extraneous issues.''\n       Roald Hoffman, a 1981 winner of the Nobel Prize for \n     chemistry, fled with his family in 1949 from their native \n     Poland.\n       ``I was one of the last generations of Hitler's gifts to \n     America,'' he said.\n       A wave of Central European scientists, including physicists \n     Albert Einstein and Enrico Fermi, fled the rise of Nazism and \n     anti-Semitism and came to America.\n       The scientific research structure established after World \n     War II flourished, with the help of a strong economy and \n     generous government funding from agencies like the National \n     Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, he \n     said.\n       ``The freedom to do the scientific research you want . . . \n     is tremendous, as is the ease of interaction with other \n     scientists,'' Mr. Hoffman said. Success then breeds success: \n     ``Once you have built up a good reputation in a particular \n     area, it attracts other scientists, as we've seen in the \n     biomedical field.''\n       Ms. Malcom predicted that a similar influx of scientists \n     fleeing the former Soviet Union would be reflected in future \n     Nobel winners. ``Not just because of the Cold War, either,'' \n     she said. ``They've lost much of the infrastructure needed \n     for research and development, as well.''\n       But wars and repressive regimes cannot account for the \n     success of immigrants once they arrive on American soil.\n       ``We're getting people with the motivation and ambition \n     that leads to high achievement,'' Mr. Moore said. ``There's a \n     certain amount of risk-taking associated with \n     success.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/20/senate-section/article/S12734-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12735-S12736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      ENACTMENT OF THE SOUTHERN NEVADA PUBLIC LAND MANAGEMENT ACT\n\n Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nrise today to announce the enactment of the Southern Nevada Public Land \nManagement Act. This historic legislation passed the Senate on October \n8th and President Clinton signed it into law on October 19, 1998.\n  Mr. President, this legislation has its roots in the Southern Nevada \nPublic Lands Task Force. The Task Force was originally established in \nthe summer of 1994 by Congressman Jim Bilbray to provide an open forum \nin which public land issues affecting the Las Vegas Valley could be \ndiscussed among federal, state, local, and private entities. It is \ncomprised of representatives from the State of Nevada, Clark County, \nthe cities of Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, and Henderson, the Bureau of \nLand Management, the Forest Service, the National Park Service, the \nFish and Wildlife Service, the Southern Nevada Water Authority, the \nRegional Flood Control District, the Clark County School District, and \nrepresentatives of the development and environmental communities.\n  At its inception, the Task Force set two primary goals for itself: \n(1) to establish and maintain a better working relationship between the \nBLM and local governmental planning agencies; and (2) to develop a \n``master plan'' for the Las Vegas Valley that identified those BLM \nlands which should be transferred to private ownership and those which \nshould be retained for public purposes.\n  In the summer of 1995, Senator Reid and I reconvened the Task Force \nto build on the goal of developing a ``master plan'' for the Las Vegas \nValley. We worked closely with the Task Force in our efforts to develop \na legislative proposal that sought to improve the current BLM land \ndisposal policy in the Las Vegas Valley; this proposal eventually \nbecame the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act, which Senator \nReid and I introduced in the Senate on March 19, 1996. Congressman \nEnsign then introduced a companion bill in the House, and I have \nenjoyed working with him in a bipartisan fashion over the last several \nyears to fine tune this legislation and shepherd it through the \nCongress.\n  The Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act is a response to \nperhaps the greatest challenge facing Southern Nevada--the need to \npromote responsible, orderly growth in the Las Vegas Valley while \nprotecting the surrounding environment and enhancing the recreational \nopportunities that exist in Southern Nevada. In the broadest sense, the \nlegislation reflects a partnership between federal, state, and local \nentities to enhance the quality of life in the Las Vegas Valley and \nthroughout the State of Nevada.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, the Las Vegas valley is the \nfastest growing metropolitan area in the country. Since the beginning \nof this decade, nearly five thousand people each month, on average, \nhave chosen to make Las Vegas their  new home. Last year alone, nearly \n20,000 new homes were built in the Las Vegas valley to accommodate this \nexplosive growth. And while the majority of Southern Nevadans have \nwelcomed the benefits of an expanding, robust economy, there is a \nrealization within the community that a long-term, strategic plan must \nbe developed to deal with growth related problems.\n\n  Both State and local elected officials are currently grappling with \ndifferent ideas as to how best to meet the infrastructure needs and \nquality of life expectations of current and future generations of \nsouthern Nevadans. Local officials estimate that new infrastructure \ndevelopment over the next ten years will cost between three and eight \nbillion dollars for such things as school construction and water, sewer \nand transit systems. To give you an idea of the magnitude of the \nsituation, the Clark County School District needs the equivalent of a \nnew elementary school every 30 days for the next five years to keep \npace with the twelve thousand new students entering the school system \nevery year.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is a critical component of Southern \nNevada's long term plan to manage growth in the Las Vegas valley. Each \ntime the BLM transfers land into private ownership it has important \nrepercussions for the local governmental entity that must provide \ninfrastructure and services to that land. The Bureau of Land Management \n(BLM) controls in excess of 20,000 acres of land throughout the Las \nVegas valley. Consequently, unlike most communities, land use planning \ndecisions are not made solely at the local level; the BLM is an \nimportant player in the local land use planning process. This \nlegislation would strengthen the partnership between the BLM and local \ngovernment and improve upon the current land use planning process.\n  The BLM's primary method of disposing of land in the Las Vegas \nvalley, through land exchanges, has been the subject of much attention \nover the past several years. I happen to believe that land exchanges \nserve a valuable public purpose--the Federal Government disposes of \nland it no longer needs in exchange for land that is worthy of public \nownership. In the Las Vegas valley, however, the real estate market is \nsuch that it does not lend itself well to appraisal-driven land \nexchanges. Disagreements between the BLM and exchange proponents over \nappraisal methodology and value determinations are often the cause of \nprotracted delays in the land exchange process. Because of the dynamic \nnature of the real estate market in the Las Vegas valley, any delay in \nthe exchange process can cause the appraisals to become outdated before \nthe transaction is closed.\n  Mr. President, the legislation before us today would make two \nsignificant improvements over the current land exchange process: (1) it \nwould allow local land managers to take a more pro-active role in \nfederal land disposal decisions; and (2) it would institute a \ncompetitive bidding procedure to ensure that the disposal of BLM land \nyields the highest return, or true ``fair market value.'' There are \ncurrently over twenty-five land exchange proposals pending in the BLM's \nLas Vegas office--some are clearly in the public interest, others are \nnot. The vast majority of these proposals are intra-state exchanges, \nmeaning the BLM has the authority to process them without Congressional \naction. This legislation would open the process to allow anyone who \nwishes to bid on BLM land to do so in a competitive sale, and it would \neliminate the need to enter into protracted appraisal negotiations over \nselected BLM land that so often bog down the already cumbersome \nexchange process. The legislation stands for the same proposition as \nthe current land exchange process--the sale of federal land in the Las \nVegas Valley should be used as a means of protecting environmentally \nsensitive land throughout the State of Nevada and of enhancing the use \nof public land recreational areas in Southern Nevada.\n\n[[Page S12736]]\n\n  At the conceptual level, the legislation represents a synthesis of \ntwo previously enacted public land bills that specifically address \npublic land management issues in Southern Nevada--the Santini-Burton \nAct and the Apex land transfer legislation. You may recall that the \nSantini-Burton Act, which was enacted in 1980, authorized the sale of \nBLM land in Las Vegas to fund the acquisition of environmentally \nsensitive land in the Lake Tahoe basin. Our legislation embodies a \nsimilar proposition--the sale of federal land in the Las Vegas Valley \nshould be used as means of protecting environmentally sensitive land \nthroughout the State of Nevada and of enhancing the use of public \nrecreational areas in Southern Nevada. With nearly 5,000 new residents \nmoving into the valley each month, it is imperative that we protect our \nopen spaces around the valley from development and expand recreational \nopportunities for the public in order to maintain the quality of life \nwe have come to expect in Southern Nevada.\n  Also in keeping with Santini-Burton, our legislation recognizes that \nland use planning decisions are best made at the local level, so our \nproposal gives local government an equal voice in deciding when and \nwhere federal land sales should occur in the valley. The map referenced \nin section 4 of the bill would establish a boundary for future BLM land \nsales and exchanges in the Las Vegas Valley, and combined with other \ncomponents of the bill, it would serve as the blueprint to assist us in \ndesigning public land policy for the 21st century. The map essentially \nrepresents the maximum build-out boundary for the valley; it was \ngenerated in close consultation with local governmental planning \nagencies and other members of the Task Force to reflect their vision \nfor future growth and development in the valley. It is important to \nnote that virtually all of the BLM land recommended for sale or \nexchange under this bill has already been identified for disposal by \nthe BLM under the existing Management Framework Plan for the Las Vegas \nValley. In fact, our legislation would reduce the overall amount of \nland available for disposal in the valley.\n  The Apex land transfer legislation, enacted in 1989, transferred over \n20,000 acres of BLM land just outside the Las Vegas Valley to Clark \nCounty for the development of a heavy-use industrial site. When the \nland is improved and eventually sold by Clark County to a private \nentity, the revenue sharing provisions of the act allow Clark County \nrecover the value of the infrastructure improvements it has made to the \nland before providing the federal government with its share of the \nproceeds from the sale. The legislation before us today recognizes the \nsame principle--that the presence or proximity of local governmental \nservices and infrastructure increases the value of federal land. \nConsequently, our legislation would direct a portion of the proceeds of \nfederal land sales to local government to assist with local \ninfrastructure development and to the state for the benefit of the \ngeneral education program.\n\n  Another important component of this legislation that I want to \nhighlight today is involves affordable housing. This legislation will \nalso make BLM land available throughout the State of Nevada to local \npublic housing authorities for the purpose of developing affordable \nhousing. There is currently a tremendous need in Los Vegas and Reno, \nand also in other communities throughout the state, for raw land to \ndevelop affordable housing projects. The BLM will now be able to assist \neach of these communities in meeting this important need.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I want to acknowledge those members of the \nPublic Land Task Force that played such an important role in the \ndevelopment of this legislation. Thanks go to Mike Dwyer of the BLM, \nJim Tallerico and Alan Pinkerton of the Forest Service, Alan O'Neill \nand Bill Dickensen of the Park Service, and Ken Voget of the Fish and \nWildlife Service. Thanks also go to State Senator Dina Titus, Pam \nWilcox of the State Land Use Planning Agency, Rick Holmes, Jeff Harris, \nand Ron Gregory of Clark County, Pat Mulroy of the Las Vegas Valley \nWater District, Robert Baggs of the City of Las Vegas, Steve Baxter of \nthe City of North Las Vegas, John Rinaldi of the City of Henderson, \nGale Fraser of the Flood Control District, Dusty Dickens of the School \nDistrict, Randy Walker and Jacob Snow with the Clark County Department \nof Aviation, and also Bob Broadbent, the former Director of the \nAviation Department. A number of citizens representing the \nenvironmental community provided invaluable assistance; they include \nJeff Van Ee, Lois Sagel, John Hiatt, Bob Maichle, and Steve Hobbs. From \nthe development community thanks go to Robert Lewis, Bob Campbell, \nScott Higginson, Mark Brown, and Jeff Rhoads. And finally, I want to \nthank Marcus Faust for all of his hard work on behalf of Clark County.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to thank two members of my staff, \nBrent Heberlee and Sara Besser, for all of their work related to this \nlegislation.\n  I believe this legislation will make great strides toward improving \npublic land management policy in Southern Nevada, and I look forward to \ncontinue working with all interested parties as this legislation is \nimplemented.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/20/senate-section/article/S12735-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12736-S12737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   LIEUTENANT WILLIAM JAMES LENAGHAN II RETIRES FROM CANTON TOWNSHIP \n                           POLICE DEPARTMENT\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Lieutenant \nWilliam James Lenaghan, II, who is retiring from the Canton Township \nPolice Department in the state of Michigan after 20 years of dedicated \nservice.\n  Lieutenant Lenaghan joined the Canton Township Police Department \nafter serving in various governmental jobs. He started his career in \n1962, when he joined the United States Navy. He was stationed at the \nNaval Air Station in Grosse, IL, where he was assigned as a Fire \nFighter Instructor. After serving in the military, he began his police \nofficer career as a patrolman. He served in this capacity as well as \nSpecial Investigator, Arson Investigator, a member of the Tactical \nResponse Team, Narcotics/Intelligence Team Commander and Instructor for \nfive years in the Michigan cities of West Bloomfield and Redford \nTownship. Next, he became a Special Agent in the United States Treasury \nDepartment Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) where he \nfulfilled the duties of Instructor and Arson Explosives Team Member. As \nthe burden of traveling with three small children at home became too \nmuch, he left his position at the BATF and went to work for Bloomfield \nTownship Police/Tri Cities Fire Department. Here, he continued to \nexpand his experience by becoming Fire Marshal, Tactical Team Officer \nand Arson Team Member. Longing to once again work for the United States \nGovernment, he went to work for the United States Department Bureau of \nCustoms in Detroit, Michigan. Among the many duties that he partook in, \nhe was a Patrol Supervisor and Intelligence Liaison with DEA. In 1978, \nhe began his final expedition as a sergeant for the Canton Township \nPolice Department. Beginning his career as a patrolman, he climbed the \nranks to eventually become Senior Lieutenant. While advancing his \nrecord as a civil servant, he also took on the responsibilities of \nshift commander, Emergency Preparedness Director and Community Policing \nCoordinator.\n  Throughout his career, Lieutenant Lenaghan has received a great deal \nof recognition for his excellent service. One example that did not go \nunrecognized was an event occurring on June 23, 1984. While attending \nto his own responsibilities, he extended much needed aid to help out a \nfellow officer who was struggling with a mentally deranged person. \nResponding to the scene, he assisted by providing physical support \nbringing the subject under control. His actions undoubtedly prevented \nfurther injury to his fellow officer and prevented further danger to \nthe citizens in the area. His decisions ad judgements were certainly a \ncredit to himself and his department. This brave act is only one \nexample of the many citations he has received over his career.\n  With over 30 years' experience in public safety and law enforcement \nat the local and federal levels, Lieutenant Lenaghan has provided \nquality leadership in public safety management. His extensive training \nin police, emergency, fire protection, and supervision enabled him to \nperform multi-level tasks essential to the efficient operation of \npublic safety and police department duties.\n\n[[Page S12737]]\n\n  On behalf of his wife Lois of 31 years, his seven children, his seven \ngrandchildren, the State of Michigan and myself, I would like to take \nthis opportunity to acknowledge his excellent service, dedication, \nwinning personality and commitment to those with whom he worked. Again, \nI extend my warmest congratulations to him on his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/20/senate-section/article/S12736-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JESSIE TRICE\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to salute one of \nFlorida's most dedicated health care service providers. On October 17, \n1998, the Economic Opportunity Family Health Center of Miami both \nhonored and said farewell to their President and CEO, Ms. Jessie Trice. \nMs. Trice's retirement concludes a career of more than thirty years \ndevoted to the improvement of health care services in under privileged \ncommunities throughout both Florida and the nation. She is a true \nhumanitarian, and has been locally and nationally recognized for her \ntireless advocacy on behalf of the affordable and accessible services \nprimary care centers provide vulnerable populations. Because of her \nefforts, these centers have garnered support at all levels of \ngovernment, and they remain a vitally important force in the health \ncare continuum of needy communities.\n  Jessie Trice is both a community leader and policy maker. Her \ndistinguished resume includes positions as Public Health Nurse \nSupervisor and Chief of Nursing Services at the Dade County Department \nof Public Health, Executive Director of the Visiting Nurses \nAssociation, and Assistant County Nursing Director of the Children and \nYouth Project. Her service as the Chairwoman of the Health Choice \nNetwork, Inc., the Screening Committee of the National Association of \nCommunity Health Care Centers, and the Legislative Committee of the \nFlorida Council of Primary Care Centers, as well as her membership on \nthe Board of Directors of the Primary Care Centers, Inc., are a \ntestament to her superb leadership abilities.\n  In 1970, President Richard Nixon recognized Ms. Trice's outstanding \ncontributions and proven expertise in this field by appointing her to \nserve as a delegate to the White House Conference of Children. She was \nnamed Florida Nurse of the Year in both 1972 and 1984, and made \nDistinguished Honoree by the Academy of Black Women in the Health \nProfessions. She has been named to the lists of ``Who's Who'' for \nHealth Care Professionals, American Women, and American Business \nLeaders.\n  Mr. President, the list of those who support and admire the work of \nJessie Trice is long and distinguished. I am grateful for the work she \nhas done on behalf of the state of Florida, and I ask my colleagues to \njoin me in extending my congratulations for her thirty years of service \nin the field of health care services. May her examples of dedication \nand hard work continue to be of inspiration to others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/20/senate-section/article/S12737-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NATIONAL BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

As the Conference Report and Statement of Managers makes \nclear, the recklessness standard and Second Circuit pleading rules \ncontinue in force. Indeed, the managers reiterated that the 1995 \nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act reinforced these standards, \nwhich continue to govern under the 1998 Act, as well. As a member of \nthe Judiciary Committee and serving now as its ranking member, I am \nwell aware that artificially high pleading standards could create \nunwanted and unneeded barriers to legitimate cases. That is not the \nintent of this legislation and should not be its effect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/20/senate-section/article/S12737-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12737-S12738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      COMMENDATION TO THE CURATOR OF THE CAPITOL, BARBARA WOLANIN\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, the Surface Transportation Board \n(STB) was established in 1996 by act of Congress as a quasi-independent \nbody within the Department of Transportation. The STB adjudicates \ndisputes and regulates interstate surface transportation including the \nrestructuring of railroad lines.\n  Although the authorization of the STB expired this year, a \nreauthorization bill has not been scheduled. It was my intention to \noffer an amendment to the reauthorization relating to railroad lines, \nor at least engage in a colloquy with the manager of the bill. However, \nbecause no amendments, or even colloquies, will be agreed to by the \nmanagers of the reauthorization of the STB, I offer these comments for \nthe record.\n  It is my understanding that under section 10901 of title 49 of the \nU.S. Code, relating to the construction and operation of railroad \nlines, the STB is required to issue a certificate authorizing the \nconstruction or extension of a railroad line, unless it finds that such \nactivity is ``inconsistent with the public convenience and necessity.''\n  Because the construction of railroad lines can cause significant \nadverse environmental impacts such as noise, safety and quality of life \non local communities, my amendment would have sought to direct the STB \nto require applicants for the construction or extension of railroad \nlines to use all reasonable means to route them away from population \ncenters in compliance with the above provision.\n  Although I am disappointed that I will not be able to offer my \namendment, I have been assured by the Chairman of the Surface \nTransportation Board that ``regardless of whether or not language is \ninserted into our reauthorization bill, the Board must, and will, \nconsider local interests in assessing the DM construction case.''\n  Mr. President, I appreciate Chairman Morgan's assurances, and I look \nforward to working with the STB on this and other issues in the next \nCongress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/20/senate-section/article/S12738-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE OCEANS ACT OF 1998\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Oceans Act \nof 1998 and several other fisheries issues included in the legislation. \nIn addition to the Oceans Act, this bill approves the Governing \nInternational Fishery Agreements between the government of the United \nStates and the governments of the Republics of Lithuania and Estonia. \nThese agreements will permit large processing vessels from these \ncountries to enter the United States Exclusive Economic Zone and \nprocess fish caught by U.S. fishermen in fisheries where American \nprocessors have insufficient capacity. These privileges have been \nauthorized this year for vessels of Poland and Latvia as well. I \nsupport these agreements because they provide needed markets for \nAmerican fishermen to sell their catch. However, I believe we have \ninadvertently worked an injustice upon a large U.S. vessel, the \nAtlantic Star.\n  The Atlantic Star is a U.S.-owned, U.S. flag fishing vessel that was \nrefitted last year for the herring and mackerel fisheries off the East \nCoast. The vessel had received all necessary permits to enter these \nfisheries. Because the Regional Fishery Management Councils had not \nthen developed plans or plan amendments addressing the entry of large \nvessels into these fisheries, Congress enacted an appropriations rider \nwhich voided the permits for this specific vessels and imposed a one-\nyear moratorium on the entry of the Atlantic Star into any U.S. fishery \nin order to give the Councils time to examine the issue. Meanwhile, the \nvessel has had to leave the United States in order to operate at all.\n  The Councils held hearings and carefully reviewed the issues. \nRecently, the Mid-Atlantic Council recommended size limitations on \nlarge harvesting vessels engaged in the mackerel fishery, but has not \ndecided to extend similar limitations to processing vessels. This would \nallow U.S. flag vessels, such as the Atlantic Star to process fish \ncaught by U.S. fishermen, just as the foreign flag vessels we are \nallowing in today will be able to do. By providing another market for \nU.S. fishermen it would also provide employment and economic benefits \nto the region. Moreover, unlike foreign vessels, U.S. flag processing \nvessels must pay U.S. income taxes, employ Americans and are subject to \nU.S. labor and environmental laws, requirements that benefit all \nAmericans.\n  Unfortunately, during deliberations on the Commerce-Justice-State \nAppropriations Act of 1999, which will be included in the Omnibus \nAppropriations bill for 1999, the Senate accepted language creating a \nblanket exclusion of the Atlantic Star. We are now in the awkward \nposition of authorizing the entry of foreign vessels to process U.S.-\ncaught fish, while excluding our own U.S. processing vessels. \nIronically, if the Atlantic Star were to give up her U.S. flag and \noperate under Lithuanian or Estonian flag, she could come into the \nUnited States and operate as a processing vessel in these U.S. \nfisheries, free from U.S. income tax, employing all foreign crew and \nexempt from other U.S. laws.\n  I support the development of our American fishing industry, while \nensuring the long-term health and management of the resource. The \nprinciples of the Magnuson-Stevens Act--the primary fisheries law of \nthe land--long ago established the priority to be afforded American \nvessels to harvest and process fish inside the U.S. Exclusive Economic \nZone. Excluding U.S. processing vessels in the face of the Council's \ncontrary judgment and while allowing foreign processing vessels into \nthe same fishery does a disservice, not only to American catcher-vessel \nfishermen who seek markets for the fish and to the crew and owners of \nthe Atlantic Star, but to all Americans. Frankly, it is a policy that \nsimply makes no sense. I hope my colleagues will join me in revisiting \nthis issue early in the new Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/20/senate-section/article/S12738-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE DAMAGE OF HURRICANE GEORGES IN PUERTO RICO\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, I strongly supported Senate \npassage of the conference report on S. 1260, the Securities Litigation \nUniform Standards Act of 1998. This bill extends the efforts which we \nundertook in 1995 to curb abusive securities class action\n\n[[Page S12739]]\n\nlitigation when we passed the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act \nof 1995 (PSLRA).\n  This bill makes the standard we adopted in the Reform Act the \nnational standard for securities fraud lawsuits. In particular, the \nReform Act adopted a heightened pleading requirement. That heightened \nuniform pleading standard is the standard applied by the Second Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. At the time we adopted the Reform Act, the Second \nCircuit pleading standard was the highest standard in the country. \nNeither the Managers of Reform Act nor the Managers of this bill (and I \nwas a Manager of both) intended to raise the pleading standard above \nthe Second Circuit standard, as some have suggested. The Statement of \nManagers for this bill makes this clear when it states: ``It was the \nintent of Congress, as was expressly stated during the legislative \ndebate on the PSLRA, and particularly during the debate on overriding \nthe President's veto, that the PSLRA establish a heightened uniform \nfederal standard based upon the pleading standard applied by the Second \nCircuit Court of Appeals.'' This language is substantially identical to \nlanguage contained in the Report on S. 1260 by the Senate Banking \nCommittee, which I chair.\n  The references in the Statement of Managers to the ``legislative \ndebate on the PSLRA, and particularly . . . the debate on overriding \nthe President's veto,'' are statements clarifying Congress's intent to \nadopt the Second Circuit pleading standard. The President vetoed the \nReform Act because he feared that the Reform Act adopted a pleading \nstandard higher than the Second Circuit's. We overrode that veto \nbecause, as the post-veto legislative debate makes clear, the President \nwas wrong. The Reform Act did not adopt a standard higher than the \nSecond Circuit standard; it adopted the Second Circuit standard. And \nthat is the standard that we have adopted for this bill as well.\n  The Statement of Managers also makes explicit that nothing in the \nReform Act or this bill alters the liability standards in securities \nfraud lawsuits. Prior to adoption of the Reform Act, every Federal \ncourt of appeals in the Nation to have considered the issue--ten in \nnumber--concluded that the scienter requirement could be met by proof \nof recklessness. It is clear then that under the national standard we \ncreate by this bill, investors can continue to recover for losses \ncreated by reckless misconduct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/20/senate-section/article/S12738-4", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12739-S12740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE COAST GUARD REAUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Coast \nGuard Reauthorization Act. The House recently passed an amended version \nof the Senate Coast Guard bill. While I support the overall \nreauthorization of the Coast Guard, I want to comment on several \nprovisions contained in the House passed bill.\n  There is currently an administrative process in place to convey \nexcess Federal government property. I believe that legislation which \nmandates the transfer or disposal of Federal property under terms which \ncircumvent the established administrative procedures is inappropriate. \nConsequently, the Senate bill used discretionary language to address \ncertain conveyances requested by individual Senators. However, the \nHouse bill includes mandatory legislative conveyances. In this case \nonly, I am accepting the mandatory language because I am satisfied that \nthe Coast Guard is willing and prepared to make each of these \nparticular conveyances.\n  Another important difference between the House and Senate passed \nbills relates to drug interdiction. I sponsored an amendment in the \nSenate bill which would have established criminal sanctions for the \nknowing failure to obey an order to land an airplane. As a former \npilot, let me clearly state that this provision was not designed to put \nany pilot at risk of an arbitrary or random forced landing. Arbitrary \nor random forced landings are impermissible under the Senate provision. \nAs with all aviation legislation in which I have been involved, safety \nis a top priority. Under current law, if a Federal law enforcement \nofficer who is enforcing drug smuggling or money laundering laws \nwitnesses a person loading tons of cocaine onto a plane in Mexico, sees \nthe plane take off and enter the United States, he may issue an order \nto land, and if the pilot knowingly disobeys that order, there is \ncurrently no criminal penalty associated with such a failure to obey \nthe order.\n  The criminal sanctions contained in the Senate bill would only be \napplied to a person who knowingly disobeyed an order to land issued by \na Federal law enforcement agent who is enforcing drug smuggling or \nmoney laundering laws. The bill would also require the Federal Aviation \nAdministration (FAA) to write regulations defining the means by and \ncircumstances under which it would be appropriate to order an aircraft \nto land. One of the FAA's essential missions is aviation safety. \nAccordingly, the FAA would be required to ensure that any such order is \nclearly communicated in accordance with international standards. \nMoreover, the FAA would be further required to specify when an order to \nland may be issued based on observed conduct, prior information, or \nother circumstances. Therefore, orders to land would have to be \njustifiable, not arbitrary or random. Orders to land would only be \nissued in cases where the authorized federal law enforcement agent has \nobserved conduct or possesses reliable information which provides \nsufficient evidence of a violation of Federal drug smuggling or money \nlaundering laws. If enacted, I would take every step possible to ensure \nthat this provision does not diminish safety in any way.\n\n  Last year, 430 metric tons of cocaine entered the United States from \nMexico. In 1995, drugs cost taxpayers an estimated $109 billion. The \naverage convicted drug smuggler was sentenced to only 4.3 years in \njail, and is expected to serve less than half of that sentence. It is \nincumbent on all of us to fight the war on drugs with every responsible \nand safe measure at our disposal. The provision in the Senate bill \nwould help those men and women who fight the war on drugs at our \nborders by providing an additional penalty for those who knowingly \ndisobey the law.\n  A provision included in both the House and Senate bill relates to the \nInternational Safety Management Code (ISM Code). On July 1, 1998, the \nowners and operators of passenger vessels, tankers and bulk carriers \nwere required to have in place safety management systems which meet the \nrequirements of the ISM Code. On July 1, 2002, all other large cargo \nships and self-propelled mobile offshore drilling units will have to \ncomply. Companies and vessels not ISM Code-certified are not permitted \nto enter U.S. waters.\n  Shipowners required to comply with the ISM Code have raised concerns \nthat the ISM Code may be misused. The IBM code requires a system of \ninternal audits and reporting systems which are intended to encourage \ncompliance with applicable environmental and vessel safety standards. \nHowever, the documents produced as a result of the ISM Code would also \nprovide indications of past non-conformities. Obviously, for this \ninformation to be useful in rectifying environmental and safety \nconcerns, it must be candid and complete. However, this information, \nprepared by shipowners or operators, may be used in enforcement actions \nagainst a shipowner or operator, crews and shoreside personnel by \ngovernmental agencies and may be subject to discovery in civil \nlitigation.\n  The provision in both the Senate and House bills would require the \nSecretary to conduct a study to examine the operation of the ISM Code, \ntaking into account the effectiveness of internal audits and reports. \nAfter completion of the study, the Secretary is required to develop a \npolicy to achieve full compliance with and effective implementation of \nthe ISM Code. Under the provision, the public shall be given the \nopportunity to participate in and comment on the study. In addition, it \nmay be appropriate for the Secretary to form a working group of \naffected private parties to assist in the development of the study and \nthe issuance of the required policy and any resulting legislative \nrecommendations. Any private citizen who is a member of any such \nworking group cannot receive any form of government funds, \nreimbursement or travel expenses for participation in, or while a \nmember of, the working group.\n                                  ____\n\n  (On page S12590 of the Wednesday, October 14, 1998, edition of the \nRecord,\n\n[[Page S12740]]\n\nMr. Reid's statement was erroneously attributed to Mr. Daschle.

Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to the \noutstanding achievements of a Nevadan who has dedicated himself to \nhelping individuals who often lack the means to help themselves. Dana \nTaschner has achieved national recognition as a champion for victims of \ndomestic violence and civil rights abuses. He is a 38 year-old lawyer \nfrom Reno who chooses cases that are relatively small-scale, but \nrepresentative of many of the problems facing Americans. Time and \nagain, Mr. Taschner has had the courage and initiative to take on cases \nthat more prominent firms are hesitant to handle for political or \nmonetary reasons. Dana Taschner truly brings honor to his profession.\n  Mr. Taschner's devotion to fighting oppression recently earned him \nthe American Bar Association's Lawyer of the Year award. He was chosen \nfrom a pool of approximately 245,000 other lawyers in North America, \ncompeting with litigators with much higher profiles and greater wealth. \nIn 1993, Mr. Taschner took on the Los Angeles Police Department and \nsucceeded in forcing them to change their policy regarding police \nofficers who commit domestic violence. In this case, he represented 3 \norphans whose father, an L.A. police officer, murdered their mother and \nthen took his own life. Taschner was able to overcome his own painful \nchildhood memories of domestic abuse and secure the orphans a \nsettlement. He argued that the department should not have returned the \nofficer's gun after he had beaten his wife and threatened to kill her. \nHe also forced the department to treat these matters as criminal cases, \nrather than internal affairs.\n  In this era of cynicism and self-promotion, I believe we must take \nsteps to encourage and reward sincerity. Dana Taschner's unwavering \ndedication to his clients can be seen in his personal relationships \nwith them, relationships that often outlive the outcome of the case. As \nan attorney myself, I have seen firsthand how much our country needs \npeople in my field who care enough about their clients to commit \nthemselves personally, as well as professionally. Many litigators find \nit much easier to take the cases that bring financial gain, rather than \nattempting to help the true victims of injustice.\n  I am proud that his colleagues have lavished accolades upon Mr. \nTaschner, but I believe it is a much greater sign of his success that \nhis clients put their faith in him. Dana Taschner, whose integrity and \nselfless devotion to fairness truly embody our American justice system, \nis a role model for us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/20/senate-section/article/S12740-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 21, 1998\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.
