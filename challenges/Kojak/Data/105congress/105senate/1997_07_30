I have the privilege this morning, with our outstanding \ncolleague, Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, to announce my intention to \nintroduce a piece of legislation, the Internal Revenue Service \nRestructuring Act, that is a product of the National Commission on \nRestructuring the IRS. That commission functioned for approximately 12 \nmonths. The success of the commission is a result of the leadership of \nSenator Kerrey and Congressman Rob Portman of Ohio.\n  As a member of the Commission on Restructuring the IRS, also as a \ncurrent senior member of the IRS Oversight Subcommittee on the Finance \nCommittee, and as the chief Senate sponsor of previous legislation that \nhas been called the Taxpayers Bill of Rights I and the Taxpayers Bill \nof Rights II--and of course I am a taxpayer myself--I have been \ninvolved in several ways for many years in an effort to finally reach \nthis point that we will make substantial changes, hopefully passing \nlegislation, that will make substantial changes in the IRS and how it \nfunctions.\n  Congress is on the verge of a very major shift in power from the \nFederal Government to the people. The recommendations of this \ncommission are a blueprint for the transfer of power. Understandably, \nthere is much anxiety within the Federal Government at this moment. It \nis in anticipation of this loss of power. The anxiety is at the highest \nlevels in the executive branch that I have seen it.\n  The American taxpayers have waited a long time for this to happen. \nThey have suffered through decades of encounters with an agency that \nhas been unaccountable, unresponsive, misleading, arrogant, and even \nabusive. The IRS has been granted enormous powers that at times seems \nto disrespect, even to undermine, civil liberties. The responsibilities \nto our citizens that go along with such power was not exercised by that \nagency.\n  Furthermore, IRS management seemed to have taken a vacation. Billions \nof dollars have been wasted. Performance failures were not met with \ndiscipline. Questionable activities were covered up by secrecy, mostly \nby abusing the authority of what we would all recognize as section \n6103, the so-called privacy provisions. Congressional oversight of the \nIRS has been rendered all but impotent because of absurd 6103 \nrestrictions. These restrictions make the Pentagon's highly secret and \nhighly restrictive Joint Chiefs of Staff vault seem like a Freedom of \nInformation office.\n\n[[Page S8288]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to seize the moment. IRS reform is long overdue \nand is very vital.\n  Mr. President, I want to highlight just a few important issues \nrecommended by the commission.\n  To restore accountability to the taxpayers, the commission has made \nseveral recommendations.\n  The one attracting the greatest attention has been the commission's \nproposal for an independent board to oversee the IRS. The commission's \nbelief is that an independent board will provide an infusion of talent \nfrom the private sector to set appropriate performance measurements and \nreward or discipline managers who either meet or fail to meet these \nperformance measures.\n  In private meetings, the administration appears to be divided on \nanother proposal, the proposal for an independent board to run the IRS. \nBut it appears unfortunate that some who oppose this proposal are doing \nso only because it signifies a monumental power struggle that they \nstand to lose.\n  Treasury officials, who years ago could not find the IRS even if they \nwere standing at the corner of 11th and Constitution, are suddenly in \nfits about losing some control over part of their budget and their \nbureaucracy.\n  They must be reminded that the IRS is one of the few Government \nagencies that has a significant impact on almost every American. The \nAmerican taxpayer deserves a modern IRS that provides taxpayer customer \nservice on a level equal to that provided by private financial \ninstitutions throughout this country.\n  We have seen a lot of promises of reform coming from the Treasury of \nlate, wholly in response to the work of this commission. Treasury \nassures us that IRS reform is their top priority and their best people \nare on it. But if Congress turns its back now on reforming the IRS and \nlistens to the siren song of the Treasury Department, I predict that a \nyear from now Congress will face the justified wrath of the American \ntaxpayer.\n  Treasury officials who are locked in this power struggle trying to \npreserve their bureaucratic empire would do well to remember the quote \nof the first Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, who said, \n``Here, sir, the people govern.'' That is the essence of what this \ncommission would do, return power from the Federal Government to the \npeople of this country.\n  I am also pleased that the commission did not call for the easy \nsolution. The easy solution around Washington is just to give more \nmoney to some Federal bureaucracy. And the plea was made to us: More \nmoney is what is needed at the IRS. One Treasury official privately \nadmitted recently that the IRS never would be serious about embracing \nreform as long as Congress kept throwing money at the bureaucracy.\n\n  Until 2 years ago, the IRS had seen continued increases in its budget \nfor 40 years. This commission uncovered that hundreds of millions of \ntaxpayers' dollars were being wasted. Clearly, the problem at the IRS \nis management, not money.\n  The commission made several findings and recommendations about \nprotecting taxpayers and strengthening taxpayers' rights. I note that \nin the past, the Congress has focused its energies on giving rights to \ntaxpayers who are in dispute with the IRS. The commission's \nrecommendations build on this. We recommend a strengthening of \ntaxpayers' rights in a number of areas, but I think of equal importance \nis the emphasis the commission has placed on protecting taxpayers, that \nis, preventing problems even before they ever happen by emphasizing \nquality of work and customer service by our IRS employees.\n  We all know the story of the small business owner who gets a notice \nfrom the IRS that he owes maybe $2,000 in additional taxes. The \nbusiness owner goes to his accountant, who says he does not owe the IRS \n$2,000, but it is going to cost $5,000 to fight the IRS. So what does \nthe small businessperson do? He pays the $2,000.\n  Why does this happen? Because the IRS puts such little emphasis upon \nquality control and upon taxpayers' rights. The IRS still measures its \nmanagers on dollars assessed, whether or not it is a proper tax owed.\n  Is it any surprise then that when a taxpayer does appeal, the IRS \nloses 72 cents on the dollar? It is wrong that many taxpayers have to \nspend millions of dollars fighting the IRS because there is no quality \ncontrol.\n  I am pleased that the commission also emphasized the need for \ncustomer service. We recommend that taxpayers who are subject to \nexamination or collection efforts or who simply try to contact the IRS \nto resolve a problem are provided a chance to comment on the service \ngiven. While revolutionary to the IRS, this is old hat for many State \ntax collection agencies as well as for business in the private sector. \nBy measuring managers on customer service, we hope to begin to change \nthe culture of the IRS and its employees.\n  Emphasizing quality service and customer service are ways to protect \nthe taxpayers in the first place. It is also a way to measure the \nperformance in an appropriate manner that will hold managers and \nemployees at the IRS accountable for their action.\n  I suggest that the emphasis upon quality service and customer service \nis in keeping with what many saw as a mandate given to the Congress in \n1994--moving power from Government to the people. The reforms suggested \nby the commission certainly emphasize that it is the taxpayer who comes \nfirst and it is serving the taxpayer as a customer that must be a top \npriority at the IRS.\n  Mr. President, I want to just briefly touch on a third point, the \nneed for greater openness at the IRS. The commission found that the IRS \nwas a very closed and insular organization. The commission put forward \na first step to make the IRS more open to the Congress, more \nimportantly, to the press as a policing agency within our process of \nGovernment. If we are going to be at all successful in changing the \nculture of the IRS, a key ingredient must be greater openness at the \norganization.\n  To encourage openness and also ensure accountability, there are three \nareas.\n  One, the IRS must be timely in responding to Freedom of Information \nAct requests.\n  Two, the IRS should not abuse its authority under section 6103 to \ncover up embarrassing information about management mistakes. For \nexample, the commission highlighted that the IRS had abused its 6103 \nauthority to hide from the press the fact that the IRS had provided \nCongress false information.\n  Three, the IRS must maintain and preserve documents. The commission \nitself discovered first hand several times that the former IRS \nhistorian Shelly Davis is right--that the IRS doesn't preserve records. \nMany requests by the commission for documents and data were met with \nthe response that the data no longer existed or the documents could not \nbe found.\n  Addressing these three areas of openness may not be headline \ngrabbing, but my experience has shown me that they will go far in \nbringing accountability at the IRS and changing its culture.\n  My final point is to emphasize the commission's findings on the need \nto simplify the Tax Code. We heard from countless witnesses, as well as \nhundreds of IRS employees and thousands of taxpayers that the \ncomplexity of the code is crippling to IRS management.\n  While I've spent a lot of my time here criticizing IRS, let me make \nclear that the complex code is not the fault of the IRS, it is a burden \nplaced on IRS management by Congress and the White House. It is clear \nthat if we wish to see improvements at the IRS in customer service and \nrelations with taxpayers, steps must be taken to simplify the code.\n  This IRS Restructuring Act will lead to better management of the IRS \nand better customer service in the field. I encourage all of may \ncolleagues to cosponsor it.\n  Mr. President, before I yield the floor, my colleague is responsible \nfor the tremendous product of this commission. It is not me. It is \nbecause he gave it the time it needed, the expert leadership it needed. \nI speak of Senator Kerrey of Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce my intention to \nintroduce the IRS Reform and Restructuring Act of 1997 with the senior \nSenator from Iowa, Senator Grassley, who also was a day-to-day \nparticipant\n\n[[Page S8289]]\n\nin this effort and gave it a great deal of energy and expertise. As one \ncan tell from listening to him, he has offered a tremendous amount of \nenthusiasm and orientation to the taxpayers concerned, the customers \nthemselves, as well as the need to open the IRS up. He cited the \nexample of Shelly Davis, who brought to the attention of the public, \nthe taxpayers, the significant problems the IRS is having and found \nthat, as her reward for doing that, she lost her job. I very much \nappreciate Senator Grassley's leadership. I look forward to working \nwith him on the Finance Committee to try to get this piece of \nlegislation heard and marked up and, hopefully, on to final passage yet \nthis year.\n  This legislation reflects the recommendations of the National \nCommission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service. My co-\nsponsor, Senator Grassley, and I have been the Senate members of the \nNational Commission for the last year, and have been part of the most \nunprecedented review of a government agency that an independent \ncommission has ever conducted. Senator Grassley and I will shortly \nintroduce legislation based on this commission's work. The goal of this \nlegislation is to make the IRS work for the American taxpayer.\n  This legislation is so important because there are twice as many \npeople who pay taxes as vote. Citizens' faith that their government can \nbe fair and efficient is dependent on a well functioning IRS. The days \nof the old-fashioned tax collector are over--the core of this \nlegislation is based on a vision for a new IRS. We believe, in today's \nworld, the job of the IRS is to operate as an efficient financial \nmanagement organization. It is a myth that the bulk of the Federal \nrevenue is generated through heavy enforcement. While the IRS must \nmaintain a strong enforcement presence, its core and the core of the \nFederal revenue stream lie in a revamped, modern organization that can \nassist taxpayers promptly and efficiently, track account information, \nand send out clear notices. There is a breathtaking gap between the \nservice levels of the IRS and those of the private sector.\n  The IRS has a 20-percent error rate for processing paper returns and \nexpends an incredible amount of resources and focus to correct these \nerrors. It captures only 40 percent of the data from returns and is \nstill drowning in a sea of paper. It is typically 18 months before a \nreturn can be matched against 1099s. A private sector business that \ntook on average 18 months to send someone a bill, certainly wouldn't \nstay in business very long.\n  This legislation offers both a realistic goal for those who will take \ncharge of the agency and a credible plan for reaching that goal.\n  We spent the last year studying the problems and solutions for the \nIRS.\n  Clearly, our access to the IRS's operations and employees was \nunprecedented. We spent 12 days in public hearings, interviewed 300 IRS \nemployees in field offices, and interviewed over 500 current and former \nofficials from the IRS, the Treasury Department, congressional \ncommittees that oversee the IRS, and other IRS experts. We also \ncommissioned consulting reports and internal reviews of IRS management, \ngovernance, work force, compliance, and customer service. Finally, we \nheard directly from citizens through town meetings and surveys. During \nall of this work, we continually asked the question: How can we make \nthe IRS serve the American people?\n  There are many visible problems at the IRS that should be noted by \nall colleagues, especially those who take the view that perhaps we \ndon't need to change. All of these visible problems dictate that we act \nand that we change the law.\n  The IRS has a law enforcement mentality, but the vast majority of its \nemployees perform service functions including tracking finances, \nsending out notices, and assisting taxpayers.\n  In addition, the IRS has the general attitude that taxpayers are \nguilty, even though 90 percent of taxpayers are compliant.\n  Taxpayers also have a low opinion of service levels provided by the \nIRS and do not believe the IRS is trying to help make paying taxes \neasier.\n  Next, training is not a priority, and employees do not have the \nskills of their private sector counterparts.\n  Fifth, the IRS uses employee evaluation measures that do not \nencourage employees to provide quality service to taxpayers.\n  Next, the IRS management and governance structure makes strategic \nplanning impossible and has caused a massive failure of the IRS' $3.4 \nbillion computer modernization program.\n  Further, IRS computer systems were developed during the 1960's and \n1970's and lack the capability to provide taxpayers with quality \nservice.\n  Wasteful inefficiencies and high error rates exist in the processing \nof paper forms.\n  The Treasury Department has basically left the IRS to its own \ndevices, leaving a vacuum in executive branch oversight of the agency.\n  Congressional oversight of IRS is scattered and can send confusing \nsignals to IRS that can be manipulated by the IRS to avoid \naccountability.\n  Last, complexity and constant changing of the tax code is a major \nobstacle that intensifies all of these problems.\n  We heard from witnesses who estimate that the American taxpayers \nspend nearly $200 billion a year just to comply with the Tax Code. \nComplexity is a problem, not only in giving customer service, but as \nfar as a drain on the U.S. economy.\n  A key problem identified by the Commission was a lack of a coherent, \naccountable structure to implement a long-term vision and goals. At the \ntop levels of the IRS and at Treasury there are murky lines of \naccountability, a lack of necessary expertise to operate in the new \ninformation age, and no people of authority with significant tenure to \nget the job done. The officials at the Treasury Department have \nexpertise in tax law, but do not have the expertise in areas of \ncustomer service, technology, and management to oversee the IRS. Worse, \nthey are not around long enough to ensure focus on multi-year projects \nlike the tax system modernization [TSM] or changing the culture of the \nagency to be more responsive to taxpayers.\n\n  Additionally, Treasury does not coordinate its own oversight: The \nCommissioner of the IRS must deal with various assistant secretaries on \nbudget, operations, computers, and others. At the end of the day, the \nIRS Commissioner really reports to the Deputy Secretary who also \nmanages 11 other agencies--not to mention the economy. The recently \nretired Commissioner of the IRS, Margaret Richardson, told us that she \nreported to three different Deputy Secretarys during her 4-year tenure \nas IRS Commissioner. Aware of these glaring problems, the Restructuring \nCommission began developing ideas for a new governance structure. Our \ncriteria for success were: First, clear accountability, second, \nexpertise in running a modern customer-oriented organization, and \nthird, continuity.\n  To provide for accountability, expertise, and continuity the \nlegislation we will introduce will include:\n  First, an Internal Revenue Service Oversight Board, appointed by the \nPresident for staggered 5-year terms. The board will: Approve the \nmission, objectives, and annual strategic plans of the IRS; oversee the \nIRS management; have significant tenure to force change throughout the \norganization; and have unique public and private sector expertise in \nmanaging large service organizations.\n  Second, the Commissioner will be appointed for a 5-year term, so he \nor she will be around long enough to achieve real change.\n  Third, the Commissioner will be given greater flexibility to hire or \nfire his or her own team of executives, who will bring new expertise \ninto the IRS. While the board will keep an eye on long-range strategic \nissues, the Commissioner will run the organization and be given greater \nauthority to do so.\n  Fourth, congressional oversight will be coordinated among the \nauthorizing committees, the appropriating committees, and the \nGovernment oversight committees. Our legislation codifies coordinated \noversight, stating that committee leaders, majority and minority, meet \nregularly to ensure that the IRS receives clear guidance from Congress, \nand that Congress is given the proper information to oversee the IRS.\n  This legislation draws clear lines of accountability between tax \npolicy and tax administration, leaving all tax policy matters to the \nSecretary of the\n\n[[Page S8290]]\n\nTreasury. The legislation makes the Secretary of the Treasury a member \nof this new board, recognizing the link between tax policy and tax \nadministration. Additionally, the Secretary of the Treasury would \ncontinue to have final say over the IRS budget before it is sent to \nCongress. Under this legislation, the board would send Congress a copy \nof their budget at the same time they send it to the Secretary, giving \nCongress an independent view of how much money to appropriate. In \nshort, our new structure will bring heightened accountability to the \nIRS and tax administration.\n  Mr. President, the American people know that the status quo is no \nlonger tolerable and that the IRS needs fixing; $3.4 billion was wasted \non a failed modernization project. IRS operations are antiquated and \noutdated, and taxpayers--close to 90 percent of whom voluntarily pay \ntheir taxes--are generally, and unfairly, treated as if they are guilty \nof something when they contact the IRS.\n  The IRS's problems are rooted in the lack of strategic vision and \nfocus, measures that do not encourage employees to treat taxpayers \nwell, operational units that do not communicate with each other, and a \nsystemic lack of expertise and continuity in management and governance. \nThe legislation Senator Grassley and I will introduce will put the IRS \non the road to recovery with a reasoned, comprehensive approach to \nfixing these problems. When implemented into law, I am confident the \nresult will be: Restored public confidence in the IRS; increased focus \non customer service; cohesive oversight and governance; efficiency \ngains in IRS operations; and innovative compliance and customer service \nprograms.\n  We hope for expedited action on our legislation so that the American \npeople have the IRS they expect and deserve. Our work to restructure \nthe IRS will go a long way toward restoring taxpayers' faith not only \nin our tax system, but in our Government, as well.\n  Mr. President, again, I congratulate and applaud and appreciate the \ndedicated service and expertise and leadership of the distinguished \nSenator from Iowa, Senator Grassley.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my colleagues and I have come to the floor \nthis morning to briefly discuss the issue of campaign finance reform. \nIt is our hope that during the August recess, discussions will progress \nand a plan developed to bring campaign finance reform before the Senate \nno later than the end of September.\n  Almost daily I have approached the majority leader and told him that \nwe must move forward on campaign finance reform. The leader has been \nexceedingly gracious and shown much patience in listening to my \nmissives. I want to thank the majority leader for his time and hope \nthat soon, we can come to an agreement for floor time to debate \ncampaign finance reform.\n  But I also understand that the leader is under great pressure to move \nmany bills, and may feel constrained to commit at this time. I \nunderstand that situation. The leader has to deal with the wishes of 99 \nother Senators. However, my colleagues and I feel compelled to put the \nSenate on notice that the time to act on this matter is rapidly \nexpiring.\n  We believe that we must begin the debate on campaign finance reform \nno later than the end of September, and therefore, if we cannot come to \nsome agreement to bring the bill up freestanding, with an up or down \nvote on the bill itself, we will feel compelled to bring the bill to \nthe floor by offering it as an amendment to some unrelated measure.\n  This is not an approach we relish. But we realize that we may have no \nother choice.\n  Delay no longer serves any purpose. Since before the last election, \ntalk of campaign finance reform has dominated the American \nconversation. The public has a right to have this issue debated. \nMembers have recognized this fact, and as proof of that recognition, \nhave introduced over 70 campaign finance bills.\n  I recognize that many of those bills have laudable features. I want \nto sit down and work with the sponsors of those bills. And I further \nrecognize that McCain-Feingold is far from perfect. As I have stated on \nnumerous occasions, we have only two fundamental principles that are \nnonnegotiable:\n\n  First, we must seek to level the playing field between challengers \nand incumbents; and\n  Second, we must seek to lessen the influence of money in elections.\n  All else is negotiable.\n  Some of our colleagues in the House have begun discussing a scaled-\ndown version of McCain-Feingold. I welcome those talks and want to \nstate that if that is what is necessary to change our electoral system, \nthen let's move in that direction.\n  Fundamentally changing the electoral system in order to restore the \nfaith of the American people in our Democratic Government is our goal. \nWe are open to compromise and negotiation. But we must act soon. It is \nour duty.\n  Last week the Economist published an editorial entitled ``The Fear of \nForeign Cash.'' Although the title is slightly misleading, I would like \nto quote from this editorial.\n\n       The answer, at least on the strength of the hearings so \n     far, is straightforward: foreign money is worse only because \n     it is not American. And two meanings can be read into that. \n     One is xenophobia: that century-old American fear of little \n     yellow mercenary men, scurrying round now at the behest of a \n     newly menacing power on the world stage. And the second \n     meaning is that foreign money provides a convenient \n     distraction. While it is being comprehensively investigated, \n     with CIA men parked behind screens and giant blow-up charts \n     of the destinations of Mr. Huang's telephone calls, \n     politicians can be left free to attend their dinners, go to \n     their fund-raisers, and continue in all the ways they know \n     best to let their consciences and their legislative proposals \n     be shaped, like warm wax, by the promise of a cheque.\n       While Mr. Thompson's hearings have been getting into gear, \n     in other parts of Congress some 57 separate bills to reform \n     campaign finance have been dying for lack of interest. Should \n     anyone really care how good clean American money flows \n     through the machine of American democracy? Well, yes, \n     gentlemen: someone should.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this entire editorial be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        The Fear of Foreign Cash\n\n       For two drowsy weeks, Senator Fred Thompson's committee has \n     been conducting hearings into campaign-finance abuses during \n     America's recent election. As a result, Americans now know \n     that there was a Chinese plot to influence the 1996 campaign, \n     though not who masterminded it or how wide it went. They know \n     that John Huang, who once worked for an Indonesian bank with \n     ties to the Chinese government, was given a post at the \n     Commerce Department because he was such a good fund-raiser \n     for the Democrats; but they do not know quite what use he \n     made of his office and his fax machine. They are aware that \n     Bill Clinton appreciated Mr. Huang and his fellow-fund-\n     raiser, Charlie Trie, at whose Chinese restaurant in Little \n     Rock Mr. Clinton often packed away the dim sum. But they are \n     not yet clear what orders, if any, came down from the White \n     House, beyond the sort that could be filled in small \n     aluminium trays.\n       The largest question to be answered, however, is a simpler \n     one. It is this: why is foreign money, applied to elections, \n     so much worse than the American sort? When the Democratic \n     National Committee learned that this money was ``illegal, \n     inappropriate or suspect'', officials instantly returned it, \n     as if it would corrode their hands. Yet how much was involved \n     here? A mere $2.8m, out of $2 billion spent by both parties \n     on campaigning. Of that total, $250m was ``soft'' money, \n     subject to no limits, sent in by unions and corporations for \n     the nebulous purpose of ``party-building''. Mr. Thompson's \n     committee has undertaken to look into soft money later; but, \n     meanwhile, how much of it has been returned as suspect? None, \n     of course.\n\n\n                      Perils, yellow and otherwise\n\n       Democrats and Republicans alike will insist that the cases \n     are not the same. Foreign contributions are illegal for good \n     reason: outside powers may well be trying to weaken America, \n     steal its secrets, compromise its security. Yet the supposed \n     Chinese plot appears to have had nothing to do with national \n     secrets, nor with persuading America to treat it kindly over \n     trade. China just seems to have wanted to make friends in \n     high places, as all lobbyists do; and it may well wonder why \n     election money was so evil, when American congressmen have \n     happily, and legally, availed themselves of $400,000-\n\n[[Page S8291]]\n\n     worth of free trips to China over the past 18 months.\n       Is democracy hurt by this? Possibly; but no more than when \n     a party or politician accepts money from any source with an \n     interest to promote. Suppose that the Chinese government gave \n     money in the hope of winning concessions in Asia-Pacific \n     trade. Is this worse than the trade distortions and higher \n     domestic prices already caused by years of election \n     contributions from America's own sugar and peanut farmers? Or \n     perhaps China thought an election contribution would \n     encourage a blind eye to its abuses of human rights. Is this \n     worse than the contributions that have won, for years, \n     indulgent treatment for America's cigarette companies?\n       The answer, at least on the strength of the hearings so \n     far, is straightforward: foreign money is worse only because \n     it is not American. And two meanings can be read into that. \n     One is xenophobia: that century-old American fear of little \n     yellow mercenary men, scurrying round now at the behest of a \n     newly menacing power on the world stage. And the second \n     meaning is that foreign money provides a convenient \n     distraction. While it is being comprehensively investigated, \n     with CIA men parked behind screens and giant blow-up charts \n     of the destinations of Mr. Huang's telephone calls, \n     politicians can be left free to attend their dinners, go to \n     their fund-raisers, and continue in all the ways they know \n     best to let their consciences and their legislative proposals \n     be shaped, like warm wax, by the promise of a cheque.\n       While Mr. Thompson's hearings have been getting into gear, \n     in other parts of Congress some 57 separate bills to reform \n     campaign finance have been dying for lack of interest. Should \n     anyone really care how good clean American money flows \n     through the machine of American democracy? Well, yes, \n     gentlemen: someone should.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Economist is exactly right. ``Should \nanyone really care how good clean American money flows through the \nmachine of American democracy? Well, yes, gentlemen, someone should.''\n  Yes, we should and must. And we will have the opportunity to \ndemonstrate our understanding of this issue when we return from recess.\n  Finally, I would like to thank my friend, Russ Feingold, my friend \nSenator Collins, Senator Cleland, and so many others who have been \ninvolved in this issue and have made this a bipartisan issue, and one \nthat I think deserves the attention of the Senate, and I think clearly \ndeserves an answer for the American people.\n  Mr. President, I thank my friend, Senator Feingold.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I require.\n  Mr. President, it is truly a pleasure to be here on the floor with my \nfriend and colleague and fellow campaign finance reformer from Arizona, \nthe senior Senator, Mr. McCain, as well as our other colleagues who \njoin with us today, including the junior Senator from Maine, Senator \nCollins, and shortly expected the senior Senator from Michigan, Mr. \nLevin, and, of course, my good friend, the junior Senator from Georgia, \nMr. Cleland.\n  We are all among a group of 33 Members of this body who have already \ncosponsored the McCain-Feingold legislation. As the Senator from \nArizona said, we are here today to announce that we will be seeking \nconsideration of bipartisan campaign finance reform legislation during \nthe month of September.\n  We will continue our discussions, as the Senator from Arizona \nindicated, with the majority leader. And I am hopeful that we will be \nable to reach a compromise that will allow us to have an open public \ndebate on this issue, and allow all Senators the opportunity to \nparticipate in offering amendments to our proposal.\n  However, as the Senator from Arizona has just indicated, if such an \nagreement with the majority leader cannot be reached, we are prepared \nto use other legislative proposals as a vehicle for campaign finance \nreform. That is not our preference. But we are committed to having a \ndiscussion of this issue and making sure there are votes on campaign \nfinance reform during the month of September.\n  We have said for some time now--and the Senator from Arizona just \nreiterated--that our bipartisan proposal is far from perfect. We have \nrepeatedly told Senators on both sides of the aisle that we are open to \nmaking changes for modifications to this package. We do have some \nfundamental issues, however, that we will not waiver on.\n  First, this proposal will ban soft money. The days when corporations, \nlabor unions, and wealthy individuals could make unlimited \ncontributions to the national parties will be over.\n  Second, the proposal must try to level the playing field between \nincumbents and challengers. Currently, we have a system that provides \nincumbent Senators with a reelection rate of 90 to 95 percent and \nprovides virtually no assistance to legitimate challengers who are \nessentially being shut out of the democratic process.\n  We must provide an opportunity for candidates, particularly \nunderfunded challengers taking on well-entrenched incumbents, to run a \ncompetitive campaign without having to raise and spend millions of \ndollars.\n  Finally, Mr. President, whatever package of reforms we consider and \nwhatever modifications we are willing to make, those reforms must be \nbalanced and bipartisan.\n  I am pleased at this point, Mr. President, to insert into the Record \na statement today from the President of the United States, William J. \nClinton, with regard to the campaign finance reform legislation.\n  Mr. President, I would now like to read from the President's \nstatement, which he asked us to present as a part of this presentation.\n  The President says:\n\n       In my State-of-the-Union Address, I called on Congress to \n     enact bipartisan campaign finance reform legislation. I said \n     that delay could be the death of reform, and urged Congress \n     to move forward quickly. I strongly support the decision by \n     Senators McCain and Feingold to bring campaign finance reform \n     legislation to the floor of Congress in September for a vote.\n       The problem with the role of money in presidential and \n     congressional elections are plain. Since the campaign finance \n     laws were last overhauled two and a half decades ago, the \n     system has been overwhelmed by a flood of campaign cash. Both \n     political parties are now engaged in an ever-escalating arms \n     race for campaign funds. The consequences for our political \n     system are clear; there is too much money in politics, and it \n     takes too much time to raise.\n       To make sure that ordinary citizens have the loudest voice \n     in our democracy, we must act to change the campaign finance \n     laws. This year, I have asked the FEC to ban so called ``soft \n     money'' to parties; I have asked the Federal Communications \n     Commission to require broadcasters to provide free TV time to \n     candidates; and the Justice Department has indicated it will \n     defend spending limits in the courts. But these steps, \n     however important, are no substitute for legislation. America \n     needs--and the American people demand--strong, comprehensive \n     campaign finance reform legislation. As the new century \n     approaches, we have an opportunity and an obligation to \n     restore the trust of the American people in their politics--\n     and this is our chance to do it.\n       For years, the special interests and their allies have \n     blocked reform. This year, those who seek to continue special \n     interest influence as usual will filibuster again. But this \n     year, we have an opportunity to come together across party \n     lines to act and pass reform that cleans up the campaign \n     finance system. September will be the time for members of the \n     Senate to stand up and be counted for reform. I will do what \n     I can to see to it that 1997 is finally the year that it is \n     achieved.\n  Mr. President, we welcome the support and enthusiasm of the President \nof the United States for our effort.\n  The Senators who are here on the floor today have joined together \nacross party and ideological lines to produce a compromise package that \nI like to refer to as moderate, mutual disarmament.\n  We have already heard the top 10 excuses for why we can't pass \ncampaign finance reform. And frankly, I am amazed at some of the absurd \narguments we have heard from opponents of reform.\n  We have been told, ridiculously enough, that there is not enough \nmoney flowing through our campaign system. That argument, incidently, \nis greeted with laughter every time I tell my constituents in Wisconsin \nthat there are some folks in Washington who actually believe we need \nmore money in our political system.\n  We have been told that our proposal is somehow inconsistent with the \nfirst amendment--a giant red herring given that a number of the leading \nnonpartisan, first amendment scholars in the country, including the \nnonpartisan Congressional Research Service, have all said otherwise.\n  We have been told that reform is not possible without a \nconstitutional amendment, an argument all too familiar to those of us \nwho were told that we could not have a balanced budget without a \nconstitutional amendment.\n\n[[Page S8292]]\n\n  We have been told that the Senate does not have enough courage to \npass meaningful reform and that, once again, we should delegate \nresponsibility to some sort of commission.\n  We have been told by some that this bill goes too far, and \ninterestingly, by others that it does not go far enough. Some might \npoint to that as the working definition of a moderate proposal.\n  We have been told that the American people do not care about this \nissue, despite numerous public opinion polls demonstrating 80 to 90 \npercent of the American people in support of these reforms.\n  We have been told that this issue requires further study, despite 29 \nsets of hearings, 76 CRS reports and 522 different witnesses testifying \non this issue over the last decade.\n  We have been told that the outrageous fundraising practices that we \nwitnessed in the last election and which have spawned congressional \ninvestigations, a Justice Department investigation, an FBI \ninvestigation, and a CIA investigation, and have led to charges of \nespionage, corruption and undue influence were ``a healthy sign of a \nvibrant democracy.''\n  In short Mr. President, we have heard more phony excuses than are \nheard by a high school vice-principal's office.\n  Fortunately, no one is buying these excuses. Not the Senators who are \nstanding here on the floor today and certainly not the American people.\n  I look forward to having a public discussion during the month of \nSeptember about the role of money in our political system. And I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in \npassing meaningful, bipartisan campaign finance reform in 1997.\n  Mr. President, I want to conclude, as the Senator from Arizona did, \nby just mentioning the folks that are here on the floor with us today. \nObviously, I have already talked about my great feelings about working \nwith Senator McCain on this, but I know that the other three Senators \nwe are going to hear from--Senator Collins, Senator Levin, and Senator \nCleland--who are all members of the Governmental Affairs Committee, are \nintimately aware of what is wrong with our system. They have taken the \ntime to come down here today to put forth a message, as Senator Cleland \nhas done so well at the hearings. He has asked a number of witnesses, \n``Would these things have happened had McCain-Feingold been enacted?'' \nThe answer in every case was, ``No.''\n  So that is the challenge before us.\n  Mr. President, at this point I would like to yield such time as she \nrequires to the Senator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I am delighted to join my colleagues, particularly \nSenator McCain and Senator Feingold, in announcing our intent to bring \nbipartisan campaign finance reform legislation to a vote in September. \nAt the State level, Maine has led the Nation on this issue, and the \npeople of my State think the time has come for Congress to step up to \nthe plate and enact meaningful reform.\n  As a member of the Governmental Affairs Committee, I have spent the \npast month listening to testimony about illegal campaign contributions. \nIt is not a pretty picture. In my opening statement at the hearings, I \nobserved that our political system suffers from a mania for money. If \nanything, the hearings have demonstrated that I underestimated just how \nintense that mania is.\n  Mr. President, we should be embarrassed by how our political system \nis viewed. Listen to the judgment rendered by Johnny Chung, one of the \nindividuals alleged to have laundered foreign political contributions. \n``I see the White House is like a subway--you have to put in coins to \nopen the gates.'' What Mr. Chung did not say, because he did not have \nto say it, is that the vast majority of hard-working and honest \nAmericans do not have enough coins to make the gates open.\n  This is not a partisan observation. All of us in this Chamber--\nRepublicans and Democrats alike--should be embarrassed at the \nperception that the leaders of the greatest Nation on earth are \naccessible only to those with enough coins.\n  Mr. President, we should be embarrassed that the American people are \nconvinced that we will never reform the system, that we will never put \nthe integrity of our political system ahead of our self-interests.\n\n  Some argue that the relative quiet of the people means they are \nsatisfied with the status quo, but that is wrong. In this case, silence \nsends a stronger message of disapproval than the loudest shouts of \nprotest. The message that it sends is that people have given up on us. \nLook at the reform efforts at the State level, and you will see that it \nis not that the voters do not believe in campaign finance reform. It is \nthat they do not believe in the U.S. Senate.\n  We all know that if left untreated, the disease that afflicts our \npolitical system will only grow worse. With the high cost of television \nads, the money frenzy can only grow. Indeed, the television ad race has \nbecome the political counterpart of the nuclear arms race characterized \nby the same insecure feeling that one can never have enough.\n  None of us involved in this effort has all of the answers. We \nrecognize that reforming our campaign finance laws raises difficult \nissues of public policy and thorny issues of constitutional law. Our \napproach is not set in stone. We are open to other ideas. We are open \nto compromise, but we are not open to letting the Senate duck this \nissue. Like my colleagues, I look forward to working with the \nleadership of this body to bring this matter to a vote. We have an \nobligation to the American people to ensure that such a vote comes \nabout, and we are determined to make that happen in September.\n  Mr. President, the American dream has undergone some changes, not all \nof which are for the better. We are now living in a country in which \nany millionaire can dream of growing up to be a United States Senator. \nThat may be an acceptable state of affairs during a time of peace and \nprosperity, when the Government does not need to call upon the people \nof this Nation to make sacrifices. But the unhealthy mix between money \nand politics may produce far more worrisome consequences during periods \nwhen America is tested. As with all reforms, the time to make them is \nbefore they are urgently needed.\n  I look forward to a vigorous debate and vote on this issue in \nSeptember. I thank my colleagues for working with me on this important \nissue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am extremely grateful for the work of \nSenator Collins on this issue.\n  I now yield to the Senator from Michigan such time as he may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Wisconsin and \ncongratulate the great Senators from Arizona and Wisconsin for their \nsteadfast leadership on this issue. It is a privilege to join their \ncause and to join with others, Senator Collins and Senator Cleland, in \nthe Chamber this morning to speak on behalf of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I have in my hand here a copy of the current Federal \ncampaign finance law. It says that individuals cannot contribute more \nthan $1,000 to any candidate or political committee with respect to any \nelection for Federal office. It says corporations and unions cannot \ncontribute at all. In Presidential campaigns you are supposed to be \nfinanced with public funds.\n  That is the law on the books today. So how is it that we hear about \ncontributions of hundreds of thousands of dollars from individuals, \ncorporations and unions? Why do Presidents and Presidential candidates \nspend long hours fundraising for hundreds of thousands of dollars? How \nis it possible, we ask? We thought there was a law.\n  Well, there is, but in the race to compete and win elections, \ncandidates and parties have found a way around the law, and that way is \nwhat we refer to as soft money. It is called soft money as opposed to \nhard money, which is the money regulated by the campaign finance laws, \nbecause soft money is easier to raise. You can get $500,000, say, from \njust one corporation or individual. You do not have to go to 500 \ndifferent people and raise $1,000 each as you do with hard money. You \ncan find one person who is rich enough and willing enough to pay a \nhalf-million dollars or more and you can then accept that contribution.\n\n[[Page S8293]]\n\n  There is another part in current law which says that if you spend \nmoney in an election in support of a candidate or opposed to a \ncandidate, you have to spend only money that is raised the hard way, \nfollowing the limits. But here is a TV ad, and there are dozens like \nthis one, and here we have a transcript of this TV ad, and anyone who \nwould see this ad would think that it was opposed to a particular \ncandidate. But this ad was produced and aired not with hard money, as \nthe law requires, but with soft money, and here it is. It reads this \nway:\n\n       Who is Bill Yellowtail? He preaches family values but he \n     takes a swing at his wife. Yellowtail's explanation. He only \n     slapped her, but her nose was not broken. He talks law and \n     order but is himself a convicted criminal. And though he \n     talks about protecting children, Yellowtail failed to make \n     his own child support payments, then voted against child \n     support enforcement. Call Bill Yellowtail and tell him you \n     don't approve of his wrongful behavior.\n\n  Now, there is no doubt that that ad, which was bought and paid for by \nan organization called Citizens for Reform, was designed to defeat Bill \nYellowtail, but because it doesn't use any of the seven so-called magic \nphrases like ``vote against'' or ``defeat,'' it is not governed by our \ncampaign finance laws.\n  Why? Because it is viewed as an issue ad, at least up until now, and \nnot a candidate ad, and it can be paid for with soft money. Now, nobody \nreally believes that fiction, but that is what the law currently \nallows.\n  So, Mr. President, you have the vicious combination under the current \ncampaign system and outside of the control of our campaign finance laws \nof contributions of hundreds of thousands of dollars from one \nindividual or corporation funding campaign ads that go directly for or \nagainst a particular candidate. The net result is that the exceptions \nto our campaign finance laws have swallowed up the rules. Our campaign \nfinance laws are a sham and a shambles. Now we face the daunting task \nof trying to plug those loopholes, to make the law whole again and in \nmaking it whole to make it effective.\n  I am pleased to be here today to announce our intention, Mr. \nPresident, to get the Senate, one way or another, to take up the \nMcCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill in September. We are \nhopeful, of course, that we can work out an agreement with the majority \nleader to allow us to have an up-down vote on the bill. But if that \ncannot be arranged, we are committed to getting this legislation before \nthe Senate in spite of the absence of such an agreement. It is not our \npreferred way to approach this legislation, but it may be the only way \nwe can get it before the Senate. I hope not, but it may prove to be the \nonly way.\n  Some will argue that we should first complete the campaign \nfundraising investigation into the 1996 elections currently being \nconducted by the Governmental Affairs Committee. But they know that we \ndo not need more evidence to prove this crime. And the current state of \nour campaign finance system is a crime. What is already unlawful, of \ncourse, must be prosecuted, but too much of what is currently lawful \nshould be unlawful. The McCain-Feingold bill is a comprehensive \nbipartisan bill supported by over a majority of this Senate. The \nPresident has said in a letter read by Senator Feingold that he \nwelcomes the opportunity to sign it. There is strong support in the \nHouse of Representatives. We are determined to bring this bill to the \nfloor of the Senate and to keep it before the Senate until we get an \nup-down vote, and we are determined to do that in September.\n  The Fourth of July was supposed to be the date by which this \nlegislation was to be considered. This year July comes in September, \nand we will act to get this legislation considered in an up-down vote \nby the Senate in September.\n  Again, I commend the leaders of this effort. It is going to take \ngreat strength and great energy to overcome the opposition, but we are \ndetermined to use our full energies to do just that.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Presiding Officer will advise the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin he has 4 minutes and 40 seconds remaining on his time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. We are delighted to have the persistence and expertise \nof the Senator from Michigan on this effort.\n  I yield all but 30 seconds to my friend from Georgia.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, hearing the discussion in this Chamber \ntoday gets my juices flowing. I appreciate the comments of everyone \nhere. It reminds me that back in my great State of Georgia there is a \nlittle town called Waycross that has adopted as its mascot a little \ncomic strip character called Pogo. Pogo was a little possum that lived \non the edge of the Okefenokee Swamp, and he was famous for one \nstatement, which is, ``We have met the enemy and he is us.''\n  There is no question, Mr. President, that the enemy of campaign \nfinance reform is us, and yet the friends of campaign finance reform \nare us. We have to resolve this issue. It is not going to be left up to \nanyone else, any one other body. We have to do it and no one else is \ngoing to do it.\n  I am extremely pleased to join with my distinguished colleagues from \nArizona and Wisconsin and Maine and Michigan to discuss this critical \nissue that I think is one of the most important issues we face \ncertainly this year.\n  Now, my friends, Senators McCain and Feingold, have indicated we will \nbe voting on this issue in this Chamber this September. I certainly \nhope so. Three of us here also have the distinction, and I guess it is \nan honor, of serving on the Governmental Affairs Committee which is \ninvestigating a series of illegal and improper activities in connection \nwith the Federal elections of 1996. All three of us--myself, Senator \nCollins, and Senator Levin--are recently veterans of the campaign \nfinance wars, each of us having won election or reelection in the 1996 \nelections. I think that is one of the reasons why we have a burning \ndesire to change the very system under which we ran.\n\n  While the Governmental Affairs Committee has more work to do in \nuncovering the full story of the 1996 elections, it is already \nabundantly clear that the atrocious current system of Federal campaign \nfinance laws has made our country vulnerable to efforts by foreign as \nwell as domestic sources to improperly influence our electoral process. \nAs Georgia's secretary of state and certainly as a U.S. Senator, I have \nbeen aware for a long time of the domestic abuses of big money and \nspecial interests, and that concern has helped fuel my longstanding \ninterest in significant campaign finance reform.\n  Mr. President, these Governmental Affairs proceedings have been an \neye-opener for me. They have indicated to me the incredible \nvulnerability that this country and our political system experience in \nterms of foreign special interests. As the preceding speakers have \nindicated, we as a group are not wedded to any one plan. We will be \nworking with other Senators to come up with the best legislation we can \npossibly put together. But we will insist that the final legislative \nlanguage we will support and force a vote on in September be truly \nbipartisan, must be real reform and not a sham, and in my view to \nconstitute real reform at a minimum we must reduce the role of big \nmoney in our political process, help level the playing field for less-\nfinanced candidates and must ban soft money altogether at the Federal \nlevel. One of the unifying threads of the Governmental Affairs \ninvestigation to date has been the very concentration virtually of all \nthe fundraising abuses in both parties in the realm of soft money.\n  So I look forward to taking our case back home to our constituents in \nAugust and in forging a bipartisan compromise which does incorporate \nthe necessary elements of real reform. We are not going to terminate \nour effort. We intend to terminate these abuses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for an excellent \npresentation this morning. We are very much looking forward to \nSeptember.\n  Let me include, because know various Senators have to go to \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, one last anecdote. The chairman of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, Senator Thompson, the other day heard \nreference to the McCain-Feingold bill, and he corrected it saying it's \nactually\n\n[[Page S8294]]\n\nbeen called the McCain-Feingold-Thompson bill. I think that is a good \nsign for the future of our legislation.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/30/senate-section/article/S8290-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE PLACED ON CALENDAR--S. 1085\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

As I stated last week, my consent to \nmodifications was with the stipulation that any changes would not \nundermine the International Dolphin Conservation Program by causing the \nsignatory nations to dissolve the agreement.\n  With the assurances we have received from the President's National \nSecurity Adviser that these changes meet that stipulation, I support \nstrongly the managers' amendment.\n  Again, Mr. President, this legislation is supported by Greenpeace, \nthe National Wildlife Federation, the World Wild Life Fund, the \nEnvironmental Defense Fund and the Center for Marine Conservation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at this time \nletters from these organizations and from the President endorsing this \nlegislation.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 17, 1997.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, \n         U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain, The Center for Marine Conservation, \n     Environmental Defense Fund, Greenpeace, National Wildlife \n     Federation and the World Wildlife Fund, representing more \n     than 10 million supporters in the United States strongly \n     support passage of S. 39, The International Dolphin \n     Conservation Program Act. We urge you to support S. 39, seek \n     prompt consideration of the bill by the full Senate, and to \n     oppose any procedural moves which would delay consideration \n     of the bill.\n       Not only does the bill strengthen the Marine Mammal \n     Protection Act, protection for dolphins in the Eastern \n     Tropical Pacific (ETP) but it also protects the ecosystem by \n     reducing the bycatch of endangered sea turtles, sharks, \n     billfish and juvenile tuna. Additionally, the Act is an \n     important step in solidifying the voluntary program presently \n     in place in the ETP which has reduced dolphin mortality from \n     423,678 in 1972 to 2,700 in the last year. Enactment of S.39 \n     and the development of the new international standards it \n     prescribes will bring the conservation community \n     significantly closer to the goal of eliminating dolphin \n     deaths altogether.\n       We applaud your efforts to bring S. 39 to the floor for \n     consideration. The amendments passed by the Senate Committee \n     on Commerce, Science and Transportation have strengthened the \n     bill considerably. Significantly, these changes directly \n     address concerns about truth in labeling, because they \n     prohibit the use of the of ``Dolphin Safe'' label on tuna if \n     a single dolphin died or suffered serious injury during the \n     fishing operation. That change means that the ``Dolphin \n     Safe'' label will provide greater protection for dolphins \n     than ever before. In addition, the bill as amended now \n     provides numerous fail-safe measures to protect the dolphin \n     populations in the ETP. The amended bill gives the Secretary \n     of Commerce emergency powers to re-impose the trade embargoes \n     if a detrimental change in the dolphin population is \n     observed. While there is no indication in the current science \n     that chase and encirclement adversely affects dolphins \n     populations the bill, as amended provides that a five year \n     study be done to determine the effects of chase and \n     encirclement on those dolphin populations. If at any time the \n     study shows adverse impact on the populations, the bill \n     provides the Secretary of Commerce emergency powers to \n     protect dolphins. In short, S. 39 offers a powerful and \n     effective means of protecting dolphins, the Eastern Tropical \n     Pacific ecosystem, and the American consumer.\n       This bill is supported by environmentalists, the fishing \n     industry, and the Seafarers Union. It is based on sound \n     science, and has been the subject of Congressional \n     consideration for two full legislative sessions. Delay in \n     enactment of S. 39 would mean sacrificing this important \n     opportunity to strengthen the protection of dolphins and the \n     ecosystem in which they live. We strongly urge you to seek \n     prompt consideration of S. 39 by the full Senate and to \n     oppose any procedural moves which would delay its prompt \n     enactment.\n           Sincerely,\n     Roger McManus,\n       President, Center for Marine Conservation.\n     Barbara Dudley,\n       Executive Director, Greenpeace.\n     Kathryn Fuller,\n       President, World Wildlife Fund.\n     Fred Krupp,\n       Executive Director, Environmental Defense Fund.\n     Mark Van Putten,\n       President, National Wildlife Federation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                        Washington, July 15, 1997.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: I urge the Senate to consider and pass S. \n     39, the International Dolphin Conservation Program Act.\n       The House of Representatives recently passed counterpart \n     legislation with wide bipartisan support and it is my hope \n     that the Senate will act similarly. As you know, this \n     legislation has recovered the support of environmental \n     organizations in addition to our nation's fishing industry. \n     If enacted, S. 39 will allow the United States to implement \n     the Panama Declaration, a strong international program needed \n     to protect dolphins and other marine life in the Eastern \n     Tropical Pacific Ocean.\n       I hope that the Senate acts in our national interest and \n     passes this measure, which will permit the United States to \n     maintain its leadership role in promoting better stewardship \n     of our oceans and their valuable resources.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. The bill, which was approved in the House last year and \nagain last May by overwhelming majorities, would implement the \nInternational Dolphin Conservation Program by making basically two \nchanges to U.S. law. First, when the IDCP agreement is officially \nconcluded, it permits the importation of tuna from the Eastern Tropical \nPacific as long as dolphin-safe fishing practices are adhered to. \nSecond, it will permit the labeling of tuna from this area as dolphin \nsafe as long as no dolphin were killed or seriously injured during the \ncatch and that science shows no significant adverse impact on dolphins.\n  Failure to enact this bill would be a devastating blow to our efforts \nto protect the marine environment. Without this implementing \nlegislation, current fishing practices will continue, practices which \nscientists have learned have an adverse impact not only on dolphin but \na host of other marine life including sea turtles and bill fish. \nForeign fishing companies no longer bound by the international treaty \nmay well resume even more harmful fishing practices which would spell \ndisaster for dolphin. The impact of tuna fishing on dolphin is an \ninternational problem which demands an international response. Passage \nof this legislation will ensure the cooperation of the need to provide \nmeaningful and sustainable protection for dolphin and other marine \nlife.\n  Mr. President, I want to again thank Senator Snowe, the chairman of \nthe Ocean and Fisheries Subcommittee, Senator Stevens, Senator Breaux, \nand Senator Kerry of Massachusetts. They have been working on this \nlegislation for 2 years. Senator Snowe has held numerous hearings, has \nagreed to a number of compromises, and a number of amendments, and I \nwould like to again congratulate her for her success in reaching \nagreement on this very difficult and controversial legislation. The \nenactment of this legislation is a great victory for the environment \nand the environmental communities and\n\n[[Page S8299]]\n\nthey deserve enormous credit and gratitude.\n  I thank the other Senators without whose cooperation passage of this \nbill would not be possible. I would like to yield to Senator Snowe for \nher comments including a description of the managers' amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank Senator McCain, who, as chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee, has shown tremendous leadership, and I congratulate him for \ngetting this contentious bill to the floor.\n  Before beginning, I ask unanimous consent that Kate Wing, a Sea Grant \nfellow from the Subcommittee on Ocean and Fisheries, be given floor \nprivileges during consideration of S. 3 9.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I would also like to commend the original \nsponsors of this legislation, Senator Stevens and Senator Breaux, for \ntheir stellar efforts on the bill before us today. They have spent a \ntremendous amount of time and energy over the past year and a half to \nget this bill to this point, and they have made every effort to \naccommodate the concerns of Senators with opposing views.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Kerry, the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee, and Senators Hollings, Boxer, and Biden who have been \ninstrumental in helping us reach agreement on this bill, and I \nappreciate their efforts.\n  S. 39, the International Dolphin Conservation Program Act, will make \nthe changes in U.S. law necessary to implement the Declaration of \nPanama, which was signed by the United States and 11 other countries in \n1995. Under Panama, these nations agreed to conclude a binding \nagreement to protect dolphins in the Eastern Tropical Pacific tuna \nfishery, and to adhere to broadly sustainable methods of harvesting \nthis tuna.\n  This bill enjoys a tremendous amount of public support. The Clinton \nadministration, which negotiated the agreement, strongly supports this \nbill. As Senator McCain indicated, a number of environmental groups are \nchampions of this legislation as well. The World Wildlife Fund, \nNational Wildlife Federation, Center for Marine Conservation, \nEnvironmental Defense Fund, and Greenpeace have all strongly supported \nthis bill.\n  The bill is also strongly supported by the National Fisheries \nInstitute, the U.S. tuna fishing industry, and the Seafarer's \nInternational Union.\n  The Panama Declaration and S. 39 represent a landmark international \neffort to achieve two critical objectives: to protect dolphins in the \nETP, and to protect the entire marine ecosystem of this vast region. \nThey do this by requiring the nations fishing in the ETP to meet \nexceedingly strict limitations on the mortality and serious injury of \ndolphins. In exchange for the other nations agreeing to this stringent \nconservation regime, the United States will lift its embargoes of tuna \nfrom other nations, and permit fishermen that set purse seine nets \naround dolphins to use the U.S. dolphin-safe label if they do not kill \nor seriously injure any dolphins.\n  This is the most effective and responsible way to achieve our dual \nobjectives of protecting dolphins and the ecosystem of the ETP, and the \nreasons are twofold. While dolphin setting was once very deadly for \ndolphins, refinements to the practice in recent years have yielded \ntremendous gains. The graph behind me shows dolphin mortality per \ndolphin set, and we can see how successful fishermen have been in \nreducing mortality to dolphins in each set--99 percent since 1986.\n  These mortality reductions per set have in turn led to a precipitous \ndecline in total dolphin mortality in the ETP, as this other graph \nbehind me indicates as well. Overall dolphin mortality has plummeted 99 \npercent since 1986, even though the rate of dolphin setting has \nremained stable during that period.\n  At the same time, it has become apparent that the alternatives to \ndolphin setting--log and school setting--are very damaging to many \nother species. The table behind me shows the relative amounts of \nbycatch for each of the three harvesting methods.\n  I ask unanimous consent the table be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                       Dolphin\n                                                               Number of      Total      Mortality    sets as a\n                            Year                                Dolphin      dolphin      per set     percent of\n                                                                  sets      mortality                 total sets\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1986........................................................       10,507      133,174         5.34        59.82\n1987........................................................       12,538       99,177        12.67        62.00\n1988........................................................       10,571       81,593         7.91        47.75\n1989........................................................       12,580       97,046         7.72        56.34\n1990........................................................       10,571       52,531         7.71        51.95\n1991........................................................        9,482       27,292         4.97        55.32\n1992........................................................       10,326       15,550         2.88        56.16\n1993........................................................        6,953        3,716         1.51        40.27\n1994........................................................        7,804        4,095         0.53        50.00\n1995........................................................        7,209        3,276         0.52        47.00\n1996........................................................        7,353        2,766         0.45        52.00\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nData from the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Association.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mahi-mahi, for instance, a fish popular in white \ntablecloth restaurants in the United States, suffers far higher bycatch \nrates in log and school sets than in dolphin sets. Looking at blacktip \nsharks, we see a similar problem. The same is true for every other \nnondolphin species in the ETP. If you look at Mahi-mahi, you are \ntalking about losing 30,000 Mahi-mahi fish for every 1,000 pounds of \ntuna caught in the eastern tropical pacific.\n  Mr. President, the basic intent of the Panama Declaration and S. 39 \nis to lock the nations that fish in the ETP into a very strict \nconservation regime that will require them to continue the progress \nmade to date and eventually reduce dolphin mortality to a level near \nzero. And it is also to recognize a fishing method that causes very \nlittle harm to dolphins, but which is also the safest possible fishing \nmethod for all of the other species that live in the ETP.\n  Mr. President, as we know, some Senators have been concerned that \ndolphin setting may be causing unseen harm to dolphins, and they \nobjected to the immediate change in the dolphin safe label contained in \nS. 39 as reported by the committee. The latest compromise that we all \nreached last week, and that is contained in the manager's amendment \nthat was offered by Senator McCain.\n  It requires the expeditious commencement of research to further study \nthe effect of dolphin setting on dolphins. Tuna caught by dolphin sets \nmay not be labeled dolphin safe until at least March 1999, at which \ntime the Secretary of Commerce must review the preliminary results of \nthe study, and make a determination as to whether or not dolphin \nsetting is causing significant adverse impacts to depleted dolphin \nstocks in the ETP. If the Secretary finds no significant impact, then \nthe label changes to permit tuna caught with dolphin sets to be labeled \ndolphin safe, as long as no dolphins were killed or seriously injured \nduring harvest.\n  Between July 1, 2001, and December 31, 2002, the Secretary will \nreview the completed results of the study, and make another \ndetermination. If significant adverse impacts to dolphins are found at \nthat time, he must prohibit the labeling of tuna caught with dolphin \nsets as dolphin safe.\n  Mr. President, I think this compromise reasonably addresses the \nconcerns on both sides, and it resolves what has been a very \ncontentious issue. I urge my colleagues to support the\n\n[[Page S8300]]\n\nmanager's amendment to S. 39, and the bill as amended.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, may I ask how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine has 5 minutes and 28 \nsecond.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Senator and start by congratulating her on \nthe effort she has made in this regard, and Senator Stevens from Alaska \nfor the work he has done along with Senator Kerry, and also acknowledge \nSenator Barbara Boxer's longstanding commitment on doing what is \nnecessary to preserve and protect dolphins.\n  As we bring this legislation to the floor, it is very, very \nsignificant, for we have been working on this for 25 years to try to \nimprove on a program that I think has made great progress in preserving \nthe ability for the tuna industry in the United States, one of the most \npopular fishing resources in the entire world, to be able to continue \nto operate in a manner that does not cause death or mortality or \nserious harm to dolphin, which conflict, many times, with the tuna fish \nthemselves. This industry, I think, is to be commended because they \nhave made tremendous strides in trying to preserve their industry, at \nthe same time protecting dolphins. So they are to be congratulated for \nthe great work they have done. This legislation hopefully will be an \nimprovement. I commend all of those who have had a chance to be \ninvolved in it.\n  One concern that I do have is directly related to the labeling issue. \nAs many of you know, the debate on the tuna-dolphin issue has a long \nand tortuous history. It was our own industry, primarily the U.S. \ncanners, who started the dolphin-safe movement by voluntarily adopting \nthat label back in 1990. It took several years and many millions of \ndollars to educate the American consumer about what the dolphin-safe \nlabel means. It was because of the industry's efforts and congressional \nbacking that we still have that label today.\n  But today, when we pass S. 39, the Congress will establish criteria \nby which to evaluate the appropriateness of the dolphin-safe label. The \ndefinition of the label may change, based upon further scientific \nstudies.\n  But let us not fool ourselves that there are some people who will \noppose this change at all costs. One way to do this is through the use \nof alternative labels.\n  The existence of alternative labels alone is not problematic, but the \nmisuse of those labels to deceive or mislead the American public is a \nproblem. The original version of S. 39 recognized this fact and \nprohibited other labels that referred to dolphins or other marine \nmammals on a can of tuna. It made sense from a practical point of \nview--if the Congress is establishing very strict criteria for a \nGovernment dolphin-safe label, then it should be the only such label.\n  Opponents to this provision would argue on the right to free \ncommercial speech. We must remember that commercial speech is not given \nthe same degree of protection as individual speech. If a significant \nGovernment interest exists, then the Government can regulate such \ncommercial speech. I believe that the conservation goals of the \nInternational Dolphin Conservation Program are such a significant \nGovernment interest. But in the spirit of compromise, I was willing to \nallow alternative labels under some strict conditions.\n  Alternative labels can exist if they meet the minimum standards of \nthe dolphin-safe label, including the no mortality or serious injury \nstandard as well as the support of a tracking and verification program \nsimilar to that found in S. 39. If you want to claim that you are as \nsafe as dolphin safe, then you must be able to prove it. Alternative \nlabels are subject to all applicable labeling, marketing and \nadvertising laws and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission Act--\nthis only makes sense.\n  But the concern on the misuse of alternative labels continues to \nexist. Our compromise would address this concern by forbidding any \ncampaign or effort to mislead or deceive consumers about the level of \nprotection afforded dolphins under the International Dolphin \nConservation Program.\n  Finally, we ask the Secretary of Commerce to monitor the situation. \nIf alternative labels are used in such a way to undermine the \nconservation goals of the International Dolphin Conservation Program, \nthen the Secretary will make a report to the Congress. If our efforts \nhere today, and over the past 2 years, are being thwarted by a campaign \nto undercut the label or International Dolphin Conservation Program, \nthen we should know and we should take action to eliminate this \nproblem.\n  Mr. President, I hope these safeguards are sufficient in dealing with \nthe misuse of alternative labels. I can only support this bill if I \nknow that our efforts and the goals of the binding international \nprogram are not being undone by a campaign which uses alternative \nlabels to cerate market distinctions for the purpose of customer \nconfusion or deception. I believe that we addressed this concern with \nour compromise. If not, I am sure that we shall visit this issue again.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I would like to acknowledge the leadership \nof my friend from Alaska, Senator Stevens, who has helped guide this \nbill through to this day. I also would like to note the efforts of \nSenators Snowe and McCain who took a personal interest in protecting \ndolphins through an international agreement. My colleague from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kerry, helped to forge the compromise agreement \nwhich we stand to implement today. Of course, Senators Biden and Boxer \nshould be noted for their continuing concern for dolphin protection--I \nam glad that our common interests were merged into common legislation. \nI urge my colleagues to vote in favor of S. 39.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield to me?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am more than happy to yield the remainder \nof my time to Senator Stevens, who is a major sponsor of this \nlegislation along with Senator Breaux. I thank the Senator for his \nleadership on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 2 minutes and 22 \nseconds.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Jean Toal and \nTom Richey be granted the privilege of the floor for this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent my staff person, \nPaul Deveau, be granted the privilege of the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I introduced S. 39, the International \nDolphin Conservation Program Act, in January of this year at the \nrequest of the administration.\n  The bill would implement the international conservation agreement \ncalled the Panama Declaration, which was signed on October 4, 1995, by \nthe 12 nations that fish for tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean \n[the ETP].\n  These countries include: Belize, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, \nFrance, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Spain, Vanuatu, and Venezuela.\n  The President and Vice President strongly support the bill, as do \nGreenpeace, the Center for Marine Conservation, the Environmental \nDefense Fund, the National Wildlife Federation, the World Wildlife \nFund, the American Sportfishing Association, U.S. labor unions, and the \nU.S. tuna industry.\n  The House of Representatives has passed measures similar to S. 39 \ntwice--in both the 104th and 105th Congresses, by large bipartisan \nmajorities.\n  Under the Panama Declaration and S. 39, a binding international \nagreement to reduce dolphin mortality and conserve fishery resources in \nthe ETP will be created.\n  This binding agreement will cap dolphin mortality in the ETP at no \nmore than 5,000 dolphins annually, with the goal of reducing the \nmortality of dolphins to zero.\n\n[[Page S8301]]\n\n  It will also create binding observer, bycatch, and other conservation \nand management measures in the ETP similar to those we just enacted in \nour domestic fisheries in the Magnuson-Stevens Act.\n  These important conservation measures are contingent on specific \nchanges to U.S. law.\n  The key changes include: A change to allow tuna caught in compliance \nwith the Panama Declaration--including through the encirclement of \ndolphins--to be imported into the United States; and a change so that \ndolphin safe will mean tuna in the ETP caught in a set in which dolphin \nmortality occurred.\n  Under the agreement we have reached with Senators Boxer, Biden, and \nBreaux, the second of these changes will be delayed.\n  Tuna caught by encircling dolphins in the ETP will only be able to be \nlabeled as dolphin safe beginning in March 1999.\n  Before this happens, the Secretary of Commerce must determine--as we \nbelieve he will based on the scientific data we have already seen--that \nencirclement is not having a significant adverse impact on depleted \ndolphin stocks.\n  I have strong doubts about whether this delay is necessary, but the \nLatin American countries who signed the Panama Declaration with the \nUnited States have agreed to the delay.\n  It is appropriate that in 1997--the 25th anniversary of the passage \nof the Marine Mammal Protection Act--we are making improvements with \nrespect to the protection of dolphins, a primary focus in our enactment \nof the original MMPA.\n  Since passage of the MMPA in 1972, dolphin mortality in the ETP has \nbeen reduced from over 400,000 per year, to below 5,000.\n  This decrease in dolphin mortality is primarily due to the \ndevelopment of a practice called the back-down technique, in which \ndolphin are safely allowed to escape from the net.\n  Our bill today acknowledges the vast improvements that have been made \nin this encirclement fishing method.\n  S. 39 will allow tuna caught through this method to be imported into \nthe United States and thereby discouraged alternative methods--log \nsets--which we have learned have extremely high levels of bycatch.\n  We spent the last 3 years working on the new measures to curb bycatch \nin our domestic fisheries--this year's S. 39 will help with the \nsituation in the ETP.\n  I thank Senator Breaux for his work on the matter, along with Senator \nKerry, and I want to acknowledge the leadership of Senator Snowe in \nworking out the final version of this bill.\n  I thank the staff: Trevor McCabe, of my office; Paul Deveau, from \nSenator Breaux's staff; Clark LeBlanc, with Senator Snowe and Senator \nMcCain; Kate Wing, from Senator McCain's staff; Penny Dalton, along \nwith Jean Toal, from Senator Hollings' staff; Margaret Cummisky, from \nSenator Inouye's staff; and Kate English and Tom Richey, from Senator \nKerry's staff. It has been an excellent staff job.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  I would like to also thank all of those involved in this effort, \nwhich has been a very long, very complicated, sometimes difficult \neffort, but I think, nevertheless, an extremely important one, which is \nresulting in a very important conservation bill being passed.\n  I particularly thank Senator McCain, Senator Stevens, Senator \nHollings, Senator Breaux, Senator Snowe, Senator Boxer, Senator Biden, \nSenator Daschle, Senator Inouye, and Senator Smith, all of whom have \nbeen involved in the negotiations and effort to reach this point. I \nthank the representative from the White House, Katie McGinty, and the \nState Department, and the Department of Commerce who have all been part \nof these negotiations, and particularly the staff on both sides, the \nstaff on the majority side that Senator Stevens mentioned and also \nparticularly Kate English and Penny Dalton, Tom Richey and Jean Toal on \nour side who have really spent hour upon hour upon hour trying to find \na compromise.\n  I fought for this compromise because it includes the critical element \nmissing from the original bill: enhanced protection for depleted \ndolphin stocks on the basis of sound science before any changes are \nmade to U.S. law to ease restrictions on fishing procedures that could \njeopardize dolphins. This was my key concern: sound science first.\n  In addition, the compromise strengthens the bill by adding a bycatch \nreduction program, mandating a research study, guaranteeing funding \ncosts for its initiation, and strengthening the authority for the \nemergency regulatory provisions. Finally, tied to the conclusions of \nthe research study, the compromise resolves perhaps the key concern \nover the timing of, and the process for, changing the definition of \nwhat constitutes ``dolphin-safe'' when that term is employed to label \ntuna products.\n  What this debate was and is about is the impact that fishing for \nyellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean [ETP] has had on \nthe two depleted dolphin stocks placed at risk as a result of this \nfishing effort: the eastern spinner and northeastern offshore spotted \ndolphins. The authors of legislation that established the dolphin-safe \nlabel--Senators Boxer and Biden--intended the label as one method to \nbring attention to the plight of these quickly declining dolphin stocks \ndue to the unsafe fishing practices of catching yellowfin tuna by \nsetting nets on dolphins that swim with tuna.\n  Since the creation of the label and the embargo of tuna products from \ncountries that do not use the dolphin-safe fishing methods, dolphin \nmortality has dropped significantly. This decline in mortality has been \nattributed to the attention that the United States brought to this \nissue through the dolphin-safe label, and to the efforts of nations \nwhich participate in the dolphin conservation program under the La \nJolla agreement of 1992.\n  I think there is consensus that the La Jolla agreement and its \nsuccessor agreement, the Panama Declaration, are very important to \ndolphin conservation. That is why I and Senators Boxer and Biden and \nothers have continued to struggle to reach a compromise on this \nlegislation which will move the Panama Declaration further along the \npath to creating an international treaty on dolphin protection.\n  The outstanding concern with the bill originally reported by the \nCommerce Committee was that it altered the international conservation \nregime, before the safety of those alterations were scientifically \nknown to be safe for depleted dolphin stocks. This concern applied \nparticularly to changing the definition of the dolphin-safe label as \nrequired by the Panama Declaration. In my judgement, a decision to \nchange the criteria for use of the dolphin-safe label could only be \nmade responsibly after the U.S. Government would authoritatively answer \nthe question, ``What is the current health and abundance of these two \ndolphin stocks?''\n  We know that 10 years ago over 80,000 dolphins were killed each year \nin the ETP through the practice of setting on dolphins to catch giant \nyellowfin tuna. While the Technique has been modified, the practice \nstill exists today.\n  The National Marine Fisheries Service, our Government agency charged \nwith fisheries research and regulation, has not conducted a dolphin \npopulation study since 1987.\n  Proponents of the bill as reported by committee claim that empirical \ndata provided by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission [IATTC] \nprovides enough information for them to feel comfortable that the \ndolphin stocks are safe and that no further study is needed. They \nconclude that IATTC observer data indicate that dolphin populations are \neither stable or increasing and that, taking into account the added \nnumber of boats fishing in the ETP since 1988, dolphin recovery is \nsuggested.\n\n\n                         bycatch versus dolphin\n\n  Supporters of S. 39 argue that, from a broader conservation \nperspective, catching yellowfin tuna by methods other than setting on \ndolphin results in the higher catch levels of juvenile yellowfin and \nbycatch including sea turtles, sharks, and marlin. I share their \nconservation concerns about bycatch and I support the bycatch reduction \nprogram added to S. 39.\n  However, I don't believe that we should address the bycatch problem \nat the expense of the two depleted dolphin stocks at risk in the ETP. \nThat is why I have pushed so hard to ensure that\n\n[[Page S8302]]\n\nany changes made to Federal law regarding fishing agreements that \nimpact these two dolphin stocks must be based on sound scientific \nknowledge regarding the dolphin populations. If we all could agree that \nthe dolphin stocks are recovering and that the new fishing practices \ndeveloped over that last 10 years are now safe for dolphins, then there \nwould be agreement on lifting the embargo and revisiting the precept of \nthe dolphin-safe label. The dolphin research study included in this \ncompromise will provide the necessary knowledge to support or refute \nthis conclusion.\n\n\n                     history of tuna-dolphin debate\n\n  I would like to briefly describe the history of dolphin conservation \nand why this compromise is so important to it continued success. Since \nthe enactment of the Marine Mammal Protection Act in 1972 there has \nbeen a dramatic decrease in the dolphin deaths from American fishing \npractices. However, in the early years of the MMPA, foreign nations had \nbecome a far more serious source of dolphin mortality. During the \n1980's amendments to the MMPA required foreign nations to accept \ndolphin protection requirements comparable to those imposed on U.S. \ntuna fishermen, or become subject to a U.S. ban on tuna imports. Those \nprotections include a ban on encircling dolphin using purse seine nets \nwhen fishing in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean [ETP].\n\n  In 1990, following a voluntary prohibition on the purchase of tuna \ncaught in association with dolphin by canned tuna companies, the U.S. \nimplemented legislation to require a dolphin-safe tuna label which \nremains in use-today. The labeling law specifies that tuna caught in \ndriftnets could not qualify as dolphin safe. That same year, the United \nStates embargoed tuna imports from Mexico, Venezuela, and Vanuatu for \nfailure to meet the MMPA requirements.\n  In 1992, the MMPA was further amended by the International Dolphin \nConservation Act, giving the Secretary of State authority to enter into \ninternational agreements to establish a global moratorium on the \npractice of setting nets on dolphins and established a dolphin-safe \nmarket in the United States in 1994.\n  In 1992, the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission [IATTC] adopted \na voluntary international agreement--the La Jolla agreement--\nestablishing a multilateral program to reduce dolphin mortalities in \nthe ETP. This agreement contains the goal of reducing dolphin deaths to \nless than 5,000 annually. Currently, 11 nations including the United \nStates, participate in this voluntary program. While Mexico had been a \nparticipant in the program, they recently announced that they were \nsuspending their formal participation in the voluntary program.\n  During the summer of 1995, five environmental groups and six Latin \nAmerican nations negotiated the Panama Declaration, a new initiative to \nstrengthen the IATTC dolphin protection program in exchange for \neliminating the current United States ban on tuna that is not dolphin \nsafe.\n  This brings us to today, where our efforts are focused on enacting \nthe necessary legislation for implementing the Panama Declaration, and \nthe requirements that we revise United States dolphin protections laws.\n  Thanks to the efforts of so many Senators, their staffs and others, \nthe bill we are about to vote on now includes: a label change provision \nthat accommodates our international obligations as laid out in the \nPanama Declaration, while providing enhanced protection for dolphins, \nand sound science for future conservation efforts.\n  The compromise reflected in S. 39 as amended, provides for a $12 \nmillion over 3 years to fully fund a study on the practice of chase and \nencirclement and its impact on depleted dolphin stocks. The bill \nrequires a preliminary finding on the results of this study to be made \nin March, 1999. Unless the Secretary of Commerce finds that intentional \nencirclement has a significant adverse impact on depleted dolphin \nstocks, then the definition of the ``dolphin-safe'' label immediately \nchanges to allow for the encirclement of dolphin--as long as no dolphin \nwere killed or seriously injured in the process--as a legitimate \nfishing practice in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. Conversely, if \nthe Secretary of Commerce finds that intentional encirclement does not \nhave a significant adverse impact on depleted stocks, then the dolphin-\nsafe label does not change at that time.\n\n  This compromise provides, further, for a second and final finding to \nbe made by the Secretary of Commerce at the conclusion of the 3-year \nstudy, between July 2001 and December 2002, as to whether or not the \nintentional encirclement of dolphins has a significant adverse impact \non depleted dolphin stocks or is preventing the recovery of such \nstocks. The Secretary of Commerce shall use the same threshold for this \nsecond determination.\n  In closing, Mr. President, this compromise is an important step \nforward for both continued dolphin protection and enhanced ecosystem \nprotection. The agreement we reached accommodates our international \nobligations as laid out in the Panama Declaration, while providing \nenhanced protection for dolphins, and sound science for future \nconservation efforts. This bill also continues to protect consumers by \nmaintaining the dolphin-safe standards. S. 39 represents a serious, \nwell-vetted effort to bridge legitimate differences on how best to \nprotection dolphins. I, therefore, encourage my colleagues to vote for \nits swift passage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Kathleen McGinty at the \nWhite House be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Council on \n           Environmental Quality,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 29, 1997.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As you know, members of the Senate and \n     the Administration have reached a compromise on S. 39, the \n     International Dolphin Conservation Act. A key component of \n     this compromise is a comprehensive dolphin population \n     abundance study and stress study to be undertaken by the \n     National Marine Fisheries Service commencing in Fiscal Year \n     1998 and continuing through Fiscal Years 1999, 2000, and \n     2001. The Administration strongly supports this study and \n     will work with Congress to obtain the necessary funding to \n     initiate it in 1998. To ensure that the study achieves its \n     scientific objectives, as laid out in the compromise, the \n     Administration will seek the funds necessary to continue the \n     study in Fiscal Years 1999 and 2000 and to complete it in \n     Fiscal Year 2001.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Kathleen A. McGinty,\n                                                            Chair.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from California 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I thank Senator \nKerry, and I will say more about him in a moment.\n  Mr. President, we have travelled a very difficult route to get to \nthis day. There are so many people I wish to thank. I will start off by \nthanking my colleagues, Senator Joe Biden and Senator Bob Smith, for \ntheir constant support over the last several years on this issue. \nSenator Biden was the Senate author of the 1990 dolphin-safe label law \nthat I authored in the House at that time. Senator Smith has, time and \ntime again, proven that he is a champion of dolphin protection. Getting \nthis compromise worked out has been very difficult--and Senator John \nKerry was a master negotiator. When many of us on all sides of the \nissue thought we would never reach agreement, he stuck with it. We are \nhere today in great part due to the dedication of Senator Kerry. He \nknows this issue, he was persistent, and he never quit.\n  I also thank Senator Hollings, the distinguished ranking member of \nthe Commerce Committee, for his leadership and, of course, Senator John \nMcCain, the chair of the committee, for coming to the table, as well as \nSenator Snowe, Senator Stevens and Senator Breaux.\n  One more thank you, Mr. President, to the 45 Senators from both sides \nof the aisle who stood with us in this fight. The only reason we got \nhere today is they refused to vote for cloture on this bill. They made \npromises on it to their constituents, and they kept those promises. I \nfeel, I have to say, that without them, we would not be here either. \nSenator Daschle, the Democratic leader, stood with us the entire time.\n\n[[Page S8303]]\n\n  I think we have saved dolphin lives as a result of this compromise, \nand we have protected American consumers.\n  Mr. President, the whole argument over this bill really revolved \naround one issue: What is the definition of ``dolphin safe''? In 1990, \nwe decided that if you want to get a dolphin-safe label, you have to \nfish for tuna in such a way as to not harm the dolphin. That is, you \nmay not chase or encircle dolphin with purse seine nets on that fishing \ntrip. There are those who believe there are new ways to use the purse \nseine nets that no longer harm the dolphin.\n  Many of us believe there is no proof of that. Senator Biden and I, \nSenator Smith, the other Senators, and 85 environmental and consumer \ngroups said we can't change the definition until we have a scientific \nstudy that tells us it is safe for dolphins. That is what this debate \nis all about.\n  Eleven countries put tremendous pressure on this Government to change \nthe definition of ``dolphin safe'' before there was even a study. We \nbelieved that our position was the right position; there should be a \nstudy.\n  We did have to give on this. We wanted a 3-year study, and we did not \nwant any change in the label until that 3-year study was analyzed. We \ndid not win that point.\n  Essentially, the way the compromise works, in 18 months when the \npreliminary results come in on the study, if--if--the Secretary of \nCommerce believes that those preliminary results indicate that chasing \nand setting nets on dolphins is safe for dolphins then the definition \nof ``dolphin safe,'' will be changed. And if the study does not show \nthat, the bill we are passing today says we will have no change in the \ndefinition.\n  So, yes, this is clearly a compromise. We have won 18 months of the \nstatus quo; 18 months when consumers know that the dolphin-safe label \nmeans just that, and after that, we will live to see the preliminary \nresults of that study, I hope, and we can have a new debate at that \ntime. But this is what compromise is all about.\n  I want to make one further statement, Mr. President, because there is \na disturbing element in all of this to me, and it doesn't just come \ninto being with respect to this issue; it is an overall issue. And that \nis, I have a very straightforward opinion that American laws should be \nmade by Americans; that, in fact, our environmental laws, all of our \nlaws, our labor laws, ought to be made by the people who are sent here \nto fight out those issues. American laws should not be made by other \ncountries.\n  I was disturbed in the course of this debate that, in fact, there was \ntremendous influence from other countries. I think there are many \nSenators who feel that is appropriate, and I think this debate shall \ncontinue, but we have a very good law on the books and I am proud to \nsay it is going to stand for 18 months.\n  I look forward to making sure that the bill we are passing today \ncomes back after conference in just this format, and it can be signed \ninto law. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I reserve my side's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 3 minutes 18 seconds.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California, and I \nthank her particularly for her comments about me. I am very \nappreciative of that. I thank her for her extraordinary tenacity in \nthis effort and willingness to fight for what she believes in, which \nshe did.\n  I also want to emphasize that I believe this was a fair compromise \narrived at by a lot of people who wanted to do what was in the best \ninterest. I thank Senator Snowe and Senator McCain for their patience \nin this effort. It was trying at times and sometimes there were some \ndifficulties along the way. They have been very gracious and very \ndecent in arriving at this. I think a compromise is a compromise. \nEverybody agrees to settle, and they do so because it is in the best \ninterests ultimately of the issue, and that is what has happened here.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1045\n\n    (Purpose: To make changes in the bill as reported by committee)\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Snowe], for herself, Mr. \n     Breaux, Mr. Stevens, and Mr. McCain, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1045.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1045) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I would like to engage the bill managers \nand Senator Stevens in a colloquy.\n  As a chief cosponsor of S. 39, my understanding is that the \nappropriate standard of judicial review that would apply to the \nSecretarial findings in section 5 on whether dolphin encirclement is \nhaving a significant adverse impact on dolphin stocks in the standard \nunder the Administrative Procedures Act. Is that the understanding of \nthe bill managers and the sponsor of the bill?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Yes, the Senator is correct on that point. The Secretarial \ndeterminations to which you refer are included in S. 39 as an amendment \nto the Dolphin Consumer Protection Information Act. That act does not \nspecify any alternative standard of review, and therefore the standard \nunder the Administrative Procedures Act would apply. Furthermore, the \nbill managers intend that such standard will apply to the Secretarial \nfindings in section 5 of S. 39. this standard involves a review of the \nadministrative record, and a determination of whether the Secretary \nacted in an arbitrary and capricious manner.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I concur with Senator Snowe. As the original sponsor of \nthe bill, it is my intent that the Secretarial findings in section 5 be \nsubject only to the scope of judicial review in the Administrative \nProcedures Act. That is clearly the appropriate standard, and I think \nwe all agree on that.\n  Mr. KERRY. I concur with Senator Snowe and Senator Stevens on this \npoint.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Senators for clarifying that point.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I commend the efforts of the Senator from \nAlaska Senator Stevens, and the Senator from Maine Senator Snowe, for \nbringing this much-needed legislation to the floor. It has been nearly \n2 years since legislation was first introduced in the Senate to \nimplement the Panama Declaration, an international agreement which will \npromote marine conservation in the Pacific Ocean. I recognize that the \nopponents of this measure have strong convictions, and am pleased that \nthe two sides were able to work out a compromise that, most \nimportantly, is consistent with the international agreement which the \nUnited States signed.\n  Let me first state my view that eliminating dolphin mortality must \nremain a top priority as the Senate considers this bill. Like so many \nAmericans, I will not soon forget the tragedy that occurred in the \n1970's, when hundreds of thousands of dolphins were killed annually \nfrom tuna fishing in the Eastern Tropical Pacific [ETP]. In 1972 alone, \nmore than 420,000 dolphins were killed there. While we can all applaud \nthe tremendous progress that has been made in reducing dolphin \nmortality in recent years, Congress must be vigilant in working toward \ncomplete elimination.\n\n[[Page S8304]]\n\n  But dolphins are not the only species adversely impacted by tuna \nfishing in the Eastern Tropical Pacific, sometimes called ETP. New \nfishing methods have resulted in significant bycatch of nondolphin \nspecies, including juvenile tuna. These other marine species in this \necosystem must also be protected, and legislation should address this \nlarger goal.\n  The question before the Senate today is how do we best achieve \nsustained conservation in the ETP tuna fishery? We must first \nacknowledge that much progress has been made in reducing dolphin \nmortality through new fishing techniques such as the back down \nprocedure. Through this technique, the back edge of the purse seine \nfishing net sinks below the surface, allowing dolphins to swim out. In \n1996, dolphin mortality in the ETP is currently estimated at a record \nlow of less than 3,000, down from record highs of more than 400,000 in \nthe 1970's. That's a 99-percent reduction.\n  International cooperation in conserving this resource, particularly \nthrough the voluntary measures of the La Jolla agreement of 1992, has \nalso been a primary factor in achieving this great success. Among other \nthings, this landmark agreement, which was signed by 10 nations, \nestablished strict dolphin mortality limits and required observers to \nbe present aboard tuna fishing boats in the ETP.\n  In order to continue this tremendous progress, the United States must \ncontinue to work with our neighbors on multilateral efforts to conserve \nthis resource. This involves enacting the legislation before the Senate \ntoday, S. 39, which implements the Panama Declaration.\n  Contrary to much of what has been said in the 2 years since it was \nsigned, the Panama Declaration represents the best in international \nconservation. It would retain--and in many cases, enhance--the \nprovisions of the La Jolla agreement that have been so successful in \nreducing dolphin mortality and protecting the tuna fishery. Let me be \nclear: the Panama Declaration will not threaten the dolphin population \nin the Eastern Tropical Pacific.\n  Unlike the voluntary La Jolla Agreement, the Panama Declaration is \nbinding upon its signatories. Among its many stringent requirements are \nreductions in the annual overall limit on dolphin mortalities that were \nestablished by the La Jolla agreement. These limits include per-stock \nmortality limits to protect all dolphin populations.\n  The Panama Declaration also increases enforcement and monitoring \nefforts to protect dolphins, including mandatory observers on all tuna \nfishing vessels. In addition, it sets as an agreed goal the elimination \nof all dolphin mortality in the ETP tuna fishery. And the Panama \nDeclaration has teeth: if foreign nations do not comply, then the \nUnited States can reimpose our tuna embargo.\n  Opponents of S. 39 have been concerned over its change in the \ndefinition of dolphin safe, as mandated by the Panama Declaration. It \nis important to note that the new definition of dolphin safe is not \nweaker than current law. Let me explain.\n  When the current definition was adopted in 1990, the dolphin safe \nlabel was intended to prevent the import of tuna into the United States \nthat were caught by encircling dolphins. This definition made good \nsense in 1990 since, historically, fishing methods that encircled \ndolphins caused high mortality rates. But as I've stated, recent \nmodifications to the encirclement method of tuna fishing have resulted \nin reduced dolphin mortality.\n  A more sensible definition of dolphin safe should mean no dolphins \nwere killed during the tuna fishing, rather than no dolphins were \nencircled. Under the new definition, if even one dolphin is killed in \nthe process, that tuna cannot be labeled dolphin safe. Proponents of \nthe old definition want truth in labeling. I agree with this. But, \ndon't consumers expect that dolphin safe means no dolphins were killed? \nThe Panama Declaration and S. 39 would do just that.\n  In any event, so as to be absolutely sure that these new encirclement \ntechniques do not adversely affect dolphin stocks in the ETP, the \ncompromise before us today delays the label change until NOAA conducts \na preliminary survey of these stocks. This slight delay should not \nthreaten United States participation in the Panama Declaration, \nallowing its strong conservation requirements to be implemented.\n  The Panama Declaration also recognizes the importance of protecting \nnondolphin marine life in the ETP that has been harmed by tuna fishing. \nThe controversy over dolphin mortality has encouraged tuna fishermen to \nutilize alternative methods to encirclement--namely school sets and log \nsets. These techniques, while more protective of dolphins, are well \nknown to cause destruction of nondolphin marine life, including sea \nturtles, billfish, sharks, and juvenile yellowfin tuna.\n  NOAA scientists have warned repeatedly that the high bycatch of \njuvenile tuna, associated with these two fishing methods, might \nactually imperial tuna stocks in the future--to say nothing of their \nimpact on other species. As envisioned by the Panama Declaration, S. 39 \nrequires the United States to implement a program to reduce bycatch of \nall marine life in the ETP, not just dolphins.\n  Mr. President, today the United States confronts a choice that must \nbe made soon on how best to conserve marine life in the Pacific Ocean. \nNegotiators have worked out a compromise that will allow the United \nStates to choose the best option. This option entails joining our \nneighbors in implementing a binding, carefully crafted international \nagreement that includes strong mandates that will protect dolphins and \nother species.\n  Another option involved going it alone, sacrificing what little \nleverage we have in an increasingly foreign fishery. Keep in mind that \nthe ETP is completely outside the jurisdiction of the United States. We \ncannot simply go in and tell others how to fish.\n  Instead, our best chance of promoting conservation is through a \nmultilateral, rather than a unilateral, forum. But other signatories to \nthe Panama Declaration will not wait forever while the United States \nCongress continues to debate this issue. The time to act is now.\n  If we had chosen to go it alone, dolphins would not necessarily have \nbeen saved. Indeed, more dolphins may well be killed if the United \nStates rejects the Panama Declaration, as fishermen will likely abandon \nthe voluntary provisions of the La Jolla agreement. What incentive \nwould these fishermen have to conserve if the largest consumer of tuna \nmaintains an embargo on their product and refuses to participate in \ninternational conservation efforts?\n  Because the Panama Declaration offers the best hope for marine \nconservation in the ETP, S. 39 has been endorsed by Greenpeace, \nNational Wildlife Federation, Center for Marine Conservation, \nEnvironmental Defense Fund, and World Wildlife Fund. These groups \nrecognize the merits of this multilateral approach.\n  I again commend the tireless efforts of the authors of this \nlegislation, and urge my colleagues to support S. 39.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the manager's amendment before us today \nis the product of many hours of work on the part of a number of my \ncolleagues. I would like to express my personal appreciation to my \nfriend, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator McCain, and the \nchair of the Subcommittee on Oceans and Fisheries, Senator Snowe, for \ntheir personal efforts and willingness to delay consideration of this \nlegislation until interested parties could work out an agreement.\n  In addition, I particularly would like to acknowledge the effort of \nthe ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, Senator Kerry for his \ncommitment to reaching a compromise. The Senator from Massachusetts \nmade the mistake at our hearing on this legislation of volunteering to \nfind a middle ground between the proponents and opponents of S. 39. \nSince that time, he has spent hours listening to and trying to \naccommodate the concerns of all sides in this contentious issue. \nWithout his tireless effort, we would not be standing here today.\n  My own interest in this legislation has always been: to ensure sound \nconservation of marine mammals; to provide consumers with the \ninformation they need when purchasing tuna; and to ensure U.S. tuna \nfishermen a level playing field on which to compete.\n\n[[Page S8305]]\n\n  The bill before us now is a far better bill. It addresses many of the \nconcerns of Senators Boxer and Biden as well as others. These two \nSenators have been leaders in the area of dolphin protection--they \nwrote the dolphin-safe labeling law and have legitimate concerns about \nchanging the dolphin-safe label without the scientific research to \nensure that the tuna fishing methods allowed by S. 39 are safe for \ndolpins. The compromise before us today ensures that there will be a \nstudy of the effect of chasing and encircling dolpins and bases a \nchange in the meaning of ``dolphin safe'' on the results of that study.\n  Furthermore, the compromise addresses the concerns of Senator Inouye. \nIt allows alternative labels on tuna but makes sure that the claims on \nthose labels are true and can be verified.\n  Again, I thank the primary sponsors of the bill, Senators Stevens and \nBreaux, and all of the parties who worked on the manager's amendment \nfor their efforts to improve this legislation.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, when the President signs the \nInternational Dolphin Conservation Program Act, the United States will \nhave joined the rest of the tuna-fishing nations in the Eastern Pacific \nin pledging that, in the future, no dolphins will be killed in the \nharvesting of tuna. Further, the transition to better fishing methods \nwill result in a significant reduction in by-catch waste in that \nportion of the ocean. This is a remarkable achievement.\n  My colleagues from Alaska and Louisiana, Senators Stevens and Breaux, \nhave pressed on for 2 years to see that this agreement is ratified. \nTheir perseverance should be recognized and appreciated. Finally, this \nbill would likely have never become law had the subcommittee chairman, \nSenator Snowe, not gathered the various parties to work out a \ncompromise that would assure passage of this implementing legislation. \nShe is to be commended for her skill and stamina in seeing this measure \nto its successful conclusion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of the \ncompromise amendment to S. 39--the so-called tuna-dolphin bill.\n  In forging this bipartisan agreement, we have struck a proper balance \nbetween resolving the market access problems now faced by other \ncountries and keeping the faith with American consumers. It is a fair \ndeal.\n  In short, the bill implements an international dolphin protection \nregime--known as the Panama Declaration--while maintaining the current \ndolphin-safe label during the pendency of a study on the impacts on \ndolphins from purse net tuna fishing.\n  In March 1999--after scientists have preliminary determined whether \npurse net tuna fishing harms dolphin stocks--the Secretary of Commerce \nis to make a determination as to the appropriate dolphin-safe label, \nwhether that be the current one that Senator Boxer and I wrote into law \nin 1990, or another protective version. This decision will be reviewed \nin the year 2001.\n  Also included in the bill are provisions requiring Latin and South \nAmerican countries tuna fishing the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean to \nenroll in an expanded dolphin protection program, which includes on-\nboard observers. This will enable us to lock-in and improve upon the \ntremendous gains that we have already made in decreasing dolphin \nmortalities.\n  This amendment represents a compromise on process, not a cave-in on \nprinciples. Again, we retain for every letter of the current dolphin-\nsafe label. In 2 years' time the question will be if the label should \nbe changed--not when it should be changed.\n  I would also note that I do have some reservations regarding the \nadequacy of the data that will form the basis of the March 1999 label \nreview. Only one population survey will be available at that time; this \nwill not be an abundance of information upon which to make an informed \nand unbiased decision. I urge the Secretary of Commerce to err on the \nside of caution during the preliminary review and not make science \nconform to political will.\n  I would like to recognize and publicly thank my colleagues who worked \nso hard in crafting this agreement, particularly Senator Boxer, Senator \nKerry, Senator Breaux, Senator Snowe, Senator McCain, and Senator \nStevens. Each spent a great deal of personal time trying to bridge the \ngap in this debate, and I am grateful for their efforts.\n  In closing, this agreement continues to protect dolphins while \nkeeping our faith with the American people. It is environmentally and \neconomically the right thing to do, and I urge its passage.\n\n\n                      Funding for Dolphin Research\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, an agreement has been reached to address \nconcerns with S. 39, the International Dolphin Conservation Program \nAct. The agreement is contained in the manager's amendment to S. 39 \noffered by Senator Snowe. Under the agreement, the Secretary of \nCommerce is required to conduct a multi-year study on dolphin and \ndolphin stocks taken incidentally in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean \n(ETP) purse seine fishery. The Secretary will use the information from \nthis study to make two separate findings that will determine whether or \nnot tuna caught in the ETP by intentionally encircling dolphins can be \nlabeled as dolphin safe in the United States. Senator Snowe's amendment \nauthorizes appropriations of $4 million in fiscal year 1998, $3 million \nin fiscal year 1999, $4 million in fiscal year 2000, and $1 million in \nfiscal year 2001 to complete the study. These amounts are based on \nNational Marine Fisheries Service estimates for the costs for the \nstudy. I have received a letter from the White House indicating that \nthe administration will request funds for the study in fiscal years \n1999, 2000, and 2001. If the administration follows through on its \ncommitment to request these funds, I will do everything I can to ensure \nthey are appropriated.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am supportive of the effort to appropriate \nthe funds necessary for the study outlined in the manager's amendment \nto S. 39, beginning in fiscal year 1998. In fact, it is my \nunderstanding that the manager's amendment is written so that a number \nof sections in S. 39 will become effective only after funding for the \nfirst year of the study has been provided. It is clear to me that full \nfunding for this research is a critical element of the agreement on S. \n39.\n  Mr. GREGG. Recognizing the importance of this study to the compromise \nreached on S. 39, funds were added to the fiscal year 1998 Commerce, \nJustice, State appropriations bill in the Senate to complete the first \nyear of work. We will work together to protect this appropriation in \nconference. I, too, encourage the administration to follow through on \nits commitment to include the funds for fiscal year 1999, 2000, and \n2001 in its budget requests, and will work to include the funds in \nappropriations if they are requested.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in supporting \nappropriations for the completion of the dolphin study. The manager's \namendment to S. 39 developed by the Commerce Committee is written so \nthat most of the operative provisions of bill will become effective \nonly if funding for the fist year of the study has been provided. The \nWhite House has expressed support for the appropriation mentioned by \nSenator Gregg for fiscal year 1998, and has indicated that funding will \nbe requested to complete the study in fiscal year 1999, 2000, and 2001. \nTogether with Senators Stevens, Byrd, and Gregg, I support the fiscal \nyear 1998 appropriation for the first year of the study, and will \nsupport funds in years to come to complete the study.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate very much your recognizing \nme prior to the time we go to third reading. I will be very brief. I am \nnot sure we have any time left. If we don't, I will just use leader \ntime.\n  I just want to say how much I appreciate the effort made by the \nSenators who are on the floor to bring us to this point. This has been \na 2-year-long debate. Obviously, there have been good intentions on \nboth sides, and negotiations have resulted in a compromise that brings \nus to a point that will allow us to address this issue in a meaningful \nway.\n  I congratulate the administration and those who worked with us to \naccomplish this within the administration. But I particularly want to \nthank\n\n[[Page S8306]]\n\nSenators Boxer and Biden who pioneered the establishment of the dolphin \nsafe label all the way back to 1990, who recognized the importance of \nthis issue and dedicated themselves to solving it as they did back \nthen.\n  I thank Senator Hollings, the ranking member of the Commerce \nCommittee, Senator Snowe, the chair of the Oceans and Fisheries \nSubcommittee, for her work, Senator McCain, Senator Stevens, and \nSenator Breaux, who developed and introduced the legislation to \nimplement the Panama Declaration, and perhaps a special thanks goes to \nSenator John Kerry, the ranking member of the Oceans and Fisheries \nSubcommittee whose patience and guidance and leadership was critical to \nbringing all sides together in reaching this agreement.\n  So this is a very good moment for us. It is another opportunity to \ndemonstrate the commitment that we have in working together to face \nthese serious questions in a meaningful way. So, to all of those \ninvolved, especially Senators Boxer, Biden, and Kerry, my thanks. I \nhope we can address this matter now by an overwhelming vote here in the \nSenate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the committee \namendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, and was \nread the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass? The yeas and nays have been ordered. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

SHORT TITLE; REFERENCES.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the \n     ``International Dolphin Conservation Program Act''.\n       (b) References to Marine Mammal Protection Act.--Except as \n     otherwise expressly provided, whenever in this Act an \n     amendment or repeal is expressed in terms of an amendment to, \n     or repeal of, a section or other provision, the reference \n     shall be considered to be made to a section or other \n     provision of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 \n     U.S.C. 1361 et seq.).\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSES AND FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to give effect to the Declaration of Panama, signed \n     October 4, 1995, by the Governments of Belize, Colombia, \n     Costa Rica, Ecuador, France, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Spain, \n     the United States of America, Vanuatu, and Venezuela, \n     including the establishment of the International Dolphin \n     Conservation Program, relating to the protection of dolphins \n     and other species, and the conservation and management of \n     tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean;\n       (2) to recognize that nations fishing for tuna in the \n     eastern tropical Pacific Ocean have achieved significant \n     reductions in dolphin mortality associated with that fishery; \n     and\n       (3) to eliminate the ban on imports of tuna from those \n     nations that are in compliance with the International Dolphin \n     Conservation Program.\n       (b) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the nations that fish for tuna in the eastern tropical \n     Pacific Ocean have achieved significant reductions in dolphin \n     mortality associated with the purse seine fishery from \n     hundreds of thousands annually to fewer than 5,000 annually;\n       (2) the provisions of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of \n     1972 that impose a ban on imports from nations that fish for \n     tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean have served as an \n     incentive to reduce dolphin mortalities;\n       (3) tuna canners and processors of the United States have \n     led the canning and processing industry in promoting a \n     dolphin-safe tuna market; and\n       (4) 12 signatory nations to the Declaration of Panama, \n     including the United States, agreed under that Declaration to \n     require that the total annual dolphin mortality in the purse \n     seine fishery for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical \n     Pacific Ocean not exceed 5,000 animals, with the objective of \n     progressively reducing dolphin mortality to a level \n     approaching zero through the setting of annual limits and \n     with the goal of eliminating dolphin mortality.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       Section 3 (16 U.S.C. 1362) is amended by adding at the end \n     the following new paragraphs:\n       ``(28) The term `International Dolphin Conservation \n     Program' means the international program established by the \n     agreement signed in LaJolla, California, in June, 1992, as \n     formalized, modified, and enhanced in accordance with the \n     Declaration of Panama.\n       ``(29) The term `Declaration of Panama' means the \n     declaration signed in Panama City, Republic of Panama, on \n     October 4, 1995.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport H.R. 2169.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2169) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Transportation and related agencies for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 1998, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, included in the fiscal year 1998 \nTransportation appropriations bill is an amendment that directs the \nFederal Aviation Administration [FAA] to work with one segment of the \naviation industry to develop an expeditious way to comply with the \npilot record sharing legislation, enacted last year.\n  When we passed the pilot record sharing legislation as part of the \nFAA Reauthorization Act, ``air carriers'' were required to obtain \ncertain records, including FAA records, on pilots. The term air carrier \nincludes more than just airlines. It also includes, for example, on-\ndemand non-scheduled carriers. These carriers tend to hire pilots on an \nas-needed basis, and need the information from the FAA in a more timely \nmanner than airlines.\n  The FAA is aware that these carriers need to be able to respond \nquickly to information requests from the on-demand segment of the \nindustry, and are striving to get the required information to them \nwithin 15 days. Ultimately, the information should be available on a \nreal time basis through desk top computers. The amendment recognizes \nthat the FAA must work with industry to figure out a means to comply \nwith the law, and then implement those changes.\n  There are many ways for the FAA to facilitate the passing of the \ninformation, and discussions should commence with the industry. \nCompliance is critical, but we cannot ask the impossible of the \nindustry or the FAA. I also want to note that the directive in the \nAppropriations bill does not authorize any new program, but merely \ndirects the FAA to work with the industry to implement last year's \nlegislation. As a result, I do not believe that we are legislating on \nan Appropriations bill.\n  I want to thank the chairman, Senator Shelby, and the ranking member, \nSenator Lautenberg, for their acceptance of the amendment.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, the Senate has accepted an amendment that \nSenator Moynihan and I offered to the fiscal year 1998 Transportation \nappropriations bill that I believe will help provide a measure of \nfinancial relief to the working men and women of Nassau, Suffolk, \nWestchester, Putnam and Dutchess counties. Residents of these counties \npay a premium price to commute each day into New York City by commuter \nrailroad. Roughly half of these commuters then have to pay another fare \nto get to their final destination by bus or subway. Our amendment will \nrequire the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority [MTA] to \nconduct a study to determine the feasibility of providing a free subway \nor bus transfer to those persons who use the Long Island Rail Road \n[LIRR] or Metro North commuter railroad so that these daily riders may \ndecrease their commuting costs.\n  Recently, the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority [MTA] \nannounced its MetroCard Gold program. This program for the first time \nprovides free transfers for those who transfer between New York City \nbuses and subways. In essence, the commuter who until now commuted from \na two-fare zone now pays only one fare. This program will greatly \nbenefit city commuters, saving them approximately $750 per year. It \nwill also have a positive impact on the local economy and the \nenvironment.\n  In addition, at my urging, the MTA will extend this single fare \npolicy for similar bus-to-bus and bus-to-subway transfers for the MTA's \n40,000 Long Island Bus commuters traveling between Long Island and New \nYork City. It is estimated that these commuters will realize an average \nyearly savings of approximately $900 based on current fare structures.\n  The intended goal of this policy is to create a seamless, integrated \ntransportation system that will benefit commuters in the most transit-\ndependent region of our country and, indeed, the world. I commend \nGovernor George Pataki and MTA Chairman Virgil Conway for this forward \nthinking initiative. What now needs to be determined is if this policy \ncan be expanded. My amendment will require the Metropolitan \nTransportation Authority [MTA] to conduct a feasibility study, from \nfunds made available to the MTA from the Federal Transit \nAdministration, on extending this policy to New York's two commuter \nrailroads.\n  New York is home to the two largest commuter railroads in the \nNation--the Long Island Rail Road [LIRR] and the Metro North railroad. \nEach day, approximately 235,000 commuters depend on these two railroads \nto get to work and back home again. Almost half of these commuters--\n108,000 or 46 percent--transfer to subways and buses once they arrive \nin New York City. They also repeat the trip in the evening as they head \nback to the train station. These are commuters who may pay $125, $175, \n$225 or more per month to take these two commuter railroads. On top of \nthat, they can pay an additional $750 over the course of a year for \nthat portion of their commute that occurs on the city's subways and \nbuses.\n  If we really want to create a seamless transit system, one that \nencourages more people to take the train and leave their cars at home, \nthen Metro North and Long Island Rail Road commuters should be offered \na free transfer to the City's subways and buses. In addition to the \nfinancial savings for commuters, the benefits to public health, the \nenvironment and the preservation of natural resources as well as the \nenhancements to the quality of life for these commuters should be \npowerful incentives to extend this single-fare policy.\n  More than 100,000 Long Island Rail Road and Metro North rail \ncommuters use New York's subway and bus systems daily. If it is \nfeasible--and taking into consideration all factors--then the commuters \nwho use Long Island Rail Road [LIRR] or Metro North and the New York \nCity subway or bus systems should receive similar benefits as are \navailable under the MTA's single-fare policy. This amendment will move \nus one step closer to that goal.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to ask the distinguished \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation appropriations if he \nwould respond to questions that I have regarding the bill.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I would be happy to respond to the questions from the \nSenator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I first want to thank the chairman for his work in \ndeveloping this major appropriations bill that\n\n[[Page S8312]]\n\nis so vital to our Nation's economic productivity and quality of life. \nThis was an important undertaking that presented many difficult issues. \nI applaud him for his patience and his willingness to meet with me and \nmy constituents in California on one of those issues involving a fixed-\nguideway transit project.\n  As the chairman knows, my State has many requests for transportation \ninvestments, particularly in the area of bus and bus facilities. I \nwould like to bring to the chairman's attention two projects in \nparticular which were not funded in either the Senate or the House \nbills. The first was a request from the Los Angeles Metropolitan \nTransit Operators Coalition, which represents 8 municipal transit \noperators serving more than 63 million passengers annually in 36 cities \nof Los Angeles County. The coalition was formed to obtain economies of \nscale in procuring replacement and expansion buses and to provide \ncritical alternative fuel facilities. These clean-fuel buses are vital \nfor the Los Angeles area which has the most severe air pollution in the \ncountry. The second project involves replacement and expansion buses \nfor the growing city of Santa Clarita.\n  I ask the chairman if he would support some funding for these two \nprojects when he meets in conference with the House on the \nTransportation appropriations bill?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I understand the Senator's concerns about funding for bus \nand bus facilities in California and the subcommittee did face very \ndifficult choices for funding. I will be happy to work with the Senator \non these issues in the conference committee.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator and ask if he would respond to an \nadditional question.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I would be happy to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. As the Senator knows, the advanced technology transit bus \n[ATTB] under development in California has the potential to be the \nnext-generation urban transit bus. It has already demonstrated its \nability to provide maintenance savings, accommodation for the disabled, \nand to be a platform for a variety of clean-fuel technologies. The \ncommittee agreed at my request to provide some funding for the project \nunder the bus program. I now understand that the chairman did meet the \nPresident's request for full funding of the project at $10 million \nunder the Transit Planning and Research Program and ask that he support \ntransferring the $2 million earmarked elsewhere for the ATTB in the bus \nprogram funding to Foothill Transit.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Yes, the committee fully funded the President's request \nunder the Transit Planning and Research Program. I will be happy to \nwork with the distinguished Senator from California during conference \ncommittee consideration of this issue.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator for his continued cooperation and \nleadership on the Transportation appropriations bill.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Let me make a couple comments. Since we are down to a few \nminutes, there will not be the time for detail which I will go into \nlater.\n  Yesterday, Senator Breaux and I introduced S. 1084 entitled the \n``Ozone and Particulate Matter Research Act of 1997.'' This bill offers \na simple solution to a very serious problem. I think there is a large \nsegment of the population out there that will consider this bill to be \nsingly the most significant of this legislative session.\n  In essence, this legislation provides the authority and resources to \nconduct the necessary scientific research and monitoring for the \nnational ambient air quality standards for ozone and particulate \nmatter. It reinstates the preexisting standards for both pollutants and \nrequires the agency to wait until the research is complete before they \nrevise the standards.\n  The bill creates an independent panel which will be convened by the \nNational Academy of Sciences to prioritize the needed particulate \nmatter research. This would take the politics out of setting research \npriorities. Next, a panel will be created to oversee the Federal \nresearch program in order to ensure that the priorities set out will be \nfollowed.\n  Mr. President, just to bring us up to date here in this short period \nof time, last November the Administrator of the EPA came out with a \nmessage on behalf of the administration stating that we should change \nour ambient air standards so far as ozone and particulate matter are \nconcerned. In particulate matter, it would mean that we\n\n[[Page S8313]]\n\nwould drop it down from 10 microns to 2.5 microns. In ozone, which is \nmeasured by parts per million, it would drop it down from .12 to .08.\n  While that sounds technical and a little confusing to some people, \nthe bottom line is that many counties throughout the United States \nwould find themselves out of attainment with these new standards. I can \ntell you, when I was mayor of the city of Tulsa and we were out of \nattainment, how difficult it was. There was not any possibility of \nrecruiting any new industry. A lot of industries had been shut down or \nhad to reduce the number of shifts they had. We had to impose various \nrequirements for car pooling and impose things that really changed the \nlifestyle of our citizens.\n  The problem is that when the Administrator came out with the proposed \nnew standards in November, we did some research only to find out that \nthere is no scientific justification for lowering the standards. In \nfact, as the chairman of the Clean Air Subcommittee of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee, I held my first hearing, a scientific \nhearing, where we had members of CASAC--that is the Clean Air \nScientific Advisory Committee--to come in and advise us as to what the \nscience is behind these recommended changes, only to find that there is \nno scientific consensus behind these recommended changes. In fact, \nthese experts said there is no bright line, as they call it, for ozone \nlevels beyond which it can be said to be detrimental to human health. \nAs far as particulate matter is concerned, they say there is no science \nthat concludes that there is any causal relationship between any level \nor type of 2.5-micron particulate matter and respiratory diseases. When \nasked how long it would take to establish such conclusions, they said \nit would be approximately 5 years before we should know.\n  Consequently, we feel that legislation is warranted to postpone any \ndecision to set an arbitrary new standard for these pollutants. Instead \nwe need more study and this bill provides for it. Clearly, as you can \nsee from the original sponsor and cosponsor as well as from those \nbehind a corresponding bill in the other body, this is a bipartisan \neffort. It is a bipartisan effort that wants clean air, that wants us \nto make sure that we do not impose any hardships on the American people \nwhich are going to be costly and make us noncompetitive on a global \nbasis, inconvenience the American people, and cost us billions of \ndollars unless there is some scientific justification for it.\n  I have been critical of EPA. When their proposed rules first came \nout, the Agency claimed the new standards were needed to prevent 40,000 \npremature deaths per year due to respiratory problems. Then some months \nlater they changed that to 20,000 deaths, and then recently they \nknocked that down again to a much smaller amount. At the same time, a \nresearch group called the Reason Foundation out in California concluded \nthat a more accurate figure would be no more than 1,000 premature \ndeaths, if that. So there has been a lot of scare talk around. And a \nlot of misinformation.\n  We hear many say that those of us who differ with the EPA don't want \ndirty air. Let me assure you, Mr. President, I have four kids and six \ngrandkids. I do not want dirty air either. I care about their health \nand well-being as much, I dare say, as any public servant shuffling \npaper in some Federal agency. What I am concerned about is that we \napproach this issue in a rational and orderly manner. We should do the \nscience first, we should know what's causing the problem, we should be \nclear about what is needed to address the problem and then take action \nwith a proper consideration of all the consequences--both wanted and \nunwanted. What we don't want to do is put ourselves in a position where \nour philosophy is ``ready, fire and aim'' instead of the more \nreasonable ``ready, aim and fire.'' Unfortunately, the EPA wants to \nshoot first and ask questions later. This is not right.\n  In the House of Representatives, on a bipartisan basis, H.R. 1984 was \nintroduced, and this bill is very similar to the bill we are \nintroducing.\n  So I would like to suggest to you, Mr. President, that there is going \nto be a lot of activity during the August recess, a lot of education \ngoing on to make sure that people understand what is about to happen \nand to make sure we don't go ahead and adopt standards that are \nartificially reduced with inadequate science to justify those reduced \nstandards.\n  Mr. President, 12 o'clock being near, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have plenty of time. I wonder if the Senator from \nOklahoma desires additional time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would like to have 5 additional minutes if I may.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  To give you an idea of how this issue has been distorted, it was \nstated by the administration that, in the event that we do adopt the \nlower standards for ozone and particulate matter, they said it would \nonly cost $9 billion. Yet, last week, when we had Mary Nichols, the \nEPA's Assistant Secretary for Air, she stated that the cost would be \n$9.1 billion, a very uneven number, making us believe there is some \nscientific reason for that, when, in fact, the Reason Foundation, out \nin California, concluded, in its study, that the cost is not going to \nbe $9.1 billion if we adopt these standards. Instead, they say it is \ngoing to be somewhere between $90 and $150 billion. In fact, the \nPresident's own Council of Economic Advisers put the cost at $60 \nbillion for the ozone standard alone.\n  If we split the difference between the $90 and the $150 billion, that \nmeans that for a family of four on average income, it would cost them \napproximately $1,600 a year--$1,600 a year--to do something for which \nthere is not adequate science to justify it. Second, the \nadministration, in their scare tactics, back in November, said in the \nevent we do not do this, it is going to result in 40,000 premature \ndeaths a year. In December, they dropped that down to 20,000 premature \ndeaths a year. In April, it came down to 15,000 premature deaths a \nyear. Again, many groups now say it is less than 1,000.\n  It was kind of interesting, because when we had the people who are \ntrying to claim the number of premature deaths that would be there if \nwe did not lower these ozone and particulate matter standards, I \ndescribed the death of my beloved mother-in-law, which took place on \nNew Year's Day. She was 94 years old. It was one of those deaths that \nwas a real blessing; the time was here. Yet, the circumstances under \nwhich she died would have qualified her, according to these so-called \nexperts, to be counted as a premature death.\n  I think we have also been told things that are not true by the \nadministration, when they say how many people are going to be affected. \nI have a chart here that we found by some accident, of the Southeastern \npart of the United States. This came out of the EPA. This is not my \nchart. What they are trying to say is only the counties, if we lower \nthese standards, in the dark green would be affected in terms of having \nto come into compliance. Now we see these concentric circles around \nhere covering more than half of this whole region, admitting at one \npoint there would have to be some controls. They call this level 1 \ncontrol region; level 2 control region--this would be level 2. In other \nwords, the areas actually subject to some form of regulation under \nthese new standards are much larger than people are sometimes being led \nto believe. So we are getting information that is certainly not \nconsistent with the facts.\n  Another criticism I have with the administration is how they have \ntried to sell this idea by singling out certain people. Certainly the \nPresiding Officer, being from Kansas, and the former chairman of the \nHouse Agriculture Committee, understands that this would have a \ntremendous effect on the agricultural community throughout the United \nStates. You would have Government saying when you can disk, when you \ncan till, when you can burn off a field, when you can use fertilizers, \nwhen you can harvest a crop. I can tell you right now, if you ask the \naverage farmer in America what his biggest problem is, it's not the \ntaxes; it's the overregulation that takes away his\n\n[[Page S8314]]\n\nfreedoms. I have often said, every time you increase regulation, you \ntake away a degree of individual freedoms. That is exactly what they \nhave done.\n  So we have an administration which now says to the farmers, don't \nworry, we are going to exempt you; you are not going be affected by \nthis. Then they went to the U.S. Conference of Mayors--and I have to \nsay that I used to be the token conservative on the board of directors \nof the U.S. Conference of Mayors when I was mayor of Tulsa, OK. It's \nnot really a conservative operation. Yet, they voted, in San Francisco, \noverwhelmingly, to reject these standards, and these are the mostly \nDemocrats talking, not Republicans.\n  Why are they concerned about it? They are concerned about it because \nthey know if we bring these standards down, those mayors are going to \nbe running cities that will be out of attainment. This will be another, \nprobably the most severe, of what they call the unfunded mandates that \nhas been out there.\n  The administration also tried to single out small business, to say \nthis is not going to affect small business. They even said that to one \nof the Congressmen from Louisiana: Well, you have seven parishes, but \ndon't worry, we won't make you do anything, we'll get the people to the \nwest so when the air flows over it is going to clean up your air. So it \nhas been a very dishonest campaign by the administration. I really \nbelieve during the August recess we are going to be able to show the \nAmerican people what this is really all about.\n  Last year we passed two significant laws. One is called SBREFA, the \nSmall Business Regulatory Enforcement Act--SBREFA. The thrust of this \nbill is you can't pass a new rule, a new regulation, unless you explain \nits effect on small business. So, during one of our committee meetings, \nwe asked the Director of the EPA, ``Why is it that you have not \nexplained what the effect of this will be on small business?'' The \nresponse was, ``There is no effect on small business.''\n  I can assure you, Mr. President, all these farms that are small \nbusinesses--I can assure you, any small business that has an electric \nbill, when they say this is going to increase the electric bills by \nsomewhere between 8 and 10 percent, that's an impact on small business. \nThe response of the EPA is, ``Wait a minute, all we are saying to the \nStates is you have to come into attainment. You have to figure out how \nto do it. And whatever you do to your citizens to make that happen is \nyour responsibility. So we--the EPA--are not the ones saying we are \nimposing a hardship.''\n  We passed another bill, the unfunded mandates bill, that says we \ncannot pass regulations here that result in an unfunded mandate to \npolitical subdivisions below the Federal Government. Consequently, I \ncan assure you, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Association \nof Governors, and the National Association of State Legislators, the \nNational League of Cities and all these groups that are so concerned \nabout this, they know exactly what an unfunded mandate is.\n  I anticipate, when the time comes that these standards are put into \neffect, or set, that there are going to be some lawsuits. I think the \nAmerican Truckers Association already stated they are going to be suing \nthe EPA. So my concern is, with all these lawsuits that will take \nplace, that we resolve this issue to some satisfaction now, before we \nget locked in endless litigation. the best way to avoid this happening, \nthe best way to avoid these arbitrary, onerous, and unjustified \nregulations, would be to go ahead and pass this legislation, which is \nS. 1084.\n  I believe S. 1084 and H.R. 1984 will be passed, and I think they will \nbe passed with a large enough margin to sustain a veto.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/30/senate-section/article/S8312-4", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET ACT OF 1997--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

The Senator from Minnesota is recognized to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to give my congratulations to the \nchairman of the Budget Committee and all the others who have worked so \nhard over the last couple of weeks to work out an especially very \nimportant tax package, which I believe is going to be a step in the \nright direction of relieving some of the tax burden placed on American \nfamilies over the last several years.\n  So with that, Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for \nthe tax relief package that will be coming before the Senate tomorrow. \nI want to take this opportunity, again, to commend and thank the \nmajority leader,\n\n[[Page S8315]]\n\nChairman Domenici, Chairman Roth, and the negotiators for the \nadministration for all of their efforts to bring us to this historic \npoint here today.\n  Mr. President, when my good friend Tim Hutchinson and I went to the \nfloor as freshmen members of the House in June 1993 to introduce a \nbudget plan we called Putting Jobs and the American Family First, I \ncould never have guessed the long road we would have to travel to reach \nthe point we find ourselves at today--on the verge of enacting the $500 \nper-child tax credit that served as the centerpiece of our 1993 \nlegislation.\n  Our proposal did not have a lot of support in Washington in 1993, and \nfamily tax relief did not even make the radar screen of most lawmakers. \nBut that was not important, because we had support where it mattered \nthe most: with the American taxpayers. In the years since, I have \nwatched the enthusiasm for the $500 per-child tax credit continue to \ngrow until it could no longer be ignored here in Washington. After \nbeing embraced by the President and congressional leaders in both \nparties, 1997 is the year in which the $500 per-child tax credit will \nfinally become law.\n  I have been pleased with many of the changes we been able to bring \nabout in our Government during my service in Congress--but the vote \nwe'll take tomorrow on our tax relief plan charts an important new \ncourse. This week, we fulfill what I consider to be a fundamental \npromise we made 2\\1/2\\ years ago to the American taxpayers: that \nWashington would finally listen to the people and let them keep a \nlittle bit more of their own money at the end of the day.\n  This legislation is a victory--not for the Senate, or the House, or \nthe President, but for the working families of America. Those are the \nmen and women who go to work every day--and sometimes to a second job \nat night--in the summer when the heat is horrific and the winter when \nthe car will not start and the snow is piled up to their knees. They \nput in their 8 hours and often stay for another 3 or 4 for the overtime \nif they are struggling to save for a new furnace or the kids need \nbraces. They do not ask for much--just to be treated fairly. These are \nthe folks who look at their checkbooks each week and wonder ``Where did \nit all go?''--the same folks who stare at their tax returns each April \nand ask ``How come the government takes so much?''\n  Thanks to the $500 per-child tax credit, the Government will be \ntaking a little less on tax day.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased with the improved $500 per-child tax \ncredit provision contained in the fiscal year 1998 reconciliation \nconference agreement. It is a needed improvement over the Senate-passed \nversion, which I voted against in June.\n  At that time, I opposed the Senate tax bill because of the way it \nrestricted the use of the $500 per-child tax credit, and in the \nprocess, diluted its value. The Senate plan offered a $250 tax credit \nin 1997 for children under the age of 13, which increased to $500 per-\nchild in 1999. For children age 13 to 16, the tax credit was available \nonly if parents dedicated it toward their children's education. While I \nfully support the idea of putting away those tax credit dollars for \ncollege, I do not believe the Government should mandate exactly how the \ntaxpayers should spend their own money. That is not the place of \nCongress and the President.\n  When I cast my vote against the Senate's tax cut bill in June, it was \nto send a signal to budget negotiators that we must craft a $500 per-\nchild tax credit that does more for working families. With the recent \nimprovements made by the House and the Senate, it is clear Washington \nfinally got the message--as a result, more families will keep more of \ntheir hard-earned tax dollars.\n  The $500 per-child tax credit remains the centerpiece of the our tax \nrelief plan. Under the agreement, working families will be provided a \n$400 per-child credit in 1998, which increases to $500 per-child in \n1999 for dependent children below age 17. The credit is phased out for \nfamilies earning more than $110,000 per year. The result is that the \nfamilies of 43 million children nationwide will receive more than $70 \nbillion in tax credits over the next 5 years.\n  It is the Nation's middle-income families who will benefit most once \nthis provision is enacted. In my State of Minnesota, nearly 700,000 \nchildren from middle-class families will be the primary beneficiaries. \nThose families will see over $300 million in tax relief. That is $300 \nmillion that will not go to Washington to fund the priorities of the \nFederal Government. Instead, families can use that money to fund their \nown priorities, whether that is groceries, medical expenses, insurance, \nor education.\n  An additional 170,000 Minnesota children will receive the tax credit \nunder this expanded version than would have under President Clinton's \nplan.\n  Another notable improvement is that the agreement broadens the child \ntax credit to low-income families.\n  When Senators Hutchinson, Coats, and I introduced our most recent \nversion of the child tax relief legislation earlier this year, we urged \nCongress to provide immediate tax relief to families effective in 1997, \nprovide it to as many families with children under age 18 as it \npossibly can, regardless of their income, and make it available against \nall taxes paid by workers, including payroll taxes. I am pleased the \nagreement adopted our proposal and offset this tax relief by tightening \nthe earned income tax credit.\n  For a typical family of four, the $500 per-child tax credit means \n$1,000 in tax relief, which would pay 1 month's mortgage and grocery \nbills, or 11 months' worth of electric bills, or nearly 20 months' \nworth of clothing for the children.\n  More significantly, the $500 per-child tax credit will reverse a 16-\nyear tide of rising Federal taxes to finally reduce a family's total \nFederal income tax burden. This is the first tax cut in 16 years, but, \nin the meantime, there have been 10 tax increases in that 16 years. \nThis begins to reverse the tide.\n  For a family of four earning $30,000 per year, $1,000 in tax relief \nwould cut their income tax burden by 51 percent. Meanwhile, a family of \nfour earning $40,000 would see their tax burden cut by 30 percent, a \nfamily earning $75,000 would see their tax burden reduced by 12 \npercent, and a family earning $100,000 per year would receive a tax cut \nof 7.4 percent.\n  This tax relief will restore some fairness for the taxpayers of my \nState. Over the past several decades, the Federal tax load on Minnesota \nresidents has grown larger and larger while their share of Federal \nspending has gotten smaller and smaller. Minnesotans last year paid an \naverage of $5,563 per person in taxes to the Federal Government, $203 \nmore than the national average. But Minnesota received back only 78 \ncents in Federal spending for every $1 its taxpayers sent to \nWashington, among the lowest return of any State. This regional \ndisparity is an additional financial burden to Minnesota residents.\n  Mr. President, I also applaud the inclusion in the agreement of \nimportant pro-economic-growth and pro-prosperity tax provisions such as \ncapital gains relief and estate tax reduction. Although these tax cuts \nare rather small and hardly keep pace with inflation, it is nonetheless \na move in the right direction. These tax cuts will spur job creation \nand economic growth. In doing so, they will reduce the cost of capital, \nincrease worker productivity, and provide higher salaries for the \nAmerican people.\n  However, I believe Congress could have done much more in the way of \ntax relief for working Americans if Washington would just spend less \nand allow working families to keep more of their hard-earned money.\n  I personally would prefer a full and immediate $500 per-child tax \ncredit for all families with children under 18 without any \nrestrictions, zero capital gains tax, elimination of the death tax, and \nending double taxation. But those battles will have to wait for another \nday.\n  My greatest disappointment with the tax deal is that it contains no \nreal tax reform. Instead of simplifying the Tax Code, this tax bill \nincreases its complexity. Tax policy is still used as a tool for the \nredistribution of private incomes and for social engineering. Nothing \nis done to end the IRS as we know it. Unfortunately, these defects \ngreatly diminish the positive impacts of the tax bill. I pledge to \ncontinue to work with my colleagues on real tax reform in the future.\n\n[[Page S8316]]\n\n  Although the tax relief in the improved bill is still tiny when \ncompared against both the total tax burden of the American taxpayers \nand total Government spending, it is the first time in 16 years that \nthe Government has acknowledged that working families are being heavily \novertaxed. That is reason enough to celebrate.\n  Mr. President, ever since the people of Minnesota sent me to \nrepresent them in Congress--first in the House and now in the Senate--\nAmericans have been writing me to share their dreams for themselves and \nfor their nation. Their letters fill dozens of files in my office. Some \nof the most passionate stories have come from families--working \nfamilies who heard that I had proposed a $500 per child tax credit and \nwanted to tell me what a difference such a seemingly simple piece of \nlegislation would make in their lives.\n\n  I would like to share just a few of their letters. A family in \nIllinois wrote:\n\n       We are a one-paycheck family struggling to keep our heads \n     above water . . . It is encouraging to know there are members \n     of the government who understand our struggle and are working \n     on our behalf.\n\n  ``Thank you for your efforts in trying to help families receive a tax \ncredit of $500 per child,'' wrote another family, this one from Texas. \n``As parents of three children, we truly appreciate your endeavors in a \ntime when other politicians are trying to get more and more of our \nhard-earned money.''\n  From Michigan came this letter:\n\n       There are not very many people in Washington who remember \n     the pro-family community--and even fewer in Washington who \n     will support the family.\n\n  And a family in my own State of Minnesota sent me this heartfelt \nletter:\n\n       As the mother of seven children with one income, I am \n     especially interested in the $500 per child tax credit. We \n     refuse to accept aid from federal or state programs that we \n     qualify for.\n\n       We believe this country was built with hard work and \n     sacrifice, not sympathy and handouts. We also believe that we \n     can spend this money more effectively than the government, \n     which has only succeeded in creating a permanent dependent \n     welfare class with our money over the last 40 years. Let us \n     get back to basics.\n\n  Let us get back to basics.\n  I think ``getting back to basics'' is what this debate is all about, \nMr. President. The American family has always been our Nation's most \nbasic level of government. The power begins with the family and it \nought to remain with the family at the end of the day. By enacting the \n$500 per child tax credit into law, Congress and the President will at \nlast send a message to real Americans--the folks outside the confines \nof this Capitol--that we understand what it means to be a working \nfamily in the 1990's, that we know government demands too much while \ndelivering too little, and that we can put aside the politics that too \noften divide us and do what is right by the American taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, the $500 per child tax credit is not going to make \nanybody rich, but we cannot measure its value in just dollars and \ncents. After 16 years without a drop of tax relief, we are finally \ngoing to let the taxpayers keep a little bit more of their own money at \nthe end of the day. From the vantage point of this Senator, that is a \npriceless investment in the American family.\n  Again, after 4 years of hard work to bring about at least this \nportion of the tax bill, which has been called ``the crown jewel,'' we \nare going to finally succeed in giving the American family some hard-\nearned tax relief.\n  Thank you, very much, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, thank you for recognizing me.\n  I want to make an announcement for Senators. The bill--the very large \nbill that you have seen kind of appear on the desk--is available to \nthose who have access to the Internet. You can view the bill through a \nlink in the Budget Committee office. You can do it in your own offices \non the Budget Committee home page, and the bill will be here no longer \nthan a half-hour from now in sufficient numbers for those who want to \nview it in its entirety.\n  As you know, the House is voting on the bill now--debating and voting \non it. Then it will officially be transmitted to us. We have decided to \nstart debating this so that we could all use this time during the day \nand not have to be here all night to get this done in a timely manner.\n  Mr. President, I want to make a few observations. Obviously, Senator \nLautenberg will have his, and then I would like very much to say to \nSenators that we are using time out of the 10 hours allowed.\n  I understand from our majority leader that we intend to get this bill \ndone, if possible, tonight; if not, clearly tomorrow morning. So that \nmeans we are going to spend a lot of time here on the floor between now \nand the time we quit tonight.\n  So, if Senators have comments they would like to make, or if they \nhave questions, I would particularly suggest if you have questions with \nreference to the Byrd rule--one of the rules that apply to these bills \nthat do not apply anywhere else because it has to do with a special \ntest for extraneousness--I wish they would talk with us, or talk with \nSenator Lautenberg's staff or our respective leadership offices about \nthe Byrd rule violations that we are aware of and kind of documented \nnow. We would all like to have a chance to work together on them. When \nit comes to that issue, I would like to make the following statement so \nthat everybody understands. I am sure my friend, Senator Lautenberg, \nwill concur.\n  The White House has been involved from the very beginning in the \npreparation of this legislation. And from time to time both the \nRepublicans and the White House have been involved with Democratic \nlegislators. But let me make it very clear. This is a historic document \nin another procedural context because last evening the White House \nstaff stayed until late in the evening--in fact, until the early \nmorning hours--before they would sign off on this. They read every \nsingle word of legislative language. And, indeed, they read every word \nin the accompanying report language. Frankly, I have been around here a \nlong time and working with administrations and the White House with \nlegislation up here, and I think this may be the first time that has \never happened.\n  I only say that because, obviously, it was hard to put this package \ntogether. In the process there are many wordsmiths, and there are many \nthings that have to be put together in terms of language. But every bit \nof it, including those few instances where there are Byrd rule \nviolations--and that sounds rather ominous, but it really means that we \nhave a technical rule that says you ought not be legislating in this \nbill. You ought to be doing deficit reduction. And on some occasions it \nis hard to keep that altogether and not fall into something that is \nlegislative in a 1,000-page document.\n  So let me stop the process part, and just remind Senators who would \nlike to speak today if you have some thoughts and things that you want \nthe public to hear from the floor of the Senate, as soon as you can \nstart calling us for time, we would be very, very glad to accommodate. \nAnd I think we can accommodate most people on a rather short notice \nbecause from my standpoint I have said an awful lot. I don't intend to \nbe here on the floor saying a lot more. I am just trying to get this \nbill completed.\n  But let me start by saying this morning that the headline in the \nWashington Post, which has not been very supportive of this, used five \nvery nice words. They said, ``This is a Big Deal.'' Maybe they don't \nlike the ``big deal,'' but it is nice that they recognize what all of \nus know--that this is a big deal for the American people. It carries \nout a bipartisan budget agreement that in itself was historic between \nthe President and the leadership of Congress back in May. It is a big \ndeal in this town when we could do what the American people asked us to \ndo, and that is to work together to live by our commitments, to reduce \nspending and reduce taxes, and get our work done.\n  So it is pretty obvious that this is a big deal. It balances the \nbudget for the first time in 30 years. And I know there are many who \nwill continue to be skeptical until that day arrives. Frankly, I am \nhere saying I am a pretty good budgeteer. I understand all of these \nnuances about budgeting, and how the economy impacts on it--how \ninflation impacts, how the growth in the economy impacts. But absent a \nreal major\n\n[[Page S8317]]\n\ncatastrophe, which nobody can plan for, this budget will be balanced. \nFrankly, it is because of a number of things. The economy is doing \nsplendidly. That could change. But it looks like things are in place \nlike they haven't been for a long, long time in terms of those things \nthat make an economy go into recession or into an inflationary cycle. \nAnd we are not growing out of control. It is kind of a measure of good \nsolid growth.\n\n  So I think we are entitled to use conservative estimates for the next \n5 years, which we have done, Mr. President. The economics in this \nbill's projections for the future are not overly optimistic. So when \nyou add it up, for those who say we have some new programs and we spend \nsome money, that is correct. For some there isn't enough by way of \ncutting the budget in this--cutting the expenditures. But I will get to \nthat in a minute.\n  Just remember, it is a Democratic President elected by the people and \na Republican-controlled Congress with Democrats in the minority who had \nto put a package together that did something significant, or spend the \nnext 3\\1/2\\ years, in my opinion, doing nothing. We would have been \naround here fighting. We would have at every juncture on every bill \nhave had stalemates. We might have even closed down Government again.\n  So from my standpoint, if you look at 10 years--and I am not saying \neverything in these 10 years is locked in stone, but 5 years of it is--\nwe reduce what we would have otherwise spent by about $1 trillion. This \ntime we have not included in that estimate the savings that will come \nfrom debt service because as you reduce the amount that you borrow you \ntake off of that baseline that had calculated in it interest.\n  Yes, this balanced budget is a bipartisan budget agreement. We \nfollowed it as well as any differing groups could follow it. We put it \ntogether with a different group than had to implement it. So that is \nnot easy, for they always second-guess us and claim they should have \nbeen in. I wish everybody in the Senate could have been in on the \nnegotiating. I wish every chairman could have been. I guess as I wish \nit I speak the truth--that had they we wouldn't be here. That is the \nreality of trying to do this kind of thing.\n  But we said in that agreement that we were going to spend $24 \nbillion. We did agree to provide $24 billion in new spending for \nchildren's health programs for insurance. We also agreed to make \nchanges in last year's welfare reform, which results in some additional \nnational spending.\n  I want to correct myself. The bipartisan agreement said $16 billion \nin new spending for child health care coverage. The U.S. Senate voted \nin $24 billion, and the Senate version prevailed in the final outcome \nof negotiations.\n  I note on the floor of the Senate now, along with Senator Lautenberg, \nis the distinguished Senator from Delaware, Senator Bill Roth.\n  Let me make sure that everybody understands that his chairmanship and \nhis committee made this the big deal that it is. I say to the Senator, \nI just commented that finally the Washington Post, after being against \nthis budget, at least recognized one thing. They said, ``It Is a Big \nDeal.'' And I am saying there would have been no big deal without the \nSenator from Delaware and the marvelous bipartisan committee that he \nhas. I thank him right here publicly for that.\n  Let me just go on through. After Senator Lautenberg speaks, our \ndistinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, which had jurisdiction \nover about 85 percent of this bill, wants to speak. I want to yield \nquickly.\n  I want to say, however, that Republicans for a long time said we \nought to balance the budget. It has now become everybody's cry. The \nPresident wants it. Many Democrats want it. But I take a great deal of \npride in behalf of Republicans in my capacity as chairman and ranking \nmember of this Budget Committee.\n  I have been trying to get there for a long time. And I think we have \ndone a great job as Republican leaders in pushing this. That is not \ntrying to detract from those who have joined us, including the \nPresident of late. We also wanted some tax cuts.\n  Many of us thought American families were in desperate need of some \nhelp--especially middle-income American families with kids. We have \ndone that. Again, even though most of that originally started on our \nside of the aisle, I don't tend to, nor do I want to, denigrate the \nfact that it has broad support on the other side, and the President of \nthe United States is supportive of it.\n  The capital gains differential has been part of what Republicans \nthought we should have in this Tax Code for decades. As a matter of \nfact, it is very interesting that we got a capital gains differential \nin this bill. We joined the industrial nations of the world with \ncapitalistic societies that have moved that way already, and I think \nthat bodes well for the future.\n\n  Everybody knows the other provisions that my friend, the chairman, \nwill speak to. But I just wanted to make the point, for those who seem \nfrom time to time to give up on causes and to be for them for a few \nyears and say we can't get them done, I believe Republicans ought to be \nproud of the fact that we have stood pretty fast for those issues, the \nones I just described, and some others, and most of them are coming \ntrue here.\n  That is not to say some issues that the Democratic Party and this \nPresident have pushed very hard for are not in this bill, also. I am \nsure, knowing my friend, Senator Lautenberg, he will remind us--and \nthat is what he ought to do. And those are some things I want, too. I \nam not running around apologetic about trying to cover children that do \nnot have health insurance. I am not sure we know how to do it quite \nright yet, I say to the occupant of the chair, who shares that concern \nwith me, but I think we have to get started, and we have done that.\n  One last thing is we all know the Medicare Program for the seniors of \nAmerica--39 million of them almost right now--we know that program is, \nfor many of them, something they build their confidence on as they get \nolder and as some of them get sick, and as they get sick, they know \nthey have this great hospitalization program. Now, there is no one who \nought to be anything but proud of the fact that we have taken a system \nthat is falling apart financially, and we fixed it for 10 years. It \nprobably would have gone bankrupt in 2, maybe 2\\1/2\\ years, so we fixed \nit for 10 years.\n  Now, I am kind of tempted to say that is a big deal. But I think it \nis. Now, it is not fixed permanently. It still continues to have big \nproblems out there in 15 years, 20 years, but, frankly, I am not \napologizing that a budget resolution and essentially this plan did not \nsolve that. Actually, I do not believe it could have. I believe it is \nsuch a big issue in and of itself that it will be solved only when a \nbipartisan national commission, which is provided for in this bill, \ngoes out into America and tells everybody the problems and comes up \nwith some solutions that are bipartisan that Presidents and Congress \nwill support. We started that here.\n  But I believe in the meantime we had to make that program more \nefficient. We have done that. In fact, we made it $115 billion more \nefficient by changing the rules of the game. In the meantime, we are \ntrying to give seniors the best of health care at the most reasonable \nprices, putting some competition into the program, and that is there, \nalive and kicking and strongly voicing itself in this bill--\ncompetition.\n  So there are HMO's, there are professional provider organizations, \nthere are private fee-for-service programs, and there are PSO's. It \nalso has a demonstration program, a medical savings account of 390,000 \nbeneficiaries.\n  Now, when you put all that together, along with a new $4 billion \npreventive program that I am not going to discuss in detail, we have \ndone fairly well by the people who pay for Medicare, the working \npeople, and pretty well by the seniors. You package this all together--\na balanced budget, which means we are not going to have our children \npaying our bills too much longer. That is what a deficit and a debt \nare. It is asking our kids and our grandkids to pay our bills. A \nbalance says we are not going to do that anymore.\n  Now, it is a long time coming, and we owe a lot of money, so we \ncannot stand up and say to our kids they are not going to pay some of \nour bills, because the debt is so big we cannot get rid of it. But at \nleast we can stop it. So that was No. 1.\n\n[[Page S8318]]\n\n  No. 2 was fix Medicare, and I have described it.\n  No. 3 was to make sure that we had a tax bill that was fair to the \nAmerican people. Frankly, after all the bickering on the edges--and \nthat is what it all was, on the edges. All this argument about how many \nchildren are covered and how far down do you go were really on the \nedges, small, small things, small numbers. The people that need tax \ncuts and tax breaks are the American people earning between $25,000 and \n$30,000 and $110,000. They are the middle-income Americans, two \njobholders, two professionals, two people working, and they are paying \nthe taxes, they are following the rules, and they haven't had anything \nfrom their Government saying we would like to make it a little easier \nfor you--until this bill.\n  Now, they have three very significant new things they can look to. It \nisn't like we are giving them a present. It is saying to them, keep \nsome of your own money and let Government grow less and let you make \nyour decisions on what you do for your children rather than have us \nbuild a bigger and bigger Department of Education. Those are the kinds \nof tradeoffs that are going to occur and are starting to occur, \nalthough, when it comes to education, this bill is strong on college \neducation, strong as anything you can have. When it comes to the new \nprograms appropriations, we have been very generous. We have been very \ngenerous to the education programs that our country has.\n  I am not sure before we vote on this that I will have another chance \nto thank everyone, so I just wish to thank Senator Lautenberg, and I \nthank our distinguished Republican leader--he did a great job--Senator \nRoth, and all the other chairmen, our House counterparts, including \nRepresentative Kasich.\n\n  But I want to make one statement on the floor. It might seem it ought \nto be done on the House floor, but I want to make it here, and I think \nmy friend, Senator Roth, would concur. The Speaker of the House, Newt \nGingrich, in negotiations from the beginning until the end, was \nabsolutely a fantastic leader. I have to say to those who doubt, \nbecause he was under a lot of pressures, I did not notice for a minute \nthat had anything to do with his single-mindedness, his tremendous \nintellect and the way he could put things back together and get us \nmoving in the direction of getting things done. So my compliments to \nthe Republican leadership in both Houses from my side, and obviously we \nhad great support from Democrats.\n  At this point I am going to yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Could I ask the distinguished chairman to yield just for a \nminute?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Of course, yes.\n  Mr. ROTH. There are many people who are responsible for bringing \ntogether this important piece of legislation, and I strongly agree with \nwhat the distinguished Senator from New Mexico said about the Speaker \nand the majority leader. They provided not only strong leadership but \nideas, were able to move ahead, and I have to say I could not agree \nmore that the Speaker showed every ability of providing the kind of \nleadership we needed from the House in order to get this complex piece \nof legislation through.\n  I would just like to say to my distinguished friend and colleague, \nSenator Domenici, that the legislation would have gotten nowhere if it \nhad not been for him. I know no one in the Senate, or House for that \nmatter, that has a better understanding of the budgetary process, knows \nthe issues with which we are dealing and who has devoted, what is it, 7 \nor 8 months' time to getting this job accomplished.\n  I would also like to say in the same context I think Bill Hoagland \nhas been a tremendous strength for this whole process.\n  I, too, join the Senator in congratulating the ranking member, my \ncolleague and friend from New Jersey, for his outstanding work.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, in supporting the conference \nreport on this budget reconciliation bill, which, along with the \nconference report on the tax bill, will finally implement a bipartisan \nplan to balance the budget.\n  I have to ask Senator Domenici, because he talked about the five \nwords that appeared in the Washington Post, I wonder whether it read \nlike this. I heard him say, ``This is a big deal.'' Or did it say, \n``This Is A Big Deal?'' I wasn't sure quite where the emphasis was. But \nI assume it was the way it was intended.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The way I said it.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The way the Senator read it himself as opposed to, \n``This is a Big Deal?''\n  I want to say to Senator Roth, who was pulled from so many \ndirections, I was amazed to see him arrive in one piece each day. He \nlistened with great patience--great patience and great interest. \nEverybody is pleased. I will speak about it from the Democratic side. \nPeople don't realize, when there is a majority and a minority, the \nminority doesn't always get a chance to present their views. But Bill \nRoth, Senator Bill Roth of Delaware, is known as someone who is a fair-\nminded person, and while he would not always agree, he would almost \nalways listen. I have never found him to say ``no,'' and I appreciated \nthat. I think it produced a very good product. It is, under the \ncircumstances, I think, perhaps the best that could have been gotten. \nAll of us wish there were other things in there--everybody. If you ask \nany Member of the Senate whether they did not think there was another \nthing that should have been in or another thing that should have been \nout, they would have, I guarantee, a menu of things they would like to \nselect from.\n  I am so pleased that we are joined in the Chamber by the ranking \nmember of the Finance Committee, my good friend and colleague from New \nYork, Mr. Moynihan. Senator Moynihan is a man with vast knowledge about \nso many things that I often say I would enjoy, even with all my white \nhair, going to college with Professor Moynihan and hearing his views on \nthings. But there is always a background of information that adds so \nmuch to the dialog and the debate, and I congratulate him for his role \nand for his willingness to hear the arguments and to work to try to get \na consensus in the legislation which we now have in front of us.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield without losing his right to the \nfloor?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Be happy to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I note the presence of Senator Moynihan, and I had not \nsaid anything about him in his absence. I would like now to say there \nare many points, as you look at the last 7\\1/2\\ months, when you would \nsay this is critical, this is where it might end. And I believe the \nthing that gave us momentum to get it done was the Finance Committee's \nbipartisan addressing of most of the issues in this bill.\n  Now, I am sure the Senator from New York didn't get everything he \nwants, but I believe it was one of the big turning points when the \nSenator joined with Senator Roth and between the two of them had such a \nlarge cadre of Senators from both sides supporting some very, very \npowerful things, and I thank the Senator personally for that.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, might I thank with great gratitude the \nsenior Senator from New Jersey and my friend from the day I entered \nthis Chamber, the chairman of the committee. They speak to what I think \nis an important fact. But, of course, the person who made it possible \nwas Senator Roth, the chairman of the committee. I was with him in this \nregard and proud to have been. I thank Senators.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, could I say that under the rule under \nthe Budget Act somebody is designated to manage, and I am it for today, \nbut I can give that to someone else. I am giving that to Senator Roth \nuntil I return, and he will be our floor leader now. I thank the \nSenator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will continue to extend \ncongratulations to some who are not here. I have to take my time to \nsalute the efforts of Senator Daschle, who was ever present in his \nencouragement to get this job done--let's see what we can negotiate \ntogether, let's see if we can make this adjustment or that adjustment, \nor talked to his counterpart on the other\n\n[[Page S8319]]\n\nside. And I want to say for Senator Lott, the majority leader, he, too, \nwas someone who wanted to get this bill behind us, get this job done, \nand he has shown his interest in doing that as he runs the Senate from \nthe majority leader's position that we do move things along. There were \nMembers on both sides of the aisle who also helped, too numerous to \nmention, but I think it is fair to say that those whom we have talked \nabout had a significant role.\n  Pete Domenici and I were among the four elected representatives to be \nnegotiating, and we were often closeted days at a time. Though the \natmosphere got stuffy, I think neither one of us did, and we were able \nto continue talking in a civilized fashion.\n  The bill before us is the culmination of those many months of intense \neffort and people of both parties deserve to be proud of this \naccomplishment. This budget proves that when leaders with good will \ncome together, we can overcome partisan divisions and find common \nground. That is good news for all Americans.\n  I will say this. We have gotten a lot of salutations, a lot of \ncompliments about getting this job done. Threaded through those \ncomments were the kinds of remarks that might surprise, like: Finally, \nthe bickering has stopped, there is no partisanship involved; hurrah, \nthe Senate and the House are working to get our interests put up front. \nI think that was kind of a noteworthy thing. It's not that we spend all \nof our time in the boxing ring here. But sometimes, when people's \npositions on legislation get too entrenched, they lose sight of the \nfact that we have to stop the argument and get on with producing a \nproduct. So, I think the Nation is going to be better off because of \nthis.\n  The budget agreement is not perfect. It is not drafted exactly as I, \nas I said, nor any other Senator would have written it. But it is an \nhonorable compromise that, on balance, is an enormous step forward. It \nwill lead to the first balanced budget in this country since 1969. It \ninvests in education and helps ordinary Americans afford college. It \nprovides health coverage for many of America's uninsured children. And \nit provides tax relief for middle-class families. It provides important \nprotections for kids and legal immigrants, people who were invited to \ncome here and who later became disabled. And it helps accomplish \nsomething that President Clinton has had on the agenda for a long \ntime--to move people from welfare to work, and to provide the means \nwith which to make that transition.\n  More generally, it shows we can both be fiscally responsible and true \nto our highest values as a nation. This budget agreement will produce \nroughly $900 billion in net deficit savings over the next 10 years. It \nwill give us the first balanced budget in a generation. It will build \non President Clinton's tremendous success in reducing the deficit. And \none cannot ignore--and Senator Domenici knew this was coming--one could \nnot ignore the incredible accomplishments, economic accomplishments \nthat have been made since President Clinton has been in office--with a \nbudget deficit that was at $290 billion when he took over in 1993, and \nat the moment looking like it is going to be something less than $50 \nbillion for the year 1997. It will build on President Clinton's \ntremendous success in reducing that deficit. It will build on the \nsuccess that we have had in getting new jobs for people in our \ncountry--12 million new jobs created. And the stock market--one can't \nhelp but notice that indicator. I noticed today, after hearing the news \nand yesterday after hearing the news, the market continued to move \nupward. Inflation is in check. People feel very good about the strength \nof the United States, leading the world's most developed countries in \ncompeting in the marketplace. That is a terrific record upon which to \nbuild.\n  This balanced budget amendment is an extension of all of those good \nthings. But I think the President is due a lot of credit for having \nbrought that deficit down to where it was, based on his hard work and, \nyes, a turn of very good events at the same time. But it was his \nforesight and his planning that helped enable us to get to this point.\n  The budget agreement, also, will move our Nation into the 21st \ncentury by providing the largest investment in education in 50 years. \nI, as a recipient of the benefits of the GI bill--I served in the war. \nI don't always like discussing which one. Sometimes people ask me if it \nwas the Spanish American? It was not. It was World War II. But, without \nthe GI bill, my widowed mother, age 36 when my father died, and the \npoor circumstances in which our family found ourselves when I was \ndischarged from the Army--never, never would have enabled me to get a \ncollege education and get a start on a career that has been very \nsatisfying for me and, I hope, worthwhile for the country. So I saw the \nvalue of helping someone get a head start in life, someone getting an \neducation and being able to contribute to our society. That is what I \nwant to see us do and the President certainly led us to that point.\n  The tax bill we are going to be considering also will include a \n$1,500 tax credit to make the first 2 years of college universally \navailable. There will be a tuition tax credit for all working Americans \nwho want to pursue lifelong learning, continue to learn. That enriches \nthe mind, enriches the body, and enriches the quality of life. That is \nwhat we have seen in so many cases. If you look in the universities and \nresearch laboratories and so forth, you see the people who continue to \nlearn and who gain vitality and youth, even as they do that. These \nprovisions are critically important to the future of our economy.\n  In addition, the budget agreement also includes $24 billion for \nchildren's health care, the largest increase in children's health care \nsince the enactment of Medicaid in 1965. This will help provide health \ninsurance to millions of uninsured children and it is a tremendous \nachievement.\n  The budget agreement also protects Medicare and extends the solvency \nof the Medicare trust fund by roughly another 7 years. Unlike earlier \nproposals, it does not ask senior citizens to bear unfair burdens and \nit doesn't threaten the quality of their health care. Instead, it \nreforms and modernizes the program and includes significant new \npreventive benefits.\n  We all know there is going to be a more thorough review of Medicare \nin the years ahead, to see whether we can comprehensively make changes \nthat will guarantee that solvency for as long as one can imagine.\n  In addition, the agreement provides tax relief for the middle class. \nAs we will discuss when we turn to the tax bill, the agreement provides \na $500 tax credit for children under the age of 17, to help families to \nbe able to bring up their children in the fashion that would provide \nthem with sustenance and direction, and perhaps help them get started \non their education. Importantly, that credit will be available to \nworking families with lower incomes. This sounds a little mysterious \nbut there are people whose incomes are supported by assistance from the \nGovernment, earned-income tax credit, in which a family that is below a \ncertain level of income gets a stipend or a tax refund from the \nGovernment. It often makes their lives livable. But there was a huge \ndebate about whether or not this credit would be available for people \nwho do not pay taxes in the first place. But we know they are working \nfamilies and they do pay payroll taxes and we decided, jointly, that it \nwould be appropriate to give some credit on those payroll taxes that \nthey pay.\n  We, the Democrats, made that a priority. With support from our \nRepublican friends we won an important victory for millions of ordinary \nAmericans.\n  The conference report also restores a basic level of fairness for \npeople who have come into this country legally, who have obeyed the \nlaw, paid their taxes, and then fate delivers them a disability whether \nthrough accident or just sickness. Last year the Congress pulled the \nrug out from under these people and eliminated their disability \nbenefits; for some, the only provision that they have that enables them \nto get along. But today we are restoring that basic safety net. It is \nthe right thing to do. As the Senate sponsor of this amendment I am \nparticularly pleased that it will be enacted into law.\n  Another important section of the conference report will protect \n30,000 disabled children who otherwise would lose Medicaid coverage. \nThis corrects a serious defect in last year's welfare\n\n[[Page S8320]]\n\nlegislation and will make a huge difference for these children and \ntheir families. I am also pleased that the budget agreement includes a \nrenewed commitment to environmental protection. We will be enacting new \nincentives to clean up thousands of contaminated, abandoned sites in \neconomically distressed areas. That not only will improve the \nenvironment, but it will help encourage redevelopment of these areas, \nknown as brownfields.\n  I have seen it in towns in New Jersey, industrial cities that had a \nglorious past but now suffer from the delinquency that often results \nfrom industrial pollution. Some of these communities have had these \nsites, dormant sites, small sites that were unused, yet with people \nbegging for work not blocks away, able to get there; people begging for \nretail facilities--they are not used. We have seen, in New Jersey, \nwhere we have cleaned up a few of these sites, good retail activity--in \none site in Hackensack, NJ, with a couple of hundred people working in \na discount store, a marketplace that people can go to, to get their \ngoods, buy their food. It has been a miracle, almost, to see these \nthings. And it is, often, for very small sums of money.\n  So we now have brownfields that I worked very hard on. It's now in \nplace. It's a win-win approach that will make a difference for \ncommunities around the Nation.\n  Additionally, the conference report includes important provisions to \nmove people from welfare to work as I mentioned. One million long-term \nwelfare recipients stand to benefit from this initiative. And the \nNation as a whole will benefit, as more Americans leave welfare and \nbecome productive members of our economy, lift their heads high, lift \ntheir spirits, provide some vision for themselves and their families. \nIt is a wonderful vision and I am pleased to see we are putting the \nresources there to make it happen.\n  Mr. President, I am going to leave to others the discussion on some \nof the other details of this legislation. But I once again take the \nopportunity to congratulate the President, President Clinton, for his \noutstanding leadership in this effort. We are here today on a \nbipartisan basis only because the President decided it could happen and \nhe wanted to make it happen. His people were all over the place, \nworking alike with Democrats who occasionally disagreed and Republicans \nwho occasionally disagreed. He brought us all together and we are \ngrateful for that. I think his commitment will be acknowledged for many \nyears to come.\n  Mr. President, I don't think, as I said earlier, there is anyone who \nwould say they are 100 percent happy with this agreement. But, while no \none sees it as perfect, everyone should see it as good. It is fair, it \nis balanced, and it will serve our country well. It will balance the \nbudget. It will invest in education and training. It will provide tax \nrelief to the middle class. It will protect Medicare. It will provide \nhealth care coverage to millions of children. It will throw a life vest \nto disabled legal immigrants. It will invest in environmental \nprotection, move people from welfare to work, and will make life better \nfor millions of ordinary working Americans.\n\n  So I urge my colleagues to put aside as much challenge as they can. \nYes, everybody in this place is free to make their statements, to say \nwhat they want. But I hope in the final analysis they are going to \nsupport this budget agreement enthusiastically, because it sends a \nmessage to the American people. It will say yes, this wasn't something \nthat was nurtured through an inch at a time. This is something that was \nsupported by people across the room from different States and from \ndifferent parties. That is the way it ought to be. It is the right \nthing for America and I am proud to have been a part of it.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Rick Werner, a \ndetailee to the Finance Committee from the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, be granted the privilege of the floor for the duration \nof the debate on this conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the budget reconciliation conference between \nthe Senate and House has come to an end. All sides have weighed in. The \nprocess has been long and involved, around the clock, through the \nweekends. But I must say the result is well worth the exercise.\n  What we have achieved is a balance, a carefully crafted compromise \nbetween the Senate and the House, between Republicans and Democrats, \nbetween Congress and the White House. I can say with certainty that no \nSenator, no Congressman, not even the President got everything he or \nshe would have liked. Undoubtedly there are specifics in this final \npackage that I would prefer to have seen written differently. But I can \nsay that, while there were necessary compromises to achieve balance and \nto deliver the budget reconciliation to the American people, there was \nno compromise on principle. Differences? Certainly, but I cannot \nremember the last time I saw such a positive, bipartisan willingness to \nwork together in a budget effort.\n  This, I believe, is because there has been a profound change in the \nnature and character of Washington. Two recent proclamations \ndemonstrate this change. The first was President Clinton's declaration \nin his State of the Union Address that the era of big Government is \nover. And the second came from our distinguished colleague, Senator \nDaschle, when, during this debate, he agreed that the question in \nCongress is no longer whether or not taxes should be cut, rather a \nquestion of how much they should be cut.\n  Cutting taxes and achieving a balanced budget have long been \nRepublican objectives. For years now, we have advocated the need to \nchange the way Washington does business. Now President Clinton and the \ndistinguished minority leader demonstrate the growing bipartisan \nconsensus on these objectives, objectives that underscore this \nreconciliation package.\n  It is a strong first step. It signals that the era of big government \nis over. Certainly government has its place. There are moral and \ncontractual obligations that the Federal Government must maintain with \nthe American people. Many are enumerated in the Constitution. Others, \nlike Medicare and Medicaid, are more recent and have become critically \nimportant to those who depend on them now and to those who rely on them \nfor the future.\n  Having said this, I believe a clear and growing majority realizes \nthat the Federal Government is not the answer to all that challenges \nus. In fact, in some cases, the Government is shown to be the problem, \nparticularly when it comes to waste, fraud, abuse, inefficiency, and a \ntop-heavy, unresponsive bureaucracy. The ability of both sides to \ncompromise on this bill demonstrates that Washington acknowledges this \nreality and that Washington is responding to the attendant frustration \nand legitimate concerns felt by Americans everywhere.\n  Beyond signaling an end to big and inefficient government, this \npackage meets several other shared criteria. It places us squarely and \nhonestly on the road to a balanced budget by the year 2002. We all know \nhow important this is. The United States has not balanced a Federal \nbudget since 1969. This, despite the fact that our Founders made it \nclear that saddling future generations with debt is immoral. According \nto Thomas Jefferson, the question of whether one generation has a right \nto bind another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such \nconsequence as to place it among the fundamental principles of \ngovernment. Jefferson said that we should consider ourselves \nunauthorized to saddle posterity with our debts; we are morally bound \nto pay those debts ourselves.\n  This budget reconciliation package is the first in years that puts us \nback where we must be. It is balanced. It begins to address the dilemma \nof big government's licentious legacy, a legacy that burdens every man, \nwoman, and child with almost $20,000 in public debt. I am happy to say \nthat our majority leader, Senator Lott, made it clear at the beginning \nof the 105th Congress that balancing the budget in 5 years would be one \nof our top priorities. Mr. President, we have delivered on that \npromise.\n\n[[Page S8321]]\n\n  Our third objective has been to strengthen the programs that would be \ninfluenced by our actions. The reforms to entitlement that are \ncontained in this package are, indeed, historic. We make significant \nand important changes to Medicare and Medicaid. We strengthen \nassistance to children. We return authority and means to our States so \nthey can better meet the needs of their citizens. It was not enough to \nsimply change entitlement programs to reduce their rate of growth. We \nsought in the process to improve, to strengthen them, to preserve them, \nand, again, we succeeded.\n  Let me give you the specifics. But before I do that, let me reiterate \nthat we were able to accomplish these significant objectives because of \na growing consensus on both sides of the political aisle, and because \nof our willingness to compromise, compromise not on principles but for \nprinciples.\n  In our effort to control spending, the largest program we addressed \nwas Medicare. Our objective here was not just to control its spending, \nbut to strengthen the Medicare Program for the long term, and we did \nthis. We did this by increasing choice and competition within the \nprogram. Choice within the Medicare Program will give beneficiaries \nmyriad options. It will allow them to participate in HMO's, PPO's, \nPSO's and private fee-for-service programs. We have based our expansion \nof choice in the Medicare Program on the successful Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Program. Through these options, seniors will be able to \nobtain important benefits, like prescription drugs, that are not \ncovered by traditional Medicare.\n  These changes and the money they will save also allow us to expand \nMedicare coverage for certain important preventive services, including \nmammography, prostate colorectal screening, bone mass measurement, and \ndiabetes management. Beyond increasing choice and competition within \nMedicare, we strengthen and preserve the program by slowing its rate of \nspending growth. Our measures save Medicare for another 10 years, while \nstill increasing program spending per beneficiary from $5,500 this year \nto $6,800 in the year 2002.\n\n  Beyond encouraging choice and competition, this bill introduces \nimportant innovations into the Medicare Program, innovations that could \ngo a long way toward strengthening the program for future generations.\n  One very important innovation is the creation of a demonstration \nproject that will explore the advantages of having medical savings \naccounts available within the Medicare Program. This demonstration \nproject will allow up to 390,000 Medicare beneficiaries to opt into an \nMSA program, a program that will allow them to choose a high-deductible \nMedicare choice plan.\n  I believe medical savings accounts will be an important component of \nMedicare's long-term viability, and to study and recommend other \ninnovations, our legislation creates a national bipartisan commission \non the future of Medicare. Senator Moynihan and I called for this \ncommission back in February as we realized that to realize long-term \nsolutions for the program, we needed a commission that would be above \npolitics. This will be a 17-member commission established for a little \nmore than a year. Its task will be to make recommendations to Congress \non actions necessary to ensure the long-term fiscal health of the \nMedicare Program. It will report back to Congress on March 1, 1999, and \nthese changes to Medicare will result in a net savings of $115 billion \nover 5 years, savings that will not only help us balance the budget, \nbut savings and reforms that will preserve the Medicare Program while \nensuring that it continues to serve those who depend on it now.\n  Concerning Medicaid, we were able to achieve a total savings of $13 \nbillion. This savings will come largely from a reduction in \ndisproportionate share, or DSH payments, and by giving our States more \nflexibility in how they run the program.\n  For more than a decade, there has been a tug of war between the \nFederal Government and the States over Medicaid. Each side has tried to \nassert its will over the other. From the mid-1980's and through the \nearly 1990's, the Federal Government imposed mandates on the States \nand, in turn, the States shifted costs to the Federal Government. The \nresult was devastating to all of our budgets as Medicaid routinely grew \nat a double-digit pace, reaching as high as a 29-percent increase in \n1992.\n  This legislative package marks a new beginning, a new trend. It marks \na change in the Washington mindset that has sought, since the days of \nthe New Deal over 60 years ago, to centralize power in this city. With \nthis substantive change in the Medicaid Program, we are offering our \nGovernors the tools they need to control this program. This, I believe, \nis the way things should be done.\n  With this bill, they will be able to move more individuals into \nmanaged care without waiting years for waivers from the Federal \nGovernment. They will be able to contract with selected provider for \nservices. The States will be able to ask families to take some \nresponsibility for the decisions they make when seeking health care \nservices. This power at the State level will go a long ways toward \nstretching Government health care dollars.\n  As I said, beyond making significant and important changes to \nMedicare and Medicaid, we have strengthened assistance to our children \nto meet the health care needs of the most vulnerable among us. It \nbecame clear through the conference that both sides of the aisle are \nequally committed to increasing access to health care for as many \nchildren as we can. Both sides of the aisle are committed to finding an \nanswer to the problem of uninsured children in this country, and this \nlegislation represents an important agreement in this area. It creates \na new program, a program that covers low-income, uninsured children. \nThe process of providing insurance and health care coverage to \nvulnerable American children is complex. As I have said before, of the \n71 million children in the United States, more than 86 percent are \nalready covered by some type of health insurance. Two-thirds of our \nchildren are covered by insurance through the private sector. Twenty-\nthree percent of all children in the United States under age 18 are \ncovered by Medicaid, and another 3 percent are covered by other public \ninsurance programs.\n  Our plan provides $24 billion over the next 5 years to be used by \nStates in a manner that provides them flexibility in how they will \nexpand health care coverage to our children.\n  Our States will have two mechanisms of establishing programs. They \ncan expand their Medicaid coverage or they can create their own program \nto address the particular needs of the children in their States. And \nwhile the Governors are given certain flexibility in the way they can \nuse this money, our bill requires that they meet specific standards \nregarding health care coverage for children.\n\n  Expanding Medicaid is certainly a choice States have made. Thirty-\nnine have expanded Medicaid eligibility for pregnant women and children \nbeyond the Federal requirements. But States are also developing other \nstrategies for increasing coverage of children as well. There are \nalready public-private partnerships in more than half of our States. \nThere are successful programs such as New York's Child Health Plus and \nFlorida's Healthy Kids. These innovative programs and programs like \nthem can grow with these additional resources provided by this \nlegislation.\n  These, Mr. President, are the major provisions of this legislation. \nThey signal a new beginning in Washington--real reforms to make \nprograms more cost-effective, more efficient, more responsive to the \nneeds of our people and our States. Great care has been taken to assure \nthat the most vulnerable among us are protected, and this includes our \nprovision to restore benefits to all legal noncitizens who were \nreceiving Social Security when last year's welfare bill was signed into \nlaw.\n  With this legislation, we also restore the ability to receive \nbenefits to legal noncitizens who were residing in the United States as \nof that date should they become disabled in the future. These \nprotections, however, are handled appropriately and in keeping with our \noverarching goal of restoring fiscal responsibility to Government.\n  With this reconciliation package, we have establish the first \nbalanced budget since 1969. We have met the criterion given us in the \nMay 2d budget compromise, and we will give Americans the first real tax \nrelief package that they have had in 16 years.\n\n[[Page S8322]]\n\n  Did we accomplish everything I would have liked to accomplish? No. I \nwould have preferred to see some deeper, more significant fiscal \nrestraint. I would have preferred to see a few other major reforms to \nMedicare, reforms that would have gone a long way toward strengthening \nthe program, and these include the provisions that were in the original \nSenate package.\n  But recall, Mr. President, the history of the balanced budget debate; \nrecall Congress' effort in November 1995 to balance the budget by the \nyear 2002; recall the consequent Government shutdown and Bill Clinton's \nveto; recall the President's 10-year balanced budget plan and Congress \ninsisting that balance could be achieved 5 years earlier.\n  Keep the history in mind, and the success of this legislation becomes \nclear. We have a balanced budget. That balanced budget will be achieved \nin 5 years, not 10. And we have achieved it without acrimony, without \nGovernment shutdowns, and without vetoes.\n  This is a bipartisan effort. It is an excellent beginning. And I am \ngrateful to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their work, \nfor the spirit of cooperation that existed on the Finance Committee, on \nthe floor of the Senate, and throughout the conference.\n  I am especially grateful to my friend, Pat Moynihan, for his wise \ncounsel, his leadership, and cooperation in helping to bring about the \nsuccess of this package. I am also grateful to the professional staff \nmembers on the Senate Finance Committee, as well as the Senate Budget \nCommittee.\n  Likewise, I want to thank the staffs of the Congressional Research \nService and the Congressional Budget Office, the Office of Legislative \nCouncil in the Senate, the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission, \nthe Physician Payment Review Commission, the General Accounting Office, \nand all others who have worked long and hard for this package. The list \nof names is too long to read here, but I ask unanimous consent that \nthese names be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the names were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                           finance committee\n\n       Lindy Paull, Julie James, Alexander Vachon, Gioia \n     Bonmartini, Dede Spitznagel, Dennis Smith, Donna Ridenour, \n     Alexis Martin, Mark Patterson, David Podoff, Faye Drummond, \n     Rick Werner, Kristen Testa, and Doug Steiger.\n\n\n                       senate legislative counsel\n\n       Jim Fransen, Mark Mathiesen, Ruth Ernst, John Goetcheus, \n     Janell Bentz, and the rest of the Legislative Counsel's \n     Office.\n\n\n                      congressional budget office\n\n       Murray Ross, Tom Bradley, Cyndi Dudzinski, Jeanne De Sa, \n     Anne Hunt, Jennifer Jenson, Jeff Lemieux, Robin Rudowitz, \n     Kathy Ruffing, Paul Cullinan, Sheila Dacy, Joe Antos, and \n     Pete Welch.\n\n\n                     congressional research service\n\n       Celinda Franco, Beth Fuchs, Tom Gabe, Jennifer O'Sullivan, \n     Richard Price, Richard Rimkunas, Kathy Swendiman, Madeleine \n     Smith, Melvina Ford, Jean Hearne, Jennifer Neisner, Pat \n     Purcell, Vee Burke, Christine Devere, Larry Eig, Gene Falk, \n     Carmen Solomon-Fears, and Joyce Vialet.\n\n\n                  physician payment review commission\n\n       Lauren B.

Mr. President, it is my hope that the spirit of \nbipartisanship that carried us through this effort continues as we now \nconsider the final package and send the bill to President Clinton for \nhis signature.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KERREY. I yield myself such time from the Democratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I come to the floor and offer what I would \ncall my reluctant support for this budget agreement.\n  Today, the subject at hand is the spending portion of this bill. And \nI wish it was completely different, I must say, than what is in here.\n  Yesterday, I spent most of the day in mourning for the loss of the \nprovisions relating to structural changes in Medicare that would have \nadded $8 billion to the HI hospitalization trust fund by imposing very \nreasonable and progressive change in the premium--it would have added \n$40 billion a year in spending relief in the year 2030 by accommodating \nthis tremendous change in the baby-boom generation between 2010 and \n2030--and other provisions. I spent the day grieving those. I have \novercome my grief, and I am prepared to support this because I believe \nit does balance the budget by the year 2002. I believe it finishes the \njob that we started in 1990 and 1993. I voted for both of those bills, \nand I find myself compelled once again to come and vote for a bill that \nI am not altogether pleased with.\n  In this morning's New York Times there was an op-ed piece written by \nWilliam Safire talking about an age-old problem in the West where \ncattlemen, because they had an interest in keeping the range open, and \nsheepherders, because they had an interest in keeping the range fenced \nin, were at constant odds and warring with one another. Their animals \nhad different needs. They, as the guardians of those animals, went to \nwar in order to protect the needs of those animals.\n  It was not until just recently that the people who manage these range \nanimals have come together. They came together as a consequence of a \ncommon enemy, in this case, a rather pesky weed called leafy spurge \nthat has roots that can go down as deep as 150 feet, impossible to, by \nany reasonable estimate, get rid of once it is in the grassland. It \nwill spread and take over the entire prairie.\n  So the cattlemen are out there saying the leafy spurge will eliminate \nthe grass. ``I'll have nothing for my cattle to graze on. What am I \ngoing to do? No herbicide is effective. No burning is effective. \nNothing seems to work.'' Until one day they discover that what works is \nto put a few hundred sheep out on the grassland. As a consequence of \nthe sheep's appetite for the leafy spurge, the sheep eliminates the \nweed, and thus is joined a battle between the cattlemen and the \nsheepherders. Suddenly they come together as a consequence of the \ncommon enemy.\n  I am impressed that Republicans and Democrats have come together with \nthis bill to address a common enemy--the deficit. I wish that the 1993 \nbill had been bipartisan. I believe that if we had a few more spending \ncuts in 1993, that might have been possible. We missed an opportunity. \nIt was bipartisan in 1990. It was not in 1993. And it is today. I am \nimpressed with it.\n  I believe the Nation wants us to be bipartisan. I believe the Nation \nmakes our greatest progress when we set aside not only our partisan \ndifferences, but we are able to find a common opponent, in this case, \nthe deficit, a common objective, and we say that we are willing to risk \na bit--in some cases, risk it all--for the larger goal.\n  I must say, after having made that observation, and to be specific, \npraising the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator \nDomenici, the ranking Democrat, Senator Lautenberg, and on our Finance \nCommittee, Senator Roth of Delaware, Senator Moynihan of New York, they \nhave worked hard to say we have a common enemy--in this case, the \ndeficit.\n  We see the connection between deficit reduction and jobs. We believe \nthat jobs, and good jobs, can solve almost any problem that we have. \nAnd thus, we are willing to join forces against a common enemy.\n  I am reluctant to become enormously enthusiastic about this, as I \nsay, because I do not believe it is asking of Americans the sort of \ntough decisions and choices that would enable us to say that we are \ntasking the American people to do something that is truly great.\n  We will balance the budget. It is true, we are reforming Medicare to \ngive seniors more choice. I think the Federal Employee Health Benefit \nprovisions in this bill will have long-lasting impact, give seniors \nmore comfort as they make a choice to buy alternative care. The \nprovisions for increased coverage for children, the provisions having \nto do with welfare reform, all these are good provisions and deserve \nattention.\n\n  We have, in addition, a lot of provisions--and I thank all four of \nthe Members who have been involved with this for their assistance in \nmaking sure that rural America has an adequate reimbursement rate under \nmanaged care,\n\n[[Page S8323]]\n\nthat we are able to take advantage of managed care and see increased \npenetration in rural America. I appreciate, as well, the change to \nincrease budget enforcement to tighten some of the loopholes that were \nin law.\n  There are a lot of things in this bill, in short, that are good. It \ndoes, it seems to me, represent a successful compromise between \nRepublicans and Democrats, and we have produced a piece of legislation \nthat all of us, or most of us, anyway, are going to be able to come \ndown and be enthusiastic about.\n  There are four things, Mr. President, that I would like to discuss \nwhich I would put in the category of unfinished business. First is \nentitlements. I appreciate that there is a commission in this bill. I \nbelieve it is 20 months that they have. I can save them a lot of time. \nWe had a bipartisan entitlement commission, Senator Danforth and I. The \ndistinguished occupant of the chair was on that commission as well.\n  There are a limited number of choices that one can make. There are \nroughly 10 or 15 choices you can make. They are all ugly. They are all \ndifficult. And they all accommodate a demographic problem, not a \nproblem caused by secular humanists or by Phyllis Schlafly or Ronald \nReagan or George McGovern. This is not an ideological problem. It is a \nproblem of birthrates during the period of time 1945 to 1965, and the \nbirthrates following that. It is called the baby-boom generation.\n  Seventy-seven million Americans will begin to retire in 2010. And \nwhat we attempted to do, with what I consider to be a relatively modest \nchange in the law with eligibility age and means testing and a \ncopayment on home health care, was to accommodate that large generation \nof people. The sooner you do it, the better. You do not do them any \nfavors by saying, we will do a commission for 2 years and perhaps do \nsomething in 1999. Then you have a Presidential campaign going. You \nwill probably have to wait until 2001. The longer you wait, the harder \nthe choices are.\n  As I said, the choices are fairly limited. If you do not like moving \nthe eligibility age, if you do not like doing some means testing, the \nonly thing you can hope to do is get some increases in the revenue \nstream, proposing to increase taxes or increase the premium. If that is \nyour choice, make it now, because the longer you wait, the more likely \nit is that the people you are trying to help are going to pay a lot \nmore. They are going to pay a bigger price. They have not been warned.\n  We missed an opportunity, and I am hopeful that by surfacing this in \nthe debate and getting strong support, bipartisan support here in the \nSenate, we can keep these issues alive.\n  In addition to the long-term problem of entitlements is another \nproblem with entitlements inside of our budget. Yes, it is true, we \nwill have taken the final step to balance the budget with this bill, \nalthough I note parenthetically that one of the curious things about \nthis particular proposal is we are going to balance the budget by \nrather substantially increasing spending in some areas and lowering \ntaxes in others. It is an exciting proposition. We are going to balance \nthe budget, it is true, but the budget has another big problem, and \nthat is the growing percent of that budget that goes for mandatory \nprograms.\n  Many of my colleagues have come down to give great, impassioned \nspeeches about why we should not do all of these things. But the \nquestion that needs to be asked in a very calm environment is, what are \nyou going to do about these numbers?\n  In this budget agreement, the amount of money we allocate for \nmandatory, plus interest, will go from entitlements, plus interest, the \nmandatory portion from about 66 percent, as I understand it--I haven't \nseen the final numbers--to about 70 percent in 2002. The Senator from \nNew Mexico is shaking his head, but it does unquestionably increase. I \ndo not know if it goes to 70 percent, but it increases, and it \ncontinues to increase. And it will increase even more when the baby \nboomers retire. It is not a flat number.\n  The head of the Congressional Budget Office, June O'Neill, prepared a \nreport some time ago that shows how the cost of these programs \ncontinues to go up as a percent of our overall budget, and they are \nsqueezing out our capacity to keep our defenses strong, our capacity to \ninvest in education or infrastructure, or research, and all the other \nsorts of things that are being done in the other part of the budget. \nOne of the reasons it was made easier to do our appropriation this year \nis, we put a little more money in the appropriated accounts in this \nfiscal year than you are going to see in the outyears.\n  So I alert Members that see the appropriations bills sailing through \nthis year and are wondering why, there is more money this year than \nthere will be next year and the year after that and the year after \nthat. In years 4 and 5, we will have very tough decisions to make in \ndiscretionary spending--far tougher than I believe people realize. \nThus, there is the second problem of the growing cost of entitlements \ninside of the budget. It sets up tough choices. It doesn't set up easy \nchoices. It sets up very difficult choices that we have to make.\n  The second big area for me is, I must say, with the economy growing \nthe way it is--and one of the great pieces of news for me in this \nbudget debate is that as a result of the growth in the economy, I think \nthere are very few people left that don't understand that, in addition \nto defending the Nation as the first order of business, whatever we do \nwith our taxes, regulatory policy, and spending policy, we do need to \nask ourselves: will this create jobs? Because if the economy is \ngrowing, it is producing jobs, and there is a demand for labor as a \nconsequence of a growing economy. Lots of things get solved in a hurry. \nNot only does the Treasury have lots of revenue that makes our job \neasier, but the gap between rich and poor narrows, the number of people \non welfare is reduced. A lot of problems we have get solved quickly if \nour economy is growing. If we recall from the recession of 1991, the \nproblems are made a lot worse if you have the opposite in place.\n  So this growth we have out there in the economy is exciting. My view \nis that this is the time when we need to be investing in that public \ninfrastructure--research, the transportation base, education, and all \nthose things that will produce increased productivity and increased \neconomic growth sometime out in the future. We may not get an immediate \nbenefit from it, but we will benefit somewhere out in the future. It \nconnects with this entitlement problem. For my friends on this side of \nthe aisle who love to get up and get fired up and tell me why we can't \ndo anything about entitlements, the question occurs: If you don't want \nto do that, Senator, where are you going to get the money to make these \npublic investments?\n  I haven't heard many people that are enthusiastic about a tax \nincrease. I have heard them being enthusiastic about going in the other \ndirection. The only way you can find the resources to invest in the \nlong-term growth of this country is by containing and controlling the \npace of growth of entitlements. It is a question of whether or not we \nare going to endow the future, or are we going to convert the Federal \nGovernment into an ATM machine, entitling the present solving of the \nproblems of me, me, me, now, now, now, but not solving the problems of \nfuture generations.\n  The third issue I speak of today is health coverage. I am of the \nopinion that the additional $24 billion that is in this particular \nbudget is going to cover a lot fewer people than leading advocates \npredict. I don't believe that it is going to be a terribly efficient \nway to increase coverage. Again, I don't think you are going to be able \nto get the kind of increased coverage that is necessary, unless you \ncome to grips with the rising costs of these mandated programs. For all \nthe terrible things that were forecast and said about the proposal to \nadd a $5 fee for home health, to add a means-tested and an income-\nrelated premium on Part B and increase the eligibility age, you thought \nwe were not spending any money at all on Medicare.\n  No account in our budget grows as fast as Medicare. It will go up, on \naverage, $24.5 billion per year for 10 years. Nothing grows that fast. \nWe are allocating more and more of our gross domestic product into \nMedicare and other entitlements. Now, I am prepared to do more for low-\nincome seniors, and help people who are in serious trouble out\n\n[[Page S8324]]\n\nthere, having a tough time paying the bills. But the choice that we \nhave to make, not only when it comes to investing in our future, but \nalso being able to provide additional coverage, is between one group of \nAmericans and another, or allocating $24.5 billion of additional money \nfor children over 5 years and $24.5 billion per year for 37 million \npeople over the age of 65.\n  Now, I think that is the kind of debate we need to have on this \nfloor. It is a tough debate, and it involves telling the American \npeople and, very often, giving them the facts. And the facts may be \npainful and difficult for us to face, but they are the facts. I, for \none, as I said, am skeptical that $24 billion over 5 years is going to \nresult in the kind of increased coverage projected for children. I must \nsay again that I think the only way we are honestly going to be able to \nincrease the coverage for Americans is to get after entitlements. There \nis a question of the legitimacy not only of the means test, but we must \nask ourselves fundamental questions about requiring an eligibility test \non age, another program based upon poverty, the veterans' programs, \nsaying if you get blown up in a war, we have a good program for you. \nThe final one, of course, is the income tax deduction.\n\n  The fourth problem that I think this country faces, which is not in \nthis bill, but it will be taken up in the tax bill and I will talk \nabout it later, but I think it's a big problem. We have a window into \nthe problem of looking at the estate tax issue, and that is the \ndifficulty Americans are having generating wealth. I will talk about it \nat greater length when we get on the tax bill. But income and wealth \nare not the same thing. It is not uncommon to pick up a newspaper and \nhear a story talking about this tax bill does this or that for the \nwealthy, and what they are talking about is income. They are not the \nsame thing. I can have a half a million dollars a year in income and \nhave no wealth, just as I can have $20,000 in income a year and if I \nsave a little bit, I can get wealth. The estate tax debate is focused \non about 2 percent of Americans who have estates at $600,000 or over. I \nbelieve estate tax relief is reasonable. I support doing that in the \ntax bill. But there are 98 percent of the American people that do not \nhave wealth in excess of $600,000. It would not take much of a change \nin the Social Security program to enable somebody in the work force, \nindeed from the moment they were born, to have a savings account that \nenables them to say that when it comes time for me to retire, as I look \nforward to growing old, I know that in addition to some kind of an \nincome transfer I am also going to have the opportunity to have \nsecurity as a result of wealth. I think wealth distribution, identified \nas a problem repeatedly, cannot be solved by simply transferring \nincome. It can only be solved by establishing that we are going to try \nto help working Americans acquire the wealth and use the principal \nretirement program, Social Security, that we have in place to get that \ndone.\n  Mr. President, I close by saying that I intend to vote ``yes'' on \nthis bill, and I intend to vote ``yes'' on the tax relief bill that \nfollows. I wish it had done considerably more. I have great praise and \ngreat appreciation for the work done by the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, by the ranking Democrat, the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee and the ranking Democrat on that committee as well. They set \nthe tone of bipartisanship, which must be set if you are going to deal \nwith these controversial issues, if we are going to be able to go after \nthe common enemy, not just of deficit spending but other tempting, \nirresponsible things that might produce a round of applause, but might \nnot be good for the United States of America.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERREY. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, first let me make an observation, perhaps not \nas eloquently. I believe the Senator from New Mexico could, someplace \nor another in the United States, make a very similar speech. I think \nmost of what you talked about I agree with. But I would like to make \nsure that everybody knows just how much you can do in a budget \nresolution and in a bill that is forced by a budget resolution and how \ndifficult it is to try to do more than fits the bill. I want to say to \nthe American people that while I agree with your statement \nwholeheartedly that we have to do much more with the entitlements--and \nlet's be very precise, the one that is really, really in need of a \nlong-term fix is Medicare--not because anybody wants to deny anyone \nanything, but the stark fact is that it, by itself, can break this \ncountry in another 15, 20 years all by itself.\n  Frankly, I never believed that we could fix Medicare in its totality \nin a budget resolution and a bill that was thrust by a budget \nresolution. Senator Gramm is chairman of the Subcommittee on Health. I \nthink he would agree with me that, while we probably could have done \nbetter, and should have, on the three items that would have helped, we \ncan't force the total change of Medicare in a bill like this under a \nbudget resolution format. First of all, a budget resolution is only \napplicable for 5 years. You are permitted to project for 10. I assume \nwhen Senator Gramm starts that reform, he is going to start beyond 10 \nin terms of the real dollar impact, because that is when it is in \ntrouble. It is not in trouble in the next 5 years. One might have a \ndifferent mix as to how you get it to a state of solvency.\n  Senator, I would like you to know I never thought that we could do \nmuch more in Medicare. But I think the three changes you made in the \nFinance Committee, with your support, if we could have held them, it \nwould have been a good first step. I still believe the spirit of \ngetting this done may get us, within the next 2 or 3 years, to facing \nthe issues for major, permanent reform of the entitlement programs. I \nam hopeful you are not giving up because we can't do it in this budget \nbill, because it is a very, very big issue that requires much debate in \nthe Senate. I don't know exactly how that debate is going to be framed, \nbut I don't think it is going to be framed in a reconciliation bill \nwith no debate to speak of and no amendments to speak of. That is just \nthe U.S. Senate's way of doing things. I thank you for yielding. Maybe \nyou can comment on that.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, first of all, I say that the man who \ntaught me about entitlements is the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico. I recall coming to the floor, I believe it was on a budget \nresolution that the distinguished Senator from New Mexico and the now-\ndeparted Senator from Georgia, Senator Nunn, when they had the famous \nNunn-Domenici amendment that controlled the growth of entitlements. The \nfirst time he proposed it, I voted against it. I listened to the \nopponents of it and said, ``That makes sense to me; this is not a good \namendment, so I will vote no.''\n  Then I started looking at the facts, and I was very uncomfortable to \nhave to conclude that I voted wrong. The next time the Senator brought \nit up, I voted for it and I became interested in this issue as a result \nof both you and Senator Nunn and your elaborations and your education \nthat you did 3 or 4 years ago.\n  The point that I am trying to make, which I am afraid is sometimes \nlost, is that the longer you wait, the harder the choice is. This is \nnot a problem that you can avoid forever. The more time you let expire, \nthe more difficult the choice is--that is, on Medicare. The same is \ntrue on the budget item when it comes to Social Security. We have \npeople under the age of 40 who will be beneficiaries out in the future, \n26 and 27 years from now, under current law, for whom we have to say, \nare we going to be able to keep the promise that's on the table? We \nhave to say no. Social Security Commissioner designate Shirley Chater, \nin 1996, when asked about it, said, ``You can expect Social Security to \nhave to be reduced by 30 or 40 percent in benefits, unless some change \noccurs.''\n  Well, there is a presumption that those of us who proposed altering \nthese programs today are proposing cuts. But the truth is, if you do \nnothing, that is what is going to happen; only the cut isn't going to \noccur to a future beneficiary, it will occur to a current beneficiary. \nLong after the time has passed when you can plan and make adjustments, \nsuddenly the Congress is going to pop up and say, ``Sorry, folks, we \nhave to cut the programs big time,'' in order to be able, as the \nSenator said, to save either the fiscal health or the program itself.\n\n[[Page S8325]]\n\n  So my fear is that we missed an opportunity when the distinguished \nSenators from New Mexico and Georgia were down here. I recall people \ncoming in the one year and pulling off veterans first, and once the \nfloodgates were open, it was ``Katie bar the door,'' everybody got down \nhere and got exempt and there was nothing left. There was no group that \nis entitled to payment left, and they were all exempted and there was \nno real reform that occurred.\n  So I am not going to give up on the issue. I am not going to stop \ntalking about the need for these long-term changes. But I am just \nsaying to the American people, especially those who understand the \nimportance of Medicare and these entitlement programs, who consider it \na victory that the conferees were unable--and I know the Senator from \nNew Mexico fought for these things, but the conferees were unable to \nhold these provisions. There are many people who are advocates of these \nprograms that consider that a victory. It is not a victory. It weakens \nthe program long term. And some beneficiary out in the future is not \ngoing to thank us for this action. Maybe it gains a few votes in \nelections. I doubt it. I believe the American people once they hear the \nfacts of the matter will be persuaded.\n\n  Anyway, it is a much longer answer. I know the Senator from Texas is \nnot very appreciative of the fact that the Senator caused me to talk \nlonger than I intended to.\n  But I want to underscore in closing that I do appreciate the fact \nthat the Senator from New Mexico, Senator Nunn, and others led on this \nthing. It probably torments the Senator now to see his student come \nback here speaking in this fashion.\n  I just close by saying that I am prepared to vote for this agreement \non the balanced budget. I believe that is good for the economy. I wish \nand hope that we are able in a bipartisan spirit to do much more, if \nnot this year sometime relatively soon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield to Senator Gramm as much time as \nhe may desire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me first thank our chairman for \nyielding.\n  I would like to begin by congratulating some people and thanking them \nfor their leadership.\n  First of all, I want to thank Senator Domenici for his leadership. I \nhave had the opportunity to serve with Senator Domenici now for 13 \nyears. I have been on the same side as Senator Domenici. I have been on \nthe opposite side of Senator Domenici. I have noticed that when we are \ntogether we generally win. I wish Senator Domenici could be right more \noften.\n  But I want to congratulate him for his leadership. I don't have any \ndoubt in my mind that Senator Domenici will go down as one of the great \nlegislators of this era, and that I will always be proud to tell my \ngrandchildren that I served with him. I want to congratulate him for \nhis great work on this bill.\n  I also want to congratulate Chairman Roth. This is the first full \nterm that Senator Roth has been chairman. He became chairman in the \nmiddle of the last Congress. And I think he has done a terrific job in \nchairing the Finance Committee and in building bipartisanship to a \nlevel that I would not have thought beginning this process that we \ncould have ever had on the tax bill. I want to congratulate Chairman \nRoth for his leadership, which I really think has been outstanding, \nhaving had the opportunity to be in committee, to be actively \nparticipating in the debate on the tax bill on the floor, and having \nhad a chance to be in much of the conference.\n  I think our colleagues ought to know, or at least hear someone say \nwhat a great job that Chairman Roth did.\n  I also believe that our Democratic colleagues, especially Senator \nMoynihan, have made a great contribution to this bill. Whether you like \nthe product, or whether you do not like anything else we do--it is as \nthick as this package that many like and many dislike--I think you have \nto clearly say that a tremendous amount of work has gone into the \nprocess.\n  Let me begin by talking about what I believe in this bill is \nunambiguously positive, and what is clearly going to be greatly \nappreciated by the American people--some of it immediately, and some of \nit over time--as people come to understand it.\n  I would like then to talk about the disappointments I have about some \nparts of the bill--opportunities lost, things done. And then I would \nlike to conclude by simply talking about the future in the next 5 years \nas we try to implement what the Congress is clearly going to adopt, and \nthen say a little bit about balancing the Federal budget. So I will try \nto do those things.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I must leave the floor. I will tell the Senator that I \nlook forward to reading the Senator's remarks. I think the Senator \nknows that I mean that. I believe what he has outlined is so typical. I \nmean the Senator is going to state the good things, things that are not \nas good as they could be, and he is going to lay them out with clarity. \nI say thank you for the generous remarks which the Senator made about \nme. But I also want to say I reciprocate.\n  It doesn't matter in the U.S. Senate whether you agree with another \nSenator half the time, all the time, or none of the time. What is \nimportant is that you respect them. That is all we can get in this \nplace--is that somebody respects what we are doing. I want to tell the \nSenator from Texas, whether it is his way and I am not right enough, or \nwhether it is my way and he is wrong too often, it doesn't matter. You \ncan't be in the Senate and serve with Phil Gramm of Texas without \nrespecting him. The Senator has a great mind, and he has learned to \napply it to our problems in a way that really means something to a lot \nof us. It strikes our minds, and makes us think. I don't think the \nSenator from Texas can expect to do more, and he wins plenty of them \nbecause of the clarity and the philosophy, and the way he digs into the \nissues.\n  There are many things that we are experimenting with in this bill \nthat may not work, and the Senator is going to certainly find them and \ntell us why. And they have an awful lot to do with the child health \ncare package. The Senator is going to say something about that. And I \nam not trying to preempt him because I know there are problems there. I \ndon't believe the people who say if it had gone straight under Medicaid \nthat it would have covered many, many more. I don't believe that at \nall. The Medicaid Program that has not worked well in the past that we \nhave been struggling to fix ought not be mimicked. It ought to be \nchanged. And if you can, you ought to do the same thing in a different \nway. That is the theory of the Senator from Texas, and he has said that \nfrom the beginning. We are trying. But we are not there yet, and many \nother things.\n  I want to tell you, we struggled mightily on the welfare side, on the \nFair Employment Labor Standards Act, and whether the myriad of laws \nshould apply to trainees. And the Senator is going to speak about that. \nBut I want to tell him, I couldn't win. I couldn't get it done. That is \nall there is to it. Everyone now knows, including the White House--and \nthey will admit it--that the welfare program will not work in terms of \nthe people that most need the training without some relief from some of \nthe laws that apply across the board to people permanently employed in \ncompanies that make enough money to get by and have to pay them. And \nthere is no doubt that the issue has been framed in a false way.\n  It is not a minimum wage issue. We have already agreed to the minimum \nwage. I heard the President yesterday speak of minimum wage again. That \nis not the issue. The issue is the rules that are going to govern a \nnonprofit organization that we asked to train 10 people. Isn't that \nright? They are going to say, ``Why should we do that?'' Every law on \nthe books governs these trainees, and we didn't even pick them. You \npicked them for us.\n  So I am aware of those and many others. But I think the Senator is \ngoing to also say that there are some good things in this bill.\n  I thank the Senator very much for yielding.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n\n[[Page S8326]]\n\n  Mr. President, let me begin with the tax cut.\n  First of all, I think if you are going to judge what has been done, \nyou have to first begin by looking at the fact that we are cutting \ntaxes by approximately 1 percent. The tax cut on average over the next \n5 years will lower the tax burden on the American people by slightly \nless than 1 percent.\n  So for all of those who are saying, ``Well, the Tax Code becomes more \ncomplicated, the changes that are made are piecemeal,'' all of that was \ndriven by the fact that with the bipartisan nature of this bill and the \nfact that we have a President who was adamantly opposed to cutting \ntaxes until 3 years ago, who only endorsed the concept of trying to \nbalance the budget 2 years ago, that we had a very limited amount of \nresources. Obviously, for people who have listened to much of this \ndebate and have gotten the idea that we are talking about a huge tax \ncut, they are going to be disappointed. But there are some people who \nare going to be directly affected, and in a very positive way. Right at \nthe top of the list will be people who have families and who have \nchildren. Nearly all of the $85 billion net tax cut we have in this \nbill goes directly to families with children.\n\n  Why single them out? I am sure there are people who say, ``Well, \nchildren are important. Families are important. But why such a focus of \nthis tax bill on children?'' Let me explain why.\n  In 1950, the dependent exemption--the amount you got to deduct from \nyour income because you had a dependent--was $500. As a result of that \n$500 dependent exemption for children in 1950, 65 percent of all income \nof the average income working family was not subject to income taxes in \nthe average family of four in America. Today the dependent exemption is \n$2,500. But to cover the same expenses and to protect the same level of \nincome that it did in 1950, it would have to be twice that big, or \n$5,000 per child.\n  So what has happened since 1950 is that the real dependent exemption \nin terms of letting working families keep their money to invest in \ntheir own children has effectively been cut in half.\n  If you look at the Tax Code, what has happened is this: In 1950, rich \npeople paid a lot of taxes. And today rich people pay a lot of taxes. \nIn 1950, poor people didn't pay any income taxes to speak of. And today \npoor people do not pay any income taxes to speak of. But the explosion \nof Government between 1950 and today has been almost totally funded by \na massive growing tax burden on working families with children. And we \nhave literally starved the one institution in America that really \nworks--the family.\n  So our primary focus--first, in the Contract with America, then the \nbudget 2 years ago, then the budget a year ago, and now the budget this \nyear--has been to give a $500 tax credit per child and to let working \nfamilies invest in their own children, their own family, their own \nfuture, recognizing that the best housing program, nutrition program, \nand education program is to let working families keep their own money \nand invest in their own children, their own family, and their own \nfuture.\n  Second, in this tax cut bill we begin the long process of eliminating \nthe death tax. People work a lifetime to build up a farm, or a small \nbusiness, or to build up assets. And they do it for their children and \ntheir future. And they make the country rich in the process. But when \nthey die, even though they pay taxes on every penny they earned along \nthe way, when they try to pass these assets on to their children, the \nGovernment comes in and takes up to 55 cents out of every dollar.\n  So it routinely happens in America every day that parents die, and \nthen their children have to sell the fruits of their lifetime labors--\ntheir business, their farm, their home, their assets--in order to give \nGovernment 55 cents out of every dollar of its value.\n  Republicans believe that is wrong. We believe you ought to tax income \nonce, and not twice. And I think the changes we made in this area, \nespecially for small businesses and family farms, is very, very \nimportant.\n  I believe that people who are trying to educate their children will \nbe beneficiaries of this program.\n  Quite frankly, my favorite part of the tax bill in the area of \neducation is not the President's initiative. It is instead an \ninitiative that came from Senator Roth. That is the initiative that \nlets people when they get out of school treat student loan interest \npayments as a business expense. Think about it for a minute. If you go \nout and buy a tractor, you can depreciate that tractor--write its value \noff against your income. But if you invest in going to college, or \ngraduate school or medical school by borrowing a bunch of money on a \nguaranteed student loan, when you get out of college and you start to \nwork with that big heavy burden of debt, none of the expenses you \nincurred in getting the education that economists call ``human \ncapital'' can be written off as a business expense.\n  So our society's Tax Code has historically discriminated against \ninvesting in our own people.\n  One of the provisions of this bill that is critically important is \nthe provision that for the first time will let a young wage earner who \nhas gotten out of school, who has a big guaranteed student loan, to \nwrite off that interest against the income they are earning as a result \nof the earning power they got from going to college, or graduate \nschool, or professional school. And I believe this is going to \nencourage people to go to school longer and to accumulate greater human \ncapital.\n  There are a lot of provisions in the tax bill. I believe the tax bill \nis basically a good bill, and the American people are going to benefit \nfrom it. Not everybody is going to benefit. The top 5 percent of income \nearners pay 50 percent of the taxes. They are going to benefit from \nnone of the general tax provisions. They will benefit marginally from \nthe death tax change. They will benefit from the capital gains tax. But \nthe focus of our benefit, quite frankly, with simply a 1-percent cut in \ntaxes, is where it ought to be--on working middle-income families.\n\n  We have had a long debate with the President, and the President has \nwon the debate in this bill. But what is the old saying? He, convinced \nagainst his will, is unconvinced still. And let me say I think it is a \nfundamental error, even though I am going to vote for the tax package, \nit is a fundamental mistake in a tax bill that only provides $17 \nbillion of tax cuts a year, it is fundamentally unfair to take part of \nthat tax cut away from working two-income families in order to give a \ntax cut to people who do not pay income taxes. I believe that tax cut \nbills should be aimed at cutting taxes for people who pay them. In any \ncase, that is where we are in the tax bill.\n  Let me turn now to the spending bill. The best provision in the \nspending bill, from my point of view, is expanded choice on Medicare. \nMedicare has grown by 12 percent a year in cost in the last 20 years. \nNo major program has ever grown that fast before, and, as a result, \neven with the reforms we have instituted, even under the best of \ncircumstances, Medicare is destined to become the largest and most \nexpensive program in the history of the American Government. But by \nletting our senior citizens have more choices, by encouraging \ncompetition, by allowing a broad range of choices between the \ntraditional HMO and fee-for-service medicine, we are going to for the \nfirst time bring the forces of competition to bear on controlling the \ncost of Medicare.\n  Since 1965, we have tried to use Government regulation to control \nMedicare costs, and it has been a total and absolute failure. We are \nnow going to try the forces of competition. I believe that they are \ngoing to be successful, and I believe that the most remembered part of \nthe spending bill that is before us will be the expanded choices that \nwe provide under Medicare. If we allow each of these choices to \ndevelop, if we continue to refine them and promote competition, I \nbelieve we can and will over time drive the cost of Medicare growth \ndown to roughly the cost of medical care in the market system.\n  Last year, the cost of medical care in the private sector of the \neconomy actually grew less than the Consumer Price Index. Medicare \ncontinues to outpace inflation by a wide margin. I believe that by \nbringing the forces of competition to bear, we have made a fundamental \nchange in at least part of the Medicare problem. Our failure to deal \nwith the long-term Medicare problem is my greatest disappointment with \nthe bill before us.\n\n[[Page S8327]]\n\n  Someone said in the newspaper this morning that the subtitle of this \nbill ought to be ``Opportunity Lost.'' I agree with that. I believe \nthat we have missed a golden opportunity to begin the reform that will \nbe required to keep Medicare solvent. I am proud of the Senate. I am \nproud of the three votes we cast to keep provisions in our bill that \nwould have raised the eligibility age on Medicare to conform to Social \nSecurity, that would have asked very high-income retirees to pay their \nfull part B premiums, that being the voluntary part of Medicare that \nyou don't pay a penny for during your working life, and finally to have \na simple $5 copayment for home health care.\n  Home health care is the fastest growing part of Medicare. The \nPresident had a 10-percent copayment in his national health insurance \nbill. The Democratic leader, Senator Mitchell, when he offered the \nfinal version of the President's plan 3 years ago, proposed a 20-\npercent copayment. Prior to 1972, we had a 20-percent copayment. And \nthe rejection of a simple $5 copayment to try to induce people to be \ncost conscious was, I believe, a sad commentary on the lack of \nleadership both at the White House and in the Congress. I believe we \nmissed a real opportunity to reform Medicare, and I believe that each \nand every one of these things will be done.\n  Going back to a point that our colleague, Senator Kerrey from \nNebraska, made earlier, the longer we wait to institute these reforms, \nthe more difficult it is going to become to make these reforms work \nbecause the problem is going to get bigger.\n  Some people are encouraged by the fact that we have set up a \ncommission in this bill. Forgive me for being underwhelmed at setting \nup yet another commission. We have already had an entitlement \ncommission. It has already reported. We know what the situation is.\n  Let me just summarize it. Under the best of circumstances, if \neverything goes right, if the economy stays strong, if we have the best \npossible circumstances that we could expect over the next 25 years, our \ncurrent policy on Medicare and Social Security will require the payroll \ntax to double from 15 percent to 30 percent on every working person in \nAmerica. Under the best of circumstances, if we do not change policy, \nwe are going to have a doubling of the payroll tax in 25 years, and \nnobody disputes it. Under the pessimistic scenario of lower growth, we \nare going to have to triple payroll taxes.\n  Let me remind you what that means. It means that a low-income worker \nwho is paying 15 percent of his income in taxes and 15 percent in \npayroll taxes will go from a 30-percent marginal tax rate to a 45-\npercent marginal tax rate. What it will mean, if we do not do something \nto reform Medicare and Social Security, is that, with absolute \ncertainty, 25 years from today the average working American will be \npaying over 50 cents out of every dollar they earn in payroll taxes and \nincome taxes.\n  For those people who said, do not make these hard choices in \nMedicare, they are the people who are going to have to explain why we \nare doubling payroll taxes over the next 25 years.\n  I believe we have a crisis in this area, and let me say the first \nweek we are back, as chairman of the Medicare subcommittee, we are \ngoing to hold a series of hearings on Medicare. Senator Kerrey and I \nare going to reintroduce our reforms as a freestanding bill, and we are \nnot going to let this issue die. I am also going to expand our hearings \nto begin to look at private investments and ownership of assets \nespecially by young workers as a way to guarantee that they have Social \nSecurity benefits when they retire and as a way of guaranteeing that \nthey have Medicare benefits.\n  If we do not change this program, with the baby-boom generation \nretiring in 14 years, we are going to have a generation of Americans \nthat will be paying 30 percent payroll taxes to pay benefits to \nretirees who will never get benefits out of these programs that are in \nany way related to what they paid in. Only if we begin to reform these \nprograms now and only if we begin to restructure the system so when a \nyoung person is setting aside money for their retirement, it is not \ngoing to some phantom account with the Social Security Administration \nbut where it is going in a real investment in something they own and \ncan depend on and trust, until we collateralize or securitize the \nSocial Security and the Medicare contributions of our young people, \ntheir retirement is not going to be secure.\n  Senator Domenici said that I was going to talk about the welfare \nreform, and I am. One of my biggest disappointments in this bill is \nthat, as it is currently structured, we have gone a long way toward \nkilling welfare reform, and let me explain why. First of all, we made \nsome tough decisions about denying benefits, setting higher standards \nand saying, especially to immigrants, you come to America. You have to \ncome with your sleeves rolled up ready to go to work. You cannot come \nto America with your hand held out ready to go on welfare. We have \npartially reversed that in this bill, and we are going to spend tens of \nbillions of dollars providing benefits to people who are denied \nbenefits under our welfare bill, but that is the smallest part of the \nproblem.\n  As a result of the administration responding to special interest \ngroups, especially organized labor, we now have provisions that will \nmake it virtually impossible for States to require welfare recipients \nto work, and let me explain why.\n  If a State has a mandatory work requirement, and let us say they want \nto require welfare recipients who are young mothers who have one skill, \nand that skill is taking care of children, and let us say they set up \nin Government housing projects a day care center, and they ask some \nwelfare recipients to do part of the baby-sitting under supervision, \nunder the provisions of this bill and under the new requirements that \nhave been set by the administration, we would have to pay minimum wage. \nWe would have to provide fringe benefits. We could not count all the \nwelfare benefits they are getting like Medicaid and housing subsidies \nas part of those wages. And so it is going to cost States substantial \namounts of money to put welfare recipients to work where they would \nacquire skills that would let them go out in the marketplace and work.\n  The net result is going to be that we are in reality coming very \nclose to killing the very welfare reform bill that was the greatest \nachievement of the last Congress.\n  These are trainees. They are people who are receiving public \nbenefits, and to ask them, in return for those benefits, to do \nproductive work is the most reasonable thing imaginable. It was \nsomething that a large percentage of Senators and Congressmen on a \nbipartisan basis agreed to last year, and yet 1 year later, with \nadministrative action by the President and through this bill, we are \ngoing to make it virtually impossible for the States to have a work \nprogram for welfare recipients.\n  Now, I am hopeful that we can in the future come out with a bill that \nwill at least let the States count all the benefits that are received \nby people who are receiving welfare in calculating what their effective \nwage is by working. But this is a very, very serious matter.\n  I am also very concerned about this massive new program to give \nhealth insurance to children. Who can be opposed to health insurance \nfor children? Nobody. Bismarck once said, never does a socialist stand \non firmer ground than when he argues for the best principles of health. \nAnd I would just paraphrase Bismarck by saying, never does a socialist \nstand on firmer ground or higher ground than when he argues for the \nbest principles of health for children.\n  But here is the problem. We started off with a bill that had a broad \nconsensus and it was a bill where we were going to spend $16 billion to \ntry to help the States get access for health coverage for children from \nvery low-income families. What happened in the process is that the \npiling on of the tobacco industry got caught up in this, so, whereas \nthe President started out with $16 billion, it has now already grown to \n$24 billion before we adopt the bill, and does anybody believe that \nthis program is not going to explode in the future?\n  Here is the problem. Once you get up to roughly 200 percent of \npoverty, 82 percent of the children are covered by private health \ninsurance. So, unless we are very fortunate, what is going to happen to \nus in this bill is that we are going to end up having four children\n\n[[Page S8328]]\n\nwho will give up, through their families, private health insurance, for \nevery one new child we get covered. So 80 percent of our money will \nsimply displace private health insurance. And how can you blame them? \nIf you have a moderate-income family, having trouble making ends meet, \nand we are going to give their children private health insurance, what \nrational parents are going to continue to pay for it themselves?\n  So, we have the very real specter, here, of spending a tremendous \namount of money and covering almost no additional children. Let me say, \nI totally agree with Senator Domenici. I think the worst choice we \ncould have made was simply going through Medicaid, when all 50 \nGovernors, 2 years ago, told the Congress that they could do what \nMedicaid was doing for 30 percent less if we would let them do it. But \nI think we have to be very concerned about this program. I hope we are \nas committed to monitoring what we are doing as we are to doing it. If \nit becomes clear that all we are doing is displacing private health \ninsurance, I hope we will be willing to go back and try to adjust this \nprogram to try to prevent that from happening.\n  I am also very concerned about all of these new benefits. Again, they \nare not benefits anybody can be against. We are cutting the copayment \nfor outpatient care under Medicare. We are adding a whole bunch of new \nbenefits to Medicare. The problem is, Medicare is going broke as \nquickly as it can go broke. The only reason we can claim we have saved \nit for 10 years is we, in the process, were forced to give in to the \nadministration's demand that we take the fastest growing part of \nMedicare and take it out of the trust fund and put it into general \nrevenue. As I said when we first debated this, I can make Medicare \nsolvent for 100 years by simply taking hospital care out of the trust \nfund. But have we changed anything by doing it? The answer is no.\n  I am concerned that, by creating these new benefits, all of which are \npopular, that we have to look and see whether, in fact, we made the \nproblem better or worse. I am very skeptical that cutting \nreimbursements to doctors and hospitals will really save money. The \nreason I am skeptical is that, as we have gone back and looked at our \nreforms in the past, that has not been a very effective way to save \nmoney. Because what tends to happen is that doctors and hospitals--\nbasically, doctors are smart people or they wouldn't be doctors; \nhospitals tend to be run by smart people--what they do is they figure \nout how they can change the billing so they end up billing for more and \ngetting the same amount of money.\n  So, I am concerned about these add-on benefits. I am worried that \nthese new programs are like little baby elephants, they are little and \npretty now, but if we are not careful they are going to all grow, each \none, into a big elephant. And, as we talk about balancing the budget, \nthe final subject I wanted to talk about, this could be a problem for \nus.\n  Finally, let me talk about balancing the budget. I have been involved \nin budget debates since I first came to the House of Representatives. \nWe have, on many occasions, claimed to have balanced the budget. Many \nof us on various occasions have thought we had really done it. And I \nthink, on balancing the budget, it is important to remember an adage \nthat Abraham Lincoln used to be fond of. Abraham Lincoln once said, \n``The hen is the wisest of all birds. She never cackles until the egg \nis laid.''\n  I believe that a lot of work is going to be required to make this \nbudget ultimately produce a balanced budget. Much of this budget is \nbased on assumptions about a strong economy--which today is very \nstrong. Obviously, we all want it to stay strong and we are going to \ntry to make it stronger. It is also based on the premise that these \nprograms are not going to grow beyond the levels we have set out in our \nbudgets, even the new programs, and that we are going to live up to \nthese discretionary spending caps. Obviously, it is hard to live up to \nthem. As everybody knows, we pass emergency appropriations bills for $8 \nbillion, and we end up breaking the budget, not only in the year we are \nin but for the next 3 or 4 years. We don't write money for emergencies \ninto the bill, knowing we will have an emergency bill. It is going to \ntake a tremendous amount of concerted, bipartisan effort to live up to \nthe commitments we made on discretionary spending. I hope our \ncolleagues are as committed to living up to this budget as they are to \nadopting it. I think, if they are, we might have a fighting chance. But \nclearly, balancing the budget is not something you buy on a one-time \npayment. You buy it on the installment plan.\n  And the weakness of the program is it is based on the assumption that \nthis very strong economy is going to continue into the future. It may \nand it may not. We are in the second-longest peacetime expansion in \nAmerican history. I think it is highly improbable that we would go 5 \nyears without an adjustment. But we could still balance the budget with \na minor recession if we could control the growth of these programs. I \nwish, as I said numerous times during the budget debate, we could have \ndone more to control spending. I wish we could have bought more \ninsurance.\n  But, in conclusion, let me say that the reforms in Medicare, the \nexpanded choices, represent a fundamental change in policy. And I \nbelieve we will all benefit from them. I think we did about as good a \njob, given that we had a Democrat President who had very strong goals \nin the tax bill, especially a belief that you can't cut taxes for \npeople who pay taxes unless you give money to people who don't pay \nincome taxes. I think, given that we had 1 percent of taxes to deal \nwith and we had a President who didn't share our fundamental goal, I \nthink overall we did a pretty good job on the tax bill and I think we \nhave reason to be proud of that.\n  I think the reforms and choice on Medicare are good reforms. But I \nthink there is really reason to be concerned about what we have allowed \nto happen on welfare reform, and much of our budget is assuming that \nthe progress we have made on reducing the welfare rolls is going to \ncontinue. I think we have to be concerned about growth, especially in \nthese new programs. We have to enforce the discretionary spending caps \nto have any chance of balancing the Federal budget.\n  So my message today is that there is a lot of work to be done. I look \nforward to participating with Senator Domenici and with our colleagues \nto try to get that work done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Senator Kennedy has been waiting. I am \nonly going to take a minute, Senator.\n  I did not get to hear Senator Gramm's entire remarks. I pledged to \nhim before that I would read them in their entirety, and I will. But \nlet me make just a couple of quick observations.\n  I think everybody knows--my good friend from Texas said--you can't \nget a balanced budget overnight. You do buy it on the installment plan. \nWhen you buy it on an installment plan that is 3 years, 5 years, or 10 \nyears, you have to make some assumptions. I think, distinguished \neconomist that he is, he would know that.\n  The Senate should know we did not use optimistic economic \nassumptions. In fact, we used CBO's very modest economic assumptions. \nThere is no way we could provide an assumption, outright, that, if we \nhave a serious recession, that we provided for it. But CBO's economic \nassumptions versus others, more optimistic, at least build into their \nmodel that, indeed, there could be a slowdown and, thus, they take \nsomething off the growth edge. So I don't think we have an unduly high \none.\n  Senator, I am agreeing with you that unless we seek to look at the \nnew programs we created, in terms of are they performing as we \nexpected, we won't make it. And, second, I am not terribly interested \nin being the enforcer on appropriations caps--which are very strenuous \nafter 1998. In fact, I will give you the number. The baseline for \ndiscretionary, if we did nothing, is $2.943 trillion. Under this bill \nit is $139 billion less, which means for a period of time it is going \nto grow very little, in fact five-tenths of 1 percent.\n\n  But I am not going to run around being the enforcer if entitlements \nare going wild again. You might, and I would respect you for it. But, \nessentially, we cannot balance the budget on\n\n[[Page S8329]]\n\nthe appropriations accounts. We have to make sure we control the \nentitlements and I think you agree with that. You are not agreeing with \nme that we should not worry about appropriations. I would worry less \nthan you about correct appropriations. But what the Senator has said \nabout making sure we get there, and making sure we do some things to \nassure that this commitment and this path is, indeed, realized--which \nis what you are saying, I believe--I think that's correct.\n  I think--so long as everybody leaves knowing that, in terms of making \nsure we don't let things within this slip and say, ``Oh, well, $10 \nbillion didn't matter, we thought it was that but we are wrong,'' and \njust pass those tens of billions by--we will get there. And that's not \nan exceptional thing to expect of a group which is out claiming a \nbalancing budget. Would you agree? We are out there claiming it. We \nought to be willing to say we will do what's necessary. And I think if \nwe do what's here that's enough. We don't have to do a lot more over \nthe next 5 years, but if we are going to do less, it is not going to be \nenough and we are all going to be ashamed.\n  I thank the Senator for those observations which prompted me to say \nthis because I believe that's absolutely true. I yield the floor and I \nyield to Senator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is a great day for America's \nchildren. With this agreement, we have taken a giant step toward giving \nall American children the healthy start in life they deserve.\n  The establishment of a new, $24 billion program to provide low and \nmoderate income families the help they need to purchase health \ninsurance for their children is a landmark achievement. It represents \nthe most far-reaching step that Congress has ever taken to help the \nNation's children and the most far-reaching advance in health care \nsince the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid a generation ago.\n  The funds provided under this bill are sufficient to assure that \nevery American family has access to affordable insurance for its \nchildren.\n  President Clinton deserves tremendous credit for his leadership in \nachieving this milestone. His fight for health security for all \nAmericans in the first 2 years of his administration laid the \nfoundation for the progress we made in the last Congress and for \ntoday's agreement.\n  The Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation enacted in the last Congress \nguarantees that workers can change jobs without losing their health \ninsurance coverage, or being denied coverage because of a pre-existing \ncondition. The vast majority of Americans obtain health insurance for \nthemselves and their families through their jobs, and ending insurance \ndiscrimination against those in poor health was a significant step \ntoward greater health security for all families.\n  Today's expansion of health insurance coverage for children could not \nhave happened without President Clinton's strong support. The President \nfought hard to include a $16 billion commitment for children in the \nbudget agreement. And it was his unwavering support that assured the \nadditional $8 billion added by the Senate was included in the final \nbill.\n  I also commend several others who contributed to this victory for \nchildren. Mrs. Clinton has made the issue of good health care for \nchildren a lifetime of commitment, and I thank her for her strong \nsupport. Senator Hatch's courageous leadership in the battle for health \ninsurance coverage financed by a cigarette tax was absolutely critical. \nSenator Rockefeller, Senator Chafee, Senator Jeffords, Senator Kerry, \nRepresentatives Nancy Johnson, Bob Matsui, and Marge Roukema and others \nwere effective leaders in reaching this bipartisan goal.\n  Among many outside groups that worked to make this day possible, the \nCampaign for CHILD Health Now, co-chaired by the Children's Defense \nFund and the American Cancer Society, was indispensable in its tireless \nefforts to inform and mobilize the public in support of children's \nhealth insurance. Marian Wright Edelman, as always, was outstanding in \nthese efforts.\n  When Senator Hatch and I introduced our children's health insurance \nproposal in March, we said that it would help guarantee good health \ncare for millions of children who have been left out and left behind. \nThese children come from hard-working families. Their parents work 40 \nhours a week, 52 weeks a year--but they still cannot afford the health \ncare their children need. Whether the issue is eyeglasses, or hearing \naids, or asthma, or prescription drugs, too many children do not get \nthe care they need for the healthy start in life they deserve.\n  The agreement today brings new hope to these children and their \nfamilies. It means that they will have a better opportunity to achieve \na long and healthy life. It means that our country has at last given \nchildren's health the high priority it deserves.\n  I am also pleased that there will be an increase in the cigarette \ntax, but I am disappointed that the cigarette companies still wield \nsufficient power in the back rooms of Congress to roll back the tax \nbelow the 20-cent increase approved by an overwhelming bipartisan vote \nin the Senate. A higher tobacco tax is an effective means to discourage \nchildren from smoking. This issue will not go away, and I expect the \nSenate to return to it later this year, either in the context of \nlegislation on the tobacco settlement or as part of other bills.\n  Finally, it is gratifying that the agreement drops the harsh and ill-\nthought-out proposals on Medicare, such as raising the eligibility age, \nimposing a means test on premiums, and requiring copayments for home \nhealth care that would have penalized the oldest, sickest, and poorest \nsenior citizens. Long-run reforms are needed to keep Medicare strong, \nbut any reform worth the name deserves careful deliberation by \nCongress, not the short-circuited consideration imposed by the strict \nrules on budget bills.\n  Finally, I express my very personal appreciation for the strong \nleadership that was provided by Senator Daschle, on our side, and for \nhis strong commitment on health care. Senator Daschle had indicated \nthat health care for children was going to be one of our Democratic \nstrong priorities in this Congress. His unflagging strength and \ncommitment and support for this program was invaluable in seeing its \nachievement.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time be \ncharged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to talk \nabout the budget agreement, and this reconciliation bill in particular.\n  Let me begin by complimenting the distinguished majority chairman, \nSenator Domenici, and the ranking member, Senator Lautenberg, for their \noutstanding work in this whole effort. As has been said now by many \nMembers, this would not have been possible were it not for their effort \nand the leadership they have demonstrated.\n  Let me commend the administration's negotiators--Secretary Rubin, \nChief of Staff Erskine Bowles, John Hilley, and others--for the \nextraordinary effort they have made in working with us on the \nPresident's behalf.\n  The majority leader deserves a great deal of credit. This would not \nhave been possible without his direct participation. He ought to take \ngreat pride in this agreement's accomplishments.\n  Many others on both sides of the aisle have worked diligently over \nthe last several weeks to bring us to this point, and they too deserve \ncredit. I am very appreciative of their efforts. This agreement is one \nof the most extraordinary accomplishments achieved, at least since I \nhave been leader and perhaps since I have been in the Senate.\n  I think the message in the last election on the part of the American \npeople all over the country was very simple:\n\n[[Page S8330]]\n\n We want Republicans and Democrats to cooperate, to work on major \nproblems together, to address the major problems in a way that gives \nthem and gives us hope that there is a better future, a stronger \nfuture. They recognize, as we do, that the deficit is a major problem \nand has been a major problem. I think this agreement--as spelled out in \nboth the spending and tax reduction bills--is clear evidence that we \nunderstood that message and have responded as consequentially and as \nsincerely as we possibly can.\n  This agreement is the final downpayment on a budget process that has \nnow been underway for several years. In fact, it goes back to the vote \nof 1993, as some of my colleagues have already articulated.\n  This chart, Mr. President, very clearly illustrates from where we \nhave come and what we have left to do. The projected deficits prior to \nthe enactment of the 1993 economic package are represented in the top \nline.\n  In 1993, we made the tough choices, the very critical decisions in \n1993. As a result, we have been able to reduce the actual and projected \ndeficits by $2.4 trillion over the period from 1993 to 2002. Were we to \nstop at this point and do nothing, annual deficits for the next 5 years \nare currently projected to remain in the range of $100 billion. If, as \nI expect, we pass this bill by week's end, we will have completely \neliminated the deficit no later than the year 2002. In other words, the \nnet savings over the next 5 years that will be generated by enacting \nthis budget agreement will total over $200 billion.\n  So we will achieve our goal of a balanced Federal budget by the year \n2002, if not sooner, as a result, first, of adoption of the 1993 budget \nagreement, and, second, enactment of the 1997 budget agreement. Passage \nof these two pieces of legislation will bring us to a balanced Federal \nbudget for the first time since 1969.\n  There were many fears expressed about what would happen to our \neconomy and the deficit if we were to enact the spending and tax \npolicies contained in the budget agreement of 1993. I will not belabor \nthe point or go over those fears at this time. Instead, I will simply \nconcentrate on what has been said about the economy since the passage \nof the 1993 package by people outside of the Senate, in particular the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan.\n  Here's what he says about the state of our economy since the adoption \nof our 1993 budget plan: we are ``now in the 7th consecutive year of \nexpansion, making it the third longest post-World War II cyclical \nupswing to date.''\n  In addition, he said:\n\n       This strong expansion has produced a remarkable increase in \n     work opportunities for Americans. . . . Our whole economy \n     will benefit from their greater productivity.\n\n  Finally, he said:\n\n       Consumers are also enjoying low inflation . . . financial \n     markets have been buoyant . . . in a relatively stable, low-\n     inflation environment.\n\n  That is about as optimistic a series of statements as I have ever \nheard the Chairman of the Federal Reserve make. He has a reason for \nmaking them--the economy is strong, we have been able to reduce the \ndeficit, and we have an optimistic outlook about our future. And it is \nuniversally held. Whether we turn to the Chairman of the Federal \nReserve Board, or Members of Congress, or the business community, or \nmembers of labor, the response is the same: Our country is stronger \ntoday.\n  There can be no doubt that we are strong.\n  Unemployment and inflation right now are at a combined rate of 8.7 \npercent. That is the best since Lyndon Johnson was President of the \nUnited States.\n  Inflation is at a 2.8 annual percentage rate. That is the best since \nJohn Kennedy was President.\n  The employment picture, with 12 million new jobs, is the best \nemployment situation our country has faced in its history. Construction \njobs are stronger now than at any time since I was born, since Harry \nTruman was President.\n  Consumer confidence has increased 14 percent in the last 4 years, \nwhich is the best we have seen since President Eisenhower.\n  Deficit reduction has been reduced to under 1 percent of gross \ndomestic product in 1997. That is the best we have seen in all the \nyears that I have lived. One would have to go back to Harry Truman's \nPresidency to find a time when it was this good.\n  Home ownership has increased from 63 percent to 65 percent, the best \never. Never in our Nation's history have two-thirds of all Americans \nlived in their own homes.\n\n  The stock market has gone from 3,500 to more than 8,000, a growth \nrecord that has been matched only once, and that was during World War \nII.\n  Median family income is up $1,600 since 1993, the best since Lyndon \nJohnson was President of the United States.\n  So, Mr. President, we feel very good about the circumstances and \nabout the economic progress and performance of the last 4 years.\n  At the same time, we have said repeatedly over the last several \nmonths that there are four categories by which we would judge any \nagreement that would attempt to make further progress on the deficit: \nfairness, fiscal responsibility, education, and how we target the \ninvestments that we will make as a result of this legislation. Those \nare the four criteria. How fair is it? How responsible is it fiscally? \nHow good an educational program can we achieve? And how well are we \ngoing to be able to target our investments?\n  Let us take the first category. How do Americans do under this \nagreement on the issue of fairness? Many of us talked for some time \nabout how important it was that we benefit all income categories, not \njust the top income category, but those working families in the $20,000 \nto $30,000 income categories, people who pay a portion of their income \nto income taxes but an even greater portion to payroll taxes. Are we \ngoing to be able to provide tax relief to families such as those?\n  We will provide a child tax credit to 27 million working families. \nFamilies who pay thousands of dollars in payroll taxes, families who \npay income taxes, families who try to make ends meet, each and every \nweek, each and every month, those families are going to benefit very \ndirectly as a result of what we were able to do with the child tax \ncredit.\n  And $24 billion has been committed in the first 5 years for a \nchildren's health program, which is the largest single investment in \nhealth care since the passage of Medicaid in 1965. That is just the \nbeginning, because we have also committed another $24 billion in the \nsecond 5 years. For the first time in history, thousands of South \nDakotans and millions of Americans are going to benefit from a Federal \nhealth program that for the first time will provide meaningful health \ncare to children who are not getting it today.\n  And $1.5 billion is going to be committed to low-income seniors to \nhelp pay for Medicare premiums.\n  So, Mr. President, from a fairness point of view, there can be no \ndoubt, when it comes to health, when it comes to the array of \nopportunities that we present working families, this bill deserves our \nsupport.\n  Mr. President, we also, as I indicated, made a very important point \nof arguing the need for targeted investment. Indeed, this legislation \nprovides opportunities for targeted investment in environmental \ncleanup, in enterprise communities, and targeted job tax credits, \nensuring that family farms and family businesses are going to be \nprotected as one generation transfers its property to the next.\n  Employer tax deductions are going to be made available for employee \neducation and training.\n  In a number of ways, we say we are going to take the resources \navailable to us and target them to where they can be used to the \ngreatest advantage--on environment, on communities, on jobs, on farms \nand small businesses. We provide an array of opportunities in that \nregard to do what Democrats said was very critical: provide the kind of \ntargeted investment that is so essential to ensuring that all aspects \nand all elements of our American society benefit from what we are doing \ntoday.\n  The third criteri we spelled out was fiscal responsibility. How well \ndo we do in that regard? We said at the very beginning, we do not want \nto see an explosion of deficit in the outyears. We wanted to be \nabsolutely certain that, regardless of what else we do, we did not want \nto pass a tax cut we cannot afford and place ourselves back in the same \nbox we created for this country in\n\n[[Page S8331]]\n\nthe 1980's. We did not want to relive the bad old days of those \nextraordinarily high deficits. Instead, we now recognize that achieving \na balanced budget in 2002 is only the first step in maintaining a \nbalanced budget in the years beyond 2002.\n  So we do not index capital gains. We put income limits on individual \nretirement accounts. We do not index the estate tax exemptions, simply \nbecause we were afraid of the extraordinary explosion in outyear \ndeficits that these changes would trigger.\n  I recognize the fact that we did not go as far as some of us would \nhave liked to ensure fiscal responsibility, to ensure with a high \ndegree of confidence that we will be able to maintain a balanced \nbudget. However, I also believe we took a number of steps that allow \nfor some confidence that once we have balance the Federal budget, it \nwill stay balanced in the years 2003, 2004, 2005, and beyond.\n  Mr. President, the last category is one that is probably of greatest \nimportance to many working families because they are trying to make \nends meet and still send their children to college. In this information \nage, it is important that we do all we can to make available to working \nfamilies the tools and the resources necessary to allow every child who \ngraduates from high school the opportunity to get more education. So \nthis bill provides the single largest investment in higher education \nsince Harry Truman passed the GI bill almost 50 years ago.\n  We provide a $1,500 HOPE credit in the first 2 years of college and a \n20 percent tuition credit for college juniors and seniors and lifelong \nlearning opportunities. There are families of all ages with many \ndifferent sets of circumstances involving children who want to go to \ncollege, involving a spouse who may want to get additional education. \nAn array of different challenges confront all working families as they \nattempt to cope with the circumstances we are facing in this \ninformation age. We provide that mechanism and those tools to working \nfamilies in ways that we have not done in more than four decades.\n  So, Mr. President, as a result of this President's advocacy, we are \ncommitting resources to education that we have not done in the period I \nhave served in the Congress.\n  There are no Pell grant reductions. There are opportunities for \npeople to use other tools as well and not be penalized for using the \ncredits that we now make available.\n  In the end, Mr. President, it all comes down to real names and real \nfamilies, people that are truly going to be affected. While there are \nmany families who have come before us over the course of the last \nseveral weeks to describe their situation, and talk about their \ncircumstances, I think the Richards family in Sioux Falls, SD, who \ntalked to us via television camera just a couple of days ago, is a \nclear example of what this legislation means for a typical American \nfamily.\n  Charlie Richards is a teacher. He is not only a teacher; he has two \nextra part-time jobs. There are many people in South Dakota who work \nnot just one job, but two and three jobs in order to make ends meet. \nCharlie Richards is that kind of an individual, hard working. He \nbelieves that his family must have the very best that he can provide \nthem, and he is willing to commit the extra time and effort and hours \nto see that provides his family with a quality of life that he now only \ndreams of.\n  His wife Karen is pregnant with their second child. Their income is \nabout $24,000 a year. As a result of what we are doing this afternoon \nand what we will do this week, Charlie and Karen will get a $975 child \ntax credit. This figure was zero under the legislation originally \ndrafted and passed by the House. Both children, once the second child \nis born, will get health care coverage, perhaps for the first time. \nBoth children will be eligible for HOPE credits when they are ready for \ncollege. Both children will be eligible for KidSave and other \nindividual retirement accounts when savings increase.\n  For the first time, Charlie and Karen will be able to perhaps set a \nlittle money aside for savings, maybe to buy a home, maybe to improve \nthe home they are living in now, maybe to give their family just a \nlittle bit more hope that they are going to be able to make ends meet \nand do the kinds of things that every family dreams of doing, not just \nwith the one child they have now, but with two.\n  So to Charlie and Karen, and to families just like them across the \ncountry, let us say today that we give them hope of a better future, a \nbrighter and more realistic opportunity of achieving their goals.\n  We heard our constituents last year when they told us we have got to \nwork together to solve problems, when they told us it is important that \nthey have the kind of economic strength and security that they want so \nbadly, when they told us we have got to continue to work and put our \nbest effort forward to reduce the debt. We heard them on all these \nfronts. As a result of the extraordinary leadership and work done on \nboth sides of the aisle, we are responding today in a way that makes me \nvery proud.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Stevens). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this conference report comes before the \nSenate in an atmosphere of near euphoria. While I have signed the \nconference report--I was a Democratic conferee from the Finance \nCommittee on these matters--and while I will vote for each of the \nbills, I cannot share the elation. I say this with the greatest respect \nfor the Senators who managed this through the Budget Committee and, of \ncourse, for our own revered chairman of the Finance Committee--Senator \nRoth--and others who have worked so very hard on the legislation. \nSurely, there is much to applaud in both bills. But the agreement does \nlittle to address, in a serious way, either short run or long-run \nbudget problems.\n  In the short-run, the Federal budget is already on the verge of \nbalance. This is due to a strong 7-year economic expansion. The \nexpansion is attributable, in part--very probably in large part--to the \nbudget decisions made by the President and this side of the aisle in \nthe Senate in 1993. Indeed, my respected colleague, Bob Kerrey, \nsuggests that the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 be renamed \nthe Balanced Budget Act of 1993. The deficit reduction brought about by \nOBRA 93, as our usage has it, is expected to reduce the deficit by a \ncumulative $924 billion through 1998. That is almost a trillion \ndollars.\n  I stood on the floor at this desk, with my great and good friend, \nSenator Sasser, as the chairman of the Budget Committee at that desk. I \nwas chairman of the Finance Committee. In the end, we enacted that \nmeasure by one vote, which has brought us to where we are today. I \ndon't know that the Nation, having heard so much for so long about \ndeficits, had been properly concerned about them so much and for so \nlong. It is not easy to grasp the possibility that the deficit for this \nfiscal year, which will end September 30, will come in under $30 \nbillion. That is about one-third of 1 percent of gross domestic \nproduct--an insignificant number. If the present trends continue, we \ncould well be in a surplus in a year's time--the first such surplus, if \nI rightly recall, since 1969.\n  And then having reached the point where we have free resources, we \nwould be in a very proper position to turn to questions of, do we want \nto cut taxes, which clearly we might do? I would much prefer to see tax \nrates reduced--and I will talk about that tomorrow--or to provide new \nbenefit programs of the kind that we are providing, but not before we \nhave done what we said we would do first, which was to balance the \nbudget.\n  Over the long run, too, this legislation does less than many of us on \nthe Finance Committee would have liked. Indeed, I can say, sir, that \nall of us on the Finance Committee would have liked, as the measure I \nam referring to, passed unanimously in the Finance Committee, 20 to 0, \non June 18. In particular, we chose to confront the long-run issues in \nMedicare. We are told that our two major retirement programs--Social \nSecurity and Medicare--\n\n[[Page S8332]]\n\nare in grave difficulties. That is not so clear in the case of Social \nSecurity.\n  Four rather simple steps would bring us into actuarial balance for a \nfull 75 years--the usual way solvency is measured for the Social \nSecurity program. It could be done by four simple measures.\n  Construct an accurate cost of living index--rather than a consumer \nprice index--in the manner that has been proposed by the chairman of \nthe Federal Reserve Board, the previous director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget, Dr. Rivlin, and the Boskin Commission \nestablished by the Finance Committee when Senator Packwood was \nchairman--he and I jointly did that.\n  Tax Social Security retirement benefits in the way that all other \npensions are now taxed.\n  Include all workers in the Social Security system. To this day, in a \nkind of exasperating holdover from the 1930's, there are several \nmillion State and local government employees who are not in the Social \nSecurity system as government employees, but who acquire the benefits, \nin any event, through part-time work outside.\n  Increase the computation period from 35 to 38 years.\n  Just take those four measures, and a few other odd things, and we put \nSocial Security in fine fiscal condition into the second half of the \nnext century.\n  This is not the case with Medicare. Medicare is a health program, and \nit provides health care to a population that grows older and does so in \nthe setting where medical science grows ever more successful in the \ntreatment of the diseases associated with aging. But those treatments \nare, of necessity, ever more expensive. There is a true problem in \nMedicare. We have made many changes in the present program, so as to \nprovide another 10 years of trust fund solvency. But in fact, sir, \nsince 1992, the revenues from the Medicare payroll taxes have not \nequaled the outlays. And we have used general revenues to fund the \nshortfall, and since the Federal budget has been in a deficit \nsituation, we have had to borrow money to do it. We can say, if you \nlike, that we have 10 years of solvency. There is not now and there \nwon't be until we do very important things.\n  We began that effort in the Finance Committee on June 18. We took the \ndecision to increase the age of eligibility for Medicare from 65 years \nto 67, in very gradual steps over the next quarter century, and \nbringing it into line with the increased age of eligibility for Social \nSecurity benefits, provisions adopted in 1983 in the aftermath of a \ncommission, headed by Dr. Greenspan, on which Senator Dole and I \nserved, among others. That measure just responds to the age profile, \nthe demographic profile of the American people. We are living longer. \nAnd I would say, Mr. President, also, while we are living longer, we \nare retiring earlier. The majority of Americans now retire at age 62, \nwhen a reduced benefit on Social Security is available, and some 70 \npercent have retired by age 65. It is not entirely clear why. Some have \nsufficient resources and they simply want to stop working, and others \nhave not gotten work, or others find the work no longer possible for \nthem. But the fact is that most people now are retired before age 65, \nand on actuarially reduced benefits, so the trust funds are left \nunaffected. We proposed to do that with Medicare.\n  If there is a problem of interim insurance from the time you leave \nemployment to the time you are retired, well, we can resolve that \nproblem. We could be thinking about it right now, in terms of those who \nretire early on Social Security. The problem of health care insurance \ndoes not deter, so far as we can tell, persons from doing that. It is \nnot an admirable fact; it is a distressful fact that the last time the \nSocial Security Administration did a survey asking persons the reasons \nwhy they retired early was about 15 years ago. The Social Security \nAdministration is very slow in providing the kind of information we \nwould like to have to make these decisions.\n  We also, in the Finance Committee, unanimously agreed to increase the \npart B premiums for upper-income beneficiaries. That is to say, to \nreduce the part of the Medicare Program paid for by general revenues. \nWhen the program was begun--and I was involved if not peripherally, but \nwith some measure of consequence as an Assistant Secretary of Labor for \nPolicy Planning and Research in the Johnson administration--we provided \nthat this program, Part B, should be paid for half by premiums paid by \nbeneficiaries and half by general revenues. Over the years, as a \ntechnical result of having constrained the increase in premiums to the \nsame percentage increase in Social Security benefits, while the cost of \nmedical care increased faster than the consumer price index--which \nitself was an inadequate measure of the cost of living--that 50/50 \nshare dropped to 25 percent for beneficiaries and 75 percent for the \nGovernment.\n  We would simply provide that persons with higher incomes would pay \nmore than the simple 25 percent that the great majority of persons \nwould pay. We are talking about a very small number of people--about 6 \npercent of all beneficiaries--but the principle is that if you have the \nincome, you don't need the subsidy. Indeed, the overall subsidy would \nstill be much greater than it was originally envisaged in 1965--with \nthe Federal Government financing 72 percent of program costs out of \ngeneral revenues. The time has come to do that.\n  Equally, the time has come to provide some measure of copayment for \nhome health care, which has been growing at extraordinary rates, and \nwhich is evidently subject to serious abuse. This was widely reported \nin the press just this week. These items have come to be known as the \nbig three Medicare changes. They were adopted on June 25 here on the \nSenate floor by a vote of 73 to 27. However, they are not included in \nthe conference agreement. The House was not willing to do this, and I \ncan only regret that we have not done so. I stand here and say, \nhowever, that the Senate has led the way and has shown you can do it. \nThe response in public opinion has been quite moderate. The comment in \nthe press has been almost unvaryingly supportive.\n\n  These are necessary, sensible things to do. And it is time we set \nabout doing them. There is an opportunity that we will not miss, \nparticularly if the Finance Committee--under the leadership of Chairman \nRoth--continues to work in a bipartisan manner.\n  About 80 percent of the savings in mandatory programs in this bill \nbefore us, this extraordinary large bill--I would hate to see it \ndropped on anyone's foot--about 80 percent of those savings came from \nactions by the Finance Committee. The 5-year savings for Medicare are \n$115 billion. That is a decrease in the increase, in a manner we have \ncome to be familiar with, and, as I have said, the trust fund will be \nin technical balance for about 10 years.\n  This does buy us time for an important provision in the bill, the \nprovision for the creation of a national bipartisan commission on the \nfuture of Medicare--time for such commission to do its work. The \nstatute provides that it issue its report by March 1, 1999, a year and \na half from now.\n  The commission is required, in the first instance, to review and \nanalyze the long-term financial condition of the Medicare Program, \nwhich is not an easy matter because we are talking about the long-term \nprogress of medicine in an age of discovery that has proved \nextraordinarily creative and fruitful but equally and not \nunsurprisingly costly, and to identify the problems that threaten the \nfinancial integrity of Medicare, including the extent to which Medicare \nupdate indexes do not accurately reflect inflation.\n  If I could say parenthetically, Mr. President, we have had a great \ndeal of talk about the accuracy, or inaccuracy, or sufficiency, or \ninsufficiency of the Consumer Price Index. The fact is, we have at \nleast four distinct price indexes in our present statutes and in our \npractices. They are spread all over the Government. One of them indexes \nMedicare expenses in ways that it seems to me probably overstate \ninflation.\n  Next the commission is asked to make recommendations regarding the \nfinancing of graduate medical education, including consideration of \nalternative broad-based sources of funding for medical education. This \ncould not be a more important matter. The question of medical schools \nand medical education is absolutely essential as we begin the process \nof economic rationalization in the provision of health\n\n[[Page S8333]]\n\ncare, as we do in this measure making a wide range of HMO's available \nto Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients.\n  In this regard, Mr. President, might I just go back to 1994 when the \nFinance Committee was taking up the health care proposal sent to us by \nthe administration in the last days of the first session of the 103d \nCongress. I was in New York City and asked the distinguished head of \nthe Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York--Dr. Paul \nMarks--if he would arrange a seminar to bring me up to date on the \nthinking of medical deans and medical academic researchers in the area \nof health care generally. We met one morning in a conference room in \nJanuary at 10 o'clock. And at about 10:20, one of the deans, who comes \nfrom another part of the country, said, ``You know, the University of \nMinnesota may have to close its medical school.'' That was said to me \nand I knew I had heard something important. Minnesota is the kind of \nState where they open medical schools. They don't close them. I asked, \n``How could that be?'' They said, ``Well, managed care is making its \nway from the west coast to the east coast. It has reached the high \nplains, and is now widely used in Minnesota.''\n  Persons enrolled in managed care plans are not sent to teaching \nhospitals because they are, by definition, more expensive. If you do \nnot have a teaching hospital, you can't have a medical school. And, \nindeed, the teaching hospital at the University of Minnesota has since \nmerged with another health care institution.\n  We are dealing with something profoundly important. An ancient \npractice of medicine goes all the way back to the Greeks. The \nestablishment of medicine doesn't go back just to the Greeks, but the \nidea of a profession of medicine with a code of ethics, a Hippocratic \noath, certain responsibilities, certain immutabilities in medicine--\nsomething of a mystery, something of a guide. In my youth, doctors \nwould prescribe medicines taken from drugstores in a handwriting that \nwas illegible to the laymen. Only the pharmacist could read it. All of \nthat is disappearing.\n  In our hearings in the Finance Committee, Msgr. Charles J. Fahey, a \nprofessor at Fordham University said to us, ``What you are seeing is a \n`commodification' of medicine.'' There is a striking image here on the \nSenate floor. For generations, we have argued the issue of whether \nlabor is a commodity. Finally, in the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, we \nsaid labor is not a commodity. Well, medicine is becoming one.\n  The next week, Dr. Raymond G. Schultze, at the time the head of the \nUCLA Medical Center volunteered, and said, ``Can I give you an example \nof that?'' We were discussing it with our witnesses, saying that is a \nnew idea. He said, ``In southern California, we now have a spot market \nof bone marrow transplants.'' Well, when you get into that, that is \ngood. It keeps control on prices. It brings rational decisionmaking \ninto this market. But it doesn't provide for the public good. Markets \nwon't provide for the public good that a teaching hospital and a \nmedical school constitute.\n  So our commission must pay special attention to these institutions.\n  Finally, we ask the commission to make recommendations on modifying \nthe age of eligibility for Medicare so that it corresponds to the \nchanges in the age of eligibility for Social Security. I would simply \nsuggest that this provision--the instruction to the forthcoming \ncommission to deal with this matter of age of eligibility--obviously \nreflects the decision in the Finance Committee and the Senate that it \nought to be increased to be in harmony with that of Social Security.\n  The Medicaid changes in this legislation will save about $10 billion \nover 5 years by providing greater flexibility to the States, and at the \nsame time, as I have remarked earlier, the Medicaid recipients will be \nencouraged to participate in HMO's just as Medicare recipients do. When \nwe began Medicaid and Medicare, there were very few arrangements which \nwe now call health maintenance organizations. Fee-for-service medicine \nwas almost the universal experience. So, naturally, when people \nretired, they continued it, and Medicaid recipients took it up. That \nhas changed with the general population and ought to change with this \npopulation as well.\n  To the one bit of really strikingly good news in this measure, we \nhave taken action to provide health coverage for uninsured children, \n$24 billion over 5 years. This will be the largest expansion in \nGovernment health insurance since the enactment of Medicare and \nMedicaid in 1965. We have done something that has not been done in a \ngeneration, and something that is needed. It will be financed by an \nincrease in the cigarette tax that will eventually reach 15 cents per \npack. Both of these measures were also an initiative of the Senate \nFinance Committee.\n  I would also note that the conference committee, even prior to our \ncommission, includes provisions to ensure an adequate stream of Federal \nfunding for teaching hospitals. Financing of health care continues to \nundergo dramatic change. We will have a more comprehensive proposal \nfrom our commission. But we have done some things in this bill.\n  Medicare payments to HMO's now reflect the higher cost of providing \ncare in teaching hospitals. Under the legislation before us, these \npayments will be carved out, as we say, and sent directly to the \nteaching hospitals, thereby ensuring that the money will go where it is \nintended.\n  In addition, while payments for medical education have been reduced \nas part of the overall reduction in payments to hospitals and \nphysicians that are inevitable in a deficit reduction bill, the \nconference report includes the Senate language which limits the cuts to \nabout $5.5 billion rather than $6.5 billion recommended by the House.\n  Again, sir, I would say that had we not decided to go for a large tax \nincrease, which we will talk about tomorrow, we wouldn't have had to \nmake some of these reductions which I think we will find difficult, if \nnot indeed painful.\n  Finally, it should be noted that this bill sensibly increases the \nstatutory debt limit from $5.5 trillion to $5.95 trillion, which will \nbe sufficient to take us through December 1999--a much smaller increase \nwould be required if we decided simply to stay the course that we set \nin 1993.\n  So, Mr. President, I will support this conference report. It is the \nproduct of a long and difficult effort to reach compromise between the \nCongress and the President. It was characterized by extraordinary \nunanimity in the Finance Committee, where 80 percent of the mandatory \nprogram reductions are to be found, and by very large majorities here \non the Senate floor.\n  I think that speaks to the sincerity of the participants and, I hope, \nto our knowledge. If I consult my hopes in this matter, there is no \nreal alternative. And, in the meantime, we have done some things that \nwe surely can be proud of.\n  I see my friend, the Senator from West Virginia, is on the floor. I \nknow what particular pleasure he will take in the provision of $24 \nbillion in health insurance for children, the largest such increase in \nhealth care in a generation since the enactment of Medicare and \nMedicaid was done.\n  With that, Mr. President, and seeing that there are other Senators \npresent, I yield the floor.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I do not know who is controlling time, \nbut certainly the Senator can take as much time as he desires. There is \nnobody here on your side. I give it to you off my side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nunder the time under the control of the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank very much the Senator from New \nMexico for his courtesy, and I will take the time under the control of \nthe Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. President, I will make a couple of general comments first, and \nthen I want to speak specifically about a provision in the conference \nreport which is before us that is enormously troubling.\n  First let me explain that I intend to vote for this legislation. The \nSenator from New Jersey and the Senator from\n\n[[Page S8334]]\n\nNew Mexico and others have, I think, done a remarkable job of crafting \na bill that represents a compromise with the White House, with the \nRepublicans and the Democrats, putting together a piece of legislation \nthat tackles this budget deficit, and is the second step of several \nsteps that we have taken, first in 1993 and then now in 1997, which \nwill lead to a fiscal policy that is under control in this country--not \nonly tackling the deficit but doing so in a way that makes a great deal \nof sense, cutting spending in some areas and increasing investment yet \nin other areas.\n  This builds on accomplishments that we began earlier by tackling the \nbudget deficit effectively but also by saying there are several other \nthings in this country that are enormously important. One is children's \nhealth, what to do about children's health care in this country. The \nfact is this piece of legislation and the accompanying piece of \nlegislation will make available a substantial amount of money to \nprovide health insurance for children who are not now covered with \nhealth insurance. The question of whether a sick child gets health \ntreatment or gets treatment in the medical care industry when that \nchild is sick ought not ever be a function of whether that child has a \nparent with money in their checkbook. This piece of legislation will \nprovide substantial additional coverage to provide health care to \nchildren, especially those who come from impoverished families.\n  This piece of legislation also says education matters, education is a \npriority in this country. This bill puts on track 1 million additional \nkids to be enrolled in Head Start by the year 2000. Head Start matters \nand Head Start works. Anybody who has been to a Head Start center and \nseen those bright little eyes of children who are getting a head start, \ncoming from circumstances of difficulty getting a head start, \nunderstands this program works. This program saves money. And this \nprogram invests in the young lives of young people who otherwise would \nnot have had an opportunity.\n  Mr. President, 300,000 more eligible college students will get \nadditional help in Pell grants. This agreement places a priority on \neducation, and that is exactly where the priority in this country ought \nto be. And finally this agreement solves a problem that caused me to \nvote against this legislation when it left the Senate. When the \nlegislation left the Senate, it had two things that I did not support. \nOne, increasing the eligible age of Medicare from 65 to 67 and, two, \nmeans testing Medicare.\n  Let me explain quickly I am willing to support means testing of \nMedicare. I am not willing to support providing a means test for \nMedicare for any purpose other than making Medicare solvent --certainly \nnot for the purpose in a reconciliation bill of making room for some \ntax cut somewhere else. We will have to and we must find a way to deal \nwith the ticking time bomb, the demographic time bomb that is going to \ncause us problems both in Medicare and also in Social Security because \nof the aging of our population. I understand that. In the construction \nof solving these problems, I am willing to cast hard votes on the issue \nof Medicare with respect to means testing. I am unwilling to do so in \nthe construct of a reconciliation bill. This is not where that sort of \nthing should have been done, and I did not support it when it left the \nSenate. That has been solved. Those provisions are out of this \nlegislation. This legislation is better because of it.\n  Let me mention one additional point. Senator Rockefeller, from the \nState of West Virginia, is here to discuss another subject with me, but \nthe point about health care and Medicare especially is one that all of \nus ought to understand. Even though it is a challenge, we ought to \nunderstand that this is born of success. Mr. President, 100 years ago, \nthe average life expectancy in America was 48 years of age. Nearly a \ncentury later it is 78 years of age. Why? A lot of things. Better \nnutrition, better lifestyle, breathtaking changes in health care, new \nknees, new hips, cataract surgery, open up the heart muscle when it has \nbeen plugged, give people additional life, breathtaking medical \nadvances, and therefore a 30-year increase in life expectancy in our \ncountry in one century. It is wonderful. It is born of enormous \nsuccess. It is also very expensive, and that is also causing part of \nour strain with respect to the Medicare Program, and we must make that \nprogram solvent for the long-term because it is too valuable a program \nfor us not to fix it for the long-term.\n\n  So I wanted to make a few comments. I intended to make more, but I \nwill abbreviate them because we have another subject that is critically \nimportant. I want to make a few comments about the job that I think was \ndone by the Senator from New Mexico, the Senator from New Jersey, the \nPresident and many, many others. It is nice for a change to be talking \nabout something that is bipartisan. The American people tend to \nbelieve, and in many cases rightly so, that instead of getting the best \nof what both political sides have to offer we often end up with the \nworst. At least in this circumstance we have engaged in a bipartisan \nagreement that I am going to vote for, I am going to support.\n  Is everything here the way I would like or the way I would write it? \nNo. But we have advanced in the area of education and health care and \ntackling the deficit and a number of other areas in a way that is \nsignificant and in a way that will be beneficial to this country's \nfuture, and I am going to vote for it.\n  Now, having said that in laudatory terms, let me say there are a \ncouple things that give me enormous heartache here, and one of them is \na problem the Senator from West Virginia and I want to talk about for a \ncouple of minutes. And at the end of this I intend to make a point of \norder under the Byrd rule against the universal service provisions in \nthis conference report.\n  Let me describe it very briefly and then yield to the Senator from \nWest Virginia. There is, in my judgment, a fundamental mistake being \nmade in the conference report in this reconciliation process. And that \nmistake is this: This conference report will use universal service \nfunds in the Telecommunications Act for the purpose of plugging a hole \nin the budget process.\n  In my judgment, that is totally and completely inappropriate and \nwithout foundation. Those who were involved in it were repeatedly told \nthis is inappropriate and yet somehow through the mechanisms of the \nCongressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget and \na range of other interests it got stuck into this piece of legislation.\n  Let me describe it very briefly. We have in this country something \ncalled the universal service provision in the Telecommunications Act. \nWhat does that mean? It means that in this country, even if you are in \nan area where it is very expensive to provide telephone service, we \nwant to make sure you have good telephone service at an affordable \nprice. If you happen to live in an area where it is very expensive to \nprovide telephone service, we have a universal service fund that \ncollects resources from all of the users in the country and uses it to \ndrive down the cost to those in the highest cost areas of the country \nso that everyone in this country has affordable telephone service.\n  That is what universal means. It has been around forever and for a \ngood purpose. Every telephone in this country is more valuable because \nthere is a telephone in the smallest highest cost area of this country \nand we have decided to drive down those costs so that telephone service \nis universally affordable.\n  Now, the universal service fund produces the money to do that. It is \nnot a fund that comes into the Federal Government. It is not Federal \nmoney. It is not a fund that has money that the Federal Government \nspends. It is completely apart and separate from the Federal coffers.\n  Two years ago, we passed something called a Telecommunications Act \nand now we are told by the Congressional Budget Office and by some \nothers that the way the universal service fund is worded in the \nTelecommunications Act there is justification for the Congressional \nBudget Office and the Office of Management and Budget to rule that the \nuniversal service fund can be used in the construct of a Federal budget \nas both revenues and outlays.\n  That is pure nonsense. This has nothing to do with the Federal \nbudget--nothing. And those who believe it does have either misread the \nlaw or don't\n\n[[Page S8335]]\n\nknow the foggiest thing about what they are reading.\n  Now, we have tried very hard to pull this out of this conference \nreport because it is a couple, I guess it is a $3 billion plug they \nstuck in, just like a cork in a big hole. They walk around with corks \nin their pocket down at OMB or CBO, and say, well, here is a big hole \nwe can't explain; we will stick a cork in there. This cork is the \nuniversal service fund. And the minute you start using that as a cork \nthe cork will get bigger every year they manipulate it. This is a \nmisuse of the fund. And the Congressional Budget Office and the Office \nof Management and Budget had no business and no capability of \nsuggesting that this is a part of the Federal Treasury.\n  Now, I would like to yield for purposes of discussion. At the end of \nthe process, I am going to make a point of order, a Byrd rule point of \norder. And let me, as I yield to the Senator from West Virginia, say \nthat the Presiding Officer, who is on the Senate Commerce Committee and \nwas integrally involved in the issue of the construction of the \nTelecommunications Act and the universal service fund, has been \ninvolved in signing letters and discussions with other Members of \nCongress about this very subject. The Senator from Arizona, the current \nchairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, feels the same way I do. It \nis inappropriate to have it in this conference report in this manner. \nThe Senate minority leader feels the same way. A good number of us feel \nthe same way. And yet we seem powerless at this point to pull it out of \nthis conference report. I expect that my challenge on the Byrd rule is \nprobably not going to survive for reasons that I will understand, but I \nthink it is critically important that we raise this issue now so it \nwill not become habit forming; this will happen once and only once. And \nbetween now and the next time someone has an urge to do this with the \nuniversal service fund, I hope we have the law changed to disabuse \nanybody that they can interpret any language in the Telecommunications \nAct with the universal service fund in any way which suggests it is \npart of the Federal Treasury assets receipts or outlays.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona I notice is in the Chamber. I \njust mentioned him. He is the distinguished chairman of the Senate \nCommerce Committee. I know the Senator from West Virginia also wishes \nto be recognized. I would be happy to yield the floor so the Senator \nfrom Arizona may speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time would the Senator like--10 minutes?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Three minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is yielded 5 minutes \nfrom the time under the control of the Senator from New Mexico. The \nSenator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I understand and appreciate Senator \nDorgan's concerns. I would disagree with the action of challenging it. \nThe Senator from North Dakota is quite correct in one sense; Federal \nfinagling with the universal service fund ought to raise concerns over \nany potential impact on the provision of essential phone service to \nrural and high-cost areas and low-income consumers.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important to put its genesis and its \nlikely real life effect into perspective.\n  I reluctantly concurred with the last-minute--I emphasize \nreluctantly--inclusion of this provision in the bill. I am sure I am \ntelling the worst-kept secret in town when I tell you this provision \nwas dreamed up by the Clinton administration and essentially imposed on \nthe Commerce Committee conferees by OMB. It is not a provision we liked \nand not a provision we wanted, but it was made very clear to us that \nour failure to include it would likely result in our losing control of \nthe bill. And if this were to occur, the probability was that not only \nthis provision but numerous others that would be worse, such as \nspectrum fees, would get added to the bill if that happened.\n  So including this provision was by far the lesser of two evils. This \nis particularly so because it is hard to see how this provision is \nlikely to have any real life effect on maintaining essential telephone \nservice. Basically, what this provision does is shift $3 billion in \nfunds between the Treasury and the universal service fund in \nalternating fiscal years in an attempt to cover a residual $3 billion \nsavings shortfall in the outyears.\n  Because industry universal service fund subsidies today total over $6 \nbillion and are projected to soar as high as $12 billion to $20 \nbillion, there can be no doubt that the telephone industry will be \nfinancially able to sustain a $3 billion loan for the limited time \nperiod prescribed. Similarly, if we really think that the Treasury will \nnot be in a position to repay a $3 billion loan, we have far worse \ndeficit problems than this bill can ever hope to cure. And because the \nbill explicitly provides that telephone companies may not raise their \nrates to recover this $3 billion, it attempts to assure that telephone \nrates will not increase, at least for this reason.\n  So, I believe it extremely unlikely that essential telephone service \nis likely to be hurt in any way by the enactment of this provision. In \nsaying this, however, I do not wish to trivialize the validity of \nconcerns over the Federal Government reaching into private, \nnongovernmental pockets to help plug a budget hole. That's a terrible \nprecedent to set, regardless of whether it is the universal service \nfund or the airline safety funds, and I have consistently voted against \nsuch schemes in the past.\n  I suggest the better remedy is to pass this bill today, then enact \nnew legislation that will prevent this kind of action in the future. We \nshould not risk bringing down this historic agreement because of one \nsuch scheme that, however objectionable in concept, will have no \npractical impact on the public.\n  Let me emphasize again, this administration provision is designed to \nhave no adverse effect on the consumer. For the information of my \ncolleagues, I have already stated I will hold conference committee \nhearings early next year to make sure that we need do nothing more \nlegislatively or in terms of FCC oversight to further assure that the \nuniversal service provision before us will not, in fact, cause any loss \nin essential service or raise telephone rates.\n  I want to tell my colleague from North Dakota, we will have hearings. \nWe will take action to make sure that this provision does not raise \nphone rates nor impair the ability of people to have universal service. \nI want to point out that the Presiding Officer in the chair, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, also a member \nof the Commerce Committee, has pledged to do exactly the same. I don't \nlike it. You don't like it. He doesn't like it. In fact, in a rather \nunusual move, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee was more \nvociferous in his opposition to this provision than I was.\n  So I want to point out I think it is important the Senator from North \nDakota raised this concern. I know the Senator from West Virginia has \nthe same concern and will articulate it. But I want to say that we will \nhave hearings. We will do whatever is necessary to make sure this does \nnot impair--either raise phone rates or impair the ability of people to \nobtain universal service. I also want to reiterate, as did the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, it's a lousy way to do business, Mr. President. It's \nnot a good way to do business. But I also, with some sympathy to my \ndear friend from New Mexico, realize that he was in a position where \nthey were $3 billion short and they had to make it in order to make \nthis budget work.\n  So I want to thank my colleague from North Dakota. I want to thank \nthe Senator from Alaska as well, for his commitment to fix this \nsituation. There is, quite simply, no reason to endorse this provision \nor the kind of tactic it employs. But neither is there any reason to \nvote against this balanced budget bill because of it. I urge my \ncolleagues to take that into consideration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Arizona. I \nam sorry if we waited until the last minute to notify you. We had \nplenty of time. You could have come down slowly and taken your time.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes, and then I will yield to \nSenator Rockefeller.\n\n[[Page S8336]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I surmise the distinguished Senator from West Virginia \nis going to stand up and agree with what has been said. I just ask him \nif he would consider seriously, with me, what the miner protection fund \nlooks like. It is exactly like this, and it is on budget. The Federal \nGovernment orders mining companies to pay into a fund, but the Federal \nGovernment does not disburse the money. That is your bill. You are \nfamous for it, Senator. That is on budget. It has been on budget from \nthe beginning.\n  Now, let's look at this. It's exactly the same. We order companies to \npay into this fund so that we can get universal service out of the \nfund. Who disburses the fund? The companies; not the Government. That \nresonates very well with a mining bill, miners' protection, the same \nway it has been on budget for 4 years. Frankly, it doesn't matter to \nthis Senator.\n  But the point of it is, we are bound by an interpretation that \nessentially was this. The reason I didn't cite this is because it never \nbecame law. But you might recall, I say to the Senator, when we had the \nuniversal health plan from the White House, noted by some as the \nHillary health plan, the distinguished chairman, then, of the \nCongressional Budget Office--not this one; one that you-all had \nappointed from the other side--ruled one morning, to the amazement of \neveryone, that the bill had a tax in it because the procedure was that \nwe were ordering money to be paid by somebody, and then, in the various \nStates, we would disburse the money. The Federal Government was not \ndisbursing the money.\n  So the White House thought they would have a bill that was without \ntaxation in it. And what did he rule? He ruled that if the Government \norders payment of money into a fund, then the fund is on budget, even \nif the Government doesn't control the fund.\n\n  I know my friend in the chair does not agree. I might not agree. But \nI am merely explaining what the facts are. I understand that you would \nlike to make a point of order. I will be here and we can talk a little \nmore about it, Senator. I do believe we have just reason to ask the \nSenate not to impose that point of order under the circumstances \nsurrounding it, but I understand you, and I will speak to that later.\n  I yield the floor at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I yield myself, off the time of the \nSenator from New Jersey, 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. As the Senator present and in charge of the \nbill he has that right. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I appreciate that very much. I also \nappreciate very much, as I always do, what my good friend, the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, said. I would draw one small point, however of \ndifference. That is, in the miners' health retirement bill there has \nnever been any thought, any action, any suggestion that any of that \nmoney should be used for anything but the health care of miners, \nperiod. It doesn't go anywhere else. In the case of what we are now \ntalking about, the universal service fund, it is something which was \nset up for one purpose and which is being used for an entirely \ndifferent purpose. The Senator may wish to come back--\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Of course.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, when we first proposed this, we could find no \nway to do this without doing exactly what you said. But the White House \ncame along, and they are a little more ingenious than are we. They \noffered us a proposal that is now in this bill. It does not change \nuniversal service, nor does it use that fund in any way other than what \nit was originally intended to do. All we have is, those who were paying \ninto it get a 1-year reprieve, to the tune of $3 billion. Then they pay \nit in the next year. I think they are delighted. They get a reprieve \nbecause we lend them the money for the year and everything is exactly \nas you want it, and in the following year the companies that would have \nbeen paying it pay into it the next year. That happens to give us the \n$3 billion credit on the budget. That was dreamed up by the White \nHouse. We said, ``It's extremely ingenious and it fits all the tests,'' \nand that is why we are here.\n  Thank you for yielding.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank my friend and ask unanimous consent the time \nused by my friend from New Mexico be used on his side and not from the \ntime of the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has been so accounted.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I strongly agree with what Senator \nDorgan of North Dakota has said. I expect that, if the Presiding \nOfficer were in a position to take the floor, he might say something \nnot that dissimilar.\n  There is an enormous amount of anger among those of us who worry \nabout rural America, that for the first time in its history --hopefully \nfor the last time in its history--the universal service fund is \nliterally being raided for the purpose of a gimmick. The Senator from \nNew Mexico is correct, I think, in the way he describes the process of \nwhat will happen. He is incorrect in one small matter, which doesn't \nreally make that much difference but happens to make some difference to \nme as a Democrat, and that is that the idea came first from the \nCongressional Budget Office, not from the White House. It came from the \nCongressional Budget Office, this so-called gimmick fix. Then it was \nupheld by, so to speak, the Office of Management and Budget, which is \nsomething that I am very angry about, as a Democrat, because that \nhappened on the President's watch.\n  I think the problem with this is that universal service is sacred. \nWhen the Senator from North Dakota described equal phone calls--as he \nsometimes says, Donald Trump can call into Minot, ND, and that is good \nfor Donald Trump in New York City and that's good for Minot, ND, and \nthe possessor of that phone. But the purpose of universal service is, \nin fact, that rural areas are able to be sustained in part of their \nrate-paying because some States have to be more generous than others. \nThat is what universal service is about. That is what the money is \nthere for. It is not there for black lung, it's not there for retired \nminers, it's not there for environmental purposes. It's there for one \npurpose, and that is to guarantee that universal service on the \ntelephones is available and affordable by people no matter where they \nlive, and people particularly in rural areas.\n  Part of my objection to all of this, of course, is that this whole \nprocess of working out this reconciliation bill--which I do support. I \nam not jumping up and down, but I do support it. That will be another \nspeech at another time. But basically there were a lot of meetings held \nin a lot of rooms in which a lot of us were not allowed to be. I have a \nfeeling that this decision was made at the last moment by OMB. Their \npeople tried vainly to convince Senator Dorgan and his folks and myself \nand my folks that this was all really nothing but just a shifting of \nmoney here and there. But that is not the case. If you look at the \nhistoric proportions of raiding the universal service fund, no matter \nfor what purpose--it's not for telephone service, it's not for making \nit possible in rural New Mexico or rural West Virginia or rural North \nDakota for people who have telephones not to have to pay exorbitant \nrates.\n\n  So here we have this one very unfortunate example. It's a budget \ngimmick. It's lousy policy. It's using the service fund as a piggy \nbank. There is no excuse for it. It's in the bill. I understand that we \nare probably not going to be able to do very much about it, but it is \nwrong. It is not only wrong because of what it does to universal \nservice, but it's also very wrong because of what it does to libraries \nand schools and health care center telemedicine programs, which I will \ntalk about in a moment.\n  I will say the fact that Senator McCain was on the floor, that \nSenator Stevens has strong feelings about this, and Senator Hollings \nhas strong feelings about this, Senator Daschle has strong feelings \nabout this, Senator Dorgan, myself, many others, Senator Snowe--many \nothers--this is a problem that we are going to come back to and fix. As \nthe Senator from Arizona indicated, he's going to hold hearings. But we \nare going to come back on this until we can fix this problem. We can't \nfix it today, but we will be back, we will be\n\n[[Page S8337]]\n\nback again, until we get this eliminated--eliminated and changed. \nBecause it is wrong.\n  I recognize the universal service fund isn't recognized by most \npeople. They don't know what it means. But it's something of such \nincredible importance to affordable phone rates for rural citizens that \nit is something people better understand very, very thoroughly. When a \ngroup of us passed and fought hard for something called the Snowe-\nRockefeller-Exon-Kerrey amendment, we extended the promise and the idea \nof universal service to something which fits in that category; that is, \nschools, libraries and rural health care facilities that use \ntelemedicine. There are 116,000 schools in this country, Mr. President, \nand we are going to make every classroom applicable and every one of \nthose classrooms, every one of those schools, we are going to make them \nfully wired up, ready for Internet, so there won't be any first- and \nsecond-class society in our country.\n  I never, ever thought during the battle that we had to get to pass \nthat Snowe-Rockefeller-Exon-Kerrey amendment, I never ever for a moment \nthought that we would be dealing with budget negotiators, but much more \nsignificantly I think, in this case, the Office of Management and \nBudget and their intransigence in trying to work out some kind of a \nFederal budget worked out that was not--I was shocked when I heard \nabout that.\n  Unfortunately, the budget has a neat trick, and as the Senator from \nNew Mexico points out, it will work. It will loan universal service \nfunds in the year 2001 and it will repay that in the year 2002, solely \nto have enough money appear on the books to make it possible to say \nthat the Federal budget was balanced in that particular year, 2002. It \nviolates the promise made to telecommunications providers that the \nuniversal service money was for telecommunications only. They are \noffended by it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nBell Atlantic and Nynex expressing exactly that view.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                Bell Atlantic,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n\n                                                        Nynex,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 25, 1997.\n     Hon. Jay Rockefeller,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Rockefeller: We urgently request that you \n     delete the universal service ``tax'' from the budget \n     reconciliation legislation. This proposed ``tax'' is a direct \n     assault on the policy of universal, affordable telephone \n     service for all Americans.\n       Section 3006 of the Budget Reconciliation Bill is bad \n     public policy and it should be deleted from the Budget \n     Reconciliation legislation. This budget gimmick borrows money \n     from a fund established to ensure universal telephone service \n     in order to ``balance'' the federal budget.\n       Because this fund is privately administered and not funded \n     through the federal budget, it is questionable whether the \n     federal treasury can ``borrow'' from this fund. If passed, \n     this provision would surely be the target of litigation.\n       This section sets a dangerous precedent of using funds \n     intended to support affordable phone service as a ``trust \n     fund'' or ``piggy bank'' to balance the federal budget each \n     cycle. As a result, this proposal raises serious concerns for \n     the future viability of universal telephone service.\n       We urge you, in the strongest terms, to delete the \n     universal service section from the budget reconciliation \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Aubrey L. Sarvis,\n       Vice President, Federal Relations, Bell Atlantic.\n\n     Thomas J. Tauke,\n       Executive Vice President, Government Affairs, Nynex.\n\n  (Mr. ABRAHAM assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The provision that will probably become law, in this \ngigantic stack of papers, is opposed by telecommunications companies. \nIt is opposed by education groups. It is going to be opposed by a lot \nmore groups before this process is finished.\n  The universal service fund is private money. It comes from telephone \ncompanies. We don't own the telephone companies. They are their own \nproperty. It is managed by nonprofit NECA, the National Exchange \nCarriers Association. This is private money--private money--that should \nnot be used for budget gimmicks.\n  At this point, we are caught between a rock and a hard place. The \nbill is before us. It is a good bill on balance. It is a bill that I am \ngoing to vote for. It is something that all of us have worked hard for \nsince 1993, and probably before that. It is going to have to be \nchanged, I fear, in the future. I tried to reach Franklin Raines this \nafternoon. I could not do so. I have spoken to the Vice President about \nit. I have spoken to everybody I possibly could, because it is terribly \nbad public policy.\n  I am committed to protecting the integrity of universal service, and \nI intend to work with Senator Dorgan, Republican colleagues, industry \nleaders, and advocates to protect universal service and its promise of \naffordable access to rural America.\n  I urge interested parties to join me in this fight. Universal service \nis not just about putting computers in classrooms. It is about fairness \nto rural Americans. It is a sacred trust. The universal service fund \nhas been briefly violated. One can hope that this will be the only \ntime, and one can hope that even this time, it will only last for about \na year before we clear it up.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator from New Mexico yield me 10 minutes?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield as much time as the Senator from Alaska \ndesires.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send to the desk a request for \nprivilege of the floor for my staff for today through August 1:\n  Antonette Advincula; Kai Binkley; Larissa Sommer; Matt Hopper; \nMelissa Kassier; James Hayes; Kate Williams; Bronwyn Rick; Jay McAlpin; \nand Jessica Huddleston.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, first, let me thank the distinguished \noccupant of the chair. I was fearing that this issue might come up for \na ruling while I had the privilege of sitting in that chair and was \nfearful what I might do, because I can tell the Senate that if one \nexamines the signatures sheets for reporting this bill, you will find \nthat I excepted from my approval of the bill as a conferee on the \nCommerce Committee side this provision on the universal service fund.\n  Mr. President, I am not going to raise a proper point of order, and \nthere is a proper point of order, but it would bring down the whole \nbill, and it is not timely. I would raise it if this went into effect \nnext year. It will not go into effect until October 1 in the year 2000. \nSo we have time to work this out and find a way to make peace on this \nsubject.\n  I intend to pursue that after the hearings that the Senator from \nArizona has announced, as chairman of the Commerce Committee, he will \nhold.\n  I don't think anyone really realizes what this does. I will say, and \nI know the Senator from New Mexico was trying to get it to me, the \nfirst time I saw this was today, although it had been described to me, \nand that is why I would not approve the Commerce Committee portion of \nthe bill pertaining to the service fund. As a matter of fact, this is \nthe old interstate rate pool, Mr. President. People in the business \nstill refer to that in many ways. It became the universal service fund. \nI was the one who dreamed this up about 5 years ago when we first \nintroduced the bill to modify the old Communications Act of 1934, and \nreally that was carried through in the Telecommunications Act that \npassed.\n  I am pleased to have been part of that, because what this does is it \ngives us a fund which the industry itself can use to equalize the costs \nof assuring service anywhere in the United States so that our \ntelecommunications will, in fact, be capable of being delivered \nwherever there is a person seeking to send or receive communications as \ndefined by our act.\n  This money is kept by the National Exchange Carriers Association, \n[NECA]. It is not Federal money. It is not subject to Federal control. \nAs a matter of fact, it is not even enforced by the Federal Government \nin terms of payment into the fund. It cannot be a tax.\n\n[[Page S8338]]\n\n  With due respect to my friend from New Mexico, I think we have a \nSupreme Court of the United States that will determine eventually what \nis on budget and what is not. The Director of the Congressional Budget \nOffice, in my judgment, has made a serious mistake, and we are pursuing \nthat mistake here. But there is more than just his mistake. The basic \nmistake has been made by the White House itself, when it conjured up \nthis new approach to using this fund which is not Federal money, it is \nnot taxpayer's money. It is paid by the ratepayers, not the Federal \nGovernment. You might have dipped into the Postal Service surplus in \nthe bank right now under this theory. That is ratepayer money, too.\n\n  It is not on budget, but, as a matter of fact, this money is not \nsubject to Federal control. But this bill says there is appropriated $3 \nbillion to put into this fund that NECA manages for the \ntelecommunications world, and it sits there for a year, Mr. President. \nOf course, it is going to earn interest, right? At the end of the year, \nit is paid back by the fund, and the fund can keep the interest it \nearned during that period.\n  Once more, the people who would have paid into the fund don't have to \nmake a payment for a year. They keep that money that they would have \npaid the fund in their own banks and they pay it to NECA the following \nyear, and guess what? They make money off it, too. So this is one of \nthe greatest shell games I have ever seen with Federal money. The \nFederal money being fooled with is the $3 billion from the Treasury \nthat goes into the fund before the game begins, and these guys get to \nplay poker with this for a year, and then after a year, they can keep \nwhatever they earned with it and pay back $3 billion to Treasury. It is \na win-win thing for everybody but the people who should be served, \nbecause the earnings for the fund ought to accrue to the fund, the \npeople who are the recipients of universal service, and this is just \ntoo cute. This, in my opinion, is the worst gimmick since the Budget \nAct was enacted, and I am glad the Senator from New Mexico has \nindicated he really didn't dream this one up, because I think he is \nsmarter than that, and I think he is embarrassed to have to carry it, \nas I would be.\n  The proper point of order, Mr. President, is a constitutional point \nof order. I will not raise it because it will pull the whole bill down, \nand we have to have this to bring about a balanced budget. It will take \nplace in the year 2000, as I said. But I warn the Senate, before 2000 \ngets here, we will raise a constitutional point of order to take this \nout of here unless it is straightened out, because it is nothing but \nsmoke and mirrors. It is the worse case of smoke and mirrors that ever \ncame out of the White House.\n  Somehow or another, someone has to understand that it is not right to \nplay with money, that $3 billion of taxpayer's money goes into this \nfund, managed by a private association; it stays there for a year, the \ninterest on it accrues to private associations, and at the end of the \nyear, they pay back $3 billion. Meanwhile the people who should have \nbeen paying in for a year have earned their own money, and guess what? \nIt is not a wash in the sense of everybody who keeps their own \ncheckbook and everyone who pays bills and the people who need this \nservice, this universal service; it is a wash under the Budget Act, \nwhich I thought was a stupid act to begin with, and now I know it is a \nstupid act, if it can conjure up something like this. It is not in the \npublic interest.\n  So, Mr. President, I am now satisfied that I was right. I signed this \nbill and approved it, except for this provision. I urge everyone to \nread it, section 3006. If there is anything that demonstrates we need a \nnew Budget Act, this is it, if people can sit in the basement of the \nWhite House and dream up a charade like this and say that it balances \nthe budget. This is why people don't believe us. They really don't \nbelieve us, because they think we play funny games with their money, \nand this demonstrates they are right, Mr. President, unfortunately.\n  I will swear to you--I am glad you came, Mr. President, because I \nwould be hard pressed not to approve the point of order that is raised \nby the Senator from North Dakota, and I would have hated to be in that \nchair and to have said what I don't believe. I am not saying you have \nto believe it either, Mr. President, just follow what the \nParliamentarian tells you and we will pass this bill, and we will live \nto the year 2000.\n  Meanwhile, someone has to put down a marker on these people. They \nhave to stop using smoke and mirrors. That is why we don't have a \nbalanced budget now, because people play games with money, and those of \nus who don't have much money don't understand it.\n  It took me a little time to find out what they were trying to do, I \nsay to the Senator from New Mexico. I see him smiling a little bit. He \nis my great friend, and I know he is embarrassed to have to carry \nsomeone else's brainchild like this. I hope we will find some way to \nstop this business, to give us a chance to deal with straight up-and-\ndown money, and straight up-and-down provisions and not more smoke and \nmirrors.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I just say to my good friend--who is my \ngood friend, perhaps one of the best here--there are plenty of smoke \nand mirrors in the appropriations bills, and I am not here saying we \nshould abolish the appropriations process. If you would like a debate \nsomeday, we will go through 20 bills, and I will find you more smoke \nand mirrors than $3 billion in any given year in the appropriations \nprocess. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if the Senator will let me have a couple \nminutes, it would be nice to have this discussion. There are no smoke \nand mirrors in the appropriations bills. We sometimes have devices in \norder to enable us to meet the objectives of the Budget Act, but we \nnever end up by appropriating money to an account that is not \ncontrolled by the Federal Government, nor do we give up interest on \nthat $3 billion for a year and expect just to get the straight $3 \nbillion back. If there is something like that going on in an \nappropriations bill, I don't know about it.\n  He is right, we have our devices for making sure that we have control \non spending money, and sometimes that is subject to criticism, similar \nto what I have just given him.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I appreciate that. That is plenty for me. I appreciate \nit very much.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota, the Senator from West Virginia, and the distinguished \nchairman from the Appropriations Committee, the Senator from Alaska, as \nto the point being made relative to the universal service fund.\n  In the 4-year tour of work of trying to reconcile and bring up into \nthe modern technological age communications law, there was one thing \nthat was sacrosanct and generally agreed upon by everyone--and there \nreally are no exceptions to it, because it was sort of a private \nendeavor. I know the distinguished occupant of the chair believes very \nstrongly in the private market and the forces of private industry vis-\na-vis those within the Government. But those within the \ntelecommunications industry, years back, by way of the entities in \nwhich they belong, determined the volume of business, and with that \nvolume of business and the costs, they then factored in each month \nthrough this private universal service fund the amount to be \ncontributed thereto. And it is operated that way. From time to time the \nFCC has rules and regulations about it, but, generally speaking, it is \na well-administered fund, not participated in, really, by Government \nlaw. The Government does not say or the 1996 Telecommunications Act \ndoes not require this.\n\n  So it came with some amazement that, in all the machinations in \ntrying to work for the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, we were hearing \nthat they were going into the universal service fund. We raised the \npoint in discussions. We had resolutions about it. We put amendments \nup. And we thought we had gotten the clear, crystal word through to the \nnegotiators and conferees. Now it appears that that has been \ndisregarded.\n  For one, we can see what was really bringing it about. They came in \nwith the spectrum auctions, which this Senator and the Senator from \nAlaska\n\n[[Page S8339]]\n\njoined in in the original instance, tried to raise money and factor in \nthe market forces. But we have found in the more recent auctions that \nwe sort of are scraping the cupboard dry or bare, as the expression is, \nwhereby on an auction of last year, agreed upon in October to bring in \n$3.9 billion, only factored in or received $13.1 million instead of \nbillions up there--few millions. So when they came with the factored-in \n$26.1 billion in spectrum auctions, they realized that the \nCongressional Budget Office, and anyone else estimating it, was going \nto have to downgrade it, so they put in a catchall, the universal \nservice fund with a blank amount, until now, I guess. It is marked at \nthe desk.\n  I understand from the debate it is $3 billion. This cannot happen. \nYou do not want to take what is really working and turn it into a slush \nfund for budgeteers or for conferees or for any other kind of nonsense \nthat is going on along here--smoke and mirrors, as they call it.\n  So I am glad the point is being made here in a most eloquent fashion \nby the distinguished Senator from North Dakota, Senator Rockefeller of \nWest Virginia, and now Senator Stevens, who was the ranking member on \nour Commerce and Communications Subcommittee for many, many years. We \nworked in this field. We fashioned out some funds that would be \navailable for the schools, for the libraries, the hospitals, and \notherwise.\n  We really have, I would say, one of the finest elements of the 1996 \nTelecommunications Act, passed by a vote of 95 Senators here in this \nbody, that the outstanding innovative feature was the agreed-upon \nembellishment of the universal service fund in order to bring in the \nlibraries and schools and hospitals and otherwise of America, to bring \nto all of America communications services in the Internet and \notherwise.\n  Now, we just passed that early on, and we turned our backs, and, \nheavens above, budgeteers have turned it into a slush fund. I hope that \ndoes not occur. I hope the point is made. I do appreciate the \nleadership of our colleagues who pointed it out this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate very much the comments made by the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, the Senator from South Carolina, the Senator from \nAlaska, the Senator from Arizona, and others. I say that the Senate \nminority leader, Senator Daschle, feels very strongly in opposition to \nthis particular provision.\n  I was very careful when I began this discussion. I was not critical \nof the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee. I said that I \nthought they had brought a product to the floor that is a compromise \nwhich represents the best of public service.\n  There is much in here to commend this. I am going to vote for this. \nThis is what we are going to vote on. It is a pretty good piece of \nwork. This page is what I am talking about, coming right out of the \nmiddle of this provision, ``Universal Service Fund Payment Schedule.''\n  There was a story once about a fellow--I do not have backwoods in \nNorth Dakota. In fact, we rank 50th in America in the amount of our \nnative forest lands. So we do not have any backwoods stories. But down \nin your part of the country, we hear all these backwoods stories.\n  There was a story I heard once about a fellow that came over a hill \nin the backwoods, and he found a couple of old codgers there sitting \nover a pot that was hanging over a fire, and they were making \nsomething. He said, ``What are you fellows making?''\n  They said, ``Stew.''\n  ``What kind of stew?''\n  ``Horseradish stew,'' they said.\n  ``How on Earth do you make horseradish stew,'' they asked.\n  ``Well,'' one said, ``You take one horse and one radish.''\n  That is the menu here--``horse'' and ``radish.''\n  You have to look through this whole thing to find out what has been \nbrewed, what has been cooked. And I like a lot of this. I think a lot \nof this advances this country's interests. The provision I brought to \nthe floor today to talk about is a terrible provision. It is a terrible \nprovision and ought not be here.\n  Mr. President, I heard discussion earlier by the chairman of the \nSenate Commerce Committee, chairman of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, and others, that there will be legislation--first a hearing, \nand then legislation to deal with this. We may never again be back at \nthis intersection, an intersection where we are having to come to the \nfloor to say, ``You can't use money, you can't count money that never \ncomes to the Federal Treasury as part of a calculation to balance the \nbudget.'' Why, in my hometown of 300 people, you would be laughed out \nof the cafe in 2 seconds. You can't count money that does not come to \nthe Federal Government.\n  So, despite the fact that I am going to offer a point of order under \nthe Byrd rule--and my understanding is that I will probably not \nprevail--I do not intend to ask then for a vote to appeal the ruling of \nthe Chair. I will accept the ruling of the Chair as a ruling, and will \ndisagree with it, I suspect, if the ruling is what I expect it to be. \nBut I will say this: I expect us never to be back to this intersection \nbecause I expect that those of us on the authorizing committee who know \nwhat the fund is and what it is for and what it is about, we will never \nagain allow a discussion to go on somewhere in the bowels of this \nbuilding in which OMB and CBO bring to the table a menu of items that \nsay, ``By the way, here is a way to count money to make things look \ndifferent than they really are.''\n  I say, the Senator from New Mexico talked about this being a White \nHouse creation. My understanding is that, indeed, the Office of \nManagement and Budget and the White House have agreed that this \nprovision is part of this budget process. In fact, the latest \nprovision, which is, I think, the third provision of this type, this \nwas, in fact, brought to the table by the White House. Originally, I \nunderstand it came from the Congressional Budget Office, agreed to by \nthe Office of Management and Budget. But notwithstanding what its \nconception was, I think it is terrible, terrible public policy, and I \nhope that we never again are at this point.\n  I think the discussion we have had is a useful discussion, which has \nserved notice to every Member of Congress that while we cannot get at \nthis provision at this point, there will be a time when we will no \nlonger debate this because we will have changed Federal law to prevent \nthis sort of thing from happening.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, the Federal Government should not \nmanipulate the universal service fund to balance the Federal budget. I \nbelieve this for several reasons.\n  The provision in the conference reconciliation package which \nmanipulates the Federal universal service fund and allows the Federal \nGovernment to use this fund to balance the Federal budget is \noutrageously bad policy, and is, I believe, an unconstitutional \ntakings.\n  In States like Montana, the universal service fund is absolutely \ncritical to the provision of basic telephone service at reasonable and \naffordable rates. However, lately it seems that this fund is becoming \nthe ``ox that gets gored'' to resolve a variety of high profile \nproblems or issues. Universal telephone service is a privately funded \nsupport system that works without Federal monetary aid. Unfortunately, \ndue to its present on-budget status, this privately financed program is \nsubject to the whims of the budgeteers. A couple of months ago, the \nFCC, at the urging of the Vice President, decided to add a further \nburden of $2.25 billion a year on the contributions to the fund to pay \nfor linking schools, libraries, and rural health care facilities to the \nInternet. Now the Congress, by this reconciliation package, is seeking \nto balance the budget at the cost of universal telephone service. This \nwill have extremely negative impacts upon basic telephone service in \nrural and remote areas of the country which depend upon the fund to \nkeep prices for telephone service reasonable; consequently, here we \nare, in the name of balancing the Federal budget, effectively raising \nrates for telephone service for all customers who happen to live in \nstates like mine. This effectively targets the rural customers and is \nsimply unacceptable. Sound telecommunications policy must not be \nmanipulated to comport with fleeting budgetary concerns. Rural \nAmericans--and those others who receive affordable\n\n[[Page S8340]]\n\nservice as a result of universal telephone service--must not be \nsubjected to the uncertainty of this process.\n  Furthermore, I believe that, even if this provision were not such \noutrageously bad policy, we should not adopt it because it will likely \nbe struck down by the courts as an unconstitutional taking of private \nproperty. Contributions to the Federal universal service fund are made \nby telephone companies and wireless telephone providers and, as such, \nare not the property of the Federal Government. The Telecommunications \nAct clearly establishes the manner in which universal telephone service \nfunds are to be collected and disbursed. Pursuant to the act, universal \ntelephone service moneys logically should not be classified as either \nFederal receipts or Federal disbursements and thus should not be \nassociated with the Federal budget, as the administration has insisted, \nand as some in Congress have allowed. Clearly these are not Federal \nfunds.\n  Thus, the Federal Government's use of these funds interest free is, \nin effect, a governmental taking of that interest. Consequently, I \nbelieve that a constitutional challenge to this provision will likely \nbe successful. Regardless, there is one thing of which we can be \nabsolutely certain: this provision will end up in the court system, \nthus wasting phone company, and by extension phone company customer, \nand taxpayer money. Folks, this provision is a bad idea for any of a \nnumber of reasons, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing any \nefforts by either the administration or Congress to use the universal \nservice fund to balance the Federal budget.\n  Additionally, this ill-advised raiding of the universal service fund \nsets an absolutely terrible precedent. While I am confident that the \nbudget agreement is based on sound numbers, what will happen if the \neconomy takes a turn for the worse and the economic assumptions on \nwhich the balanced budget plan is based come up short? Will the \nbudgeteers not look to increase the amount of money that is borrowed \nfrom the universal service fund? Even if that's not the case, and even \nif the money borrowed from the fund will be repaid, this amounts to a \nback-door tax increase levied on every American through his or her \ntelephone bill. I don't believe that we need to raise taxes in order to \nbalance the budget--that's why I joined every other Republicans member \nof Congress in voting against the ill-conceived Omnibus Budget \nReconciliation Act of 1993--but if we're going to raise taxes, we ought \nto be forthright about it. This scheme to raid the universal service \nfund is anything but forthright.\n\n\n                           universal service\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I support the Dorgan point of order \nagainst the provisions in the reconciliation bill which manipulate the \nuniversal service support system to create a book-keeping gimmick which \nis disguised to look like deficit reduction.\n  Universal service support is the complex system of intercompany \npayments between phone companies designed to ensure that telephone \nrates are reasonable and affordable. The universal service support \nsystem assures that phone rates and services are comparable in rural \nand urban areas. This system of payments and shared costs does not \ntouch the U.S. Treasury.\n  For the first time, the reconciliation conference agreement would \nmanipulate the universal service support system for budgetary gains. \nThis is a terrible precedent which if abused will drive up phone rates, \nespecially for rural Americans.\n  The idea of universal service is profound. It is one of the most \nfundamental principles of telecommunications law and economics. The \nconcept was introduced in the original Communications Act of 1934 which \npromised ``to make available to all Americans a rapid, efficient, \nnationwide and world-wide wire and radio communications service * * *''\n  From 1934 to 1996, regulation and monopoly were the primary means of \nensuring telephone services to all Americans. In 1996, the Congress \nembraced the idea that competition would best deliver \ntelecommunications services to all Americans at affordable rates.\n  The Congress also recognized that there were some markets which \ncompetitive companies would not serve and some areas where costs are so \nhigh that rates would drive citizens off of the phone network. In those \nmarkets, universal service support would keep rates affordable and \ncomparable to urban areas.\n  The principle of universal service is that all Americans should have \nmodern, efficient, and affordable communications services available to \nthem regardless of where they live.\n  Universal service support is not a subsidy, and it is not a tax. It \nis a shared cost of a national telecommunications network.\n  What makes the American phone network valuable is that almost anyone \ncan be reached. Affordable phone service is not just important to the \ncitizens of Valentine, NE or Regent, ND, it is of value to the citizens \nwho live in New York, Chicago, and other urban areas who need to reach \nAmericans in all 50 states.\n  The basic bargain of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was that the \ngates of competition would open, provided all telecommunications \ncarriers contribute to the support of universal service. Under the act, \nsupport would be sufficient, predictable, and the burdens would be \nshared in a nondiscriminatory manner.\n  To assure that all Americans shared in the benefits of the \ninformation revolution, the Congress also adopted the Snowe-\nRockefeller-Exon-Kerrey amendment which provided for discounts to \nschools, libraries, and rural health care facilities. The bottom line \nwas that no American would be left behind.\n  The precedent that the reconciliation conferees have set is \ndangerous. It threatens to undermine the promise of sufficient and \npredictable support for universal service. It does so to gain a smoke \nand mirrors bookkeeping advantage in the budget.\n  If the universal service support system is manipulated for this \npurpose, consumers will lose.\n  The very system which assures affordability should not be jeopardized \nby an attempt to avoid the real choices necessary to produce a balanced \nbudget.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask the Senator, are you ready to at least make your \nstatement about this? I understand your points. I hope everybody \nknows--I should have gotten recognition. Are you through?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask the Senator from New Mexico if he could hold for a \nmoment. I will be happy to yield the floor and take a moment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to ask the Senators, we have now been on \nthis bill since 12 o'clock, which has been for 5 hours, 25 minutes, all \nof which I believe is counted against the 10 hours. I very much wonder \nwhat Senators would like to do with reference to the bill.\n  Are there more Senators who would like to speak? The bill is not \nsubject to amendment. There is a list of Byrd rule violations that is \naround. It is not hidden. I just am wondering what the pleasure of the \nMembers is. I think that most of the Byrd rule violations have been \nclearly worked by Democrats and Republicans and are consistent with the \nbill and should be waived. But we cannot do that without conferring \nwith a number of Senators, including the distinguished Senator Byrd, in \ndue course.\n  There is a conference going on, so I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the indulgence of the \nchairman of the Budget Committee. I was prepared to make a point of \norder, a Byrd rule point of order, on this universal service provision. \nI am persuaded that making a point of order, in which the \nParliamentarian would likely rule that this provision is not violative \nof the Byrd rule, would put us in the position of having a ruling by \nthe Chair blessing an approach that I think deserves not a blessing but \ncondemnation. So I am not going to proceed to make the point of order.\n  I am persuaded to decide that by the fact that the Senator from \nArizona, the\n\n[[Page S8341]]\n\nchairman of the authorizing committee, of which I am a member, \nindicates, first of all, a determination to hold hearings in support of \nchanging the law to prevent this from occurring again and statements by \nthe Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens, and Senator Rockefeller and \nothers, including Senator Hollings.\n  It is clear to me that we will not likely come to this point again. \nWe will likely see a law change that says universal service funds \ncannot be used for this purpose. For that reason, I will not require \nthe Chair to rule on a Byrd rule point of order on the universal \nservice provision because I simply don't want anybody to believe there \nwas any blessing applied to this approach in this piece of legislation.\n  Let me make one additional point. The Senator from New Mexico made a \npoint some while ago, and I suspect he thinks that we are here in some \nways jabbing away, and so he made a point that, gee, this isn't the \nonly place this stuff goes on. Everybody in the Chamber would agree \nwith that assessment. We understand that there are games and there are \ngames. We also understand that this piece of legislation, the \nreconciliation bill, this year provides significant traction toward the \ngoals we all want for this country: getting our fiscal house in order, \nmaking the right investments, cutting spending, and doing other things. \nI understand all that.\n  My point was--and I was not critical of the Senator from New Mexico--\nthere is a provision right in the middle of this, which is a tiny \nprovision, that is fundamentally wrong and ought to never be put in a \npiece of legislation like this. I am now believing from this discussion \nthis afternoon that we will not likely be forced to discuss this again \non the floor of the Senate, because those of us who are involved in \ndescribing what a universal service fund was in the Telecommunications \nAct will join and conspire, in a thoughtful way, to change the law, so \nno one--OMB, or CBO, or anyone--can misinterpret whether those revenues \ntouch the Federal Government. They do not and they cannot, therefore, \nbe used to plug some kind of a hole in the budget process.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes. First, while \nSenator Stevens is on the floor, he has made some very good points, \nand, certainly, the distinguish Senators on the Democrat side have made \nsome good points. The Senator from New Mexico wants to do nothing in \nthis budget bill that will adversely affect our movement toward \nuniversal service. There is no intention in this budget reconciliation \nbill, which I ended up agreeing to--and I have already explained why--\nbut there is nothing in it that is going to deny the march toward \nuniversal service that is prescribed and was your thoughtful, visionary \nidea, Senator Stevens. I just ask you, so we have the record straight, \nis that your interpretation, also?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from New Mexico that \nwe have studied this and there is no impact on any universal service \nprovider or universal service beneficiary that is adverse. There may \nactually be a beneficial effect, in terms of some of the providers. But \nit is not a provision that harms universal service. It is a provision \nthat tinkers with the funding of universal service, but not adversely \nto the system. I will agree with that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Now, Mr. President, might I say while a number of \nSenators are present--and hopefully others have access to what we are \nsaying--we have now been on this bill on the floor for 6 hours, or we \nwill be in 15 minutes. As everybody knows, there are 10 hours on \nreconciliation. Frankly, there are no amendments in order, and, \nclearly, the Senator from New Mexico will stay here if there are other \nspeeches or other comments that people want to make. But I very much \nthink we ought to be able to vote at a time certain tomorrow morning.\n  Now, I am just wondering if there is anybody who--Senator Byrd?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator. I have a \nquestion. Under the rule with respect to extraneous material, I read an \nexcerpt therefrom:\n\n       The Committee on the Budget of the Senate shall submit for \n     the Record a list of material considered to be extraneous \n     under subsections b(1)(A), b(1)(B), and b(1)(E) of this \n     section to the instructions of the committee as provided in \n     this section.\n\n  Is that list available?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Byrd, that list is not only available, it has \nbeen sent to the desk in accordance with the statute.\n  Mr. BYRD. May I see a copy of it?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, indeed. This is the list that we submitted.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator. Now, I have been \nsupplied by the minority with a list of extraneous provisions, and it \nappears that, on a cursory examination, they are not the same; the two \nlists are not in agreement on all fours.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, we don't know what might be different, but we \nare certainly willing to look and see what is different. We have been \nin contact with them and working together, as you might suspect.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I think if there is going to be a list, it \nshould be a complete list, and I am only raising the question because I \nhave been supplied with two different lists--one list by the minority \nand one by the majority--and there may be some of the same things on \nboth lists, but I am not sure. It appears to me that some of the items \non the minority list are not on the majority and perhaps vice versa.\n  Could we have a clarification of this matter?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Staff for the minority is approaching. I will ask him \nthe question.\n  Could I get a quorum call?\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield to the other side.\n  Mr. REED addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I request such time as I may consume from \nthe Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could the Senator kind of guess? How much; 15 minutes?\n  Mr. REED. No. Close to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Why doesn't the Senator ask for up to 10?\n  Mr. REED. I ask for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of this bill. As one who \nvoted against the Senate version of this legislation, I am especially \npleased today to be able to support this initiative--an initiative \nthat, among other things, provides 10 years of solvency to the Medicare \nProgram, and makes a substantial investment in the health care of our \nchildren. I would like to remind my colleagues that we were able to \ncraft this agreement because of the tough vote that I and others cast \nin 1993 for President Clinton's deficit reduction plan--a plan that has \nreduced the deficit from almost $300 billion to approximately $40 \nbillion or perhaps lower.\n  I am particularly pleased that this bill makes a remarkable \ninvestment in the health care of our children by providing $24 billion \nto States to spend for children's health care. This new program \nrepresents the most significant and far-reaching expansion in our \nsocial programs since the passage of Medicaid and Medicare in the mid-\n1960's. These children's health provisions will give our children the \nhealthy start that they deserve, and the healthy start that is \nnecessary to help young people become effective students and help these \nstudents become effective workers, and help all of us raise a \ngeneration of American citizens who will serve this country and lead \nthe world.\n  Congress is committing significant resources to children's needs. And \nnow we must turn our attention to the days ahead to ensure that these \nresources are used wisely. I remain cautious about this new initiative. \nAs with any investment of our taxpayer's dollars,\n\n[[Page S8342]]\n\nthe Federal Government needs to ensure that the investment is well \nspent. The plan which is being offered today provides a wide array of \noptions and benefit plans with a high degree of flexibility. And it is \ncrafted in a such a way that it could perhaps be gamed--not for the \nbenefit of the children but for the benefit of those who will be \nenriching themselves from the system. As this program is implemented, \nwe need to provide adequate oversight to ensure that the children are \nthe beneficiaries of this program, and that they receive the benefits \nthey need, that their health care is protected, and that we as a Nation \ncan prosper. The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human \nServices, along with the Congress, has her work cut out for her. And \ntogether we must ensure that this program is implemented wisely and \nbenefits the children that we so desperately and appropriately want to \nserve.\n  In addition, this conference agreement makes significant changes in \nthe Medicare Program. Most importantly, this bill brings 10 years of \nsolvency to the Medicare Program--a program that more than 30 million \nAmericans depend upon, and that more than 170,000 Rhode Islanders \ndepend upon.\n  Like the amendment I offered during the debate on the Senate version \nof this bill, this legislation does not include the provisions which I \nbelieve take the wrong approach to solving our Medicare problems--\nprovisions like raising the eligibility age, means testing for the part \nB premiums, and a home health copayment for home health services. This \nlegislation strikes those provisions, as my previous amendment struck \nthose provisions.\n  A home health care copayment would have negatively impacted the \nsickest and poorest of Medicare beneficiaries. And an increase in \nMedicare's eligibility age is a step in the wrong direction. Simply \nput, raising the eligibility age for Medicare increases the ranks of \nthe uninsured. Already, 13 percent of the 21 million people age 55 to \n64 lack health insurance. It makes no sense at all for Congress to \neliminate Medicare as an option for seniors who have nowhere else to \nturn. These and other issues will be debated in the context of long-\nterm Medicare reform as we address the problems faced by Medicare for \nthe next generation.\n  During the Senate debate on this bill, as I indicated, I offered an \namendment to strike these provisions. My amendment failed. But I am \nglad to see that today we have reached an agreement which protects \nMedicare, extends the life of the program for at least 10 years and \ndoes not attempt an ad hoc approach to structural reform.\n  This bill includes many improvements to Medicare. For example, it has \nexpanded preventive health care benefits for mammography, pap smears, \ndiabetes, prostate, and colorectal cancer screening, bone density \nmeasurements, and vaccines. This bill also requires the Medicare \nProgram and managed care plans to give more information to \nbeneficiaries about their choices and their coverage, and the quality \nof that coverage. All of these are welcome developments.\n  I am also pleased that this bill contains $1.5 billion for protecting \nlow-income Medicare beneficiaries against an increase in Medicare \npremiums. However, I am disappointed that this comes in the form of a \nblock grant to the States that ends after 2002. This approach has the \npotential to fall short of providing real protection for low-income \nMedicare beneficiaries. Any increase in Medicare premiums can result in \nsignificant hardships for low-income seniors, and these individuals \ndeserve a permanent guarantee of protection.\n  This bill also includes numerous changes in Medicare reimbursement \npolicies--changes that will have a great impact on those individuals \nand institutions that provide health care to Medicare beneficiaries. I \nwill keep a vigilant eye on the implementation of these changes, paying \nparticular attention to their impact on the access to and quality of \ncare provided to Medicare beneficiaries.\n  This legislation also establishes a bipartisan national commission to \nexamine the long-term solvency of the Medicare Program. The creation of \nthis commission lays an important foundation to work on long-term \nreforms and solutions, and to tackle those issues that are not suitable \nfor the narrow confines of a budget debate. Such reform is needed to \naddress the challenges that the Medicare Program will face as members \nof the baby-boom generation become recipients of Medicare. This \ncommission provides that framework, and I am encouraged that the \ncommission is established by this legislation.\n  I am prepared to vote in favor of this bill. As with any piece of \nlegislation, it is not perfect. Indeed, many individuals will benefit \nfrom various provisions of the bill. Medicare beneficiaries will have \nthe security of an additional 10 years of solvency in the program. The \nfamilies of uninsured children will now have new State programs to turn \nto. Medicare beneficiaries will have new choices and increased \npreventive health care benefits.\n  But this is no time to rest on our laurels. To ensure that Medicare \nbeneficiaries continue to have access to high-quality care in the face \nof constrained payments to providers, to ensure that the $24 billion \nfor children's health care is well spent, and to ensure the long-term \nviability of the Medicare Program, we will need continued vigilance on \nthe part of many, including the Congress, the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services, and those persons served by the Medicare and Medicaid \nPrograms.\n  We also must recognize that within this budget, as we continue to \ndraw down discretionary spending over the next several years, harder \nand harder choices will ensue. We have to ensure that we make the right \nchoices. We have to ensure that the spirit today--a spirit that reaches \nout to help our children, a spirit that reaches out to help and \nmaintain our seniors--will be the spirit that dominates our future \nbudget deliberations as it has ennobled our past efforts to strengthen \nAmerica.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Domenici, I yield \nmyself up to 15 minutes. I don't believe I will take that long.\n  But I also ask that the Senator from Montana be allowed to take a \nminute to introduce legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank my friend from Indiana.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Burns pertaining to the introduction of S. 1090 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I don't believe I will take all 15 \nminutes.\n  I want to express, however, the reason I am voting against this \nbudget agreement. When the budget resolution came before the floor of \nthe Senate initially, I voted against it because it did not contain the \nentitlement reforms--the structural reforms that I felt were absolutely \nnecessary if we are ever going to have a sustained, consistent effort \nat balancing our budget. Clearly, we all know that the entitlements--\nthe mandatory spending--have not been structurally reformed for a long, \nlong time, and we are on a collision course with their ability to meet \nthe demands on those funds in the future. Some changes were made in \nthis bill. I want to talk about those in a minute. But they were not \nthe structural reforms.\n  Then when the budget reconciliation bill came before the Senate, I \nsupported the budget reconciliation bill because the Senate had the \ncourage to stand up to the plate and address the need for entitlement \nreforms. I doubt that there is a Member of this Congress, House or \nSenate, or anyone else who has paid attention to this issue, that \ndoesn't recognize that this is something that we have to do. We are on \na collision course with bankruptcy for Medicare.\n  We hear all of this wonderful talk about preserving Medicare for the \nbenefit of our elderly. Yet, the quality of Medicare services continue \nto decline because we continue to impose restraints and restrictions on \nthe providers, and it squeezes the quality of care. And we fail to have \nthe will to step up to the plate and deliver any kind of structural \nreform in the program--even reform that takes place well into the next \ncentury. The Senate addressed that issue. The Senate by a fairly \nsubstantial vote passed legislation which\n\n[[Page S8343]]\n\nwould begin that process of structural reform. So I supported the bill \non that basis, hoping that it would survive conference. Due to a number \nof factors which I will talk about, it didn't survive. And it is back \nhere now without those reforms.\n  All the wonderful promises and rhetoric about addressing the Medicare \nproblem is more of the same that we have been promising for the last \nseveral budget resolutions, most of which has not come to fruition.\n  So I approach this conference spending bill with a sense of sadness \nand feeling of resignation--a sense of sadness because I know that the \nSenator from New Mexico and others who have been involved in this \nprocess have worked very, very hard to put together a bill which moves \nus toward a balanced budget. They have incorporated a number of \nprovisions in here which I believe are important provisions, and \nprovisions which I support; but a sense of sadness because we have \ndropped in the negotiations what I think were the most important parts \nof this budget reconciliation bill--the structural reforms and \nentitlements.\n  It is entitlements that are eating up our revenues. It is the \nentitlements, were it not for a booming economy which is pouring \nrevenues into our coffers for the present time--it is the entitlements \nwhich would be squeezing other aspects of the budget, whether you are \nfor education, or roads or safe water, or environmental issues, or a \nwhole number of other things. Those are being squeezed because we don't \nhave the political will and courage to address the entitlements.\n  It is resignation that I feel because lasting structural reform of \nGovernment spending seems to be beyond the ability of the Congress and \nthe executive branch.\n  The measure before us today is significant not for what it contains \nbut for what it does not contain--commitment to fundamental \ninstitutional change. And that failure is most obvious, as I have said, \nwhen we look at the entitlement parts of this bill.\n  Here, for whatever reason--probably a lack of political will--we have \ndropped the three measures which maybe signaled the best hope of future \nability to contain entitlement growth. Instead, we have what is \nestimated as a $115 billion reduction in Medicare spending, but this is \nan evasion, not a reform, because these projected savings are achieved \nby the typical way we have done this: decreasing payments to providers. \nIt has been tried over and over again, and it has failed. Costs have \ncontinued to rise under reduced payment schemes while the quality of \ncare has decreased.\n  The plan also shifts the home health care program, the fastest \ngrowing part of Medicare, from Medicare part A to part B. That is a \nshift, at taxpayer expense, by the way, that simply delays the overall \nfailure of this program by not reforming its faults but simply making \nit sustainable. In addition, the measure drops the Senate provisions \nthat would have set the stage for future reforms, measures that, as I \nsaid, were adopted as a result of the leadership of Senator Gramm, who \noffered the amendment, and support on a bipartisan basis--Senator \nKerrey of Nebraska and others--for these reforms. The Senate bit the \nbullet. The Senate exercised the political will. The Senate put itself \nout on a limb only to see all of these reforms dropped in these \nnegotiations.\n  Means testing provision dropped, the increase, very gradual increase \nin eligibility from 65 to 67 that would not affect anybody 46 years of \nage and older, and the increase in copayments for home health care \nservice dropped, all killed, and along with that any hope for \nmeaningful reform.\n  The President bears some of this responsibility, a lot of this \nresponsibility, because we all know that we cannot accomplish this \nwithout Presidential leadership, and that leadership was tepid at best. \nThere was no sustained active involvement on the part of the executive \nbranch and the President to bring about these reforms. And support from \nthe House, not this body, but support from the House was weak, and I \nregret that. It falls on the shoulders of both parties.\n  Left unchecked, CBO projects that Medicare spending will explode to \n$470 billion a year by the year 2007, representing an average annual \nincrease of 8 percent over the next 10 years. This is a growth rate of \nnearly double the estimated growth of the overall economy for the same \nperiod. In the period from 2010 to 2030, when 80 million baby boomers \nmove into retirement, Medicare's expenses are expected to surge to 14 \npercent of our gross domestic product as compared with 2.5 today. This \ncannot be sustained. This is a train coming down the track headed for a \nwreck, and yet time after time after time, as we are faced with the \nprospect of that train wreck, we blink. We pass it off to the next \nCongress and the next Congress, and we defer and pass that debt off to \nfuture generations.\n  The $115 billion in promised reduced payments does nothing to avert \nthis long-term disaster. By dropping the reforms passed by the Senate, \nbudget negotiators have brought the looming crisis one step closer to \nreality. And just yesterday in the Washington Post, there was an \narticle entitled, in fact, ``Billions Wasted, Medicare Audit Says.'' \nThe article opens by stating that nearly 40 percent of the home health \ncare services provided to frail elderly Americans under the Medicare \nProgram are unjustified either because the service is not necessary or \nthe agency administering the care is not sanctioned to do so or the \nperson is not covered--40 percent. I think the figure was $23 billion a \nyear in fraud and waste and abuse of one part of the Medicare system.\n  We had a provision in the bill that began to address the problem, and \nwe passed on it. We could not even turn to seniors and say that the \nprogram which benefits you, home health care--and I used that for my \nfather when he was home in need of that health care--the program that \nbenefits you is so fraught with waste and abuse it is jeopardizing the \nentire Medicare system. And yet, the Congress refuses to even impose \nthe most minimal of corrections to try to address that problem.\n  So what do we offer our seniors? A so-called bipartisan commission to \nstudy the problem. Madam President, there is nothing left to study. We \nhave studied this thing to death. The problem is not a lack of \nknowledge. It is a lack of political will. Confronting the Medicare \ncrisis will take political courage and it will take sacrifice. But \nthese values, which should come easier in a time of economic growth and \nprosperity, are absent in the spending plan. That is to say nothing \nabout Social Security. That is another problem that we don't even touch \nhere and we also need to address.\n  All of this, as I said, is deeply disturbing, but then when you add \nto that a new entitlement program, a $24 billion health care \nentitlement, paid for with a tax hike on cigarettes and tobacco, you \ncompound the problem--not because we do not need a health care program \nfor children; we do, but because this one was designed with no rational \nbasis. It was created without an assessment of the need. The level of \nfunding was arbitrary. We were throwing figures around here--how much \ncan we add? How much can we subtract? Pulling figures out of thin air \nin a mindless bidding war rather than having an adult policy debate.\n  We are creating in this measure future entitlement problems that we \ncannot even imagine because we have not taken the pains to consider \nthose problems.\n  I am not speaking against the need for health care for children. I am \nsaying let us determine what the need is and tailor a program that \naddresses the specific need without just throwing a new entitlement \nprogram in place that will probably go the way of all other entitlement \nprograms and that will grow beyond our means to check it, and we will \nnot be able to put reforms in that either.\n  What is absent from this agreement is any type of fundamental, \nlasting structural reform in our Government and its spending. That \nreform is now possible because of the strength of our economy. This is \nwhen we ought to be putting these reforms in place.\n  We always hear that we cannot make structural reforms during times of \neconomic slowdown, because that would have too much negative impact on \nour economy. And now we hear the argument that we cannot make reforms \nduring economic prosperity because it is too difficult, because a \nstrong economy signals to us that we do not need to make reforms. We \nwill just reap the benefits of the new revenues that are\n\n[[Page S8344]]\n\ncoming in. And so when the economy is down, we cannot do it because it \nhurts the economy, and when the economy is doing well, we say we do not \nneed to do it; there is no sense of urgency anymore.\n  Our entitlement crisis is lurking around the corner, just below the \nsurface of this strong economy. The same irrational and bloated \nbureaucracies that choke our economy in hard times hide in the shadows \nof economic boom because this legislation does nothing to reform and \nlimit the Federal Government.\n  Sooner or later the economy is going to slow. I wish it would not, \nbut it will. And when it does, the reckoning will be even more severe. \nWe have squandered a unique opportunity--a President who is not running \nagain, a Congress led by Republicans who are willing to walk out on a \nlimb again for entitlement reform, who will support a President if he \nwould just provide leadership on entitlement reform, a prosperous \neconomy where people are at work, revenues coming in.\n  Is there ever going to be a better time to bring entitlement reform \nto our budget process? I doubt it. And yet we are squandering this \nmarvelous opportunity to make changes now that will be incremental and \nsmall in nature but will provide great dividends and great benefits for \nthe future. Instead, in the interest of political expediency, we \npostpone those tough decisions to a future Congress, to future \ngenerations, and we look myopically at the immediate election \nconsequences, what we perceive them to be. I do not believe they are \nthere. I think people are looking for politicians who will exercise \npolitical will, make the tough decision, step up and do what is right, \nand I think they will be rewarded in the polls. Instead, we say let us \npass on this one more time.\n  We will never have a better moment. We will never have a better \nopportunity. We will never be in a position where we are 3 years out \nfrom a general election, more than a year out from the next off-term \nelection, with an Executive who does not ever have to stand for \nelection again in his life, with a Senate that has already made the \ndecision to go out on the limb. We will never be in a better position, \nand yet we have squandered this moment.\n  For that reason, for all of the hard work that the Senator from New \nMexico and others have put in this agreement, for all of the benefits \nin this agreement and the positive things in this agreement, I cannot \nsupport this resolution, because my litmus test, as I stated when I \nvoted against the budget resolution and for the budget reconciliation, \nincluded entitlement reforms. But now, because they have been drawn \nout, that litmus test was not met.\n  That is a minimal litmus test. I was willing to accept minimal \nreforms, anything, anything that moved us in a path of structural \nreform, addressing a problem that we know is going to impact negatively \non the people of this country and the economy of this country. We know \nit passes on debt to future generations. We know it places our elderly \npeople in a precarious position for the future of Medicare. And yet at \nthis golden time, which may not come again, for political expediency or \nwhatever reason--I wasn't in the budget negotiations--we once again \npass, we once again take a powder on this and say we will do it another \ntime; let's form a commission; let's study it some more; let's have \nsome more recommendations.\n  How many studies, recommendations and conditions do we have to put in \nplace to keep telling us what we already know?\n  So, Madam President, I know I am a skunk at the party here, the \ncelebration for the passage of this so-called balanced budget \nagreement, and I hope it does balance the budget, and it may, mostly, I \nthink, not because of new spending we put in place but because the \neconomy is roaring along and pouring money into the coffers of the \nGovernment. I wish we could get more of that money back to the people \nwho have earned that money. Instead, we are creating new entitlements. \nWe passed on the opportunity to reform existing entitlements, and I \njust regret that very much.\n  So I may be a lonely voice in this vote, but I cannot for the reasons \nI have stated support this resolution.\n  I yield back whatever time I have remaining.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I have spoken with the distinguished \nchairman of our Budget Committee. He has allocated 20 minutes. I think \nI will take far less.\n  Madam President, when Alice in Wonderland asked the cat where they \nwere headed, the cat replied, ``before you decide where you are going, \nyou must first decide where you are.''\n  And as we look at this so-called Balanced Budget Act of 1997, we \nshould look to see, before anything is enacted, exactly where we are. \nAt this very minute, we have a pretty good estimate from the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  We know, Madam President, that as of May 19, CBO estimated the \ndeficit for this year, 1997, to be $180 billion. We also know that both \nthe CBO and the Office of Management and Budget have agreed that this \nyear's revenues are now exceeding their original estimates by as much \nas $40 billion. So, the August estimate for 1997 will be revised to \nshow a deficit of about $140 billion.\n\n  The idea is to balance the budget and remove the deficit. If you are \ngoing to remove your deficit, you have to do it one of two ways--or \nboth ways; namely, you have to cut back on your spending and you have \nto increase your revenues or do both. The present Balanced Budget Act \nof 1997 proposed increases in spending, rather than cuts in spending. \nAnd, instead of increasing the revenues, it reduces revenues by some \n$90 billion.\n  So, Madam President, I have studied this document, and I have to \nstand here as a matter of conscience, because I have been the chairman \nof the Budget Committee. I have been in the committee itself since its \ninstitution in 1974. I cannot mislead the people with a vote that would \napprove what this budget resolution is all about. I could go at length \nas to the various smoke and mirrors, backloading, excessive spectrum \nauctions and other deceptions contained in this bill, but let me go to \none that is not just a simple smoke or a simple mirror. The fact of the \nmatter is, it is an illegal smoke and an illegal mirror. Why do I say \nthat? We had some struggle during the original enactment of the \nGreenspan Commission report in 1983. Social Security was about to go \nbroke, but its bankruptcy was avoided by the National Commission on \nSocial Security Reform. I hold a section of the report, dated January \n1983, in my hand.\n  Section 21 of the Greenspan Commission report recommended taking \nSocial Security off budget. That is the core of the misunderstanding--\nor the understanding. We stated categorically, in accordance with the \nGreenspan Commission, that when we were calculating deficits, whether \nor not we were in the red or in the black, that we would not include \nSocial Security trust funds.\n  I ask unanimous consent at this point to have printed in the Record a \ntable of the various pension fund moneys that have been expended and, \nso there will be no misunderstanding, I would also like to include the \n``Budget Reality'' table that I referred to earlier which contains the \nCBO figure of a $180 billion actual deficit this year.\n  There being no objection, the tables were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  TRUST FUNDS LOOTED TO BALANCE BUDGET\n                [By fiscal year, in billions of

1997 Economic and Budget\n  Outlook, May 19, 1997.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Fortunately--and we are all enthused about it--the \ndeficit is going to come down to about $140 billion this year. It may \ncome down to $135 billion, but I doubt that. I have talked to the \nauthorities. But we know we are spending over $100 billion more than we \nare taking in. We cannot, under the law, use Social Security trust fund \nsurpluses to mask this deficit. The Senate voted on October 18, 1990, \nby a vote of 98-2, to take Social Security off budget. It took us quite \na while in the Budget Committee, but we finally got it done. That is a \nlaw, section 13301, signed by President Bush, to take Social Security \noff budget.\n  So, this was a very deliberate act. I am not just trying to impassion \nsenior citizens or any of that nonsense. I am trying to inflame the \nintellects and the consciences of the Senators. Because every Senator \npresent here today who was here in 1990, voted and said, I believe in \nthat particular policy. No Senator since 1990 has tried to change that; \nthere has been no amendment or bill or otherwise. We had the policy \nitself reaffirmed in the Retirement Protection Act of 1994 which barred \nbusinesses from using the pension moneys to pay the debt.\n  Then, the Senate passed an amendment in the budget bill, barring \ncorporations from pension misuse, known as the Pension Reform Act of \n1994.\n  Madam President, when I look at this particular budget, I say how in \nthe world, if you are spending over $100 billion more than you are \ntaking in, can you remove the deficit by increasing spending and \ndecreasing revenues? It is quite obvious it cannot be done, except \nunder subterfuge, misuse, misappropriation or other fraudulent acts. \nBecause the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 --and we have examined the \ndocument now--uses $465 billion of Social Security trust funds to make \nit appear balanced.\n  There is no gimmickry here about Government moneys and buying bonds. \nWhen you spend the money out of the fund--and that is what we are doing \nbecause we don't have it--then it has to be replaced. Under the chart I \nincluded earlier, you can see that over $600 billion from the Social \nSecurity trust fund has already been expended, and now they will spend \nan additional $465 billion in this bill. This means that by the year \n2002 we will owe Social Security over $1 trillion.\n  They say, ``Oh, it's the baby boomers in the next generation that are \ngoing to bankrupt Social Security.'' No, not at all, my colleagues. It \nis the senior citizens, the adults on the floor of the U.S. Congress \nthat are decimating Social Security. It is going on. It continues to go \non. It is absolutely fraudulent. It is absolutely illegal.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have section 13301 printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     SEC. 13301. OFF-BUDGET STATUS OASDI TRUST FUNDS.\n\n       (a) Exclusion of Social Security from All Budgets.--\n     Notwithstanding any other\n\n[[Page S8346]]\n\n     provision of law, the receipts and disbursements of the \n     Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the \n     Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund shall not be counted \n     as new budget authority, outlays, receipts, or deficit or \n     surplus for purposes of--\n       (1) the budget of the United States Government as submitted \n     by the President,\n       (2) the congressional budget or\n       (3) the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act \n     of 1985.\n       (b) Exclusion of Social Security From Congressional \n     Budget.--Section 301(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n     1974 is amended by adding at the end the following: ``The \n     concurrent resolution shall not include the outlays and \n     revenue totals of the old age, survivors, and disability \n     insurance program established under title II of the Social \n     Security Act or the related provisions of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 in the surplus or deficit totals \n     required by this subsection or in any other surplus or \n     deficit totals required by this title.''.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Then, Madam President, I refer to the document itself. \nThey do not have to list in this reconciliation bill the annual \ndeficits, the outlays, budget authority, and the debt itself. But the \ndocument of last month, the conference report, does--and I refer to Mr. \nKasich's bill: ``From the committee of conference submitted on the \nconference report on the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal \nyear 1998.''\n  If you turn to page 4--and I am going to ask the first 15 lines, just \nthose 15 lines, be printed in the Record at this particular point. I \nask unanimous consent to have that printed.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       (4) Deficits.--For purposes of the enforcement of this \n     resolution, the amounts of the deficits are as follows:\n       Fiscal year 1998: $--173,000,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 1999: $--182,200,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 2000: $--183,200,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 2001: $--157,100,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 2002: $--108,300,000,000.\n       (5) Public Debt.--The appropriate levels of the public debt \n     are as follows:\n       Fiscal year 1998: $5,593,500,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 1999: $5,841,000,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 2000: $6,088,600,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 2001: $6,307,300,000,000.\n       Fiscal year 2002: $6,481,200,000,000.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, on line 1 it says, ``fiscal year \n2002''; line 2, subsection 4, it says ``deficit.''\n  Then you look down on line 8 at ``fiscal year 2002,'' and you will \nnot see a balance, but a deficit of $108,300,000,000.\n  The reason it shows this deficit is because of section 13301, which \nsays you cannot include Social Security trust fund surpluses.\n  But, if you go down to line 15 and see that the fiscal year debt, \nfrom year 2001 to 2002, goes up, not into balance. The debt doesn't go \ninto balance from the year 2001 to 2002. Instead, the debt increases \n$173.9 billion. This is not a balanced budget.\n  It's a tragic thing that you can't get this reported. It is a matter \nof fact. It is a matter of law. It is a matter of conscience. We should \nall come together and say we won't use pension funds to pay off our \ndebt. We passed a formal rule here some time ago for all corporate \nAmerica which made this illegal. Denny McLain, the Cy Young Award \nwinning pitcher for the Detroit Tigers, when he got out of baseball, \nbecame the head of a corporation, and, unfortunately, used the \ncorporate pension fund to pay off the debt. He was sentenced to 8 years \nin prison. Tell our friend Denny, if you can catch him in whatever \nprison, to please run for the U.S. Senate because, rather than sending \nus off to prison here when we use the pension funds to make the debt \nlook smaller, we get the Good Government Award. Everybody is standing \nup with the President and the Speaker and the majority leader and \nsaying, ``How wonderful, boys. It is Christmas in July.'' It is a total \nfraud, absolute farce, and everybody ought to know it. Because what we \nare doing is breaking into the airport trust fund, the highway trust \nfund, the military retirees' pensions, the Civil Service retirees' \npensions, and everything else I have included in the record. There it \nis. I have had it typed up.\n  As a matter of conscience I cannot engage in this deception. I was \nalways taught, some 50 years ago when I got into public service, in \n1948--that public office was a public trust. I believe Social Security \nis a public trust. I think the consummate 98 Senators said we ought to \nmake it a public trust. They said, not only for us but for corporate \nAmerica, we ought to make certain that some fast-moving merger artist \ncan't come in on a takeover and abscond with the pension funds to pay \nthe debt and pay himself a good bonus and leave everybody else hanging.\n  So we have it in formal law, we have it in formal policy. But, when \nit comes to us, we run around and say ``unified, unified.'' There is \nnothing unified. It is expended moneys in violation of the formal \nstatutory law of the United States of America, section 13301 of the \nBudget Act.\n  I can't vote to violate that law and, therefore, will have to oppose \nthe bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to offer my congratulations \nto the leaders on both sides of the aisle, the chairmen and ranking \nminority members of the Finance and Budget Committees, for all of their \nhard work in consummating this very significant, bipartisan budget \nagreement. While this bill is not everything I had hoped for, it is an \nimportant step toward getting our fiscal house in order.\n  Moreover, it is grounded in a philosophy that I strongly believe in--\nthat bipartisanship is the key to making government work. On difficult \nnational problems, such as balancing the budget, neither party alone \ncan get the job done, nor garner the public consensus needed for such \naction.\n  Indeed, this was the genesis behind establishing the so-called \nChafee-Breaux centrist budget coalition, which I believe deserves \nconsiderable credit for advancing the terms of debate on the issue of \nlong-term Medicare reform. Regrettably means-testing of the part B \npremium, increasing the age of eligibility from 65 to 67, and the $5 \nhome health copayment were dropped from the final package. However, the \ncredit for getting them into the Senate version of this bill belongs to \nthe centrist budget coalition. Each of these provisions was added to \nthe Senate bill with a big, courageous bipartisan vote--something which \nwould have been unthinkable just a few years ago.\n  As a result of these pioneering Senate votes and the growing national \nconsensus on the need for long-term reform, President Clinton has now \npledged to stand with those Members of Congress who vote for means-\ntesting of the part B premium, an important step toward creating the \npolitical environment which will be needed to secure this program for \nfuture generations of retirees.\n  I would further urge the President, as well as Democratic party \nleaders, to disavow and distance themselves from candidates who resort \nto mediscare demagoguery in their future political campaigns. The \nAmerican people deserve a responsible debate on this difficult subject, \nand the centrist coalition will be working to see that this happens.\n  This bill does include a number of helpful changes for Medicare \nbeneficiaries, low-income children, and legal immigrants which I would \nlike to briefly highlight.\n  Medigap provisions included in this bill, which I was pleased to \nauthor earlier this year, will do for Medicare beneficiaries much of \nwhat the Kassebaum-Kennedy health insurance bill did for working \nAmericans: It vastly improves portability and bans preexisting \ncondition limitations for Medigap policy holders.\n  This bill also improves access to emergency services for Medicare \nbeneficiaries enrolled in managed care plans, which is derived from \nlegislation Senator Graham authored and I was glad to cosponsor earlier \nthis year. This provision establishes a prudent layperson definition of \nemergency medical conditions to ensure that emergency services are \nproperly covered.\n  This legislation also includes expanded preventive health care \nbenefits for Medicare enrollees, including mammography, colorectal and \nprostate cancer screening; testing for osteoporosis; and improved \ncoverage for diabetes and other important prevention measures. These \nenhanced services will be helpful to the more than 174,000 Medicare \nbeneficiaries in Rhode Island.\n  One of my most important priorities, that of expanding access to \nhealth insurance for low-income children, is also addressed in this \nbill. I am especially pleased that we are providing $24 billion for \nthis purpose. This is a critical step forward for Rhode Island's\n\n[[Page S8347]]\n\nchildren, 19 percent of whom live in poverty. Many of these poor \nchildren--38 percent--live in families where at least one parent is \nworking, yet they are still poor. These funds are targeted to help \nthese families especially.\n  While I would have preferred greater specificity in terms of the \nbenefits to be provided to children under this program, the final \npackage is a significant improvement over some of the earlier \nproposals. I want to thank and acknowledge Senator Rockefeller for his \nleadership and expertise in working to advance the cause for children's \nhealth insurance. He was a strong partner in helping to make this a \nstronger and better program than it otherwise would have been.\n  I also want to thank Senator Roth for helping me to ensure that Rhode \nIsland can take full advantage of the funding provided under this \nprogram to continue its children's health initiatives. The Finance \nCommittee chairman was very responsive to the problems this legislation \nposed for States, like Rhode Island, that have already expanded \ncoverage. We were able to work together to ensure that Rhode Island \nwill not be penalized for choosing to expand coverage on its own.\n  This bill also gives States critical new flexibility by allowing them \nto enroll Medicaid beneficiaries into managed care without obtaining a \nwaiver from the Department of Health and Human Services. At the same \ntime, the legislation includes important safeguards for these \nbeneficiaries, many of which were contained in legislation I introduced \nearlier this year. For example, disabled children, children in foster \ncare and special needs children who have been adopted are protected \nfrom mandatory enrollment in managed care. Women enrolled in Medicaid \nmanaged care programs will continue to have the freedom to choose their \nfamily planning provider, even if that provider is not part of their \nmanaged care plan.\n  This bill also restores Medicaid coverage to thousands of children \nwho were removed from the SSI rolls as a result of eligibility changes \nmade in the 1996 welfare reform law. This will be enormously helpful to \nmany low-income families whose children may no longer be considered \nstatutorily disabled but who nevertheless have significant special \nhealth care needs.\n  Let me take a moment to describe the provisions of this bill dealing \nwith legal immigrants. As my colleagues know, the 1996 welfare reform \nlaw placed severe restrictions on the Federal benefits that legal \nimmigrants may receive. Among these restrictions was a complete and \nimmediate cut-off of supplemental security income [SSI] and food stamp \nbenefits, not only for future immigrants but for those already in this \ncountry legally.\n  For the elderly and disabled legal immigrants who last August were in \nthe United States--including nearly 4,000 in my own State of Rhode \nIsland--the new SSI ban represented nothing short of a crisis. For \nmany, the loss of this critical Federal aid would mean losing the \nability to live independently. In turn, this would present a serious \ncommunity and fiscal challenge to State and local governments, as \nimmigrants who had lost benefits and faced destitution turned to \nnursing homes or other costly facilities for support.\n  I was sorely troubled by these restrictions on immigrants, and \npledged to do what I could to mitigate the most harsh of these during \nthis Congress. I am delighted to say that in this regard, we have been \nsuccessful. The conference report before us now is identical to the \nSenate-passed bill on which I and others of my colleagues worked very \nhard.\n  It restores benefits to those legal immigrants who were receiving SSI \nas of last August. It also allows immigrants who were in the United \nStates last August and who may become disabled in the future to receive \nSSI. For my State, this means that 3,753 currently elderly and disabled \nRhode Island residents--and many others who may become disabled in the \nfuture--will be able to receive basic SSI assistance to allow them to \nlive with dignity.\n  Now, the immigrant provisions of this bill are not perfect. And I am \ndisappointed that it does not contain the Chafee-Graham amendment on \nlegal immigrant children and Medicaid, or the provision dealing with \nSSI for those too disabled to naturalize. But the bill before us goes a \nlong way toward restoring fair treatment for the thousands of legal, \ntax-paying immigrants who were in the country and playing by the rules \nwhen welfare reform was enacted.\n  I want to commend Senators D'Amato, Feinstein, DeWine, and Graham for \nall of their hard work in helping to solve this problem. Since the \nintroduction of our Fairness for Legal Immigrants Act in April, we have \nbeen working as a united team toward fair treatment for legal \nimmigrants. With passage of this bill, our efforts will have met with \nsuccess.\n  In closing, I am hopeful that we can build upon the bipartisanship \nthat was necessary to make this bill a reality when we turn to the more \nchallenging task of advancing long-term budget and entitlement reforms \nin the future.\n  I particularly want to address the entitlement reforms I strongly \nbelieve are necessary for Medicare. Although the provisions we worked \nhard on--means testing the part B premium, increasing the age of \neligibility from 65 to 67, the $5 home health care copayment--were \ndropped in the final package, nonetheless, I think it behooves all of \nus to continue our work on each of these measures, and certainly I will \ndo everything I can to advance them. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself such time as I might consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I rise to address the Balanced Budget \nAct of 1997.\n  This is an important moment. This bill represents the triumph of the \nidea that we must get our national accounts in order. This is an idea \nthat Republicans, with the help of many Democrats, have labored for \nyears to put at the top of the national agenda.\n  Finally, it is close to being done.\n  As a member of the Finance and Budget Committees, and as a Budget \nCommittee delegate to the conference, I have been deeply involved in \nthe consideration of this bill. And I have been in a position to \nwitness the dedication Senator Roth, Senator Domenici, and Senator Lott \nhve brought to the difficult task of giving birth to this balanced \nbudget legislation. I want to congratulate them on the success of their \nefforts.\n  I would particularly like to thank Chairman Domenici, Chairman Roth, \nSenator Lott and the other Senate conferees for protecting a number of \nexcellent Senate provisions in the conference committee. Believe me, \nMadam President, it wasn't easy.\n  The Medicare portions of the bill will bring about very positive \nchanges in the program.\n  The bill calls for necessary savings in Medicare, and thereby will \nhelp put Medicare, and particularly the Medicare hospital trust fund, \non a sounder financial footing. The bill also contains a number of \ninnovations that I think will improve the Medicare Program.\n  First and foremost is the new Medicare Plus Choice Program, reforming \nMedicare managed care.\n  From my perspective, representing the State of Iowa, the inclusion in \nthis bill of a 50-50 local/national blended rate for Medicare managed \ncare reimbursement is extremely important. Also critical is the bill's \ninclusion of a minimum payment of $367 in 1998, with annual updates \nthereafter.\n  The opportunity for additional types of health plans, other than \nHMO's, to participate in the Medicare Choice Program will open \nadditional opportunities to Medicare beneficiaries. Based upon what I \nhave been hearing from Iowa, I think the reformed payment system and \nthe additional types of plans should truly broaden choice for Medicare \nbeneficiaries in Iowa.\n  These provisions together should go a long way toward giving Iowans \nthe same kinds of choices Medicare beneficiaries in other parts of the \ncountry have.\n  I also want to thank the chairman and my colleagues on the Senate \nFinance Committee and the House and Senate conference committees for \nincluding many provisions contained in S. 701, legislation I introduced \nearlier this year regarding Medicare managed care standards. I am \nespecially pleased to see that, beginning in 1998 and annually \nthereafter, beneficiaries will receive comparative user-friendly charts\n\n[[Page S8348]]\n\nlisting health plan options in their area. The only way to foster \nconsumer choice and competition is by informing Medicare beneficiaries \nof their options and their rights under the Medicare Choice Program. \nThe lack of information currently distributed to Medicare beneficiaries \nis astonishing.\n  The Medicare conference agreement will ensure that beneficiaries have \nthe information they require to make the right health plan choice for \ntheir individual health care needs.\n  Another important protection for Medicare beneficiaries is a fair \nappeals process. I have been advocating for an objective review of \nhealth plans' decisions to deny care.\n  I am pleased that the Medicare conference agreement adopted my \nprovisions to provide Medicare beneficiaries increased protections \nduring the appeals process. Now, all Medicare beneficiaries will have \nthe assurance that the Medicare program will provide an independent \nreview of all denials of care by health plans prior to beneficiaries \nappealing to the Department of Health and Human Services.\n  This increased protection will hold health plans more accountable in \ntheir decision making process regarding medically necessary care and \nwill give beneficiaries greater confidence in Medicare managed care, if \nthey choose this option.\n  Madam President, I am also very pleased that we have preserved in the \nconference agreement rural health provisions that I have been working \non for several years.\n  These provisions include:\n  My Medicare dependent hospitals bill, which will help a large number \nof rural hospitals in Iowa suffering from negative Medicare margins;\n  Senator Baucus' bill on critical access rural hospitals, on which \nSenator Rockefeller and I have been close collaborators;\n  Reform of the Medicare disproportionate share hospital program, so \nthat deserving hospitals will be treated fairly whether they are \nlocated in urban or rural areas----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, I have been listening to your \nremarks and analysis.\n  I want to tell the Senate, and anybody interested, if not for Charles \nGrassley, the Senator who has been speaking, we would not have gotten \nthat provision. That is a fair provision because those parts of \nAmerica--your State, my State, and others--that have done a good job of \nkeeping costs way down, can't make it if we build the program on \nkeeping them down while the very expensive States do not come down. And \nthis is a formula we did not get exactly what we wanted, but thanks to \nyour efforts we came very close to something that you can say is fair \nand much better for your people.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his kind \nremarks. And he has spoken better than I can on that issue. But \nbasically what his constituents do not realize and my constituents do \nnot realize, is that we have a very cost-effective delivery of medicine \nin rural America, very high quality by the way, but because of the \nhistorical basis for the reimbursement of Medicare, based upon that \ncost-effective medicine, we are at a very low level, and the options \nthat metropolitan areas have will not come to rural America; but the \nprovisions of the legislation he just described will make that possible \nnow.\n  And so I can say this, that in 1995, it would not have been included \nin the legislation without the intervention of the Senator from New \nMexico, even though it was my basic legislation. And he helped us this \ntime at a very, very critical time in the negotiations between the \nHouse and the Senate. So I may have authored this legislation, but the \nfact that it is in the final package is a tribute to the leadership of \nSenator Domenici.\n  I will continue on and say that we have also for rural areas \nthe provisions for:\n\n  Expanding the existing telemedicine demonstration project, in order \nto improve the delivery of health care to underserved areas;\n  Reform of the eligibility requirements for rural health clinics, \nenabling this vital program to operate as originally intended; and\n  My legislation assisting rural referral centers.\n  I am also pleased to finally see my legislation to provide direct \nreimbursement at 85 percent of the physician fee schedule to nurse \npractitioners, clinical nurse specialists, any physician assistants is \nfinally going to become law. Similar measures were included in the \nPresident's Medicare proposal and in the House Ways and Means Medicare \nbill and were part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1995.\n  Senator Conrad and I introduced these bills in the last three \nCongresses. We reintroduced them again in this Congress and were \nsuccessful in getting them included in the Senate Finance Committee \nbill. This legislation will reform Medicare policies which, under \ncertain circumstances, restrict reimbursement for services delivered by \nthese providers.\n  Direct reimbursement to these nonphysician providers will improve \naccess to primary care services for Medicare beneficiaries, \nparticularly in rural and under served areas.\n  There has been much deliberation in this Congress over proposals to \naddress the problem of uninsured children in our Nation.\n  I am very pleased that the bill before us today includes a strong \nbipartisan package addressing this matter. This bill includes a total \nof $24 billion to be spent on children's health insurance initiatives \nfor those who are not currently enrolled in Medicaid or who do not have \naccess to adequate and affordable health care coverage. This is $10 \nbillion more than the President's original proposal.\n  We should view this achievement not only as an important piece of \nhealth care policy, but also as a giant step toward improving the \nquality of life for our Nation's children. I commend the Senate \nleadership, particularly Chairman Roth and Chairman Domenici, for their \nleadership and commitment to this important matter.\n  These funds will be provided to States in the form of block grants. \nStates are allowed considerable flexibility in designing health \ninsurance programs, yet States must meet important Federal guidelines \nin their efforts to provide quality health care coverage.\n  I am confident that this proposal will be successful in meeting our \ngoals to cover our Nation's uninsured children.\n  Yet, it is important that Congress remain committed to this goal and \nwe must closely monitor the developments of the proposal set forth in \nthis legislation.\n  This budget bill includes a number of improvements to the Medicaid \nProgram to ensure that high-quality of care is provided to our Nation's \nmost vulnerable population. And, this bill reforms Medicaid to give \nStates much more flexibility in managing their programs.\n  In recent years, States have undertaken numerous initiatives to \ncontrol spending in Medicaid. As a result, Medicaid spending has slowed \nsignificantly. This budget saves a total of $13.6 billion in the \nMedicaid Program over 5 years. Most savings are achieved through new \npolicies for payments to disproportionate share hospitals. Funds have \nbeen retargeted to hospitals that serve large numbers of Medicaid and \nlow-income patients.\n  Other improvements made to the Medicaid Program include changes to \nlast year's welfare reform law so that benefits are restored to legal \nimmigrants needing long-term care services. Also, a number of important \nreforms were made to managed care policies for Medicaid programs \nserving children, people with disabilities, and other Americans.\n  Of course, I do have a number of concerns, Madam President. Does this \nbill represent a long-term solution to the problems facing the \nentitlement programs? No, it most certainly does not. But I note that \nthe proposal of Senators Roth and Moynihan to establish a Medicare \nReform Commission is included in the conference agreement. We will look \nto the work of this commission to make proposals for reform and to help \nus produce the consensus we need to act to put the Medicare Program on \na sound footing for the retirement of the baby-boom generation. Make no \nmistake: we will need to do more. But on balance, I believe that we \nhave made a good start.\n  I want to conclude by again thanking Senators Roth and Domenici and \ntheir\n\n[[Page S8349]]\n\nhard-working staffs for the efforts they have made, for several years \nnow, to bring us to this point.\n\n\n                Restoring Benefits for Legal Immigrants\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the balanced budget agreement represents \nmajor progress in restoring benefits to legal immigrants. The harsh \nwelfare law passed last year wrongfully denied access by legal \nimmigrants to most Federal assistance programs. It permanently banned \nthem from SSI benefits and food stamps. It banned them for 5 years from \nAFDC, Medicaid, and other programs. And it gave the States the option \nof permanently banning them from these programs.\n  Americans across the country were rightly concerned about these \nunfair provisions, and Congress soon agreed that the legislation had \ngone too far.\n  If the provisions of last year's welfare law remain in effect, many \nelderly legal immigrants would be forced out of nursing homes. Legal \nimmigrants injured on the job and those with disabled children would \nlose assistance. Some 500,000 legal immigrants who were already living \nin the United States would have been affected. In Massachusetts, 15,000 \nelderly and disabled legal immigrants would have lost their SSI \nbenefits.\n  Some said in last year's welfare debate, ``Let the immigrant's \nsponsor support them.'' But, Congress now realizes that legal \nimmigrants often do not have sponsors. Refugees, for example, do not \nhave sponsors. In cases of many older immigrants, their sponsor has \ndied or is no longer able to provide support.\n  Immigrants affected by last year's harsh cuts are individuals who \ncame to this country legally. Many are close family members of American \ncitizens. They play by the rules, pay their taxes, and serve in our \nArmed Forces. They are future citizens trying to make their way in this \ncountry.\n  The $12 billion restored for legal immigrant assistance over the next \n5 years in this bill is urgently needed. It will allow most legal \nimmigrants who currently receive SSI benefits to stay on the rolls. In \naddition, legal immigrants who were in the United States at this time \nlast year's welfare bill was enacted in August 1996 can receive SSI in \nthe future if they become disabled. These changes will help a very \nlarge number of people hurt by the welfare law.\n  Unfortunately, those who are too disabled to go through the process \nof naturalization to become citizens are left out of the final bill. I \nproposed an amendment, which was accepted by the Senate, to receive SSI \nbenefits after their first 5 years in the United States, and I hope we \ncan revisit this important issue in the near future.\n  I had also hoped the final budget agreement would allow legal \nimmigrant children to continue to receive Medicaid. Currently, they are \nbanned from Medicaid for 5 years. Some States may even act to ban legal \nimmigrant children from Medicaid forever. The Senate bill included a \nChafee-Graham amendment to enable these children to receive Medicaid \nbenefits, and I regret that it was dropped from the first bill.\n  There is still much more to be done to correct the problems created \nfor legal immigrants by last year's welfare bill. The Senate version of \nthis bill restored less than 50 percent of the cuts made last year in \ntheir benefits. We are making worthwhile progress in this legislation, \nand I intend to do all I can to see that additional progress is made in \nfuture legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time does the Senator desire? Fifteen minutes?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, let me thank the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee for yielding, and let me also recognize him this evening and \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, for the work that \nboth Senators have done with their ranking members over the last good \nmany months to craft the legislation that is before us today, tomorrow, \nand through the balance of the week dealing both with the budget and \nwith tax cuts.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 2015, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n  Madam President, in 1993 and 1994, we had a President who said \nbalancing the budget probably was a bad thing to do. We had a high \nadministration official who actually had written a book that said it \nwas a loophole whenever children could inherit some of their parents' \nmoney. Congress had increased spending and joined with the President in \nthe passing of the biggest tax increase in the history of our country. \nThat was not a decade ago. That was just a few years ago.\n  Then came November 1994. And what a difference an election makes. \nWhat a great transformation of the mind and the political thought can \noccur when the American people have spoken and said, ``We've had \nenough.''\n  We asked the Congress to change their thinking. And we changed the \nCongress to think differently. And the first Republican Congress in 40 \nyears began in 1995, with promises to do several very important, \nnecessary things--to reform welfare, to cut back bureaucracy, to \nbalance the budget, and to provide some tax relief for American \ntaxpayers who work hard, have families, and create jobs.\n  In 1996, the voters rewarded a Congress and President who \naccomplished the first two of these items and who promised to bring \nabout the rest.\n  This week, the Republican majority in Congress, joined by now many \nreform Democrats in a bipartisan majority, will deliver on those \npromises.\n  Madam President, this week, as we consider the Balanced Budget Act, \nand especially the Tax Relief Act of 1997, we are talking about more \nfreedom for more of America's people.\n  Freedom is not something that the Government gives the people. Our \nNation's founders knew that the people's freedom is, in the words of \nthe Declaration of Independence, ``self-evident,'' ``unalienable,'' and \n``endowed by their Creator.''\n  Freedom comes from limiting Government to its necessary functions. \nFreedom is what remains when Government is not excessively burdensome \nor coercive.\n  This week, we take modest but very significant steps toward restoring \nfreedom to the American people--freedom from the most severe tax burden \non families in our Nation's history, freedom from an oppressive \nnational debt, freedom from the growth of an ever-larger, ever-more \nintrusive Federal Government.\n  A couple from Idaho and their four daughters visited my office just \nthis week and we discussed taxes, and particularly death and \ninheritance taxes. They told to me they run a small farm in Idaho that \ntheir great-grandparents had established in 1882. And they reminded me \nthat people turned to Government to take care of them when the \nGovernment, usually through taxes, takes away their ability to take \ncare of themselves.\n  And as Ronald Reagan said: A Government big enough to promise you \neverything you need is a Government big enough to take away everything \nyou have.\n  The Tax Relief Act that we will begin debating tomorrow, combined \nwith balancing the budget, will help more families take care of \nthemselves the way they want, by keeping more of their own hard-earned \nmoney; by bringing about the ability to save more for their retirement, \ntheir children's education, and other priorities they have; by making \nit easier to own your own family farm or small business or home; by \nmaking it easier to do the kinds of things that Americans like to do, \nwithout having to think twice or three times whether they can afford \nto, or worry whether the Government will take more of their money; by \ncreating, in other words, the economic atmosphere that will allow \nAmericans to invest in creating more and better jobs for themselves, \ntheir children, and the future of our country.\n\n  The bills we will pass this week mark the triumph of the principle \nthat the Federal budget should be balanced and should stay balanced.\n  In 1994, when the American people spoke so clearly about changing the \npolitical thought in this country and the political attitudes, the Dow \nJones was hovering at about 3000. Today, it is at 8000. We have, by \nthese efforts to balance the budget and provide tax relief,\n\n[[Page S8350]]\n\nunleashed a dynamic of this economy that is, without question, \nhistoric.\n  We are now seeing the reverse of what happened about 40 years ago, \nwhen an elite group of liberal economists sold liberal politicians on \nthe idea that you could promise your voters a free lunch. Their \nintellectual justification was the so-called enlightened discovery that \nunlimited borrowing could pay for unlimited social spending without \nmuch consequence.\n  It's easy to understand the political appeal of this proposition. \nWhat is incredible is that anyone really believed it, or that they \nwould follow it for nearly 40 years and create a $5 trillion borrowed \ndebt--almost beyond understanding.\n  But that is where we are today. That is clearly why the American \npeople have spoken, and that is why this Congress and this Senate \nfinally said we have to change the way we do business.\n  You can't borrow your way to prosperity over the long term. We tried \nand we saw our economy grow even more sluggish. We saw people become \neven more dependent on Government largess. Thank goodness, Americans, \nenlightened as they always are, recognizing that they are the \nGovernment, took charge and said, ``No more.''\n  A huge national debt means our Government has spent the last \ngeneration mortgaging the future for the next generation.\n  That is not a matter of green-eyeshades accounting; it really is an \nimmoral assault on the well-being of our children and their ability to \nproduce for themselves and their prodigies.\n  Balancing the budget is not about numbers, it is about people. \nBalancing the budget means more and better jobs, making it more \naffordable to buy a home, and more families affording a good education \nfor their children without having to come to the Government and say, \nplease help me. They can do more of it for themselves. Balancing the \nbudget means that essential Federal programs like Social Security and \nMedicare will be there for those who need it and not become a liability \nand a burden on future generations.\n  There will be more freedom because of a balanced budget, because \npeople will get no more Government than they are willing to pay for. \nBalancing the budget means Americans--all Americans--win. And we have \nthe actions of the last 3 years now--an economy responding to spending \nrestraint and real efforts to balance the budget and cut taxes--to \ndemonstrate that what I am talking about tonight has a very strong \nfoundation of truth.\n  I want to pause for a moment and review one critical reason why we \nare here this week passing legislation that promises to balance the \nbudget by fiscal year 2002. This die was cast when Congress, by the \nnarrowest of margins, defeated the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution.\n  Only the threat of the ultimate legal sanction--a constitutional \namendment--and the overwhelming public support for that amendment \nfinally convinced Congress, most important, some of my colleagues and \nsome in the administration, that we had to quit talking the talk and \nstart walking the walk.\n  In other words, I have heard so many on the other side throw up their \nhands and say, we do not need a constitutional amendment to make us \nbalance the budget; all we have to do is do it; all we have to do is \nexert fiscal responsibility. But we also have to have this program and \nwe have to have that program, and we have to spend here and there. And \n2 years running, by one vote, the people almost began to take control \nof their Government again. It frightened the Congress.\n  A President who once said a balanced budget is a bad idea is now out \nstrutting around talking about his balanced budget and all of the \nwonderful things that will be reaped by it. Well, it is always \nsurprising to me that people like our President think the American \npublic has such a short memory. They don't. His record suggests he \ndoesn't believe it is a good idea. He also knows politically that he \nhas to do it. And there are some in Congress who sometimes choose to do \nsomething differently than we otherwise may like to do, but who know \nwhat they have to do because the American people expect it. Balancing \nthe budget has always been the right thing to do. We are here tonight \nbecause it is now also, at last, the politically correct thing to do, \nand I suggest that that vote occur.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG. No, not at this time. I'd like to finish my thoughts. I \nknow that 2 years running, with the House having passed a balanced \nbudget amendment and this Senate missing by just one vote--finally, it \nis recognized by all in a bipartisan gesture that, the closer the \npeople come to changing their Constitution and exerting that control \nover Congress, the more motivated Congress becomes in doing it, doing \nit ourselves, and that is exactly what is occurring here. I believe \nthat, without the constitutional discipline, we will always risk the \nreturn to more spending and more borrowing. Ultimately, to safeguard \nthe future, the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution must come \ninto place.\n  Some may suggest that passage of this year's balanced budget \nagreement means we no longer need the constitutional amendment. I \nsuggest that is not true. One balanced budget in 30 years hardly means \nthat we have fixed the system or that we have systemically changed the \nattitude of some who serve here. It will never be easier than it is \nright now to balance the budget.\n  In the past, the temptation always was to put off the hard choices; \nMembers have thought, it will be easier in the future than it is now. \nBut in fact, it will never again be as easy as it is right now to begin \nthat long march to arrest the growth of a $5 trillion national debt.\n  That is what the long-term economic and demographic trends tell us. \nThis year's budget discipline and hard choices are nothing compared to \nwhat Congress must wrestle with in just the next few years.\n  For what we have committed ourselves to tonight and for the balance \nof this decade will not be easy choices. It was difficult enough to \narrive at the agreement that we now have, and I will say, even though I \ndiffer sometimes with the President and others, that this is now a \nbipartisan effort, and I accept that and I honor them in their \nrecognition that, finally, they are willing to offer to the American \npeople what the American people have asked for.\n  When we finally pass this balanced budget and then the balanced \nbudget amendment and send it out to the States for ratification--and I \nbelieve that will occur in my lifetime and probably within the decade--\nwe will show we understand, as the American people clearly understand, \nthat a nation so indebted ultimately cannot survive, and that to clean \nup our debt, to balance our budget was ultimately the necessary thing \nto do.\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 is a mixed bag. I don't support every \nportion of it. I have reservations about some of it.\n  It creates new social spending; it locks in, in the form of \nentitlements, that social spending. It could use stronger enforcement \nprovisions. For example, I continue to support the idea that caps on \nspending should extend to spending overall and not only to annual \nappropriations. It does not address the long-term economic and \ndemographic trends that drive entitlement spending and cry out for \nreform.\n  The chairmen of our committees and some Senators tried hard to get \nthose reforms. That was bipartisan. Some partisans on my side, too, \ncould not accept that. But, ultimately, we will get there. We have to \nget there. I don't want my grandchildren turning to me and saying, \nGrandpa, we love you dearly, but we can't afford you and afford to \nprovide for ourselves. We want to buy our own home, educate our \nchildren, and we cannot afford the amount of money that would come from \nour paycheck to go to the Federal Government because that government \npromised to provide for everyone's future. I don't want that to happen, \nand the chairman doesn't want that to happen. The future demands that \nwe address it, that we help people prepare themselves for it, and that \nwe will try to do.\n  Today, annual discretionary appropriations make up only one-third of \nthe total budget, and that share will continue to shrink. The Kerrey-\nDanforth entitlement commission of a couple of years ago estimated that \nin just 14 years, 2011, entitlement spending and interest payments will \nconsume all\n\n[[Page S8351]]\n\navailable tax revenue. That means we will either have to borrow \nincredible amounts for deficit spending; or go without defense, \nhighways, law enforcement, parks, forestry, education, science, and \nmedical research; or raise taxes to ruinous levels.\n  We are not going to do that. We are smarter than that. More \nimportant, we wouldn't be here to do it if we tried, because the \nAmerican people won't tolerate it. They will demand reform before we \nget to that point, and if we can't give it to them, they will find the \ncandidate willing to do so.\n  While this bill before us today does establish another commission to \naddress the need for long-term entitlement reforms, we have already had \nthat kind of commission, chaired by Senator Kerrey of Nebraska. We \nalready know what the current trends are and have some idea of what \nneeds to be done.\n  But there is also considerable good in this bill. It does accomplish \nmore in the way of spending control and entitlement reform than many \nthought possible even a year ago. There are significant repairs to the \nMedicare System. Medicare will be solvent for at least another decade \nand will continue to be there for seniors who need it.\n  Last, we will begin the process of injecting consumer choice into the \nsystem. Why should our seniors not have some of that? The Medicare \nSystem, based on market principles, means better care and more economic \ncare. I am always amazed when the bureaucracy thinks it can outperform \nthe marketplace. We know it can't, we know it never has, and, in this \ninstance, we finally recognize that by putting some market principles \nin.\n  The fundamental reforms in last year's historic welfare reform bill \nwill remain in place. We continue to move toward a system that rewards \nwork and allows the States the freedom to develop new and better \napproaches.\n  Enforceable caps on discretionary appropriations spending--virtually \nthe only thing out of the 1990 budget agreement that worked--will \ncontinue through the year 2002.\n  Overall, the growth in spending will slow by $270 billion over the \nnext 5 years and $1 trillion over the next 10 years, a saving that will \nbe locked in by permanent law and not be subject to year-to-year \npolitical whims.\n  New spending will be accomplished with a minimum of bureaucracy and a \nmaximum of State flexibility.\n  This is far from the ideal balanced budget bill. But it takes the \nfirst major step away from demagoguery and toward genuine entitlement \nreform. It delivers on and locks in the promise of a balanced budget, \nsomething I have demanded and worked for my entire time here serving \nthe State of Idaho.\n  Why do I demand that? Because the citizens of my State know that a \ngovernment that continually spends beyond its means, a government that \nmounts a $5 trillion debt, a government that allows interest on debt to \nrapidly move toward becoming the largest single item in its budget, is \na government that cannot sustain itself. That we recognize. The \nchairman of our Budget Committee and the chairman of our Finance \nCommittee recognize that. We all recognize that. That is what our party \nhas stood for. That is what the majority here in Congress has demanded \nbecause the citizens of our country have said it is a requirement of \ngovernment.\n  I must say that the Balanced Budget Act of this year and the \nTaxpayers' Relief Act of this year are responses to demands of the \nAmerican people. I am proud to have been a part of helping craft them. \nI look forward to the opportunity to vote for them, to cause them to \nbecome law, and to see this economy remain dynamic, create jobs, and \nprovide opportunities for this generation and generations to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me say to my friend, Senator Craig, \nperhaps if we had adopted what he has been recommending for many \nyears--a constitutional amendment to balance the budget--we wouldn't be \nhere with the kind of circumstances that confront us.\n  I don't think the Senator from Idaho has to stand up here, or with \nhis people, and talk about where he stands in terms of overspending by \nour National Government because his record is excellent in that regard. \nI think his remarks today indicate that, when you have a Democrat \nPresident, a Republican Congress, and a strong Democratic minority in \nboth Houses, you can't get everything that you want. As a matter of \nfact, the Democrats differ from their President, and the President \ndiffers from us.\n  What we have done, I think, is borderline on being a miracle. The \nonly thing that keeps me from saying that is that I don't know whether \nthe product deserves being labeled a miracle. But in terms of getting \nit put together, coming here today and getting it finished and voted on \ntomorrow--I am sure we are going to get in excess of 75 votes \ntomorrow--that is pretty good.\n  As I said this morning when I opened up, even the Washington Post \nfinally said, ``That Is a Big Deal.'' I think it is.\n  I am very glad that the Senator from Idaho is going to support it and \nthat he has been helping us as much as he has. I thank him for that.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico. I \nrecognize the bipartisan nature in which this was created, and I \nsupport that. I hope that we can sustain that in years to come to truly \nget our budget in balance and to do so in a way that remains or creates \nor participates in a vibrant economy.\n  There is no question that this effort was accomplished not by us \nalone but in a bipartisan effort. Certainly the ranking member, who \nstands here this evening, was a major contributor. And I recognize \nthat.\n  I am always a bit surprised when for the 17 years that I have been \nhere I have always heard, ``Oh, we don't need to worry about that. We \ncan balance the budget. We have the will to do it.'' Well, we didn't \nhave the will until the American people demanded it of us. Now we do \nhave that will. It will only come by a bipartisan effort. I recognize \nthat this evening. I appreciate it. I think it is a great \naccomplishment, and the Senator from New Mexico is to be congratulated \nfor it.\n  I thank both Senators.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I mentioned that this was a ``big \ndeal.'' Every time I say that I want to make sure that I say, ``and a \ngood deal for all Americans'' because that is what is important--not \nthat it is big, not that people think it is a big deal, but that it is \ngood for our people. And that it is.\n  I yield the floor. Senator Lautenberg wants to speak.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Just for a few minutes, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, in the almost afterglow of feeling \npretty good about things, we worked hard, everybody together. There \nwere no fingers pointed.\n  I chided the chairman of the committee this morning when he excerpted \nfrom the headline of the Washington Post. He said that the headline in \nfive words said, ``This is a Big Deal.'' I asked a question. Was the \nintonation properly affixed, or did it say, ``This is a good deal?'' It \nis quite a different meaning.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We read the story. They were saying it is a ``big \ndeal.''\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. It is a big deal; a giant deal. I think, without \nbreaking our arms or patting ourselves on the back, there was a lot of \ngoodwill that was injected into the discussion and into the debate.\n  My colleague from Idaho, who is a man who has a way with words, kind \nof laid it on us and included the President in there as someone who did \nbuy into the balanced budget notion but was dragged kicking and \nscreaming.\n  Mr. President, I wish it was 1 o'clock in the afternoon and we were \nall energized and we had a chance to talk a little bit. But I will not \nprolong the process except for a minute or two to say, since it took \nwhat I thought was a slight partisan turn--it makes me unhappy when \nthings have gone this well this way to say that I have been here long \nenough to remember Presidents Reagan and Bush. I like them both. They \nare nice people. But people on their watch, as we say, who managed to \nhave this deficit of ours skyrocket\n\n[[Page S8352]]\n\nright up into the air--turn up the tax cuts and let the deficits run. \nThat is what they did.\n  When our President and the Democratic Party took over in 1992, 1993, \nhe inherited a deficit that year of $290 billion without a balanced \nbudget amendment but with the interest that was generated. Yes, we were \nprofligates, and we spent too much money, and perhaps we did a few \nthings wrong. But it was an honest try all the way. And the assertion \nor the insinuation that these guys didn't care or those guys didn't \ncare, it is not a way to do business. I don't care if we never get a \nbalanced budget amendment. I want to tell you right now. As a matter of \nfact, I hope you don't. I love the Constitution, and the Constitution \nloves America, and it is the best document ever written. The fact that \nwe have altered it so few times is a testimony to the strength and the \nwisdom of the Founders and those who have written amendments.\n  The only time we wrote an amendment that kind of restricted our \nactivity was prohibition, and it was soon canceled. It is a wonderful \nprescription for how a society should function, preserving individual \nrights and making sure that the freedoms as much as possible are \nextended to every citizen in our country.\n  So I just felt like I had to respond. No one worked harder than the \nman on my right, the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, \nSenator Domenici. I didn't always agree with him, but nobody worked \nharder, and no one assembled a more honest attempt to do it in a \nbipartisan fashion. There were things that he wanted that we on my side \nof the aisle didn't want. But he was willing to explain them and \nwilling to take a deep breath when necessary not to fight them. I have \ngained great respect for him, as well as personal affection, honestly.\n  Mr. President, I just want to change the tone for a minute, and let \noff a little steam and say that I hope we will move on to pass this \ndocument into law and make sure that everybody understands there was a \ngood attempt by everybody working in this place to get it done with, to \nget on with the task that we have a very good start on because of the \nshape of the deficit that we see now.\n  So, Mr. President, I yield the floor. I know the Senator from New \nMexico has a UC that he would like to propose. I hope that we will have \na chance to hear that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I note the presence on the floor of the \njunior Senator from Oregon. Might I ask, did he desire to speak on the \nbudget?\n  Mr. WYDEN. On the budget.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if I could propose a UC regarding the budget. \nWhen I am finished I will try to work in an exception for him.\n  How long does the Senator desire to speak?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Fifteen or twenty or minutes would be plenty.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nresume the pending conference report at 9:15 a.m., Thursday, and that \nthe remaining hour be equally divided between the chairman and the \nranking minority member of the Budget Committee; and that, at 10:15 \na.m., the Senate proceed to vote on adoption of the conference report \nwithout any intervening action. I further ask consent that this evening \nSenator Wyden of the State of Oregon be allowed 15 or 20 minutes on the \nbill after which we will be finished for the evening.\n  Is that satisfactory with the Senator?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, there will be no further votes tonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, first, let me say to my good friend, Senator Domenici, \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee, I just want him to know how much \nI have appreciated the chance to be a member of his committee. I think \nthis is a historic occasion and a chance to work very closely with him \non a variety of issues. Coming to the Senate has been a special \npleasure.\n  I also want to commend our good friend, Senator Lautenberg of New \nJersey, who in my view has done yeomen work in terms of keeping this \nwhole effort together and keeping it bipartisan.\n  Mr. President, the balanced budget agreement that will be passed this \nweek has been a long time in coming. I think our challenge is to now \nmake sure that actually getting a balanced budget takes a shorter \nperiod of time.\n  I do believe that we are finally on the right track because this \nbudget provides an opportunity for the Federal Government to get its \nfiscal house in order while still making a handful of extremely needed \ninvestments in the people of our country and in U.S. productivity.\n  Most importantly, I am of the view that this is a historic moment \nbecause it has been achieved by working together. If ever there was an \nissue that required bipartisan cooperation, this is it. It seems to me \nthat this is an example of what can happen when you put down for just a \nfew moments the political cudgel and focus on the needs of our country \nfirst.\n  Let me also say that I would like to make a special effort in the \ndays ahead to address the Medicare provision of this legislation. In my \nview, in the 21st century, Medicare is not just going to be a part of \nthe Federal budget; it is going to be the Federal budget. There is no \nprogram in America growing at the rate of Medicare. I think it is well \nunderstood that in the 21st century our country will be faced with a \ndemographic tsunami. We are going to have upwards of 50 million baby \nboomers retiring, and it is quite clear that efforts must be made now \nto modernize Medicare and get this program ready for the 21st century.\n  I sought to begin those efforts by introducing S. 386, the Medicare \nModernization and Patient Protection Act, in the spring. And the \nfundamental principle of that legislation was to make sure that \nMedicare began to introduce the kind of competition and choice and \nemphasis on quality for older people that is available in private \nsector health care.\n  What we are seeing in our country today is that Medicare has \nessentially been engaging in purchasing practices and management \npractices that the private sector threw in the attic years and years \nago. In much of the United States, Medicare has been rewarding waste \nand penalizing efficiency, and we all saw that emphasized again this \nweek when the Inspector General of the United States indicated that \nmore than $20 billion is lost each year in the Medicare Program due to \nfraud and waste.\n  The issue of inefficiency and the rewards for waste that you see in \nthe Medicare Program are particularly important to those I represent at \nhome in Oregon. We have gone a long way to reinventing the health care \nsystem in our State, particularly in the metropolitan areas. We have \ncompetition. We have extensive choice for older people. We do not have \nthe gag clauses in the managed care plans where physicians are \nrestricted from telling older people about their options. We have done \na lot to come up with a health plan for seniors that will be good for \nolder people and taxpayers in the 21st century.\n  The reward to Oregon for doing the heavy lifting to reform Medicare \nover the last few years has been lower reimbursement collection. In \neffect, what the Federal Government told the people of Oregon over the \nlast 10 years is you would have gotten higher reimbursement, you would \nhave received higher payments, if you had gone about the process of \noffering wasteful, inefficient health care. And so what happens in much \nof my State, an older person, say, in the Klamath Valley will call \ntheir cousin or their sister in another part of the United States and \nask them about their Medicare. And a senior in another part of the \ncountry where health care isn't provided so efficiently will say to the \nOregonian, you know, my Medicare is great; I get prescription drugs for \nfree; I get eyeglasses at a discount; I get all these extras that are \nnot covered by Medicare.\n  Seniors in Oregon and other States where health services have been \nefficient say, I pay the same into Medicare as seniors in those States. \nWhy don't I get the same benefits?\n  Medicare is a national program. Why shouldn't the senior in Oregon \nget the\n\n[[Page S8353]]\n\nsame benefits as the senior in another State, which on top of \neverything else is offering care that is more costly and inefficient?\n  The reason for this bizarre situation is a very technical \nreimbursement system, an eye-glazing concept known as the average \nadjusted per capita cost. And the long and short of it is that it \nrewards waste, penalizes efficiency and in parts of the country like \nmine has meant that many of the health programs have difficulty even \nproviding the basic benefits to older people let alone some of the \nadditional benefits such as prescription drugs.\n  Under this legislation, because of exceptional bipartisan work--and \nhere I want to particularly commend Senator Grassley of Iowa, the \nchairman of our Aging Committee, who has worked very closely with me, \nfor his perseverance in correcting this inequity. As a result of the \nwork of our bipartisan coalition, this reimbursement system is going to \nchange. We will see all counties in our country get a minimum payment \nfor these health care plans that are holding costs down while giving \ngood quality, and over a period of time there will be a blending of \nreimbursement rates to consider both local reimbursement patterns and \nnational patterns.\n  What this means is that areas like Oregon that have held costs down \nwhile giving good quality will get higher reimbursement, and my \nconstituents, older people, are pleased because they will be in a \nposition to get better benefits. But what is especially important is \nthis is the kind of reimbursement change that is essential to save this \nprogram in the 21st century.\n  I would submit that what will happen as a result of the bipartisan \nwork to change the Medicare reimbursement process--Senator Grassley, \nmyself, and others have spent so much time--is we will start seeing \ncompetition and choice come to health care programs in parts of the \ncountry where there is no competition and there is no choice. So we are \ntalking about a change that, in my view, is going to really pay off for \nour country and pay off greatly in the years ahead.\n  Mr. President, I want to turn very briefly to the question of the \nother changes in Medicare that the Senate has debated and we are going \nto have to tackle in the days ahead. Particularly now I turn to the \nquestion of raising the age of eligibility for the Medicare Program and \nthe question of a means test or some sort of ability-to-pay test being \nincorporated into Medicare.\n  I have long felt that Lee Iacocca ought to be paying more for his \nMedicare than should an older woman who is 75 and has Alzheimer's and \nhas an income of $10,000 a year. So I think it is clear there is going \nto have to be an ability-to-pay feature added to the Medicare Program. \nBut it is extraordinarily important that this be done right and that \nthis be done carefully. I and other Members of the Senate felt that to \ntry to do this over just a few months with so many questions about how \nthis would be administered was precipitous action. But it must be done. \nLet us make no mistake about it. That change is going to have to be a \npart of 21st century Medicare. It has to be done fairly. My \nconstituents were concerned that at a time when already they did not \nget a fair shake under the Medicare reimbursement formula, they were \ngoing to be asked to pay more immediately under Medicare.\n\n  So there are some real questions about how to do this and do it \nfairly. But I want it understood I am of the view that there will have \nto be an essential change, and I am very hopeful the Senate will not \nwait for a bipartisan commission to make recommendations but with the \ncompletion of this legislation will start on that issue as well.\n  With respect to the question of the age of eligibility for the \nprogram, here, too, there are very important technical questions of how \nit is done and how it is done fairly. There have been a number of \nanalyses of late that have shown there is a significant increase in the \nnumber of uninsured Americans between the age of 55 to 64. So if that \ngroup of uninsured individuals is growing, to then add more, those \nbetween the ages of 65 and 67, would cause a hardship. So what I and \nothers hope will be done as this effort to examine the age of \neligibility is addressed is that there will be a buy-in opportunity, an \nopportunity for those individuals without insurance in that age group \nto be able to buy into the Medicare Program on a sliding scale.\n  Again, I think this is an opportunity the Senate ought to examine \ncarefully, ought to look at in a bipartisan way, and not wait for a \ncommission to make recommendations as to how it ought to be done.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me say that as these significant changes \nin Medicare are made, beginning with the reimbursement formula changes \nthat are being made now, changes that will bring fairness and \ncompetition and choice to the program, at every step of the way we have \nto keep the focus on protecting the rights of the patient. In this body \nSenators Akaka, Kennedy, and myself have led the push to ban gag \nclauses from managed care health plans. Health care is a complicated \nissue, we could all agree. But one issue we all should agree on is that \npatients have a right to know all the information about the kind of \nmedical services and options that would be made available to them.\n  Under this legislation, that significant protection for patients is \nin place and I think it is just the beginning of the kind of new focus \nthat should be placed on patients' rights and the protection of quality \nhealth care which older people deserve. At a time when the health care \nsystem and Medicare specifically are in transition, protection for the \nrights of the patients is even more important than ever. At a time when \nthere is a focus on more competition and choice, it ought to be met \nwith an equal emphasis of protecting the rights of the patients, and \nthat has begun in this legislation as well.\n  Mr. President, I come from a part of the country that is proud to \nhave led the Nation in the cause of health care reform and efficiency. \nUnder the leadership of our Governor, Gov. John Kitzhaber, we have \nreinvented the Medicaid Program with the Oregon Health Plan.\n  For more than a decade, as a result of work done by Democrats and \nRepublicans and older people and health care professionals, we have \nreinvented the Medicare Program in much of our State. So there is a new \nemphasis on choice and quality. What this legislation does is it \nremoves the penalties against those programs that have been creative, \nthose programs that have led the Nation in reforming Medicare and \nMedicaid. It is high time that those changes are made.\n  Mr. President, I think those changes lay the foundation for the other \ncritical changes that are going to be needed to strengthen health care \nservices in the days ahead. I look forward to working with our \ncolleagues on a bipartisan basis to achieve those changes.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I may speak for \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to make a couple of comments also on the \nbudget bill that we have before us here this evening and that we will \nbe voting on, I guess, tomorrow morning.\n  I come here excited in a sense that we are finally doing something \nthat when I first ran for office back in 1990 I pledged to do, which \nwas to come here and try to balance the Federal budget. Not to put \nschemes out there that say, well, we will target this and we will \nadjust to this number when we get there, but actually pass a law that \nwill get us there without Congress having to do one more thing.\n  I think that is what we have accomplished here in this legislation. \nWe will pass the changes, the needed reforms, in the entitlement \nprograms that will get us to a balanced budget, that will save an \nestimated $270 billion over the next 5 years, will require no further \nFederal action other than just passing our appropriations bills under \nthe limits we have set, and we do a pretty good job at that. If there \nis anything I can say Congress has done in the past few years it is \nthat we have kept to the budget caps. I do not anticipate that being a \nproblem. In fact, I think many of us would advocate trying to come in \nbelow those caps. So I think this bill\n\n[[Page S8354]]\n\nwill accomplish what we set out to do, balance the budget by 2002. And \nhopefully, if we do not have any kind of major recession, we will be \nable to balance it sooner than 2002.\n  So, I am very excited about that. We have been able to face that \nproblem, and we have been able to deal with it in a responsible \nfashion.\n  I must admit, though, that I am somewhat disappointed at some of the \nthings we did not accomplish here that we, in fact, passed in the \nSenate bill. We took, I think, some courageous political stances here \nin the U.S. Senate in dealing with the issue of Medicare. The Senator \nfrom Oregon was talking about that just a few minutes ago, some of the \nchanges that were not made that he believed in. In fact, some of them, \neven though I notice he didn't support them, need to be made.\n  Senator Gramm, during the debate here on the budget last month, \ntalked about the demographic cliff that we are going to fall off in the \nyear 2011. I share that with you again this evening. In the year 1995, \nin fact for the years pretty much throughout the 1990's, roughly \n200,000 people will turn 65 per year--200,000 people. In the year 2011, \n1.6 million people will turn 65. That is just a cliff. That is 1.6 \nmillion people going into a system, no longer paying into that system, \ninto a system that today cannot absorb 200,000 a year. It is going \nbankrupt absorbing 200,000. We are asking that same system, that same \nprogram, to now absorb eight times the number, and that is not just a \nblip. It is not 1.6 million in the year 2011 and then back down to \n200,000. No; it's 1.6 million and then it levels off to about 1.5 \nmillion a year throughout the years of the baby boom generation and \ntheir retirement.\n  It has been estimated that if we don't change Medicare and Social \nSecurity in the next few years, the payroll tax will double within a \ngeneration. That is from 15 percent of every dollar that is earned in \nAmerica up to $60,000 for Social Security tax and 1.45--actually 3 \npercent if you take the employee and employer share for every other \ndollar, irrespective of income. We are going to have to double that \npayroll tax. That's an optimistic projection. Pessimistically, we will \nhave to triple the tax if we keep Medicare and Social Security just the \nway they are.\n  So, to the people who run around and say, ``We don't need to fix \nMedicare now, we don't need to fix Social Security now, everything is \nfine; those people who want to change Medicare and Social Security are \njust out to get the elderly,'' I would just suggest this: Anybody who \nis not talking about long-term structural changes to those two programs \nis out to get the elderly who are yet to be elderly, who are waiting to \nbe elderly, because those are the folks who are going to pay--and big. \nI think it is only fair that we spread this out a little bit and we \nbegin to make changes now.\n  The two major things I wanted to see done that were not done were, \nNo. 1, as the Senator from Oregon talked about, means testing part B \nbenefits. This is a chip shot. I mean, this is a layup. I can't think \nof any other term. This is an easy one. This affected about 4 percent \nof the population of seniors in this country who were the highest \nincome-earning seniors. What were we going to do? For Medicare, part A, \npart B--there are two parts to Medicare. Part A is hospitalization, \nmajor medical; part B covers some of the other things. It is a \nvoluntary program. It covers some outpatient, labs, doctors, things \nlike that. It's a voluntary insurance program. You don't pay one penny \ninto Medicare part B over the course of your earnings before you turn \n65. But when you turn 65 you can opt into this, in a sense, public \ninsurance program. It is voluntary. If you choose to get into part B, \nyou pay a premium. It is about $45 a month.\n  That $45 only covers 25 percent of the cost of the program. Who picks \nup the other 75 percent? Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer. That's fine if you are \na senior who needs subsidies from the Federal Government to be able to \nafford insurance, but in my mind it's not fine to give a subsidy to \npeople who don't need a subsidy. I am not someone who comes to the \nfloor on many occasions and talks about class warfare. I don't believe \nin that. I don't believe in a lot of the arguments that the rich don't \npay their fair share. I think a lot of it is just hooey, and in fact \nclass warfare.\n  What we are talking about here is we are talking about subsidizing \npeople at a higher income. I am not for that. I am not for taxing them \nmore, but I am not for subsidizing them, either. So, to the extent that \nwe subsidize, we said, ``Look, if you are earning over $70,000 as a \ncouple, you are going to pay a little bit more for your Medicare part B \npremium.'' It's still a good deal. It's a pretty big group, and you get \na nice group rate.\n  We should have done that in this bill. I can tell you, I have been to \nsenior center after senior center after senior center, and I have \ngotten up and I talked about this. I have never heard an objection. No \none has ever objected to this. They thought that's pretty reasonable. \nWe should not be subsidizing Ross Perot in his Medicare part B premium. \nIt's crazy. He doesn't need it. Most of these people don't need it, and \nthey probably wouldn't want it if they realized what it was costing the \nFederal Government to do it and what it was costing their children and \ngrandchildren. So that's one of the things we missed, in my opinion. \nIt's unfortunate.\n  The second--I know this is a tougher issue--and that is raising the \neligibility age for Social Security. I know this is not a very popular \nissue, but I can tell you we got 62 votes here in the U.S. Senate, I \nwill say very proudly, in a bipartisan vote. The eligibility age for \nSocial Security, to be able to qualify for full Social Security \nbenefits, is going up. Most people in this country don't know that, but \nit is. It is going up. In 1983, when they passed the Social Security \nreform, they did a couple of things. They raised taxes and they raised \nthe eligibility age from 65 to 67. They didn't start doing it, though, \nfor 20 years. The first people who turn 65 who are going to be affected \nby this raise in the eligibility age are people who retire in the year \n2003, 20 years after the bill passed.\n  You will hear the people who were here in the Congress who said, ``We \nwaited 20 years to enact this so people could prepare for this time.'' \nIt is funny, because I talked to a lot of people who are planning to \nretire who are about that age, in their fifties right now, who are \ngoing to be retiring, late fifties, retiring in 2003. Most of them \ndon't know the retirement age is being moved back. I talked to most \nyounger people, and they have no idea the retirement age is being moved \nback. These people, as far as I am concerned, who passed this thing in \n1983 and put it off 20 years, put it off 20 years because they will be \ngone in 20 years, most of them, and so they won't have to take the \nwrath of the American public, if there is going to be some. I hope \nthere will not be, once they understand the problem of having to deal \nwith the issue. I think we should deal with the issue now.\n  We should tie the Medicare eligibility age to Social Security, which \nphases up over a 20-year period. It doesn't hit 67 as a retirement age \nuntil the year 2025. We should tie the two together, because most \npeople, most lower and middle income people, are not going to be able \nto retire prior to being eligible for Social Security, so there should \nnot be much of a problem with tying in Medicare because they are going \nto retire when they hit the retirement age for Social Security. That \nwill also be the retirement age, in a sense eligibility age, for \nMedicare.\n  For those who can afford to retire sooner, they probably are more \nwell off, by and large, or they may have a disability. But in that case \nthey qualify for Government benefits through disability. But, for those \nwho are more well off, then we should create an option for them to buy \nin at age 65, they can buy into Medicare if they can't continue their \nprivate insurance.\n  There was a way to work this out that I think would have been, again, \nthe right thing to do for the long term for Medicare. If you really \ncare about providing a health safety net for the future, those were two \nthings that were really missed opportunities. It is unfortunate we \nmissed them.\n  I will say, overall, we have taken a positive step here. I think we \nmissed an opportunity to do something really lasting, really \nsignificant. We stood up and made a courageous vote, a vote that, \nfrankly--if Members would go out and take the time to talk to people \nand explain the demographic problems that we have, the fact that people \nare living substantially longer and they are substantially healthier, \nthat these kinds\n\n[[Page S8355]]\n\nof changes only make sense to make sure that future generations have \nthese retirement security programs like Medicare and Social Security to \nrely on for the future.\n  So, I am disappointed that we blinked, the White House was not \nsupportive, and frankly our colleagues in the House were not \nsupportive. I think that is unfortunate for both of those entities. I \nstand with particular pride at the U.S. Senate, that it had the courage \nto look ahead, to not make decisions just based on short-term fixes. \nFrankly, the Medicare provision here is a short-term fix. We had long-\nterm fixes in the Senate bill and we didn't follow through, and I think \nthat is unfortunate.\n  We did do a lot of other positive things in this bill, and I will \nsupport it as a result of that. But I think this piece of legislation, \ngiven what the Senate did in their courageous action by going out on \nMedicare and setting the course, missed a tremendous opportunity.\n  One final comment. There is an additional concern I have about a \nprovision in the welfare bill. There is welfare reform--or, in my \nopinion some of it is a backtracking on reform from the last bill. We \nhave some positive things in this bill with respect to work, but we \nalso have a provision in there that is very worrisome for me, as far as \nthe ability for work programs, workfare, to work in the States. This \ngives the President and the Department of Labor the opportunity to \ndesignate people on workfare in an employment setting as workers \ncovered by the Fair Labor Standards Act, the minimum wage laws, and all \nthe other laws that apply to all other employees. The problem with that \nis that you get into a whole host of complex things that drive up \nsignificantly the cost of providing a work slot for someone on welfare.\n  If you believe, as I do, that the most important thing for most of \nthe people on welfare today is to get them into the workplace, to teach \nthem the value of work, to give them the sense of pride which so many \nmillions of Americans for the first time are feeling now, to get off \nthe welfare rolls and get them into the workplace where they are doing \npositive works, where they are getting positive reinforcement for the \nthings that they are accomplishing, where they are learning the ability \nto get up, get their children off to school or to day care or to a \nrelative and get to work, keep those hours, work hard and come back \nhome and manage their life--those are important life skills. If we put \nthe barrier too high for the States, we are going to limit the number \nof work spots available for, really, millions of people and, I think, \ndestroy a lot of the tremendous progress that we have made in creating \nan environment under this welfare reform bill that we passed last year \nfor people to rise out of poverty, to get the kind of experience \nnecessary to get the sense of accomplishment and self-pride that is \nnecessary to rise out of poverty.\n  I am very concerned about that. I hope the administration does not \npull the trigger. They are getting immense pressure from the unions to \ndo so because the unions want to protect their piece of the pie when it \ncomes, particularly to the public sector spots that will be filled in \nsome cases by welfare recipients.\n  So, I hope the President does not bow to the unions at the expense of \nmillions of people who want to get out of welfare and who need these \nwork opportunities to be able to do so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/30/senate-section/article/S8314-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8355-S8356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent there be a \nperiod for the transaction of morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to discuss today a disinformation \ncampaign being conducted by indicted war criminal Radovan Karadzic and \nhis Bosnian Serb henchmen, a campaign which threatens our forces in \nBosnia, and a powerful tool available to the United States to \ncounteract that campaign.\n  Despite his agreement to remove himself from political life, Radovan \nKaradzic has continued to play a leading role in Bosnian Serb politics, \nrunning the Republika Srpska from behind the scenes. Moreover, he has \nused the Bosnia Serb controlled radio and television to present a \ndistorted picture to the Bosnian Serb people. Most ominously, since the \narrest of one secretly indicted war criminal and the killing of another \nby NATO forces in Prijedor in northwestern Bosnia on July 10, Karadzic \nand the state controlled media have been orchestrating attacks on NATO \ntroops.\n  As the New York Times reported on July 26, ``television and radio \nbroadcasts have been increasingly inflammatory.'' This distorted \npicture has been used to interfere with the implementation of the \ncivilian aspects of the Dayton peace accords. It has also been used to \nwage a smear campaign against Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic, \nwho sought to expose Karadzic's criminal activities that have brought \nhim wealth at the expense of the Bosnian Serb people.\n  Karadzic has shown himself to be a master of the ``no lie is too \ngreat'' approach. For example, when the Office of the High \nRepresentative, the senior international civilian position created by \nthe Dayton accords, recently announced a significant civil military \nproject that would involve the repair of the Tuzla to Brcko railway \nline by an Italian Railway Regiment with funding from United States \nAID, the state controlled Bosnian Serb media claimed that the repair \ntrain had been modified to transport Serb civilians to the Hague. A \nproject designed to improve the quality of life for all Bosnians in the \nregion was twisted to frighten the people and to foment ill-feeling \ntowards the Stabilization Force.\n  Mr. President, the influence of indicted war criminal Karadzic must \nbe checked. I believe that his control of the Bosnian Serb media is a \ngood place to start. The United States military has the capability \nthrough the EC-130E Commando Solo aircraft to broadcast television and \nradio programming directly to the Bosnian people, overriding Karadzic's \nprogramming. This capability was put to successful use during Operation \nUrgent Fury in Grenada to inform the people on Grenada of the United \nStates military action; during Operation Desert Storm to convince Iraqi \nsoldiers to surrender; and during Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti \nto broadcast radio and television to the Haitian citizens and leaders. \nIt could be used to get the true word out to the Bosnian Serbs.\n  I applaud the decision of the recent international donor's conference \nfor Bosnia to channel money only to communities that comply with the \nDayton peace accords. Republika Srpska has received only a small \npercentage of such aid in the past due to Karadzic's behind the scenes \nrefusal to cooperate. He has also mounted a media disinformation \ncampaign, accusing the international community of bias against the \nBosnian Serbs when his own policies are to blame. The Bosnian Serb \npeople need to hear the real causes for their isolation and lack of \ninternational aid.\n  Mr. President, paragraph 5 of article VI of the Agreement on the \nMilitary Aspects of the Dayton Peace Settlement gives the SFOR \nCommander the authority to do all that he judges necessary and proper \nto protect the SFOR and to carry out its responsibilities. I believe \nthat it would be appropriate for the SFOR Commander to determine that \nthe presentation of distorted reports about SFOR, the inflaming of \nemotions against SFOR, and the encouragement of reprisal action by the \nBosnian Serb media controlled by Karadzic and the ruling Serb \nDemocratic Party, are impeding the SFOR Commander's ability to protect \nSFOR and to carry out SFOR's responsibilities. Once the SFOR commander \nmakes that determination, the Air National Guard EC-130E Commando Solo \naircraft could be used to counteract Karadzic's disinformation campaign \nwhich so endangers our forces and hampers the implementation of the \nDayton accords.\n  Mr. President, I wrote last week to National Security Adviser Sandy \nBerger and Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen proposing the use of the \nCommando Solo aircraft under the circumstances we confront in Bosnia. I \nask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. I believe that, until the Bosnian people, particularly the\n\n[[Page S8356]]\n\nBosnian Serbs, are able to receive television and radio broadcasts that \ndepict the true reasons for their isolation and poor standing in the \ninternational community, it is less likely that meaningful progress \nwill be made in the implementation of the civilian aspects of the \nDayton accords.\n  Mr. President, the European Stars and Stripes reported last week that \nmany Bosnian Serbs have refused to accept copies of a free publication \ncalled the Herald of Peace that is handed out throughout Bosnia by \nSFOR. I am sure that they are reluctant to be seen accepting this \npublication for fear that they will be reported to Karadzic and his \nhenchmen. The beauty of Commando Solo is that its radio and television \nbroadcasts will go into the homes of the Bosnian Serbs where they can \nreceive it away from prying eyes. Karadzic can't stop the broadcasts--\nthey override his transmissions. It is time to put this valuable tool \nto work for peace in Bosnia and for the security of our forces.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 24, 1997.\n     Mr. Samuel R.

Mr. Berger: I am writing in connection with the lack \n     of progress in implementing the civilian aspects of the \n     Dayton peace accords, particularly the problem of war \n     criminals. I am deeply disturbed about the failure of the \n     Bosnian parties, particularly the Republika Srpska, to \n     cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of war crimes \n     and other violations of international humanitarian law as \n     required by Article IX of the General Framework Agreement for \n     Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n       Recent press reports regarding the influence of former \n     Bosnian Serb president and indicted war criminal Radovan \n     Karadzic, establish that his and his party's control of all \n     Bosnian Serb media, particularly Bosnian television, \n     consistently presents a distorted picture as to the cause of \n     the Republic's isolation and poverty.\n       Until the Bosnian people, particularly the Bosnian Serbs, \n     are able to receive television broadcasts that depict the \n     true reasons for their isolation and poor standing in the \n     international community, it is doubtful that any meaningful \n     progress will be made in the implementation of the civilian \n     aspects of the Dayton accords.\n       I am concerned that the local media's distorted reporting \n     is inflaming the situation in Republika Srpska and \n     encouraging the Bosnian Serbs to take reprisal action against \n     personnel of the Stabilization Force (SFOR), the \n     International Police Task Force (IPTF), and the Organization \n     for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). It seems to me \n     that those actions and other less dramatic, but improper, \n     actions by the Bosnian Serbs and their political leadership \n     are impeding the ability of the SFOR Commander to protect the \n     SFOR and to carry out its responsibilities under the accords.\n       Paragraph 5 of Article VI of the Agreement on the Military \n     Aspects of the Peace Settlement gives the SFOR Commander the \n     authority to do all that he judges necessary and proper to \n     protect the SFOR and to carry out its responsibilities. I \n     believe that it would be appropriate for the SFOR Commander \n     to determine that the presentation of distorted reports about \n     SFOR, the inflaming of emotions, and the encouragement of \n     reprisal action by the Bosnian Serb media controlled by \n     Karadzic and the ruling Serb Democratic Party, are impeding \n     his ability to protect SFOR and to carry out SFOR's \n     responsibilities.\n       The U.S. military has the capability through the EC-130E \n     Commando Solo aircraft to broadcast television and radio \n     messages to the Bosnian people. I strongly recommend that, \n     once the SFOR Commander makes the above determination, he be \n     authorized to utilize Commando Solo to conduct television and \n     radio broadcasts in Republika Srpska to inform the Bosnian \n     Serbs of the true facts.\n       It may also be necessary to take similar action with \n     respect to the other Bosnian parties. I fear that without \n     such action war criminals will not be brought to justice, \n     reconciliation will not take place, and the human and \n     material investment of the United States and its allies will \n     have been in vain.\n       I am sending a similar letter to the Secretary of Defense.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Carl Levin,\n     Ranking Minority Member.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 24, 1997.\n     Hon.

A bill to provide for the modernization of port and rail \naccess in northern New England, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n   the older industrial region rail/port access and modernization act\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Snowe to \nintroduce legislation to aid the growth of commerce throughout New \nEngland. The Older Industrial Region Rail and Port Access and \nModernization Act aims to improve northern New England's aging rail \ninfrastructure and ocean ports to speed delivery of goods and people \nthroughout the region.\n  New England was built by the railroads. But in our modern economy, \nhighways have captured a majority of the commerce, supplanting rail. As \nwe reach the end of this century, our region has begun to recognize the \nimportance of railroads, and their vital role in our expanding economy. \nEfficient highways run north to south in northern New England, but we \nhave no east to west roads sufficient to handle growing trade and \ncommerce. As Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine work together to compete \nin this global economy, our success is dependent on our mutual efforts \nto improve access to markets. We will succeed only if modern freight \nrailroads can serve the entire region and through our ports bring goods \nto market across the Nation and around the world.\n  Rail lines throughout northern New England have been neglected for \nmany years. Crumbling rail beds and constricted passage has limited the \nmovement of freight and passenger trains and restricted rail access to \ndeep water ports. Older bridges, deteriorated tracks, inadequate \ntunnels all contribute to a rail system that fails to fulfill the needs \nof the three-State area. As a result, commerce throughout the region \nsuffers.\n  A recent report by Cambridge Systematics, entitled ``New England \nTransportation Initiative,'' indicates that northern New England's \neconomy cannot fully expand without a carefully planned and implemented \nintermodal strategy. The study predicts that Maine's ports will \ngradually lose business to southern ports, primarily in New Jersey and \nNew York, because of inadequate rail transportation and port access. In \naddition, the study predicts that business and jobs in New Hampshire \nand Vermont will not keep pace with other regions without a better \nstrategy to efficiently move goods and people.\n  An exhaustive analysis by the Eastern Border Transportation Coalition \nregarding the trade and traffic flows across the eastern United States-\nCanada border projected a trade increase of close to 200 percent by the \nyear 2015. The report also outlines that this increase could be \nhampered by a lack of adequate transportation options and overcrowded \nroads and highway border stations. To avoid this setback, rail options \nmust be available. Without proper infrastructure development, New \nEngland's chance to take advantage of such economic growth will \ndiminish.\n  The legislation we introduce today will authorize Federal spending to \nrehabilitate rail beds in Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire, enabling \nthem to improve their freight rail traffic and better handle the \nmovement of goods and people with their borders. States will be able to \napply separately to the U.S. Secretary of Transportation for individual \ngrants. Grant funding is provided for a variety of categories: Port \ndevelopment and access; bridge and tunnel obstruction repair and \nreplacement; repair of railroad beds; and development of intermodal \nfacilities, including intermodal truck-train transfer facilities. \nRevitalization of these resources will allow freight and passenger \ntrains to move freely throughout the region, reconnecting railroad \ntowns long separated by the hazards of unpassable tracks.\n\n  The bill also establishes a loan assistant program. Railroad \ncompanies in Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire will be able to access \nlow interest loans to improve their rail lines in the region. The loans \ncan be used for purchase of rolling stock, development of maintenance \nfacilities, and many other capital improvements.\n  Without this legislation, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine may fail \nto benefit from future growth opportunities. Even though international \nshipping trade is expected to increase by 20 percent in the next 5 \nyears, New England is less likely to benefit from the influx of \nbusiness and jobs because of its decaying rail and port infrastructure. \nImproving rail lines will bring new life to our region, strengthening \nour industries and thereby our economies.\n  Mr. President, I would urge action on this legislation, because, as \nwe are learning, ports and railroads are the life lines that will help \nto ensure the well-being of all of northern New England.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague and good \nfriend, Senator Jeffords of Vermont, to introduce the Older Industrial \nRegion Rail/Port Access and Modernization Act.\n  There is an old Yankee saying ``you can't get there from here''. If \nwe do not take steps to upgrade our aging transportation infrastructure \nin order to allow us to be a vigorous competitor for the movement of \ngoods, that saying may become a sad reality. That is why the bill we \nintroduce today is so important to northern New England's future, \nbecause its purpose is to revitalize our aging rail infrastructure. As \nmuch as rail is a part of our Nation's history, it is also the pathway \nto a bright economic future.\n  The bill, which covers Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine, will \nprovide funding for improving and modernizing our freight rail system--\nremoving obstacles like low bridges that constrict the use of double-\nstack trains, and intermodal facilities construction and maintenance. \nIt would also provide funding to assist Maine's ports in updating and \nmodernizing their facilities\n\n[[Page S8362]]\n\nand rail transport access. This upgrading is particularly important as \nstudies have shown that Maine's ports are losing business to southern \nports because of inadequate rail transport and access.\n  Under the bill, an 80/20 Federal/State share grant program would be \ncreated. The States could use this money for first, connecting all \nrailroads to ports; second, removing, repairing or replacing bridges or \nother obstructions that inhibit the use of double-stack rail cars; \nthird, repairing, upgrading and purchasing railbeds and tracks and \nfourth, constructing, operating and maintaining intermodal truck-train \ntransfer facilities and train maintenance facilities.\n  Intermodalism is the future, as we have seen from the success of \nISTEA. I have seen it at the intermodal facility in my hometown of \nAuburn, ME. Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater visited the \nfacility earlier this year with me and other members of the Maine \ndelegation. After the visit, he told me that Auburn was a model \nfacility that he would use in his travels as an example of how well the \nconcept works when done correctly. Our bill will provide States with \nthe flexibility to encourage new facilities and to upgrade current \nones. It will provide our businesses with better, faster, more cost \neffective access to out of State markets and it will increase the \nviability of our three ports--Portland, Eastport, and Mack Point--by \nmaking them more attractive options for shipping and receiving goods.\n  More important is the basic fact that a modern transportation system \nis vital to any economic development. Our bill will allow the northern \nNew England States to upgrade their aging infrastructure to ensure that \nwe do not allow future economic development and growth to slip away \nbecause we cannot meet the transportation needs of business and \nindustry in the coming years.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROTH:\n  S. 1088. A bill to suspend temporarily the duty on ACM; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n           Legislation to Suspend Temporarily the Duty on ACM\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to suspend the \nduty through December 31, 1999, on a product commonly known as ACM or \n[3-(Acetoxy)-3-cyanopropyl] methyl-phosphinic acid butylester, which \nfalls under subheading 2931.00.90 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of \nthe United States. ACM is an essential ingredient in the production of \nglufosinate ammonium, a patented nonselective, broad-spectrum \nherbicide, manufactured by AgrEvo USA under the brand name Liberty and \nused primarily in corn and soybean cultivation.\n  The cost to import ACM currently comprises roughly 90 percent of the \ntotal cost of manufacturing glufosinate ammonium. Suspension of this \nduty will substantially lower AgrEvo's cost of production and thereby \nimprove the company's competitiveness.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Ford, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Harkin, \n        Mr. Inouye, Mr. Inhofe, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, Mr. Bryan and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 1089. A bill to terminate the effectiveness of certain amendments \nto the foreign repair station rules of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n               AIRCRAFT REPAIR STATION SAFETY ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce legislation designed to address aviation safety concerns \nwhich arise out of the proliferation of aircraft repair facilities \noutside the United States which are used by airplanes that fly within \nour Nation every day. This legislation would change current regulations \nso that U.S. aircraft are repaired to the maximum extent possible by \nprofessional U.S. mechanics, properly trained and supervised, using \ncertified parts. This bill also addresses the critical issue of \nsubstandard or uncertified airplane parts, known as bogus parts.\n  I am pleased to be joined by 10 of my Republican and Democratic \ncolleagues in introducing the Aircraft Repair Station Safety Act of \n1997, which is similar to a bill introduced by my colleague from \nPennsylvania, Congressman Borski (H.R. 145) which currently has 135 \ncosponsors.\n  A key focus for many of us in the 105th Congress is aviation safety. \nAs a member of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, I have \nworked with my colleagues to ensure that we spend the maximum amount \npossible on improving our aviation infrastructure for safety purposes, \nincluding altogether new runways, runway extension projects, and new \ngenerations of radar and landing systems. Air travel is an essential \nelement of our lives, as millions of Americans use airplanes for \npersonal and business trips. Our economy is deeply rooted in the \nsuccess of our aviation system, which makes it even more critical that \nwe take all necessary steps to enhance aviation safety.\n  This legislation is intended to address a regulatory loophole created \nin November, 1988, when the Federal Aviation Administration promulgated \nnew rules which weakened the restrictions on certification for foreign \naircraft repair stations. The 1988 changes have resulted in a situation \nwhere FAA certification--the highest seal of approval in the world--is \nmuch too easy to obtain. Prior to those changes, a foreign repair \nfacility had to demonstrate that there was a need to service aircraft \nengaged in international travel before they could get certified. But \nnow, a station can receive FAA certification for the simple goal of \nattracting U.S. business. I am advised that repair stations in Tijuana, \nMexico and Costa Rica applied for and received FAA certification even \nthough few expect these locations to become new hubs for international \ntravel. Instead, these facilities are becoming new hubs for stealing \nU.S. jobs and could potentially jeopardize aviation safety because of \ninadequacies in U.S. regulatory oversight.\n  One example of where work performed on an aircraft at a foreign \nfacility had significant repercussions within the United States was the \n1994 engine explosion and fire on a Valujet plane on the runway at \nAtlanta's Hartsfield International Airport, which necessitated the \nevacuation of the 57 passengers. According to media reports, the work \nwas done at a Turkish repair station that lacked FAA approval, and \nwhose shabby business practices included plating over a cracked and \ncorroded compressor disk. Had the explosion occurred in midflight, the \nresults could have been catastrophic.\n  When the 1988 regulations were adopted, the FAA expected that the \nnumber of foreign repair stations it certified would rise from the \nlevel of 200 to possibly 300 or 400. I understand that there are now \nnearly 500 such foreign aircraft repair stations with FAA \ncertification. This comes at a time, however, when the FAA is having \nenough trouble inspecting domestic repair stations and enforcing \naviation safety rules within facilities in the 50 States. I find it \nhard to believe that the FAA has sufficient resources to adequately \ninvestigate problems at the 480 foreign aircraft repair facilities in \naddition to its U.S. responsibilities.\n  I am advised that one recent phenomenon is that foreign repair \nfacilities are being used by some U.S. carriers on a contract basis as \na means of holding down costs, and some have become what have been \ntermed virtual airlines because so little maintenance and repair work \nis done in-house. Instead of aircraft repair work being done at \nrelatively few sites, countless contractors and subcontractors \ndomestically and abroad are now filling that function.\n  I would note that the Gore Commission on Aviation Safety and Security \nstated in its Final Report of February 12, 1997 that:\n\n       Considerable attention has been given to the issue of \n     outsourcing of maintenance and other work, particularly in \n     the wake of the Valujet crash. The Commission does not \n     believe that outsourcing, in and of itself, presents a \n     problem--if it is performed by qualified companies and \n     individuals. The proper focus of concern should be on the \n     FAA's certification and oversight of any and all companies \n     performing aviation safety functions, including repair \n     stations certificated by the FAA but located outside of the \n     United States. (Emphasis added.)\n\n  A problem is that under the current regulatory framework, foreign \naircraft repair stations have not had to demonstrate legitimate need or \nto meet all the standards and procedures imposed on U.S. stations. For \nexample, I am advised that domestic facilities and their employees must \nmeet rigorous worker\n\n[[Page S8363]]\n\nsurveillance standards including broad drug and alcohol testing \nrequirements. Many other nations seeking to compete do not have these \nsame requirements in place or the same level of enforcement. There is \nalso a discrepancy between the requirement that certain mechanics at a \nU.S. facility are certified airmen and the absence of such a mandate on \ncertified foreign repair stations. One would think that this \nrequirement is important enough to be imposed wherever a plane which \nflies within our borders is repaired and maintained. Accordingly, this \nlegislation provides that all standards imposed on domestic repair \nstations and their employees must be imposed on foreign facilities and \ntheir employees.\n  In sponsoring this legislation, I am not attempting to deprive U.S. \ncarriers of access to foreign repair facilities when necessary. \nStrategically based foreign repair stations have been part of our \naviation network since 1949, when it was recognized that such stations \nwere needed for the repair of U.S. aircraft operating outside our \nairspace. In addition, foreign manufacturers producing FAA-approved air \nframes or components have traditionally been allowed to support their \nproducts. Further, it is my intention that this legislation would not \nhinder the repair of U.S. aircraft abroad which do not operate within \nthe United States.\n  This legislation would not change these accepted practices, but would \ngive the FAA the opportunity to revisit this issue by returning the \nregulations governing the certification of repair stations to what they \nwere before November, 1988. This legislation is aimed at the \nproliferation of foreign FAA-certified repair facilities which exist to \nservice aircraft that, except for the cheap labor and lower regulatory \noversight, would never leave the United States.\n  This legislation would also clamp down on the possibility that \naircraft repair stations would knowingly use bogus parts instead of \nproperly certified parts. The bogus airplane parts trade has become \nlucrative and gives real cause for concern. The FAA and law enforcement \nagencies have cracked down in recent years, resulting in 130 \nindictments across the country as of May, 1997 of people suspected of \nbeing dealers of bogus airplane parts. In one troubling media account, \nwhen an American Airlines plane crashed in Colombia in 1995, salvagers \nextracted valuable components from the plane before even all the bodies \nwere collected and the parts were offered for sale in Miami shortly \nthereafter. Under this bill, if a facility is found to have knowingly \nused bogus parts, the FAA will revoke its certification.\n  In closing, I want to reiterate that the Aircraft Repair Station \nSafety Act of 1997 is a sensible approach to increased aviation safety. \nThis is more than just a jobs issue; peoples lives and our economy are \nat stake. At a time when the FAA's resources are stretched thin, I do \nnot believe it is in the public interest to continue to certify foreign \naircraft repair facilities which we cannot observe or regulate \nadequately.\n  I look forward to working with the members of the Senate Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation Committee on this issue, as well as the \ncarriers, both passenger and cargo, which operate under current \nregulations and whom I hope will support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS (for himself, Mr. Johnson, Mr. McConnell, Mr. \n        Grassley, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Helms, Mr. Daschle, \n        Mr. Cochran, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Inhofe, and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 1090. A bill to specify that States may waive requirements \nrelating to commercial drivers' licenses under chapter 313 of title 49, \nUnited States Code, with respect to certain farm vehicles, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                           waiver legislation\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I rise to correct an unintentional \nFederal burden that has been placed on a sector of our Nation's \nagricultural community.\n  The Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986 subjected operators \nof large trucks and buses to new regulations including the requirement \nthat States devise a commercial driver's license [CDL] program by April \n1, 1992.\n  The intent of this act was to improve highway safety by requiring a \nhigher level of qualification and knowledge for those engaged in \ncommercial trucking activities and was primarily aimed at addressing \nthe safety issue of over-the-road, long-haul truckers.\n  In 1988, the Federal Highway Administration [FHwA] granted States the \nauthority to waive the CDL requirements for farmers and others who \noperate large vehicles incidental to their occupations. States retained \nthe right to impose restrictions and conditions on those for whom the \nwaiver was applied.\n  Unfortunately, the CDL requirement continues to apply to many vehicle \noperators who are neither a highway safety hazard or engaged in \ncommercial trucking enterprises. Such is the case of those engaged in \nthe unique, seasonal business of harvesting the Nation's crops.\n  Custom harvesting is a service industry which, for a fee, provides \nfarmers the personnel and equipment necessary to harvest their crops; \nrelieving them of the need to invest, operate and maintain the costly, \nspecialized equipment which can only be utilized on a limited seasonal \nbasis.\n  Incidental to this service is providing the transportation equipment \nand drivers necessary to deliver those crops to on-farm or local \nstorage or processing facilities.\n  This service harvests nearly 60 percent of the Nation's entire wheat \ncrop from my State of Montana to Texas and many wheat growing States in \nbetween.\n  The vast majority of miles driven in providing this service are off-\nroad or on low traffic density rural roads and highways. Because of the \nunique nature of this business and the substantial investment in \nequipment, the owner-operator of these predominantly small, family-\nowned businesses devote a significant amount of time and resources to \nemployee training and safety education which is relevant to the service \nthey provide, rather than simply accepting the generally inappropriate \nstandards based on the urban-suburban driving needs requires for a CDL.\n  In addition, close supervision of the harvesting and transport \nactivities is provided both during the actual harvesting operations and \nthe movement of equipment from site to site.\n  Given the failure of the FHwA to acknowledge the unique \ncharacteristics of the custom harvesting business and to provide a \nreasonable waiver to States to determine an appropriate level of \nregulation for this industry, we are introducing legislation to provide \nStates the authority to grant an exemption from the CDL requirements.\n  This legislation does not mandate that those engaged in activities \nsuch as custom harvesting will be unregulated. It does provide those \nStates, who wish to do so, the opportunity to provide regulatory relief \nto an industry which is critical to the production of food and fiber in \nthis country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    June 26, 1997.\n     Hon. Conrad Burns,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Burns: Recently you received a letter from \n     Senator Conrad Burns and Tim Johnson requesting your co-\n     sponsorship of legislation to modify the Commercial Driver's \n     License (CDL) requirements for those engaged in custom \n     harvesting and processing of our nation's crops. The \n     membership of the undersigned organizations urge you to join \n     in supporting the legislative relief provided in their bill.\n       The Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1996, required \n     that states develop and implement a CDL program by April 1, \n     1992 and a drug and alcohol testing program in 1996. It was \n     intended to improve the safety performance of commercial, \n     over-the-road trucking enterprises. In recognition of the \n     unique nature of some trucking activities, the Federal \n     Highway Administration provided States the authority to waive \n     the CDL requirements for farmers, firefighters and others who \n     operate large vehicles as part of their day-to-day business, \n     but who were not engaged in commercial trucking. Individual \n     states retained the ability to develop conditions and \n     restrictions as part of the waiver process. Unfortunately, \n     the CDL requirements still apply to that sector of \n     agriculture which provides an important seasonal service by \n     harvesting this nation's food and fiber crops and delivering \n     the harvest to storage or processing for\n\n[[Page S8364]]\n\n     individual farmers. These businesses pose little safety \n     hazard, and are not engaged in hauling crops on a commercial \n     basis. Their operations predominantly require skills \n     associated with driving off-road or in low traffic density \n     areas. Unlike commercial trucking operations, the drivers \n     involved in the harvest are closely supervised both during \n     the harvest activities and those limited times when they must \n     utilize the nation's highway system to move from farm to \n     farm.\n       Harvesters and agriculture processors currently provide \n     education, training and experience for drivers that is \n     directly applicable to the conditions those drivers will face \n     throughout their employment. The CDL requirements force the \n     employer to also train their drivers so they can obtain a \n     license which is of little practical use in their workplace. \n     This dual burden is costly, time consuming and has reduced \n     the ability of the industry to find competent employees.\n       The legislation proposed by Senator Burns and Johnson does \n     not eliminate the CDL requirement for all drivers in all \n     states. It does, however, provide States the opportunity to \n     determine the appropriate level of regulation which should be \n     applied to this important segment of the agriculture \n     industry.\n       We urge you contact Senator Conrad Burns (Randall Popelka \n     224-2644) or Senator Tim Johnson (Sarah Dahlin 224-5842) and \n     join them in ensuring that custom harvesters and agriculture \n     processors are able to continue providing this safe, \n     professional, efficient and competitive service which \n     benefits all Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Farm Bureau Federation; National Barley Growers \n     Association, National Cotton Ginners Association; U.S. Custom \n     Harvesters, Inc.; National Association of Wheat Growers; \n     National Cotton Council, and the National Grain Sorghum \n     Producers Association.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 1091. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to provide for \nmaintenance of public roads used by schoolbuses serving certain Indian \nreservations; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n      THE INDIAN RESERVATION SCHOOL ROADS MAINTENANCE ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Indian \nReservation School Roads Maintenance Act of 1997. This bill, which is \nbeing cosponsored by my colleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, \naddresses a unique situation with respect to roads in and around Indian \nreservations and nearby counties that is actually preventing children \nfrom getting to and from school safely. Because of the unique nature of \nthis situation, it can only be addressed at the Federal level.\n  I would like to start with an example of this unique problem and why \nI believe a Federal solution is necessary. As you can see, Mr. \nPresident, this first chart is a map of the Navajo Reservation in New \nMexico, Arizona, and Utah. The Navajo Nation is by far the Nation's \nlargest Indian reservation, covering 25,000 square miles. To give you \nan idea of its size, there are 10 States that are smaller than this \nreservation. For instance, it is the same size as the State of West \nVirginia.\n  According to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, there are 9,000 miles of \nroads that serve the Navajo Nation. Only one-fifth of these roads are \npaved--the rest, over 7,000 miles, are dirt roads. The schoolbuses have \nto use nearly all of the 9,000 miles of roads each and every day to get \nthe kids to and from school.\n  About 6,400 miles of these roads on the reservation are BIA roads and \nover 2,500 miles are State and county roads. All public roads within, \nadjacent to, or leading to the reservation, including BIA, State, and \ncounty roads, are considered part of the Indian reservation road \nsystem. However, only BIA roads are eligible for Federal maintenance \nfunding from BIA, and generally, construction and improvement funding \nfrom the Federal Lands Highways Program in ISTEA is applied to BIA \nroads. On the other hand, States and counties are responsible for \nmaintenance and improvement of their roads.\n  Mr. President, the Federal Government is asking the States and \ncounties to bear too large a burden for road maintenance in this unique \nsituation, given the resources most of these counties have. For \nexample, counties around the Navajo Reservation are predominantly \ncomprised of Federal or tribal lands. Three-quarters of McKinley County \nin my State of New Mexico is either tribal or Federal land, including \nBLM, Forest Service, and military. This next map is of McKinley County, \nand as you can see, Mr. President, everything shown on this map that is \neither orange, yellow, green, or red, is tribal or Federal land. The \nIndian land area alone comprises 61 percent of the county. As you can \nsee, everything else is county land, which is a very small fraction of \ntotal land area. Therefore, there is a very small tax base on which the \ncounty can rely as a source of revenue for maintenance purposes. The \npicture for San Juan County in the northwest corner of New Mexico is \nvery much the same.\n  Mr. President, families living in and around the reservation are no \ndifferent from families anywhere else; their children are entitled to \nthe same opportunity to get to school safely and get a good education. \nHowever, the miles and miles of unpaved, deficient roads in this vast \narea are frequently impassable. If the schoolbuses don't get through, \nthe kids simply cannot get to school.\n  Of the 600 miles of county-maintained roads in McKinley County, 550 \nmiles serve Indian land. Because of the vastness of the reservation, \nthis is a cost that the counties in New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah \nsimply cannot and should not have to bear without Federal assistance. \nIndeed, because of the large tribal and Federal presence in these \ncounties, it is encumbent upon the Federal Government to provide this \nassistance.\n  What my bill does is set aside $10 million from the highway trust \nfund that counties such as these can apply for to help maintain the \nroads used by schoolbuses to carry children to school or to a Headstart \nprogram. Let me be very clear: these Federal funds can be used only on \nroads that are located within, or that lead to the reservation, that \nare on the State or county maintenance system, and that are used by \nschoolbuses.\n  Let me just state again, Mr. President, that maintaining schoolbus \nroutes in this vast area is a unique problem that only the Federal \nGovernment can effectively deal with.\n  I don't believe any child wanting to get to and from school safely \nshould have to risk or tolerate unsafe roads. Kids today, particularly \nin rural areas, already face enough barriers to getting a good \neducation. I ask all Senators to join with me in assuring that all \nschoolchildren at least have a chance to get to school safely and have \nan opportunity for an education. I urge all of my colleagues to support \nthis bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \nbill, a summary, a McKinley County Commission resolution, a letter from \nthe McKinley County road superintendent, David Acosta, and a letter \nfrom the Northwest New Mexico Council of Governments be included in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1091\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Jeff Bingaman,\n     Senator, New Mexico,\n     Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Attention: Mr. Steve Clemens\n       Dear Steve: McKinley County is responsible for the \n     maintenance of approximately 591.343 miles of roadway. \n     Approximately 450 miles consist of unimproved dirt roads. The \n     majority of roads serve as school bus routes for the Gallup-\n     McKinley County Schools, BIA Schools, and several private and \n     parochial schools. McKinley County is comprised of \n     approximately 5,454 total square miles, with approximately \n     61% of the land base classified as Native American and BIA \n     lands. McKinley County has approximately 540 miles of \n     maintained roads which provide access to and within the \n     Indian Reservation, Indian Trusts Lands, and Restricted \n     Indian Lands.\n       Our request is that the upcoming Intermodal Service \n     Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) legislation be modified \n     to provide greater flexibility in the use of ISTEA funds on \n     local roadways, or modify the upcoming reauthorized version \n     of ISTEA to establish a ``Rural Area Set Aside for Local \n     Roads''. McKinley County would benefit greatly if County \n     Government could become eligible under the Indian Reservation \n     Roads (IRR) set aside funding. Currently the funding consists \n     of $191 million dollars per fiscal year which is allocated \n     directly to Indian Tribes and BIA.\n       The current legislation prohibits the use of ISTEA Surface \n     Transportation Funds for any roads that are functionally \n     classified as local or rural minor collectors. Since \n     virtually all County roads fall under this category, counties \n     throughout the nation do not currently qualify for ISTEA \n     funding.\n       On behalf of all counties within New Mexico, we are \n     requesting that the reauthorization of ISTEA funding have the \n     specific language which will provide funding for County \n     Government.\n       If you have any questions or need further clarification, \n     please do not hesitate to notify me at (505) 722-7171. Thank \n     you for your assistance and support to McKinley County.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  David J.

(An \n     amendment to Section 1000 (a)(6) of the Intermodal Surface \n     Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991) The school bus routes \n     in northwest New Mexico, like much of the road network in the \n     region, are not well maintained. McKinley and San Juan \n     Counties public school systems, the BIA, and private schools \n     all provide educational opportunities to children on the \n     Navajo Reservation. The counties' school system, and school \n     bus route system is extensive, yet there are not adequate \n     funds to maintain school bus routes at the county level. \n     Other routes and counties in and around the Navajo \n     Reservation have these same problems.\n       This additional funding would allow the county school \n     systems to provide safe, adequate transportation of children \n     on the reservation to and from school.\n       Please contact me if you have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Patricia Lundstrom,\n                                               Executive Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 1092. A bill to provide for a transfer of land interests in order \nto facilitate surface transportation between the cities of Cold Bay, \nAK, and King Cove, AK, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation \nto benefit one of Alaska's most isolated regions, the Alaska Peninsula. \nThis bill, The Izembek Refuge Land Exchange Act, provides a balanced \napproach to a difficult problem. In this remote area, there is a small \nAleut Native village, King Cove, which is completely isolated from \nother Alaska cities and towns, and the rest of the world. The only way \nyou can get to King Cove is by air or sea. And in this part of Alaska, \nthe weather is so bad that neither sea or air is very reliable.\n  My bill will permit King Cove to be connected to the rest of the \nworld through a road link to Cold Bay, a regional center, and the \nlocation of a good, all weather airport which can provide year round \nand emergency medical evacuation for the residents of King Cove. \nCurrently, when somebody is injured or gravely ill, treatment is at the \nmercy of weather and sea conditions.\n  Mr. President, King Cove is a tough place to live and the residents \nare tough and independent people. Their ancestors migrated to this part \nof the State thousands of years ago and have made a life out of this \narea with its rich bounty of fish. But people get sick there just like \nany place in the country, emergencies happen there more than most other \nplaces in America because the lifestyle is so close to the edge.\n  We have had long debates in this body this year about access to \nhealth care. Nowhere does this take on a more dramatic meaning than in \nKing Cove. When I say access, I mean access. That means the actual \nphysical ability to get to a hospital in Anchorage or Seattle to get \nthe specialized health care needed in the event of a serious emergency \nor sickness. Right now, the residents of King Cove do not have this \naccess. Since 1981, 11 air crash fatalities have occurred flying \nresidentS from King Cove to Cold Bay. Numerous other crashes have also \noccurred, luckily without fatalities.\n\n[[Page S8366]]\n\n  Many of these crashes involved flying injured or sick people out of \nKing Cove in an attempt to get emergency care. Often the trip to care \nis as dangerous as the infliction itself. For example, in 1981, a \nmedivac plane was forced to leave King Cove for an emergency/life and \ndeath rescue mission. There was no alternative to this flight and the \nplane crashed. Four people died including the pilot and the medivac \nvictim. Six years ago another fatal crash occurred with six people \nkilled. The list goes on.\n  This is a terrible place to have to fly out of if you cannot afford \nto wait. On medical emergencies, nobody can afford to wait. These \nresidents are predominantly Alaska Natives, Aleuts for the most part. \nThey have a good Alaska Native hospital available to them in Anchorage. \nIn fact, thanks to this body, it is a new hospital with great \nfacilities. But it might as well be on the dark side of the Moon for \nthe residents of King Cove. When they need it, they can't be sure they \nwill be able to get to it.\n  This legislation provides the solution by allowing ground access to \nan all-weather runway only 30 miles from King Cove in Cold Bay. In \nfact, thanks to World War II, Cold Bay has the third longest runway in \nthe State. The runway has modern all weather equipment such as \ninstrument landing systems and many other modern landing system \nimprovements. In the past 4 years, the Cold Bay airport has seen only \none instance in which air traffic from Anchorage could not land. It is \nsafe to say that air operations can occur here in virtually all weather \nand can accommodate the King Cove emergency needs at all times. With no \nroad between King Cove and Cold Bay there will be no hope for those \nseeking help. My bill would provide a land exchange that will permit \nthe road to be built between King Cove and Cold Bay. This is the \nreasonable solution.\n  Mr. President, there is a need for this road, but there will be \nconcerns raised because most of that road will be sited through the \nIzembek National Wildlife Refuge. This is unavoidable. The refuge is \nlocated completely astride the route between King Cove and Cold Bay. \nThis is nobody's fault, and I know that the Fish and Wildlife Service \nhas concerns. I also have concerns and my constituents and I are \nprepared to do what it takes to minimize the impact of this road on the \nsurrounding area and resources.\n  The King Cove Corp. has proposed an exchange for valuable wetlands it \nowns near the refuge for the road right of way. The bulk of the right \nof way is already owned by King Cove as an inholding in the refuge. \nOnly 7 miles is not owned by King Cove and this is the Federal land \nwhich would be exchanged under my bill. That portion is in the \nwilderness portion of the refuge, but there is no alternative to this \nexcept further danger to my constituents and the inevitable death and \ndestruction to future victims of the next air crash.\n  Mr. President, I stand ready to work with the Fish and Wildlife \nService to make this as constructive process as possible, but make no \nmistake, it is absolutely critical that this road be built. My \nconstituents deserve a way to save their lives in times of emergency. \nThey cannot be hostage to fear for life and limb.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n\n  S. 1093. A bill to extend nondiscriminatory treatment (most-favored-\nnation treatment) to the products of the Lao People's Democratic \nRepublic, and for other purposes; to the Committee on finance.\n\n\n   LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC MOST- FAVORED-NATION LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, along \nwith Senator McCain, to extend nondiscriminatory treatment most-\nfavored-nation treatment to the products of the Lao People's Democratic \nRepublic. To avoid confusion, let me say at the outset that this bill, \nif enacted into law, would not give Laos special tariff treatment but \nrather put it on a par with the vast majority of our trading partners. \nThis bill is identical to H.R. 2132, introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by Congressman Crane. The administration strongly \nsupports this bill.\n  Recognizing the importance of a free market economy to economic \ngrowth and development, Laotian political leaders, in the late 1980's, \nmade a fundamental decision to abandon Laos' centrally planned economic \nsystem and adopt free market reforms. Since taking this decision, the \nLaotian Government has embarked upon a constant process of reform. Over \n90 percent of the 600 state-owned enterprises have been privatized. The \nforeign investment code, first adopted in 1989, was further liberalized \nin 1994 to make it consistent with World Trade Organization [WTO] \nstandards. Laotian tariffs have been consistently reduced. An import-\nexport regime consistent with WTO standards has been legislated. In \n1995 an intellectual property, patent and trademark protection law was \nenacted. Laos has complied with International Monetary Fund guidelines \non fiscal policy, instituted making reforms, and is following stringent \nfiscal management to reduce inflation.\n  In recognition of these developments, the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations [ASEAN] admitted Laos as a member this month. The Laotian \nGovernment is now revising its laws and regulations, as necessary, to \nbe consistent with ASEAN and ASEAN free trade agreement requirements.\n  The United States and Laos have also taken steps to improve bilateral \neconomic relations. Last year, an OPIC agreement was successfully \nnegotiated. The U.S. Trade Representative's Office and Laotian \nofficials are currently negotiating a bilateral trade agreement, which \nwill also meet WTO standards.\n  Reform in the economic area has been accompanied by major political \nchanges as well in Laos. All but three political prisoners from the \nSoutheast Asian war era have been released. In 1990 the Laotian \nGovernment adopted a constitution and bill of rights based on \nprinciples enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. In fact, American \nlawyers, serving as consultants, played a major role in writing these \ndocuments. Nationwide elections by secret ballot in 1992 led to the \ncreation of a new National Assembly. Although still a one-party state, \nit is worth noting that individual candidates did not have to be \nCommunist Party members to run in the elections, and in fact, several \nmembers of the assembly are not Communist Party members. The Laotian \nGovernment is also making a concerted effort to enhance the \nindependence of the judiciary.\n  The United States and Laos have established good working relations, \nparticularly on two issues of great importance to us--POW/MIA and \ncounter narcotics. Extending MFN to Laos makes sense economically, in \nterms of the Laotian commitment to economic reform, and in terms of our \noverall bilateral relationship.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1093\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION I. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Lao People's Democratic Republic is striving to \n     shed centralized government control of its economy in favor \n     of market-oriented reforms;\n       (2) extension of unconditional most-favored-nation \n     treatment would assist the Lao People's Democratic Republic \n     in developing its economy based on free market principles and \n     becoming competitive in the global marketplace;\n       (3) establishing normal commercial relations on a \n     reciprocal basis with the Lao People's Democratic Republic \n     will promote United States exports to the rapidly growing \n     Southeast Asian region and expand opportunities for United \n     States business and investment in the Lao People's Democratic \n     Republic economy;\n       (4) United States and Laotian commercial interests would \n     benefit from a commercial agreement between the United States \n     and the Lao People's Democratic Republic providing for market \n     access and the protection of intellectual property rights;\n       (5) economic reform in the Lao People's Democratic Republic \n     is increasingly important as that country integrates into the \n     ASEAN free-trade area and accedes to the World Trade \n     Organization; and\n       (6) expanding bilateral trade relations that include a \n     commercial agreement may promote further progress by the Lao \n     People's Democratic Republic on human rights and democratic \n     rule and assist that country in adopting regional and world \n     trading rules and principles.\n\n[[Page S8367]]\n\n     SEC. 2.

RESOLUTION REPORTED BY THE \n                     COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS\n\n  Mr. HELMS, from the Committee on Foreign Relations, reported the \nfollowing original resolution; which was placed on the calendar:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 46\n\n       Whereas on July 30, 1997, two terrorist bombs exploded \n     almost simultaneously in an open air Jerusalem market, \n     killing at least 18 people, and wounding more than 100, and\n       Whereas this attack is a violent and vicious attack against \n     the peace process and against the people of Israel: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress--\n       (1) Expresses the deep condolences of the Congress and the \n     American people to the people of Israel for the loss of life \n     and the serious injuries that have been suffered in the \n     terrorist bombing in the Jerusalem market and expresses the \n     solidarity of the American people with the people of Israel \n     in the wake of this tragic and senseless act;\n       (2) Expresses the determination of the Congress to join \n     with the government of Israel in fighting against terrorism;\n       (3) Urges Yasser Arafat and officials of the Palestinian \n     Authority to do more to combat terrorism and to eliminate \n     terrorist networks in areas under their control;\n       (4) Calls on Yasser Arafat and officials of the Palestinian \n     Authority to cooperate more intensively with the Israeli \n     government in fighting terrorism; and\n       (5) Reaffirms the commitment of the United States Congress \n     to peace in the Middle East and urges all parties to work \n     together to bring an end to terrorism and to promote lasting \n     peace and security in the region.\n\n                 the reprehensible bombing in jerusalem\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, this morning, the Foreign Relations \nCommittee approved and sent to the Senate an original resolution--\nSenate Concurrent Resolution 46--condemning the terrorist attack in \nIsrael at 1:15 p.m. Wednesday afternoon, Israel time, when two \nterrorists entered a market in the center of Jerusalem and blew \nthemselves up, killing at least 12 Israelis, and leaving 120 wounded, \nat least 20 of whom are described in critical condition.\n  Mr. President, the reason for this attack was probably yesterday's \nannouncement that the peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians \nwere about to resume. Clearly, the terrorists decided to try to derail \nthe peace process by murdering innocent people.\n\n[[Page S8368]]\n\nThey perhaps have succeeded, because the peace process, Mr. President, \nis meaningless if there is no security for the people of Israel.\n  It is reported that Yasser Arafat telephoned Prime Minister Netanyahu \nto apologize for the bombing. He has had ample practice in issuing \napologies and regrets for Palestinian attacks on Jews. But rhetoric is \ncheap. The question all of us must ask is: ``Has Yasser Arafat done \nwhat it takes to rid the territories under his control of terrorists?'' \nThe answer to that is obvious: no.\n  The United States has done a great deal, too much, some contend, to \nsupport the Palestinian Authority. What has the Authority done to crack \ndown on terror? Not nearly enough. Palestinian police officials are \nimplicated in murders; terrorists are operating freely in areas under \nthe Palestinian Authority's control.\n  Now dozens of innocent people lie dead and wounded. Not soldiers. Not \nmilitary or police personnel. Just innocent people--mothers, fathers, \nchildren. There is no peace in this process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/30/senate-section/article/S8367-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          SENATE RESOLUTION 110--RELATIVE TO THE SENATE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Warner) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit for the \nRecord a concurrent resolution passed by the Michigan Legislature \nearlier this year. Recognizing the impact of ozone transport on the \nwest side of the State, and understanding the potentially devastating \neffects of ill-considered regulations, the Michigan House of \nRepresentatives and the Michigan Senate adopted a resolution which \nurges the EPA to reaffirm the previous standards of ozone and \nparticulate levels.\n\n[[Page S8374]]\n\n  Specifically, this resolution strongly urges the EPA to maintain the \n.12 parts per million standard for ozone and conduct all necessary \nresearch to reach conclusive findings on questions concerning \nparticulate matter measuring 2.5 microns in diameter and larger. In \naddition, this resolution asks the EPA to identify any unfunded \nmandates or other administrative and economic burdens for State and \nlocal governments or agencies that would result from the proposed \nchanges to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.\n  Unfortunately, this bipartisan request has been ignored. The EPA has \ngone forward with new regulations. After making only minor \nmodifications to the EPA proposal, the administration announced the \nfinal standard 2 weeks ago. I am disappointed, because I was hopeful \nthe President would recommend a policy that recognized the importance \nof clean air, and the importance of jobs and economic growth. However, \nsince he did not, I will continue to work hard to highlight the \nimportance of these very real, very serious issues.\n  This resolution makes clear that the people of Michigan understand \nwhat is at stake in this debate. I wish the same could be said of the \nadministration.\n  The resolution follows:\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 11\n\n       Whereas, the United States Environmental Protection Agency \n     (EPA) has a responsibility to review periodically the \n     National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone and \n     particulate matter (PM); and\n       Whereas, The EPA is considering establishing a more \n     stringent ozone standard and a new, more stringent standard \n     for particulate matter at or below 2.5 microns (PM2.5); and\n       Whereas, Michigan, through its local jurisdictions, \n     businesses, and citizens, has supported health-based National \n     Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) that are premised on \n     sound science; and\n       Whereas, Michigan has made significant progress in meeting \n     current NAAQS for both ozone and particulate matter (PM) \n     under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, although there \n     are some areas that have not yet come into compliance with \n     the current standard(s); and\n       Whereas, Michigan, through its local jusidictions, \n     businesses, consumers, and taxpayers, has become considerable \n     cost to come into compliance with the current NAAQS for ozone \n     and participate matter; and\n       Whereas, The proposed new standards will significantly \n     expand the number of nonattainment areas for both ozone \n     particulate matter. This may result in additional emission \n     controls in all areas, thus imposing significant economic \n     administrative, and regulatory burdens on Michigan, its \n     citizens, businesses, and local governments; and\n       Whereas, EPA's own Clean Air Science Advisory Committee \n     (CASAC) was unable to find any ``brighline'' that would \n     distinguish any public health benefit among any of the \n     proposed new standards for ozone, including the current \n     standard; and\n       Whereas, There is very little existing PM2.5 monitoring \n     data; and\n       Whereas, There are many unanswered questions and scientific \n     uncertainties regarding the health effects of particulate \n     matter, in particular PM2.5, including:\n       Divergent opinions among scientists who have investigated \n     the issue;\n       Exposure misclassification;\n       Measurement errors;\n       Lack of supporting toxicological data;\n       Lack of a plausible toxicological mechanism;\n       Lack of correlation between recorded PM levels and public \n     health effects;\n       Influence of other variables; and\n       The existence of possible alternative explanations; and\n       Whereas, No scientific proof exists that establishing a \n     more stringent ozone standard or a new, more stringent PM2.5 \n     standard would avoid alleged adverse health, but it would \n     assuredly impose significantly higher costs; and\n       Whereas, The issue of transported volatile organic \n     compounds is not adequately addressed; now therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     concurring). That we advise and strongly urge the EPA to \n     reaffirm the existing NAAQS for ozone; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we advise and strongly urge the EPA to \n     reaffirm the existing NAAQS for PM10; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we advise and strongly urge the EPA to \n     refrain from establishing a new NAAQS for PM2.5 at this time \n     and to gather the necessary PM2.5 monitoring data and conduct \n     all necessary research needed to address the issue of \n     causality and other critical and important unanswered \n     scientific questions concerning PM2.5; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we advise and strongly urge the EPA to \n     identify any unfunded mandates or other administrative and \n     economic burdens for state or local governments or agencies \n     that would result from the proposed changes to the NAAQS for \n     ozone and particulate matter, and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the Untied States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, the members of the Michigan congressional \n     delegation, the administrator of the United States \n     Environmental Protection Agency, and other appropriate \n     administration officials.\n       Adopted by the House of Representatives, March 11, 1997.\n       Adopted by the Senate, March 12, 1997.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/30/senate-section/article/S8373-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n VFW INITIATIVE TO PROVIDE LONG-DISTANCE PHONE SERVICE TO HOSPITALIZED \n                                VETERANS\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate \nthe members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States for \ntheir program called Operation Uplink. Through private donations, the \nVFW has been able to distribute more than 11,000 hours worth of free \nlong-distance calling time to hospitalized veterans and active duty \ntroops overseas who might not otherwise be able to talk with their \nloved ones back home. Since I represent a State which especially honors \nnational service and has the most combat veterans per capita, you can \nbe sure that this is an issue I care about deeply.\n  Shortly after I joined the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I \nlearned that none of our country's veterans' hospitals had bedside \nphones. Patients had to collect change to use at a pay phone, or wait \nfor a nurse to wheel a portable phone into their room. Not only did \nthis inconvenience patients greatly, it added to the burdens of an \nalready overworked nursing staff.\n  We all realize that a phone is more than a modern convenience; it is \na lifeline to the outside world for a sick veteran. That is why I \nfought for, and won, $1.5 million in 1993 to support the work of the \nbedside phone project, P.T. Phone Home, in West Virginia and elsewhere.\n  A couple of years ago when I was in West Virginia visiting the \nClarksburg VA Medical Center, I spoke with a World War II combat \nveteran, Kenneth Getz. Mr. Getz had been experiencing serious medical \nproblems, but he was much more concerned about his blind wife than his \nown health. He told me, ``We start the day with a phone call and end it \nwith a phone call. Phones should have been in here years ago.'' And he \nis exactly right--we have an obligation to make certain that every \nveteran receives the same quality care you or I would want for \nourselves.\n  Unfortunately, too many poor veterans are not able to take advantage \nof the bedside phone service, since for many, home is not a local call \nfrom the hospital. The thought of a sick or wounded veteran, lying in a \ndistant veterans' hospital, cut off from family, children and friends, \nis very troubling to me. It is plain wrong.\n\n  I highly commend the VFW for recognizing this problem and taking \naction. We know that in the long run, veterans who can talk to their \nspouse or children are not only happier, but also have higher morale, \nand that can go far in improving their health. I can just envision the \ncomforting effect on a patient like Mr. Getz in having the opportunity \nto talk to his son in Houston or wife in Charleston--all of this made \npossible by the VFW initiative.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in extending a warm \nthank-you to the VFW and its members all across America. I am \nespecially pleased to note that this service is being provided by \nprivate donations, thus protecting the already beleaguered Federal \nbudget. This project is a tribute to the many veterans who believed in \nthe principles of freedom and democracy strongly enough to risk their \nlives in the name of freedom. By providing prepaid phone cards to sick \nvets and overseas troops, the VFW truly ``Honors the dead by helping \nthe living.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/30/senate-section/article/S8374-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8374-S8375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONGRATULATIONS TO YOUSIF GHAFARI\n\n  MR. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my warm \ncongratulations to Mr. Yousif B. Ghafari who is celebrating the 15th \nanniversary of Ghafari Associates.\n  The economic success in Michigan is due in no small part to the \ninvigoration of small businesses like Ghafari Associates. Over the past \n15 years Ghafari Associates has risen to be the third largest \narchitectural and engineering firm in the State. This incredible \nachievement is largely due to\n\n[[Page S8375]]\n\nthe outstanding leadership capability and business savvy of its \nfounder, Yousif Ghafari.\n  I have the pleasure of personally knowing Yousif and appreciate his \ndedication, not only to the business world but to his family and \ncommunity as well. Yousif's exemplary duty and service to the community \nat large has earned him the great respect of his colleagues, friends, \nand family. I would like to join them in commending him for his \ndedication to seeing Ghafari Associates grow into one of Michigan's \nmost distinguished and respected engineering firms.\n  The State of Michigan is very fortunate to have Mr. Yousif Ghafari \namongst its citizens, and should be very proud of his accomplishments. \nI would like to conclude by extending to him my best wishes for much \nsuccess in all of his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/30/senate-section/article/S8374-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      NATIONAL WOMEN'S BUSINESS COUNCIL AND WOMEN-OWNED BUSINESSES\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I want to speak today about the \nwork the National Women's Business Council [NWBC] is doing in my State \nand the work they do for the country in the interest of women-owned \nbusinesses. I want to make special note of the efforts of one of \nGeorgia's shining examples of entrepreneurship. Mr. President, Carolyn \nStradley started out filling in potholes with asphalt and from that has \ngrown a small business that is now responsible for work done in both \nthe Olympic Stadium and the Georgia Dome. In addition to successfully \ncompeting in a male dominated business world, she is literally paving \nthe way for other women to find opportunities into the work force \nthrough the creation of small businesses.\n  Yesterday morning Carolyn moderated a workshop that provided a forum \nto discuss, develop, and find consensus on policy recommendations which \nenhance women business owners access to capital and credit at every \nstage of business growth. This forum was part of 10 workshops being \nheld at Federal Reserve Banks and branches across the nation. The top \n10 recommendations from each of the 10 workshops will be compiled into \na report and presented to Congress and the President by the NWBC. The \nparticipants of these workshops include women business owners, bankers \nand other lenders, government representatives and other experts who \nwork daily to develop financial strategies that are so essential in \ngetting small businesses off the ground.\n  Mr. President, I want to commend the NWBC for their work and their \ncontinued efforts as an independent source of advice and counsel to the \nCongress, the President and the Small Business Administration. Their \nmission is to promote bold initiatives, policies and programs designed \nto foster women's business enterprise as well as an economic \nenvironment conducive to business growth and development for women-\nowned businesses. The council has focused on four key areas: (1) \nexpanding public and private market opportunities for women-owned \nbusinesses; (2) promoting the development of a research agenda and data \ncollection on the women's business sector and public awareness of its \ncontributions; (3) strengthening the networking capabilities of women \nentrepreneurs and the technical assistance and training infrastructure; \nand (4) expanding the financial resources available to women business \nowners and ensuring their access to them.\n  I believe that it is particularly fitting that the NWBC does have \nthis focus and I would point to a few important figures, just in \nGeorgia alone, that would support this. Mr. President, as of 1996 there \nare nearly 204,000 women-owned businesses in Georgia employing over \n622,000 people and generating over $87 billion in sales. During the \nperiod of time from 1987 and 1992, the National Foundation for Women \nBusiness Owners estimates that the number of women-owned firms in \nGeorgia has increased by 112 percent, employment has grown by 334 \npercent and sales have risen 508 percent. In 1996, women-owned firms \naccounted for 36 percent of all Georgia firms, and provided employment \nfor 34 percent of Georgia workers, and generated 24 percent of the \nState's business sales. Finally, I am proud to point out that Georgia \nranks fifth in growth in the number of minority women-owned firms as of \n1996--a 227 percent increase between 1987 and 1996.\n  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to support and fund \norganizations like the National Women's Business Council. Small \nBusinesses are the foundation of our Nation's economic engine and small \nbusinesses are the future continued economic growth and \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/30/senate-section/article/S8375-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      OECD SHIPBUILDING AGREEMENT\n\n Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, as the Senate moves toward concluding \nits business before the August recess, I would like to take this \nopportunity to clarify the circumstances surrounding the Finance \nCommittee's consideration of legislation to implement the OECD \nShipbuilding Agreement.\n  This vital agreement has already been the subject of a hearing in the \nFinance Committee in December 1995, and, in May 1996, the Committee \nvoted unanimously in favor of the legislation to implement the \nAgreement.\n  I understand my Finance Committee colleagues, Senators Lott and \nBreaux, have made substantial progress in resolving the controversial \nissues surrounding some parts of the legislation originally reported by \nthe Finance Committee. I expect that their work on the implementing \nlegislation and the resolution of certain procedural issues will be \nconcluded shortly so that we can complete committee consideration and \ncongressional passage of this bill as soon as possible after we return \nin September.\n  I trust the other signatory countries to the Shipbuilding Agreement \nwill understand that the recent delay in the Finance Committee's \nconsideration of the implementing legislation was unavoidable--that it \nwas simply a result of the committee's need to complete its work on the \nhallmark legislation to balance the U.S. budget and need to resolve \ncertain parliamentary questions. This delay should in no way be \ninterpreted as a lack of resolve to bring the OECD Shipbuilding \nAgreement implementing legislation to closure.\n  I strongly urge other signatory countries not to take any action that \nmight forever compromise our long-held goal of achieving free and fair \ntrade in the global shipbuilding sector. It is my view that the United \nStates is very close--closer than it has ever been--to enacting the \nlegislation necessary for completion of U.S. ratification of the \nagreement. It would be terribly counterproductive and inappropriate for \nother signatory countries to abandon this important agreement at this \njuncture in reaction to this relatively minor and unavoidable delay.\n  With that clarification, I look forward to working with my colleagues \non the Finance Committee and in the Senate as a whole in moving this \ncritical legislation forward to ultimate passage by Congress as quickly \nas possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/30/senate-section/article/S8375-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8375-S8378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CHINA TRIP REPORT\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, over the last Memorial Day recess, \nI visited South Korea, Japan, North Korea, China, and Hong Kong, on an \nofficial Finance Committee trip.\n  Today I am entering into the Record the first half of a trip report I \nrecently filed with the Committee, and tomorrow I will include the \nsecond half, dealing with China and Hong Kong. I hope the Senate will \nfind it of use.\n  The material follows:\n\n Asia Trip Report--Covering Visits to South Korea, Japan, North Korea, \n                Beijing, and Hong Kong, May 24-31, 1997\n\n\n                      I. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY\n\n       A. Itinerary--Over the 1997 Memorial Day recess, between \n     May 24th and May 31st, I made a week-long trip to East Asia \n     to host a three-day conference in Beijing entitled ``Working \n     With America: Food Security and International Trade,'' put on \n     by the Mike and Maureen Mansfield Center for Pacific Affairs \n     and the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with \n     Foreign Countries.\n       With the authorization of the Senate Committee on Finance, \n     I visited South Korea, Japan, North Korea and Hong Kong as \n     well as Beijing to discuss trade, security, agricultural and \n     humanitarian problems in Asia. This report will inform the \n     Senate on the substance of my discussions, particularly on \n     food and security in Korea; China's application to enter the \n     World Trade Organization; and Hong Kong's transition to \n     China's sovereignty.\n       B. Goals--As I see it, our country has three long-term \n     interests in Asia. First, preserving the peace which is \n     critical to our national\n\n[[Page S8376]]\n\n     security and is also the foundation of Asia's current \n     prosperity. Second, opening markets and creating more \n     reciprocity in trade relations with Asian countries. And \n     third, raising the quality of life and promoting long-term \n     political stability by advancing human rights, fighting crime \n     and protecting the environment. My goal on this trip was to \n     understand more fully the immediate issues we must address in \n     order to secure these long-term interests, and to advance if \n     possible our policy goals on these issues.\n       In 1997 and 1998, the issues I believe most critical to \n     securing these interests will be: (1) the security and \n     humanitarian problems on the Korean peninsula posed by hunger \n     and economic decline in North Korea; (2) China's application \n     to enter the World Trade Organization; and (3) Hong Kong's \n     transition to Chinese sovereignty. Thus, while I discussed \n     issues ranging from food security to human rights, US-China \n     security relations, environmental protection and agricultural \n     trade with Korea, I concentrated on the first three issues.\n\n       C. Conclusions--I finished the trip feeling that current \n     American policy on these issues is well conceived and well \n     implemented. While I have differences with some of our \n     specific positions and will mention them further on in the \n     report, I believe that in general, we are on the right track.\n       In Korea, we are deterring conflict, preventing nuclear \n     proliferation and providing humanitarian assistance as \n     appropriate.\n       On China's WTO application, we rightly support China's WTO \n     membership on a commercially appropriate basis, and are \n     working with the other WTO members to make sure that while \n     China understands we are not trying to block membership on \n     political grounds, we also expect them to live up to the \n     fundamental obligations of all WTO members.\n       And on Hong Kong's transition, we seem to have secured the \n     direct US interests; we are in close contact with all the \n     political actors and economic interests involved in the \n     transition; and we are appropriately active without being \n     confrontational on political and human rights issues.\n       All of these questions are highly complex. The Korean \n     situation, in particular, is dangerous and becoming more so \n     as North Korea's economy declines. All of them will demand a \n     great deal of informed attention from Congress and the \n     American public, as well as from the Executive branch and our \n     diplomats and military leaders in the region. But on the \n     basis of my visits, I am generally pleased with our policies \n     and impressed with the people implementing them.\n\n\n                          II. KOREAN PENINSULA\n\n       A. Visit--The Korean peninsula was the first stop on my \n     trip. I arrived in Seoul on Sunday, May 25th, spent the next \n     day in discussion with South Korean national security and \n     agricultural officials, representatives of the US business \n     community, and with American diplomats and military \n     personnel. On the morning of May 27th I departed for \n     Pyongyang, where I met with Foreign Ministry and Agriculture \n     Commission officials, departing for Beijing the morning of \n     the 28th. I also had the opportunity to discuss Korea later \n     in the trip with Chinese political and military leaders, and \n     with two senior officers of the Japan Self-Defense Forces \n     during a refueling stop at Misawa Air Force before arrival in \n     Pyongyang.\n       My purpose, in addition to discussing bilateral \n     agricultural trade issues with South Korean leaders, was to \n     look into the security and food questions we face on the \n     Korean peninsula. I concluded that American policy with \n     respect to these issues is well-conceived. We have a highly \n     capable military force on the peninsula, which works together \n     with South Korea in the Joint Command. Our political policies \n     are carried out in tandem with South Korea, with the apparent \n     endorsement of the neighboring countries. And we are \n     providing food aid as the World Food Programme identifies the \n     areas of need.\n       There is, no doubt, room for improvement. In particular, we \n     could be speeding up our provision of missile defense for \n     Seoul. North Korea's need for food aid may well increase this \n     summer and require a higher-level effort. And while we seem \n     to be in full agreement with neighboring countries on the \n     contingencies we hope to avoid (i.e. war, nuclear \n     proliferation, or sudden collapse into anarchy in the North), \n     we do not appear to have grappled with our long-term positive \n     goals for the Peninsula. But on the whole, I believe that we \n     are confronting a very dangerous situation and doing it well.\n       The following sections will evaluate the food situation in \n     North Korea; review the opinions offered by South Korean, \n     Japanese and Chinese officials on policy toward the Korean \n     peninsula; evaluate U.S. policy; and provide a first-hand, if \n     brief and incomplete, look at life today in Pyongyang.\n       B. Food Crisis--I discussed reports of food shortages in \n     North Korea with U.S. diplomats and agricultural specialists; \n     South Korean Agriculture Ministry officials; North Korean \n     Foreign Ministry and Agriculture Ministry officials; and \n     Chinese leaders. I had also asked to meet World Food \n     Programme experts in Pyongyang, but was unable to do so.\n       My conclusion is that we can think of the food issue as a \n     three-part problem. First, over the next few weeks North \n     Korea will need humanitarian assistance. Second, this need is \n     likely to reach crisis proportions over the summer of 1997. \n     Third, North Korea needs to make some fundamental changes in \n     its agricultural and military if it is to feed itself in the \n     long term. I see little evidence that the government is \n     prepared to do so.\n       1. US and South Korean Assessment--Most U.S. and South \n     Korean experts believed the majority of North Koreans \n     continue to receive basic subsistence rations, feeling the \n     North Korean government continued to distribute some basic \n     rations and some more food was available in small farmer \n     markets. In more remote rural areas, however, hunger is \n     probably very severe. This situation is likely to worsen \n     soon, however.\n       Over the year as a whole, the U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture forecast a shortfall of about 1.2 million metric \n     tons of rice. To put the figure in context, USDA's estimate \n     of a year's consumption of food in North Korea is 5.4 million \n     metric tons. South Korean estimates were similar.\n       US and South Korean experts also agreed on the cause of the \n     food shortages. While floods may be an immediate cause, long-\n     term factors--loss of aid from Russia and China at the end of \n     the Cold War, failure to make rural reforms, and spending of \n     25%-30% of GDP on the military--are much more important. A \n     South Korean agricultural official noted very simply that \n     North Korea uses its oil for military exercises rather than \n     to make fertilizer or run tractors, and thus the agricultural \n     sector has been short of energy throughout this decade. \n     Chinese officials from Manchuria tell him, he said, that \n     since 1991 North Korea has conducted a propaganda campaign \n     calling for ``two meals a day for the glorious unification of \n     the peninsula.''\n       2. North Korean Views--The North Korean officials appeared \n     to realize they face an emergency. Foreign Ministry Officials \n     spoke in general terms about food problems and North Korea's \n     appreciation of foreign assistance. Agriculture Commission \n     officials, led by Vice Chair Madame Kim Yong-suk, provided a \n     highly detailed statistical review of recent flood damage, \n     reclamation work in paddy fields, and overall food shortages.\n       According to Mme. Kim, the most pressing need for food aid \n     will be quite soon. Spring planting had gone well, and in the \n     absence of new flooding the fall harvest would be good. \n     However, she said, ``in July and August we will face a very \n     tense situation,'' and in the interim North Korea ``would \n     accept with pleasure 1 million tons of assistance.''\n       This recognition of an immediate crisis was not matched by \n     any realistic appraisal of the causes of the present food \n     crisis or of North Korea's long-term policy needs. Both the \n     Foreign Ministry and Agriculture officials attributed the \n     food crisis solely to flood damage in the last two years. The \n     only long-term effort they said was necessary was a \n     reforestation program to reduce erosion.\n       3. Policy Conclusions--North Korea is clearly in dire \n     straits. While I did not travel outside the capital (because \n     of time constraints rather than North Korean unwillingness), \n     US and South Korean experts provided accounts of severe food \n     shortages which I consider credible. Their views were \n     generally in accord with the accounts of North Korean \n     officials, international food experts, and recent travellers \n     outside Pyongyang including Rep. Tony Hall and several \n     journalists.\n       Up to now we have provided $25 million in humanitarian food \n     aid. South Korea, China and Japan have also made \n     contributions. Our diplomats believe the WFP is capable of \n     providing assistance without significant diversion to the \n     North Korean military, and I see no reason to question that \n     assessment.\n       My own strong opinion is that, as a humanitarian matter we \n     should provide short-term food aid to people proven to need \n     it. This will be most urgent this July and August. However, \n     longer-term aid or large-scale involvement in the North \n     Korean agricultural and industrial economy should only be \n     done in concert with South Korea, and should not proceed \n     without willingness on the part of the North to address the \n     basic economic and military issues that have caused this \n     crisis.\n       C. Security on the Korean Peninsula--Despite North Korea's \n     economic and food difficulties, US military officers and \n     diplomats along with South Korean officials stress that it \n     continues to pose a severe military threat to South Korea and \n     Americans stationed in the South. It maintains a million-man \n     army in a population of 23 million; spends 25-30% of its GDP \n     on the military; and stations about 65% of its troops, and \n     most of its artillery and rocket launchers in offensive \n     positions very close to the Demilitarized Zone. Our response \n     has come in two main forms.\n       1. Deterrence--The foundation of all US policy toward the \n     North is strategic alliance with South Korea to deter North \n     Korean military aggression. We have done this through \n     permanent stationing of 37,000 American troops in South \n     Korea, and complete cooperation in a Joint Command with South \n     Korea.\n       Up to now, deterrence has succeeded. US military officers, \n     including Supreme Commander Gen. John Tilelli, said that \n     relations with the South Korean military are very good. South \n     Korean officials agreed. Both sides emphasized the importance \n     of continuing to work very closely together on military \n     preparation, and also in any negotiations with North Korea. \n     All agreed that if the North Korean industrial and \n     agricultural economy continued to decline--as it seems very \n     likely to do in the absence of any reform--the North Korean \n     government would become more desperate and the military \n     situation would become more dangerous.\n       Finally, I should mention that military officers had some \n     concerns about quality-of-\n\n[[Page S8377]]\n\n     life issues for American soldiers, but felt that construction \n     of new barracks under the last two Military Construction \n     appropriation bills would help a great deal.\n       2. Nuclear Proliferation and the Agreed Framework--A \n     corollary to our broader defense strategy in Korea is \n     opposition to proliferation of nuclear weapons. These would \n     not change the ultimate outcome of any conflict, but would \n     raise its cost in human life, physical destruction and \n     environmental damage enormously.\n       Since 1994, we have attempted to prevent nuclear \n     proliferation through the ``Agreed Framework.'' Under this \n     agreement, North Korea agreed to freeze its nuclear program \n     while we supply 500,000 barrels of oil and over a longer term \n     replace the heavy-water nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, north of \n     Pyongyang, with light-water reactors whose products cannot be \n     used for weapons. Our military people and diplomats feel that \n     North Korea is complying with this part of the agreement. I \n     have no reason to disagree, and believe we should continue \n     with the Agreed Framework.\n       While I will address political issues and negotiating \n     proposals later on, I should note here that the Agreed \n     Framework also calls for progress toward political and \n     economic normalization of relations between the US and North \n     Korea. North Korean officials, including the Foreign \n     Minister, complained repeatedly about the slow pace of \n     normalization with the US and our failure to lift sanctions, \n     saying this had increased North Korean ``suspicions'' about \n     US intentions and reliability. However, the Agreed Framework \n     also includes a commitment to North-South dialogue aimed at \n     reducing political and military tension between the two \n     Korean governments. North Korea has not done this. American \n     action on the political side of the Agreed Framework must \n     depend on North Korean willingness to begin North-South \n     dialogue.\n       3. Conclusions--I was extremely impressed by our military \n     officers and enlisted people. I believe our strategy is \n     appropriate and our coordination with South Korea is close. I \n     would add only one point. I heard many times about the \n     vulnerability of Seoul to North Korean missile, rocket and \n     artillery fire. If we can ease that by providing some missile \n     defenses to Seoul, we should do it as soon as possible.\n       D. Political Issues and Negotiations--Progress toward \n     normal political relations, relaxed trade sanctions or \n     assistance beyond short-term humanitarian aid, must result \n     from talks leading to reduced military and political tension \n     on the peninsula. These must address first and foremost the \n     basic issue of North Korea's threats and aggressive military \n     posture vis-a-vis South Korea, but can include North Korean \n     concerns as well. And they must not lead to any separation of \n     the US from South Korea, nor any unnecessary political \n     conflicts with China, Japan or Russia.\n       1. Four-Party Talks--Last year, President Clinton proposed \n     ``four-party talks'' on Korean issues including South Korea \n     and North Korea along with the US and China as the two \n     principal belligerent powers in the Korean War. These could \n     address North Korean concerns about trade, economics and \n     other issues as well as the concerns we and South Korea have \n     about security. Based on my discussions in Seoul, Pyongyang \n     and Beijing, I remain convinced this is the best approach to \n     Korean security issues. Recent progress toward these talks \n     bears out this conclusion.\n       2. North Korean Views--I repeatedly urged the North Korean \n     Foreign Ministry officials to open a North/South dialogue as \n     the Agreed Framework requires, and to begin four-party talks \n     with South Korea, China and the US.\n       Foreign Minister Kim Yongnam and Vice Foreign Minister Kim \n     Gye Gwan were my main interlocutors on this issue. The Vice \n     Foreign Minister gave a peculiarly weak and unconvincing \n     reason for North Korea's failure to engage in a North-South \n     dialogue, saying North Korean public opinion had been \n     offended when President Kim Young-sam of South Korea failed \n     to offer condolences on the death of former President Kim Il-\n     sung in 1994. He did, however, state support in principle for \n     North-South dialogue, and neither he nor the Foreign \n     Minister, however, ruled it out after the election of \n     South Korea's new President this December.\n       Both the Foreign Minister and the Vice Foreign Minister \n     raised concerns about the four-party talks proposal, mostly \n     questioning the reason why China should be involved. They \n     also insisted that the US was following a hostile policy by \n     continuing to impose sanctions and an overall trade embargo \n     on North Korea. They did not, however, insist on large-scale \n     food or economic aid as a precondition for entering the four-\n     party talks.\n       3. The Chinese Role--As the largest local military power \n     bordering on North Korea, and as a government with \n     traditional ties to North Korea, China has very large \n     interests in the Korean issue and will play a key role in any \n     solution to it.\n       American officials in Seoul and Beijing generally felt that \n     China is acting responsibly and helpfully. South Korean \n     officials agreed. In a more general sense, they said they \n     were satisfied with the state of South Korean-Chinese \n     relations, and hoped US-China relations would remain \n     ``harmonious.''\n       North Koreans, by contrast, seemed indifferent to China. \n     They did not encourage Chinese participation in four-party \n     talks--to the contrary, in fact, they called for a ``3+1'' \n     formula with China playing an unspecified but clearly minor \n     role. One official, commenting on the overall political \n     situation of the Korean peninsula, said ``the directly \n     involved parties are the DPRK and the US, and we acknowledge \n     that the South has some indirect concerns. China is not \n     concerned.''\n       E. Japanese and Chinese Views--During my trip, I met with \n     senior policymakers in Beijing about Korean issues, and \n     discussed Korean policy with two senior officers of the Japan \n     Self-Defense Forces. A brief summary of these conversations \n     follows.\n       1. Japanese Views--At Misawa Air Force Base I met with Gen. \n     Akihiko Hayashi and General Minoru Hoso, of the Northern \n     Command of the Japan Self-Defense Forces. These discussions \n     were brief given our limited time, and concentrated on \n     Japan's security role rather than on Japan's particular \n     political concerns about its kidnapped citizens and the \n     recent apprehension of a North Korean ship loaded with \n     amphetamines at a Japanese port, or its broader political \n     views on Korean issues. Japan is deeply concerned about North \n     Korea's deployment of a new generation of medium-range \n     missiles capable of targeting Japan, and working closely with \n     us on attempts to deter conflict on the peninsula.\n       2. Chinese Views--The senior political leaders, Foreign \n     Ministry officials and military officers I met in Beijing \n     were quite interested in my visit to Pyongyang, and asked \n     about my physical impressions of Pyongyang and the \n     discussions I had with North Korean officials. None raised \n     any basic objections to US policy toward North Korea.\n       On the political issues, their general view was that Kim \n     Jong-il is a rational person who understands that, in the \n     words of one Chinese officer, ``to attack the South would be \n     the act of a madman,'' and is unlikely to engage in any \n     serious provocation. Further, they believe he is in firm \n     control of the North, and that no political upheaval is \n     likely in the short-term despite the food and economic \n     problems.\n       With respect to economics and the food situation, Chinese \n     said they were unsure whether North Korea's problems resulted \n     from floods or from ``poor economic organization.'' They said \n     they would help with food needs ``within China's capacity.''\n       Finally, all the Chinese with whom I raised the Korean \n     issue said that China's influence over North Korea is \n     limited; that China would act with the goal of maintaining \n     peace and stability on the Korean peninsula; and that China \n     viewed the four-party talks proposal favorably. US diplomats \n     generally agreed that China is acting very constructively on \n     these issues. I believe it is essential that we continue to \n     work with China on the four-party talks proposal.\n       F. Long-Term Issues--Opinions were divided as to North \n     Korea's long-term prospects.\n       Americans and South Koreans tended to believe that the \n     North was fairly resilient, that Kim Jong-il is in firm \n     control of the government, and that could probably continue \n     along its present path for several years. However, objective \n     indicators pointed to a situation which is not sustainable \n     indefinitely, and many felt that some abrupt collapse or \n     desperate military assault on South Korea was possible. \n     Chinese agreed that Kim Jong-il was firmly in control of the \n     country, but felt more certain than US or South Korean \n     sources that North Korea would remain politically stable.\n       Many people commented that South Koreans did not feel the \n     German model of unification was ideal--it had been very \n     expensive and difficult for the German economy to absorb, and \n     they preferred a ``soft landing'' for the North followed by a \n     longer transition. However, few seemed to have a vision of \n     how to make this possible, and a number of Americans \n     commented that a ``soft landing'' did not seem very likely.\n       North Korean officials gave essentially ideological \n     explanations of why their country would emerge from the \n     present ``arduous march'' and recover economically. The Vice \n     Foreign Minister, for example, said that while many \n     foreigners spoke of North Korea as ``a broken airplane and \n     some say it will soon collapse . . . my country is not going \n     to collapse at all. We have the wise leadership of the Great \n     Leader Comrade Kim Jong-il, and the entire people rally \n     around in general and single hearted unity. We have a guiding \n     ideal which is different from the USSR or Eastern Europe, and \n     that is the juche [self-reliance] idea.''\n       G. Personal Assessment of Pyongyang.--Finally, a visit to \n     Pyongyang is unusual, and apart from the policy issues, my \n     personal impressions of the city may be of some interest.\n       I arrived in North Korea on a specially arranged U.S. Air \n     Force flight, which entered North Korean airspace at the \n     Russian border on North Korea's far northeast, proceeded \n     along the coast and then crossed over a mountainous area to \n     Pyongyang. From the air, as far as I could tell, the fields \n     and rice paddies look in bad shape and rivers show severe \n     siltation.\n       We proceeded from the airport (we landed at 12:20 p.m.; at \n     least one radar was turned off, and no other planes appeared \n     to be active) by car to Pyongyang. We were able to drive \n     around the center of the city on the way to several meetings, \n     and took an unaccompanied 15-minute walk from the hotel to \n     the city railway station and back. This relatively short \n     experience revealed a city which resembles a ghost town--I \n     can only compare it to my visit to Phnom Penh in 1979, just \n     after the Vietnamese Army had expelled the Khmer Rouges.\n\n[[Page S8378]]\n\n       We saw very few cars, few trucks or buses, and no sense of \n     normal business or economic activity at all. Streets were \n     almost empty, and no economic activity was apparent--I saw no \n     people engaged even in waiting in lines at stores. The people \n     we did see appeared in reasonably good physical health, \n     although listless and low on energy. This applied to the many \n     (but not well-armed) military people I saw on the street as \n     well as to the civilians. And the physical plant of the city \n     is clearly deteriorating. Electricity was spotty in our \n     hotel, in surrounding buildings and on the streets. A number \n     of trucks and buses appeared to be rusting and out of use, \n     and a trolley car was essentially abandoned near the hotel \n     with its back wheels off.\n       In preparing for this stop, I anticipated a highly \n     repressive state. I expected poverty and perhaps visible \n     signs of hunger, although I had been told this was less \n     likely in the capital than in rural regions. And I expected \n     constant surveillance. What I did not expect was the almost \n     empty, eerie quality of Pyongyang. Clearly, the country is in \n     dire straits. While I cannot speculate on North Korea's long-\n     term prospects with any authority, it is hard to imagine that \n     they can sustain their current domestic and military policies \n     indefinitely.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/30/senate-section/article/S8375-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  OPENING OF THE NEW NATIONAL AIRPORT\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, over the past 2 weeks, and \nculminating with ceremonies this past Sunday, the Metropolitan \nWashington Airports Authority opened the new terminal at National \nAirport.\n  This $450 million state of the art facility is just one element of a \n$2 billion capital development plan at both Washington National and \nDulles International Airports, made possible by the creation of the \nMetropolitan Washington Airports Authority only 10 short years ago.\n  To understand the significance of this achievement, one only needs to \nrecall what it was like to use either Washington National or Dulles \nInternational during the late 1970's and early 1980's.\n  Both airports were owned by the Federal Aviation Administration, and \nCongress was absolutely unwilling to appropriate more than the bare \nessential amount necessary to operate either facility.\n  National Airport was in a grave state of disrepair, and Dulles was \ncalled the great white elephant.\n  Looking upon these airports as integral parts of the areas economy \nwas unfathomable, and the notion of customer service was even more \nunimaginable.\n  Then, thinking in the region began to change.\n  Encouraged by the desire of the Reagan administration to re-examine \nthe proper role of Federal Government, area business leaders and \nmembers of the Virginia congressional delegation started asking the \nquestion: Why not divest the Federal government of these two airports, \nand let them be run like a business?\n  Fortunately, there was a Secretary of Transportation whose response \nto the question was: Why not indeed!\n  Not about to be discouraged by enormity or ambitious nature of the \ntask, that Secretary of Transportation, Elizabeth Hanford Dole, \nenlisted the assistance of a very able and influential statesman, \nformer Virginia Governor Linwood Holton, who worked tirelessly to help \nmold both a plan, and the consensus to transfer ownership of the two \nairports to a non-Federal authority.\n  This authority was authorized under an interstate compact to operate \nthe airports and to raise the money necessary to renew National \nAirport, and to make Dulles the economic dynamo its creators once \nenvisioned.\n  Following a very tortuous and uncertain course through the \nlegislative process, a bill was finally placed on President Reagan's \ndesk for signature, and in 1987, the Metropolitan Washington Airports \nAuthority took control of the two airports.\n  Under the stewardship of James A. Wilding, and the leadership of a \nten person board comprised of appointees from Virginia and Maryland and \nthe District of Columbia, the Airports Authority designed a capital \ndevelopment plan which relied on the sales of bonds financed by future \nrevenues.\n  This capital development plan became the catalyst enabling the \nMetropolitan region to achieve its dream.\n  Today, Dulles International Airport is a major force in the growing \nhightech and biotech economy of the region, and with the opening of the \nnew National terminal last Sunday, the region now has a world-class \ndining, shopping, and transportation facility to welcome the more than \n15 million passengers who come to the Nation's capital from cities \nwithin a 1,250 mile perimeter of the airport.\n  In fact, it is this perimeter, combined with a limitation on the \nnumber of flights that can arrive and depart from National Airport each \nhour, and a curfew on stage two aircraft after 10 P.M., that maintains \nthe political and economic balance enabling National Airport to serve \nshort-haul passengers, while Dulles International serves long-haul \npassengers from across the United States and around the world.\n  Without these tools, the community would be in a literal uproar over \nthe noise and volume of air traffic at Washington National Airport, and \nDulles would still be the white elephant it was in the 1970's and early \n1980's.\n  Needless to say, the region's economy would be nothing like it is \ntoday had the vision of Secretary Dole, area business leaders and \nVirginia's Congressional delegation not been realized.\n  So, Mr. President, it is with gratitude that I salute all the \nthousands of people who helped make this dream come true.\n  Especially I thank the present and former members of the Metropolitan \nWashington Airports Authority board of directors including Linwood \nHolton, Ron Linton, and Robert Tardio; the staff and management of the \nAirports Authority including James A. Wilding, general manager, August \nMelton, manager of Washington National Airport, and Keith Merlin, \nmanager of Dulles International Airport; and architect Cesar Pelli and \nall the construction personnel who turned Mr. Pelli's designs into a \nliving, working masterpieces.\n  Congratulations to all. Job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/30/senate-section/article/S8378-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO THE SAVANNAH INTERNATIONAL TRAINING CENTER AND THE OLYMPIC \n                           SOLIDARITY PROGRAM\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to praise the \naccomplishments of the Olympic Solidarity Program and its partnership \nwith the Savannah International Training Center, the only recognized \nathletic training venue in the United States whose athletes are funded \nby the International Olympic Committee. This scholarship program has \nbrought athletes from Africa and South America to Georgia, continuing \nthe spirit of the 1996 International Olympic games by giving \nopportunities to athletes from developing countries.\n  The Savannah International Training Center is the largest Solidarity \nTraining Center in the world. The Solidarity Program provides athletes \nwith funds for room and board, education, visas, transportation and \ntraining costs. In June 1996, 25 Olympic Solidarity Athletes arrived in \nGeorgia from countries such as Zimbabwe, Rwanda, and Colombia to \nparticipate in the outstanding track and field program. The facility \nhopes to be able to expand its programs to include weightlifting, \nswimming, and soccer. Essentially, the Solidarity Program provides \nathletes with a unique experience like no other in the United States or \nin the world.\n  This program not only enhances the quality of life for the athletes; \nthe Olympic Solidarity Program has provided the community of Savannah \nand the State of Georgia with an international experience comparable to \nthe 1996 Olympic games. Exposure to the variety of cultures existing \namong the participating countries allows the citizens of Savannah to \ndevelop stronger ties with these nations and improve foreign \nrelationships.\n  The Savannah International Training Center continues to thrive and \ngrow, exemplifying Georgia's commitment to the success of international \nathletics and the spirit of the Olympics. It is with great pride that I \ncongratulate the Savannah International Training Center, the city of \nSavannah, the International Olympic Committee and the athletes involved \nfor contributing to the unparalleled success of this distinguished \nprogram in the United States and for continuing the Olympic legacy in \nthe State of Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/30/senate-section/article/S8378-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8378-S8379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNITION OF BETTY GREGOIRE\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, Today I stand before you to recognize \na truly\n\n[[Page S8379]]\n\nunique individual and personal friend for her exemplary service to my \nhome State of Missouri at the time of her retirement. Betty Gregoire, \nhas lived in Kansas City, Missouri for the past 24 years during which \nshe has been a wife and mother, a volunteer and a public servant. Betty \nhas shown the kind of lifelong devotion to her State that make it an \nhonor to commend her for her many years of civic contribution.\n  After receiving a B.S. Degree from State University of New York, she \ntaught in Long Island Elementary Schools and in Rochester, New York \nHigh School System. Betty came to Weatherby Lake, a community near \nKansas City, in 1973 and by 1980 had established a position as Manager \nof the Prosecuting Attorney's office. Later she became the \nAdministrative Assistant to the County Commission.\n  In addition to her service on the Weatherby Lake Improvement Board, \nas secretary, Legislative Committee, Missouri Assessor's Association, \nshe was appointed by Governor John Ashcroft to fill the term of \nAssessor in 1985 and continued to serve for three terms.\n  Now part of the Finance Committee of St. Teresa Catholic church in \nParkville, Betty is also a member of the Mid American Regional Council \n(MARC) Board and has held the position of Treasurer and 2nd Vice-\nPresident.\n  Betty was appointed by the Governor in 1986 to the Missouri Job & \nEmployment Council then reappointed in 1992, and was District 3 \nDirector of Missouri Association of Counties from 1991-94.\n  As an active member of several other civic organizations, Betty is an \nexample for her fellow Missourians. I commend Betty for her many years \nof service and I am glad to say that the State of Missouri is enriched \nwith her wisdom and leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/30/senate-section/article/S8378-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF PAKISTAN\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the people of \nPakistan on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of their \nindependence. In August of 1947, Pakistan gained its independence from \nthe British Empire. For the past fifty years, the people of Pakistan \nhave shared with the people of the United States a common interest in \nthe establishment of democracy. In recent years, Pakistan has \nreasserted its committment to democratic government and is deserving of \nboth our recognition and our support.\n  The friendship between the United States and Pakistan goes back many \nyears. In the mid-1950's, Pakistan and the United States joined \ntogether in a security agreement to resist Soviet expansion in South \nAsia. In late 1955, Pakistan joined the South East Asia Treaty \nOrganization and the Central Treaty Organization, demonstrating \nPakistan's committment to the Free World. This commitment proved \ninvaluable during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, as our two \nnations united in opposition to Soviet aggression. Without a doubt, a \nclose, constructive friendship between the United States and Pakistan \nhas been essential to the security of both nations.\n  Beyond the affairs of state, there are the economic and cultural \nexchanges which spur growth and development and enrich the lives of our \nnations. In 1996, the total value of U.S. trade with Pakistan was $1.3 \nbillion. Pakistan has recently embarked on an ambitious economic reform \nprogram to jumpstart the economy of Pakistan and provide the necessary \nfoundation for free and fair trade. The United States should support \nthese efforts, as Pakistan has the potential to one day become a model \nfor the newly independent states of West and Central Asia.\n  Pakistani-Americans are a vibrant part of American cultural and \neconomic life. Across the nation, Pakistani-Americans share their \nknowledge and heritage with other Americans, contribute to our economy, \nand create homes and neighborhoods which are a vital contribution to \nthe American dream.\n  And so, on this the fiftieth anniversary of the independence of \nPakistan, I rise to honor the people of Pakistan and their commitment \nto forge a free and democratic society. I look forward to many years of \ncontinued friendship between the people of Pakistan and the United \nStates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/30/senate-section/article/S8379-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   INCREASING INCOME FOR THE DISABLED\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of S. \n1054. This legislation, introduced by Senator Cochran, gives greater \nopportunity to disabled workers.\n  In a nation professing to honor and reward hard work, I find it \ndistressing that individuals able and, more importantly, willing to \nwork do not receive all the benefits they are entitled to. Presently, \ndisabled individuals can maintain Social Security benefits only if they \ndo not earn a substantial amount. For the disabled, this amount is $500 \nper month, or $6000 per year. Blind individuals, however, are able to \nearn nearly twice as much without diminished benefits; nearly $12,000 \nper year. This discrepancy is wrong.\n  During the 104th Congress, the Senate acted on legislation expanding \nsenior citizens ability to work. The Senate passed the ``Senior \nCitizens' Right to Work Act of 1996'' by unanimous consent. This \nlegislation, which I was proud to support, allows seniors to retain \nmore of their Social Security benefits even if they continue to work. \nBy the year 2002, seniors will be able to earn up to $30,000 in outside \nincome without penalty. I see no reason why the Senate can extend the \nearnings limit to seniors and the blind, but does not extend the \nability for greater income to the disabled. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation and correct this outstanding \ndeficiency.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/30/senate-section/article/S8379-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8379-S8380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            SPECIAL COORDINATOR FOR U.S. POLICY TOWARD TIBET\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today the New York Times reports \nan important advance in United States diplomacy. Secretary of State \nAlbright has agreed to appoint a special coordinator to oversee \nAmerican policy toward Tibet. This brings to fruition the vision of our \nbeloved former chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator \nPell, who introduced a bill (S. 2554) at the end of the 103d Congress \nto establish a position in the Department of State to coordinate United \nStates policy on Tibet.\n  Since 1959, the Tibetans have suffered the liberation of their \ncountry by the Communist Chinese. Tibet is a remote land. Tibetans at \nthat time had no interest in relations with other countries. No \ninterest in joining the newly formed United Nations. Perhaps if Tibet \nhad, we would have paid more attention when it was invaded.\n  Now it's time to pay attention. Most importantly, we must focus on \nefforts to bring the Tibetans and the Chinese to the negotiating table \nto resolve their differences. The situation requires far more attention \nwithin the administration and a special coordinator can provide \nappropriate attention. While the Dalai Lama has stated repeatedly his \nwillingness to begin negotiations, the Chinese continue to issue \ndenials. As my daughter Maura wrote in a Washington Post article in \nApril:\n\n       Most policy makers do not realize that the Dalai Lama is \n     not seeking territorial sovereignty for his captive nation; \n     nor is he asking to be reinstated as the head of the \n     theocratic government that ruled Tibet prior to the Chinese \n     invasion. In an address to the European Parliament in 1988 in \n     Strasbourg, France, the Dalai Lama offered the Chinese \n     control of Tibet's military and diplomatic affairs if they \n     would allow the Tibetan people a measure of self-governance \n     and non-interference in religion and culture.\n\n  That is certainly a magnanimous offer. The response from the Chinese? \nSilence.\n  In creating this new position, we make clear that we have heard this \nreasonable offer and intend to pursue it. As Lodi Gyari, the able \ndiplomat who represents the Dalai Lama in Washington, is quoted in the \nNew York Times today:\n\n       If the United States is consistent and sincere and vigorous \n     in trying to persuade the Chinese Government to come to a \n     settlement, I strongly believe it will happen.\n\n  The new post will also allow closer scrutiny of human rights abuses \nin Tibet, which continue at an appalling level. I would note, as the \nauthor of the provision which resulted in a separate Tibet report in \nthe State Department's annual Country Reports on Human Rights \nPractices, that the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, led by \nAssistant Secretary Shattuck, has done a superb job in documenting\n\n[[Page S8380]]\n\nthe situation in Tibet. The excellent information the Bureau collects \nwill be more readily acted upon by an officer focused solely on Tibet.\n  For too long, Tibet has fallen between the cracks of United States \nforeign policy. Such neglect has led Abe Rosenthal to wonder if \nTibetans are not ``Endangered Species,'' as he asked in the New York \nTimes on May 21, 1994:\n\n       Is anybody protecting, please, another of God's endangered \n     species, which happens to be human, the Tibetans? Not yet. \n     Neither the Republic nor the Empire nor any other nation, \n     great or small, does anything about the Tibetans, except \n     India, which gives them refuge when they can escape their \n     cage.\n       Would it help to say that just as there are laws against \n     slaughtering hawksbill turtles, there are international laws \n     against genocide--the elimination of nations and cultures? \n     Probably not.\n\n  This is a rather somber note on which to end, yet the situation in \nTibet is grave. I am pleased that the Secretary has decided to appoint \na new special coordinator for Tibet and both Congress and the \nAdministration can devote more attention to this ``Endangered \nSpecies.''\n  Mr. President, I ask that the article on the position be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 30, 1997]\n\n       Albright to Name Special Aide On U.S. Policy Toward Tibet\n\n                         (By Steven Lee Myers)\n\n       Washington, July 29.--Secretary of State Madelene K. \n     Albright told Congressional leaders today that she would \n     appoint a new ``special coordinator'' to oversee American \n     policy toward Tibet.\n       The announcement, which came in response to Democratic and \n     Republican pressure in Congress, could create new diplomatic \n     strains with China.\n       The United States has never had diplomatic relations with \n     Tibet, which it regards as part of China, but the creation of \n     the new position would significantly raise the profile of \n     Tibetan affairs within the Government, according to \n     Administration and Congressional officials familiar with the \n     plan.\n       ``We are prepared to have someone working in the State \n     Department to see that the religious freedom of Tibetans is \n     promoted and that their ethnicity is respected,'' a senior \n     Administration official said, speaking on condition of \n     anonymity.\n       The new coordinator, however, would not have the rank of \n     ambassador, with the diplomatic credentials to act on behalf \n     of the United States, nor would the appointment bestow any \n     diplomatic recognition on Tibet. In that sense the idea would \n     fall short of recent proposals in both the House and the \n     Senate, which the Administration has opposed.\n       But the appointment is likely to rankle China, which has \n     repeatedly accused other nations of interfering with internal \n     matters by raising concerns over Tibet.\n       President Clinton met in April with the Dalai Lama, Tibet's \n     exiled spiritual leader, and promised to raise Tibet as a \n     prominent issue when he meets President Jiang Zemin of China \n     in the fall. The meeting with the Dalai Lama, a so-called \n     drop by during the Tibetan's session with Vice President Al \n     Gore that stopped short of an official visit, prompted \n     protests from Beijing.\n       ``I see this as a step in the right direction,'' said Lodi \n     Gyari, president of the International Campaign for Tibet and \n     a former aide to the Dalai Lama. ``I hope this is \n     the beginning of a trend. If the United States is \n     consistent and sincere and vigorous in trying to persuade \n     the Chinese Government to come to a settlement, I strongly \n     believe it will happen.''\n       Ms. Albright, visiting Singapore today, discussed the \n     appointment in a telephone call with leaders of the Senate's \n     Committee on Foreign Relations and the House's Committee on \n     International Relations, which are considering new \n     legislation to force the appointment of an envoy with \n     ambassadorial rank, a move the Administration opposes.\n       The details of the position--including the scope of the \n     duties and resources--were not disclosed.\n       After the meeting, an aide to a Senate Republican said, \n     ``We want to make sure this is not one guy sitting in the \n     bowels of the State Department with no influence over policy \n     in Tibet.''\n       The special coordinator would have a broad mandate to \n     orchestrate the Administration's policies internally and also \n     to meet with Tibetan officials, including the exiled leaders \n     based in India, officials said. The officials said the \n     coordinator would also act as a mediator between Chinese and \n     Tibetan officials, trying to restart contacts.\n       China seized Tibet in 1950.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    U.S. to Press for Pol Pot Trial\n\n                        (By the New York Times)\n\n       Singapore, July 29.--Ms. Albright said today that the \n     United States would continue to press for an international \n     war crimes trial for Pol Pot, the former Cambodian leader.\n       ``What we do think is very important is that Pol Pot be \n     tried,'' she said in a briefing for journalists traveling \n     with her to Asia. ``We consider him a war criminal.'' She \n     added that the United States sought to have him tried ``by \n     some procedure that is internationally accepted.''\n       She acknowledged that earlier explorations into using \n     Canadian or Dutch law had run into complications, but said \n     American officials were continuing to search for the right \n     site and method for a trial.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/30/senate-section/article/S8379-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO GARY HURT\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a friend and \noutstanding member of the Missouri Highway Patrol, who is retiring \nafter many years of dedicated service.\n  You have heard the expression, ``you can bet your life on it.'' That \nwas more than an expression for me during the 8 years my family and I \ndepended on the Governor's security team. We literally bet our lives on \nGary Hurt and his colleagues, just as all Missourians bet their lives \non other members of the highway patrol every day.\n  Gary Hurt has devoted 28 years of service to the Missouri State \nHighway Patrol. Of this tenure, 18 years has been spent on the \nGovernor's security division, where Gary has served as assistant \ndirector for 14 years. He learned his craft in the time-honored way, as \na road trooper for a full decade.\n  Gary fought back several years ago from an injury that threatened to \nend his career with the patrol. An injury to his ``gun arm'' required \ntwo operations, extensive physical rehabilitation and tremendous grit \nto overcome but overcome it he did.\n  As Governor, I became very close to my security team members sharing \nevery event and most waking hours. I am particularly grateful for their \npatience during the endless hours that, while driving to events, I read \nbedtime stories into a tape recorder for my son, Sam, for those nights \nI could not be home in time to read to him in person. Gary and I have \nshared floods, tornadoes, prison riots, hangings in effigy, election \nnight victories and defeats, births, deaths, weddings, budget crises, \nand fiscal triumph. As an aside, one of the weddings we most recently \nshared occurred when Gary's son married a caseworker in my office of \nconstituent services.\n  I regret that Missouri will no longer have Gary Hurt among its law \nenforcement members, but I am counting on him to continue to share his \nhumor, insight, and experience through different avenues. Thank you, \nGary, and best of luck in your retirement. You have earned the chance \nto do things you want to do for a change.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/30/senate-section/article/S8380-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            INDIAN GAMING REGULATORY ACT AMENDMENTS OF 1997\n\n Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, on July 22, 1997, the Washington \nPost contained a moving tribute to the Forward, a New York City \njournalistic tradition currently celebrating its centennial year.\n  The Members of the Senate are probably aware of the Forward's \nmagnificent history; this daily Yiddish newspaper once enjoyed a daily \ncirculation of over 250,000. It did its job of helping new arrivals \nassimilate and become Americans so very well, that its original \nreaders' descendants can now enjoy the newspaper's superb English \nlanguage edition, while a wave of new immigrants are being introduced \nto the nuances of American life by the newspaper's Russian edition.\n  The Forward's legacy lives on, not only in its three current \neditions, but with the tens of thousands of families whose ancestors \nlearned about this country in the pages of Abraham Cahan's remarkable \npublication. On May 22, New York Mayor Guiliani hosted a reception at \nGracie Mansion to mark the one- hundredth anniversary of the Daily \nVorwaert's first issue. I sent a message to this reception which was \nreprinted in the Forward's Yiddish, English and Russian editions:\n\n       I have long believed that the Forward renders an invaluable \n     contribution to American\n\n[[Page S8381]]\n\n     society. Your dynamic newspaper should be appreciated by all \n     who cherish our national heritage of respect for intellectual \n     creativity and journalistic integrity. Even those of us who \n     couldn't enjoy A Bintel Brief in the original were long ago \n     aware of the Forward's power to captivate, educate and \n     inspire. Your vigorous English edition is a worthy companion \n     to the historic Yiddish Forward.\n       Please accept my great congratulations on this magnificent \n     milestone.\n       With my best wishes to the ``gold standard'' of ethnic \n     journalism.\n\n  The Forward has played a significant cultural and educational role in \nits first century and I trust that the members of the Senate join me in \nwishing similar success to the three editions that so ably carry on the \nhistoric Forward tradition.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the Washington Post article on \nthe Forward's centennial be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 22, 1997]\n\nNew Voices for a New Century--Newspaper of an Exodus Speaks a Language \n         Its Children No Longer Hear, but Reaches Out in Others\n\n                          (By John M. Goshko)\n\n       New York.--Some of this city's most prominent \n     editorialists, academics and intellectuals lately have been \n     waxing nostalgic about a New York institution now personified \n     by a half-dozen elderly men hunched over rickety, ancient \n     typewriters in a charmless office.\n       These men--not all in the best of health and able to put in \n     a full day's work--are what remains of the Yiddish staff of \n     the Forward, or Der Vorwaerts, once celebrated as the most \n     influential foreign-language newspaper in the United States. \n     Now marking its 100th anniversary amid growing uncertainty \n     about its future, the Forward is known as the paper that did \n     its job so successfully that it has come to the brink of \n     putting itself out of business.\n       To survive into a second century, the Forward has had to \n     start thinking about ways to reinvent itself. It actively is \n     experimenting with moves away from Yiddish, seeking to \n     attract new audiences with editions in English and Russian.\n       The English edition, in particular, has aroused \n     considerable interest because of its aggressive, no-sacred-\n     cows coverage of Jewish affairs under editor Seth Lipsky, a \n     graduate of the Wall Street Journal's editorial page, and his \n     staff of young reporters. The English version doesn't always \n     sit well with many old-line readers who find Lipsky's \n     combative conservatism jarringly at odds with the Forward's \n     foundations in socialism and trade unionism. They say that \n     while the name on the masthead of the English edition may be \n     the same, the newspaper itself is not. To them, he Forward's \n     identity cannot be separated from the language and culture \n     that the great waves of turn-of-the-century immigration \n     brought to this country from East European Jewish communities \n     destined to perish in the Holocaust.\n       More than 2.5 million Yiddish-speaking Jewish immigrants \n     poured into New York between 1880 and 1925, and many learned \n     how to Americans from the Forward. At the height of the \n     newspaper's influence, its daily circulation of more than \n     250,000 stretched from New York into the sizable immigrant \n     communities of Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago and Los Angeles. \n     And it used this influence to become a key player in shaping \n     the modern American labor movement and leading the exodus of \n     Jewish immigrants from European-inherited socialist politics \n     to the New Deal.\n       ``For people like me, the Forward is part of a culture; \n     something that's in my genes,'' said Hyman J. Bookbinder, \n     long the American Jewish Committee's representative in \n     Washington. ``I was brought up in a Forward home, where my \n     parents, who came from Poland as teenagers, looked to the \n     Forward for what amounted to their high school and college \n     education.''\n       In 1947, the Forward's 50th anniversary celebration packed \n     Madison Square Garden. Today, the editor of the Yiddish \n     Forward, Mordechia Shtrigler, worries that the paper, which \n     became a weekly in 1983, might have to cut back further and \n     go biweekly or even monthly. The grandchildren and great \n     grandchildren of the original faithful have moved on. For the \n     Yiddish edition, there remain only a geriatric generation \n     whose imminent passing effectively will mark the dying out of \n     Yiddish as a language with any currency in the United States.\n       ``It's not just that the young people don't read or speak \n     Yiddish,'' said Shtrigler. ``We are almost out of people who \n     can write commandingly and persuasively in Yiddish about \n     politics and literature and culture. Many weeks I have to \n     write more than half the newspaper myself. I fear what the \n     future will be.''\n       His anxiety is, in many ways, a testament to the certain \n     vision of Abraham Cahan, an autocratic but brilliant editor \n     who ran the paper for more than 50 years. Cahan arrived in \n     New York from Lithuania in 1882 and quickly acquired a gift \n     for writing in English that enabled him to become a star \n     reporter for English-language newspapers. He gained even \n     wider notice by writing two novels about Lower East Side \n     ghetto life: ``Yekl,'' which in the 1970s became the basis \n     for the film ``Hester Street,'' and the ``Rose of David \n     Levinsky,'' acclaimed at the time as a minor masterpiece of \n     genre realism.\n       Both books dealt with the theme of assimilation as \n     necessary and inevitable for survival in the new world, even \n     when it meant a melancholy loss of one's youthful ideals. \n     That was the message that Cahan carried over into the pages \n     of the Forward. Cahan built a devoted readership from \n     sweatshop laborers and pushcart peddlers with detailed, \n     colorful coverage of New York's politics and its nascent \n     labor movement. And he added a high-toned side, publishing \n     the work of the best Yiddish poets and novelists. One, Isaac \n     Bashevis Singer, published almost all of his stories in the \n     Forward before their book publication.\n       But the Forward's basic message was underscored by Cahan's \n     lead editorial on his first day as editor: ``Send Your \n     Children to College if You Can, but Don't Let Them Become \n     Disloyal to Their Parents.'' It set the tone for future \n     Forward articles that would attempt to act as a bridge \n     between America and the shetl. They covered every conceivable \n     subject including one, ``Fundamentals of Baseball Explained \n     to Non-Sports,'' which came complete with a diagram of the \n     Polo Grounds.\n       By far the most popular and famous feature was the ``Bintel \n     Brief'' (``Bundle of Letters''), where readers wrote in to \n     seek advice about their most personal concerns and \n     aspirations.\n       The letters included such pre-``Dear Abby'' trivia as one \n     from ``The Unhappy Fool,'' who confessed that he considered \n     the girl be loved flawed because she had a dimple. The \n     Forward's tart reply:\n       ``The trouble is not that the girl has a dimple in her chin \n     but that some people have a screw loose in their head.''\n       But others were what has been called ``a cry from the \n     depths of immigrant life'': the new arrival's anguish at \n     leaving his aged parents in Europe, the plight of the young \n     mother deserted by her husband, the despair of a tenement \n     janitor condemned to eke out his days in `` a place where the \n     sun is ashamed to shine.''\n       If the people who wrote to the ``Bintel Brief'' have a \n     present-day counterpart, it is the immigrants from the now \n     defunct Soviet Union, whose population in the New York area \n     has swelled to almost 400,000 in recent years. An estimated \n     95 percent of them are Jewish, and in December 1995, the \n     Forward began a weekly Russian edition to cater to their \n     needs, with a circulation now of 10,000.\n       It carries a heavy dose of news about the Russian immigrant \n     community, particularly its problems of adjustment. It even \n     carries a Hebrew lesson in each issue.\n       As to the descendants of those earlier immigrants who were \n     the Forward's original audience, they are largely successful \n     business and professional people who have graduated to the \n     suburbs and Manhattan's tonier neighborhoods. The English \n     edition, a weekly established in 1990, is hoping it can lay \n     the foundations for a new kind of paper by establishing with \n     the new generation the same bonds of passion for Jewish \n     issues that existed between their forebears and the Yiddish \n     Forward.\n       It has a ways to go. Its circulation is only about 25,000, \n     and it hemorrhages red ink at the rate of about $1 million a \n     year. Still, Lipsky optimistically insists that it is not \n     unrealistic to harbor hopes of someday becoming a daily. In \n     pursuit of that dream, he has hired a constantly revolving \n     team of your talent.\n       Although they work just down the hall from the Yiddish \n     staff, there is a respectful but clear separation between the \n     two. The English edition does not use any material from its \n     older sibling. And the younger staff members, their accents \n     and sensibilities betraying the stamp of places like \n     Berkeley, Cambridge and New Haven, have only the foggiest \n     notions of the Talmudic arguments about assimilation and \n     schisms in the socialist movement that preoccupied earlier \n     generations of Forward editors and reporters.\n       Collectively, they turn out a newspaper distinguished by \n     sophisticated arts coverage and a more probing, sometime \n     sensationalist approach to Jewish issues than most other \n     American Jewish publications, whose ties and funding sources \n     generally cause them to tread cautiously around Jewish \n     charities and organizations. The Forward also is unlike its \n     competitors in that it frequently is willing to take some \n     critical looks at Israel.\n       This attitude has earned the English edition a substantial \n     number of enemies among Jewish organizations and individuals \n     who feel the paper has treated them unfairly. Inevitably the \n     biggest share of brickbats has been aimed at Lipsky's \n     editorial positions which reader nostalgic for the old \n     Forward consider an unpalatable mix of Reaganomics and Cold \n     War rhetoric.\n       Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg, a professor of humanities at New \n     York University, accused Lipsky of trying to turn ``a \n     newspaper of socialists and social democrats [into] an echo \n     of the Wall Street Journal.'' Jack Sheinkman, former \n     president of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers \n     Union, expressed outrage at Lipsky's unapologetic defense of \n     American involvement in the Vietnam War, and the literary \n     critic, Alfred Kazin, protested that a Forward proposal to \n     bomb North Korea's nuclear weapons facilities had no place in \n     ``a paper founded a century ago on the blood and toil of \n     peaceful laboring people who believed in harmony with people \n     like themselves.\n\n[[Page S8382]]\n\n       Lipsky takes the criticism in stride: ``A lot of people \n     tiptoe around our ideological battles as through its \n     something to be embarrassed about. Actually, I find it a \n     matter of great zest.'' He even wrote an article in a recent \n     issue of Commentary magazine arguing that ``Abraham Cahan \n     would have perfectly well understood the contours of the \n     struggle we are in today and have responded in the spirit in \n     which we carry on.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/30/senate-section/article/S8380-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.

Res. 32, the First \nConcurrent Resolution on the Budget for 1986.\n  This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget \nthrough July 28, 1997. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and \nrevenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the 1997 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget (H. Con. \nRes. 178), show that current level spending is above the budget \nresolution by $9.5 billion in budget authority and by $12.9 billion in \noutlays. Current level is $20.5 billion above the revenue floor in 1997 \nand $101.9 billion above the revenue floor over the 5 years 1997-2001. \nThe current estimate of the deficit for purposes of calculating the \nmaximum deficit amount is $219.9 billion, $7.4 billion below the \nmaximum deficit amount for 1997 of $227.3 billion.\n  Since my last report, dated June 23, 1997, there has been no action \nthat has changed the current level of budget authority, outlays, or \nrevenues.\n  The report follows:\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 29, 1997.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, only hours ago, in a market in \nJerusalem, the plague of terrorism once again struck the people of the \nMiddle East. Simple people shopping for their goods and wares were \nstruck down by a terrorist bomb. People who do not have\n\n[[Page S8384]]\n\nthe courage to stand on the battlefield or the wisdom to sit across a \nconference table with diplomats have, once again, sought to impose \ntheir own will on the people of Israel.\n  I rise on the floor of the Senate to express all of our sympathies \nfor the families of the victims, the people of Israel, and to Prime \nMinister Netanyahu.\n  I know in all of us, there is not only a prayerful sorrow, but also a \ngreat anger. The sacrifices and the works and the hopes of so many \nmight be dashed by these few who would impose their will. The best \nmessage may not simply be our prayers or our condolences. Perhaps, Mr. \nPresident, as Americans, we are best to respond to this tragedy as \nAmericans have always responded to those who act in violence and with \nsuch irresponsible actions. Our best message may be our uncompromising \ndetermination to pursue peace.\n  It is, after all, the interruption of the peace process that \nterrorists desire the most. If they had a coherent argument that had \nintellectual weight, they would have sought an entry into the peace \nprocess to make their arguments to diplomats. If they could make a \ncoherent case to either the electorate in Israel or the people of the \nPalestinian Authority, they would have taken their case through a \ndemocratic process to those peoples. Their terrorist actions are the \nbest evidence that they have no such arguments. They can make no such \ncase. They, indeed, do not have confidence themselves in the strength \nof their own positions.\n  In responding to this terrorist action, President Clinton made clear \nthat the United States will not be dissuaded, that we are not led away \nor apart from our current policy of seeking a peaceful resolution to \nevents in the Middle East. I believe that President Clinton, when he \nspeaks these words, represents all of us.\n  It is, therefore, only right and proper that, when the mourning ends \nand the dead are buried, our diplomats return to the Middle East with \nall dispatch. If it was the intention of the administration that they \nwere to return in several days, the best message to the terrorists is \nthat they return sooner. If it was their intention to remain a month, \nit is the best message to the terrorists that they should remain 2 \nmonths. If it was the intention of this Congress to continue American \nassistance to Israel for several years, the best message to these \nterrorists is, it shall continue for more years.\n  There are those through the years who do not understand the United \nStates. They think that because we are a patient and a reasonable \npeople, inclined towards peace and willing to talk, that we lack \nstrength or resolve. Those who know our history, watched our actions, \nor understand us and our culture the best know that, in fact, nothing \ncould be further from the truth. We are a people of enormous resolve. \nThat resolve will best be demonstrated in the coming days when this \nadministration sends our diplomats back to the negotiating table, this \nCongress continues with our commitments to Israel, and we make clear we \nwill not be separated from our ambition of a strong and free Israel, \nwith a Middle East with a lasting peace.\n  To the Palestinian Authority and its leader, Yasser Arafat, we are \nall grateful that Mr. Arafat has expressed to Prime Minister Netanyahu \nand to the families of the victims his condolences. It is, however, on \nthis occasion, not enough. The best expression of condolence to the \nvictims and to the people of Israel is for Mr. Arafat to renew his \ncommitment to the peace process without condition. It is not enough \nsimply to express regret at the suffering of those who are victims or \nfor Mr. Arafat to express his commitment to find those responsible and \nto cooperate with the Israeli authorities.\n\n  It is also not enough to cooperate because of the deeds of this day, \nbut to assure that tomorrow, and in all days that follow, the \nPalestinian Authority security forces will cooperate with Israeli law \nenforcement to share intelligence information, to open her borders and \nher files to ensure that this deed that has been suffered upon the \npeople of Israel is not repeated.\n  Mr. President, the people of Israel have suffered on many such days. \nTerrorism has not become the exception, but sometimes it seems the rule \nof the politics of the Middle East.\n  In Israel, like in America, we are misunderstood. This much should be \nclear: There is no terrorist action so great, no number of victims so \nlarge, that the people of Israel will be convinced to compromise on the \nneeds of their basic security, their determination that they and their \nchildren will live in an undivided Jerusalem. At times we seem so close \nto peace and yet more victims, more sacrifice is asked.\n  Wherever these terrorists might be hiding tonight, whatever cave may \nconceal their cowardice, let this much be clear: Israel will remain \nfree, Jerusalem will remain Israeli, the future will be secured. And if \nthe sacrifice of the people of Israel through all these years has not \nconvinced these terrorists, or those who would follow them, of that \nfact, then add this to the equation: The U.S. Congress, this Senate in \nrepresentation of all the people of the United States, are determined \nto make it so as well.\n  Mr. President, our prayers, our heartfelt sorrow go to the families \nof the victims of all the people of Israel. May the future at long last \nbe different than the past.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/30/senate-section/article/S8383-7", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ADJOURNMENT UNTIL TOMORROW AT 9:15 A.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
